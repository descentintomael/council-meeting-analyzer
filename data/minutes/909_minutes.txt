The City Manager requested consideration and adoption of a resolution approving the FY 2020-21
Final Budget for the City of Chico, the Successor Agency to the Chico Redevelopment Agency and
the City of Chico Parking Authority. (Mark Orme, City Manager)

Vice Mayor Brown asked for this item to be removed from Consent for further discussion. She asked
that during the budget discussion to be held in October, that a conversation be included regarding
the impacts of the Camp Fire and rise of domestic violence and perhaps a better referral system
program which could be a city-funded grant to an outside service provider better suited for said
referrals. She would like to see what an agreement would look like, although she believed that other
agreements were around approximately $150,000.

A motion was made by Vice Mayor Brown and seconded by Councilmember Stone to adopt the
following resolution:

REGULAR AGENDA

DISCUSSION OF PLACING ITEMS ON THE NOVEMBER 2020 BALLOT

At its meeting of 5/26/20, Council voted to adopt a resolution calling for a General Municipal
Election to be held on November 3, 2020 and at that time provided additional direction to staff
regarding potential Charter amendments and/or ballot measures. Council also requested a standing
item be included on all future agendas for the discussion of potential ballot measures up until the
deadline for submission of measures to the County.

At this meeting, Council continued its discussion of potential measures and provided staff with final
direction. A formal resolution is required in order to submit ballot measures to the voters for
consideration at the November 3, 2020 election. All necessary resolutions will be provided for
Council action at its meeting of July 7, 2020. The deadline for inclusion of items to be placed on the
November 3, 2020 ballot has been set by the Butte County Clerk as July 10, 2020. Staff was seeking
direction on which items the Council would like to consider at the July 7, 2020 Council meeting for
final action and adoption of appropriate resolutions which would allow inclusion on the November
3, 2020 Municipal General Election ballot. (Report - Andrew L. Jared, City Attorney & Deborah R.

D. Franchise Agreement for Chico Certified Farmers Market

Addressing the Council via email on this matter were Lauren Kohler, Deanne Allen, Nichole
Nava, Nathaniel Perry, Rain Scher, Julie Threet, Eric Chisler, Mercedes Macias, Jody Taylor,
Juanita Sumner, Lisa Salzmann, Barbara Noble Allinger, Caroline RP, and Rob Berry.

A motion was made by Councilmember Reynolds and seconded by Councilmember Stone to
direct staff to move into conversations with CCFM and start to develop a franchise agreement,
something like an eight year, with an eight-year evergreen.

Councilmember Ory asked if action could be delayed a week in order to allow him time to
obtain additional legal analysis by the next meeting.

Councilmember Stone stated that he would like to see something more that prevents a future
Council from moving the market.

Councilmember Ory indicated that he had asked for a week in order to obtain the outside
legal analysis, but Council was directing staff to begin negotiations with the Farmers Market.
He asked again that Council delay taking action until the first meeting in July.

Councilmember Stone stated that he wasn’t dismissing Councilmember Ory’s request as it
was implicit that the City would not have signed franchise before that date which would allow
time for Councilmember Ory’s legal analysis to move forward.

A substitute motion was made by Councilmember Ory to postpone this discussion to the July
7, 2020 meeting. It died for a lack of a second.

The original motion made by Councilmember Reynolds and seconded by Councilmember

4.2. CONSIDERATION OF AN ORDINANCE TO ESTABLISH ONE-HALF CENT SALES TAX

On June 9, 2020, the City Council considered the first reading of an ordinance adding a one cent
sales tax which was an item continued from the June 2, 2020 City Council Meeting. After significant
discussion, the City Council acted to direct staff to return with an ordinance first reading
implementing a one-half cent general sales tax measure with a delayed implementation date of
January 1, 2022 and a sunset date of June 30, 2029. This action would approve the first reading. On
July 7, 2020, City staff would return with a second reading of the ordinance and the resolution calling
for the measure to be placed on the November 2020 ballot. The action to approve an ordinance for
placement on the ballot requires 5 affirmative votes. (Report - Chris Constantin, Assistant
City Manager)

Jules Brown, Susan Smead, Lisa Salzmann, Stefanie Barrett, Ashley Jones, Natasha See, and Rob
