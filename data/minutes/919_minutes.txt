SECOND READING OF TWO ORDINANCES TO ALLOW COMMERCIAL CANNABIS
BUSINESSES

On August 25, 2020, the City Council introduced two ordinances to regulate and allow commercial
cannabis businesses within the City of Chico. Such action followed recommendations by the Ad Hoc
Commercial Cannabis Committee, and review and recommendation by the Internal Affairs
Committee, and the Planning Commission for adoption of such regulations.

Further information regarding the ordinances can be found in the staff reports for the Council
Meetings of March 17, 2020 and August 25, 2020 (continued from August 18, 2020).

ORDINANCE NO. 2552 — ORDINANCE OF THE CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF CHICO
AMENDING TITLE 5, CREATING CHAPTER 5.42 “COMMERCIAL CANNABIS BUSINESSES” OF
THE CHICO MUNICIPAL CODE TO REGULATE COMMERCIAL CANNABIS USES WITHIN THE
CITY OF CHICO

ORDINANCE NO. 2553 — ORDINANCE OF THE CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF CHICO
AMENDING TITLE 19 OF THE CHICO MUNICIPAL CODE, CHAPTERS 19.75 “CANNABIS
REGULATIONS”, 19.44 “COMMERCIAL OFFICE ZONES, 19.46

ALLOWABLE LAND USES” TO ALLOW COMMERCIAL CANNABIS USES WITHIN THE CITY OF

ORDINANCE NO. 2554 — ORDINANCE OF THE CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF CHICO
AMENDING CERTAIN SECTIONS OF TITLE 19 OF THE CHICO MUNICIPAL CODE REGARDING
ACCESSORY DWELLING UNIT REGULATIONS FOR CONSISTENCY WITH STATE HOUSING
LAWS - final reading and adoption

On July 7, 2020 the City Council adopted an ordinance amending the permit process and
development regulations for Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs) to be consistent with State housing
laws. California jurisdictions are required to submit ADU ordinances for review and approval by the
California Housing and Community Development Department (HCD) within 60 days of adoption to
ensure compliance with State ADU laws. The City of Chico submitted the adopted ADU ordinance
for HCD review which resulted in a few minor changes to Section 19.76.130 "Accessory Dwelling
Units" of the Chico Municipal Code. On August 6, 2020 the Planning Commission considered these
minor changes and recommended approval of the proposed ordinance amendments to the City
Council. (Brendan Vieg, Community Development Director - Planning)

ORDINANCE NO. 2555 — ORDINANCE OF THE CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF CHICO,
AMENDING TITLE 10.52 OF THE CHICO MUNICIPAL CODE RELATING TO ABANDONED
VEHICLE ABATEMENT AND AMENDING, ADDING OR REPEALING PROVISIONS IN TITLE
40.52 OF THE CHICO MUNICIPAL CODE FOR THE ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT BY
THE CITY’S CODE ENFORCEMENT DIVISION - final reading and adoption

Abandoned, wrecked, dismantled, and inoperative vehicles impact the quality, character, and safety
of neighborhoods. Inoperative vehicles contribute to the deterioration of neighborhoods creating
visual blight, affecting property values, and impacting quality of life. Inoperative vehicles are an
attractive nuisance for children, and provide harborage for rodents, insects and pests. Storage of
wrecked, dismantled, and inoperative vehicles in residential neighborhoods impact parking,
generating multiple complaints to Code Enforcement and the Police Department. To improve Code
Enforcement’s ability to abate abandoned vehicles, staff recommended amending City of Chico
Municipal Code to be consistent with State and County regulations addressing this growing issue.
