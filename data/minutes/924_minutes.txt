APPROVAL OF THE AIRPORT COMMISSION RECOMMENDED REVISED STANDARD LEASE
POLICY AND NEW STANDARD LEASE AGREEMENT WITH EXHIBITS

Starting in March of 2018, the Airport Commission had discussed updating airport related leases to
include an overall policy and standard lease agreement. Previously, many leases at the Chico
Municipal Airport included extremely long terms with no opportunity to renegotiate for market rates
putting the City's Airport Enterprise Fund at a financial disadvantage. The Airport Commission had
heard numerous options and was recommending the revised lease policy and new standard lease
form with exhibits to capture all the diverse leasing opportunities at the Airport for City Council
approval. (Erik Gustafson, Public Works Director-Operations and Maintenance)

ACCEPTANCE OF CALIFORNIA ALCOHOL AND BEVERAGE CONTROL GRANT

The Police Department was presented with a small grant opportunity from the California Alcohol and
Beverage Control to conduct underage alcohol sales operations. Specifically, the grant award is in
the amount of $19,000 with no requirements to match or shoulder the burden of any costs
associated. This type of grant rarely presents itself from the State of California and is one we as a
law enforcement agency always hope to secure. (Billy Aldridge, Captain)

This item was removed from the Consent Agenda at the request of Councilmember Ory for further
discussion.

A motion was made by Councilmember Huber and seconded by Councilmember Reynolds to accept
the CA Alcohol and Beverage Control grant.
The motion carried by the following vote:
