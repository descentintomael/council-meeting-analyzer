PUBLIC RECORDS ACT REQUESTS PROGRAM PLATFORM

The City Clerk’s office is charged with responding to all California Public Records Act requests
submitted to the City. Over the past several years, the number of requests has steadily increased,
with internal self-tracking no longer being sufficient to timely respond to requests. The use of PRA
software would allow staff to quickly process and respond to requests for records as statutorily
required by California State Law quickly and efficiently. (Deborah R. Presson, City Clerk & Elections

REGULAR AGENDA

ADOPTION OF AN URGENCY ORDINANCE OF THE CITY OF CHICO CREATING CHAPTER 12.18
ALLOWING FOR THE ENFORCEMENT OF EXISTING TITLE 12R - RULES AND REGULATIONS OF
BIDWELL PARK AND OTHER PARKS AND PLAYGROUNDS AS EITHER MISDEMEANORS OR
INFRACTIONS; AND INTRODUCTION AND FIRST READING OF ORDINANCE OF THE CITY OF CHICO
ADOPTING TITLE 12R - RULES AND REGULATIONS OF BIDWELL PARK AND OTHER PARKS AND
PLAYGROUNDS AS EITHER MISDEMEANORS OR INFRACTIONS

City staff is required to address Municipal Code violations. Such issues may include offenses against
public peace, safety, morality, and other public nuisance violations. Currently, the City has three
Code enforcement options: 1) initiating criminal proceedings (Cal. Gov. Code, § 36900(a)); 2)
bringing a civil lawsuit for abatement of a public nuisance (Cal. Civ. Code, § 3490-3496; Chico Mun.
Code, Chapter 1.14); or 3) utilizing the administrative abatement process in a public hearing before
the City Council. (Cal. Civ. Code, § 3491; Chico. Mun. Code, Chapter 1.15.) However, regulations in
the City’s Municipal Code listed in Title 12R regarding rules and regulations related to City Parks and
Playgrounds cannot be enforced by initiating criminal proceedings because they were adopted by
resolution and not ordinance. This action will allow additional enforcement tools to address rules
and regulations of the parks which are already on the books. (Report - Tony Lindsey, Community
Development Director, Building and Code Enforcement)

Addressing the Council on this item were Jesica Giannola, Ruth Sarnoff, Daniel Rodrigues, Margaret
Hicks, Amanda Reilley, Adri Long, Kim Dietz, Robyn Engel, Rob Berry, Juanita Sumner, Michele
Cooper, and Nichole Nava.

City Clerk Presson read the following ordinance in it’s entirety into the record:

AN URGENCY ORDINANCE OF THE CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF CHICO, AMENDING TITLE 12 OF

Code section 266i makes pandering a prostitute a felony punishable by imprisonment for three to
eight years. Penal Code section 647, subdivision (b), makes engaging in prostitution a misdemeanor
punishable by imprisonment for up to six months or by payment of up to a $1,000 fine. Lastly, Penal
Code section 374.3, subdivision (h), makes dumping commercial waste or waste in excess of one
cubic yard on public or private property a misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment for up to six
months or by payment of a fine of up to $10,000. Despite such prohibitions and penalties, persons
engage in repeated offenses. (Report - Tony Lindsey, Community Development Director - Building
and Code Enforcement)
