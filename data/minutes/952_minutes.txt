AMENDMENTS TO EXEMPT GOVERNMENTAL SIGNS IN CHAPTER 19.74 OF TITLE 19 OF THE
CHICO MUNICIPAL SIGN CODE

The proposed Sign Code amendments creates new definitions for Governmental Signs and
Information Sign Kiosks, exempt these sign types from the sign permit requirements, and add
provisions in the Sign Code where none currently exist in the PQ (Public/Quasi Public Facilities)
zone.

The Informational Sign Kiosk program is an important component of the Downtown Access Action
Plan (DAAP) and serves as an economic development tool by providing pedestrian wayfinding
signage with information regarding Downtown accessibility, parking, community events, business
directory, historical buildings and similar community information. The proposed Sign Code
amendments were initiated by Public Works staff as part of the DAAP and at the request of the
Downtown Chico Business Association (DCBA). Planning staff added the sign code provision in the
PQ zone because none currently exist in the Sign Code.

The Planning Commission had reviewed the proposed amendments and recommended that Council
adopt the amendments.

The Mayor opened the hearing to the public. No one spoke and the hearing was closed.

A motion was made by Vice Mayor Reynolds and seconded by Mayor Coolidge to introduce the

VEGETATIVE FUELS MANAGEMENT PLAN AND PROGRAM ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT
REPORT

Using funds from a CalFire Community Wildfire Prevention Grant, a Vegetative Fuels Management
Plan (VFMP) was prepared to describe actions that the City will implement on the City's approximate
6,400 acres of parks, greenways, and open spaces to minimize the risk of catastrophic wildfire and
to enhance ecological health. Adoption of the VFMP was a project under the California
Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), so an environmental document, in this case a programmatic EIR,
was prepared to analyze the effects of adopting the VFMP.

At its 3/08/21 Special Meeting, the Bidwell Park & Playground Commission (BPPC) reviewed the
Final Program Environmental Impact Report (PEIR) for the VFMP, which includes the responses to
the comments received and any changes made to the PEIR and VFMP in response to those
comments. The Council considered resolutions that if adopted, would certify the Final PEIR and its
associated Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program, and adopt the Final VFMP.

The Council recessed at 6:46 p.m. for a ten-minute break due to the outside noise impacting the
ability to hear in the Council Chamber. The meeting was reconvened and all members were present.

COUNCILMEMBER BROWN REQUEST - OUTDOOR SHELTERING OPPORTUNITY

Atits meeting 3/2/21, the Council voted to agendize a discussion on an outdoor sheltering opportunity
at the BMX site.

Addressing the Council were Chris Nelson, Jesica Giannola, Ken Mollison, and Nichole Nava.

A motion was made by Councilmember Brown and seconded by Councilmember Huber to authorize
staff to utilize 4/5's of an acre of the BMA track to use as an outdoor sheltering environment to direct
staff to create an estimated cost for establishing a fence around the 4/S5ths of an acre in order to make
it a viable opportunity. To direct staff to identify a service provider, as mentioned earlier in the
discussion, Caring Choices or the sheltering team, Step Up. It is likely they can be reengaged on
this matter. To deliver a minimum budget for establishment and operation of this environment that
would be requested of the City or other sources for six months and for one year. Those are the
timelines that seem reasonable. Define on- time costs and an operational budget for two different
types of projects such as a sanctioned campground with tents and the dollar amount would be bit
lower than a pallet shelter environment. And finally, direct staff to identify funding from the City for
this effort including COVID 19 dollars which would be relevant and are coming into this City. Staff
would also address the easement issues by providing solutions.

Vice Mayor Reynolds asked if the City should wait for when the $3.6 million is released for the Chico
area.

The motion was not acted on as the substitute motion carried.
A substitute motion was made by Councilmember Denlay and seconded by Councilmember Morgan

to direct staff to stop working on the BMX Shelter concept; revisit other uses of the CDBG funds and
rescind the Shelter Crisis Declaration.
