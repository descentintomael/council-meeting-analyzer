DIRECTIVE ON ENCAMPMENTS

encampments.

Councilmember Ory asked the Council to retract the motion passed on April 7". He stated it was
necessary at the time and served the City well for four months. But at this time, with a new Chief of

encampment policy, with everything related to weather to lack of shelter beds, and to carry forth the
policies of Council.

Councilmember Ory stated the motion from the April 7 meeting, was “that the Council provide
direction to the City Manager to eliminate evictions from homeless encampments under 10 people
and to require an outreach and informational approach with our homeless communities rather than
enforcement to preserving public health, encouraging distancing and keeping encampments clean
barring the necessity of eliminating criminal activity from parks, greenways, and waterways.
Encampments were defined as ‘place with temporary accommodations consisting of huts or tents. =
