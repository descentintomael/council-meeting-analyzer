(CDBG-CV) funding in relation to issues of homelessness and to take steps necessary to

identifying sheltering options for the unhoused population, to include the safe parking
proposal.

Council Action

A motion was made by Councilmember Morgan and seconded by Councilmember Huber to allocate
$282,933 CDBG funding (as noted in Option 3 above) to CHAT and to what extent is possible,
continue with the fundraising for the BMX, and working with the County to pursue other possible
solutions.

The motion carried by the following vote:

AYES: Brown, Huber, Morgan, Tandon, Reynolds, Coolidge
NOES: Denlay

Council Action

A motion was made by Councilmember Huber and seconded by Councilmember Brown to authorize
use of city owned land at MLK site to establish an outdoor shelter and direct staff to continue to
search out all sheltering options and funding sources.

Councilmember Tandon asked for a friendly amendment to define the use as temporary and asked
how much time does it take to go from temporary housing to permanent housing.

Councilmember Huber did not accept the friendly amendment as he noted it would be hard to define
a timeframe due to different abilities, with some taking longer than others.

Councilmember Brown asked for a friendly amendment to consider other alternative funding sources.

Councilmember Huber accepted this amendment.

Councilmember Reynolds also wanted to ensure that staff was being directed to continue to work on
providing Council with more information on how to potentially turn the MLK site into some sort or type
of sheltering options, along with identifying additional funding sources.

City Manager Orme confirmed that what he was hearing from Council in regard to the MLK site, is
that (1) the City would not be moving forward until funding is secured; and (2) continue to evaluate
this site for a potential use to help support those who are unsheltered. At this time, it is not defined
as to what that potential use would be. Once the CDBG or whatever funds through the COC, or any
other additional funding sources that are found, staff would return with potential projects that could
be used on this site.

The City Manager also noted for the record that it was clear that only “non-general fund dollars” would
be used and that staff would need to work on securing some type of service provider in order to
enable services to be provided, whatever they are and that staff would have to come back with a
plan. He reiterated that it did sound like there is at least an interest by Council in ensuring that staff
can continue to work on relocating the BMX to enable this property to become available for a potential
project.

The original motion to authorize use of city owned land at MLK site to establish an outdoor shelter
and direct staff to continue to search out all sheltering options as well as funding sources, carried by
the following vote:

AYES: Brown, Huber, Tandon, Coolidge
NOES: Denlay, Morgan, Reynolds
