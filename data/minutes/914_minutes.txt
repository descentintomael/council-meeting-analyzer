CONSIDERATION OF ESTABLISHING ADMINISTRATIVE FINES FOR VIOLATIONS OF THE
CHICO MUNICIPAL CODE

In 1999, the City adopted Ordinance 2180 to enact Chapter 1.15 which established a non-judicial
citation and hearing process. Under this Chapter, the administrative fine amounts were not fixed in
the ordinance and instead were left open to the City Council to adopt fine amounts by resolution.
(CMC section 1.15.050.)

August 4, 2020 Special City Council Minutes age/4

5.3.

Various resolutions have established fine for specific CMC sections over the years and are updated
from time to time. Despite this, no default fine amount exists. This resolution fulfills that purpose by
setting a default fine amount not to exceed one hundred dollars ($100.00) for a first violation, two
hundred dollars ($200.00) for a second violation of the same code provision within one year, and five
hundred dollars ($500.00) foreach additional violation of the same law within one year. These fine
amounts would apply to any violation where there is not already a stated fine amount. This resolution
would not affect those other specific violation amounts. (Report - Andrew Jared, City Attorney)

Addressing the Council on this item were Marybeth Wuerthner, Robb Gage, and Mark Geyar.

Additional comments received in the Engage Chico platform from Angela McLaughlin, Marybeth
Wuerthner, Tarace Lea, Jules Brown, Julie Threet, and Troy Steffy.

resolution establishing a default administrative citation fine amount for any violation of the Chico
