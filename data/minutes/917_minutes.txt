REVISED ACCESSORY DWELLING UNIT AMENDMENTS TO TITLE 19 OF THE CHICO
MUNICIPAL CODE

On July 7, 2020 the City Council adopted an ordinance amending the permit process and
development regulations for Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs) to be consistent with State housing
laws. California jurisdictions are required to submit ADU ordinances for review and approval by the
California Housing and Community Development Department (HCD) within 60 days of adoption to
ensure compliance with State ADU laws. The City of Chico submitted the adopted ADU ordinance
for HCD review which resulted in a few minor changes to Section 19.76.130 "Accessory Dwelling
Units" of the Chico Municipal Code. On August 6, 2020 the Planning Commission considered these
minor changes and recommended approval of the proposed ordinance amendments to the City
Council. (Report - Bruce Ambo, Principal Planner and Kelly Murphy, Planner)

Mayor Schwab opened the hearing to the public. One email comment was received from Grace
Marvin. The hearing was closed to further comment.

AMENDMENTS TO THE CHICO MUNICIPAL CODE RELATING TO ABANDONED VEHICLE
ABATEMENT

Abandoned, wrecked, dismantled, and inoperative vehicles impact the quality, character, and safety
of neighborhoods. Inoperative vehicles contribute to the deterioration of neighborhoods creating
visual blight, affecting property values, and impacting quality of life. Inoperative vehicles are an
attractive nuisance for children, and provide harborage for rodents, insects and pests. Storage of
wrecked, dismantled, and inoperative vehicles in residential neighborhoods impact parking,
generating multiple complaints to Code Enforcement and the Police Department. To improve Code
Enforcement's ability to abate abandoned vehicles, staff recommended amending City of Chico
Municipal Code to be consistent with State and County regulations addressing this growing
issue. (Report - Tony Lindsey, Community Development Director, Building and Code
Enforcement)

Addressing the Council via Engaged Chico were Patti Donze, Rob Berry, Jesica Montgomery, Kim
Dietz, Michelle Reutlinger, Susan Smead, Nichole Nava, Julie Threet, and Juanita Sumner.
