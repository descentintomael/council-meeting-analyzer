ORDINANCE NO. 2562 - ORDINANCE OF THE CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF CHICO
APPROVING THE DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE CITY OF CHICO AND JP
REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS, LLC., (DA 18-01); (CITY OF CHICO/JP REAL ESTATE
INVESTMENTS, LLC) - Final reading and adoption, by reading of title only.

On 03/02/2021, the City Council conducted a public hearing and introduced an ordinance that would
approve and authorize the City Manager to enter into a Development Agreement between the City of
Chico and JP Real Estate Investments, LLC (Courtesy), to defer installation of City standard frontage

AMENDMENT TO CITY OF CHICO BUDGET APPENDIX B-1 — As Amended

An amendment to the City of Chico's 2020/21 Fiscal Year Budget Appendix B-1, modified the
Contracted Management Employees’ Salary Table for the addition of a Deputy City Manager
classification. (Mark Orme, City Manager) - It was noted for the record that this request was
modified to exclude the $500 per day stipend for Department Heads when covering for the
City Manager.

LETTER OF INTENT- AMPLA HEALTH

The City Manager recommended City Council authorize Mayor Coolidge to sign the letter of intent to
lease City-owned land to Ampla Health. (Mark Orme, City Manager)

APPROVAL OF AMENDMENTS TO AP&P 10-1 RELATED TO THE POLICIES GOVERNING THE
CITY'S BOARD, COMMISSION AND ADVISORY COMMITTEES

At its 3/9/21 Special Meeting, Council voted 6-0-1, (with Morgan absent) to direct the City Clerk to
bring back an amendment to the City's AP&P 10-1 which set forth the protocol, and procedures of
the City of Chico's board and commission actions. This amendment was to prohibit the creation of
any future board or commission standing subcommittees requiring staff support (agendas, minutes,
and attendance at meetings) as well as to end three existing subcommittees currently in place for the
Bidwell Park and Playground Commission. With this policy change, matters being considered at the
BPPC committee level will continue to be addressed by the full Commission. Should a board or
commission feel that a subcommittee is needed, it can formally make that request to the City Council
for approval. Ad hoc committees that do not require staff support nor City resources may continue to
be created for a specific purpose, with a specific timeline, and once the work is completed the work
of the ad hoc is finished.

One additional amendment was included not related to Council's request but was recommended by
the City Clerk related to requirements when calling for a special meeting. Pursuant to Government
Code, § 54954.3(a).), advisory bodies are prohibited by law from considering any other business at
a special meeting. Therefore, Business from the Floor cannot be included at a special meeting called
by aboard or commission. By including this requirement in the policy, commissioners will understand
the requirements are of the Brown Act related to when a special meeting is called. (Deborah
Presson, City Clerk)

This item was removed from the Consent Agenda at the request of Councilmember Huber for further
discussion.

Councilmember Huber noted for the record that he felt that the standing committees of the Bidwell
Park and Playground Commission should be retained. He also stated that it was brought to his
attention that the change to the policy related to the removal of Business from the Floor from special
meetings should not be approved as he was opposed to anything that would limit the ability of the
public to participate and comment on items.

The City Clerk clarified for the record that as noted on the agenda, pursuant to Government Code, §
54954.3(a).), legislative or advisory bodies are prohibited by law from considering any other business
at a special meeting other than the items that have been agendized. Because Business from the
Floor is the time for citizens to address items not already appearing on the agenda, it is therefore not
allowed at special meetings. Inclusion of this requirement will help aide the board or commission
members in understanding the requirements of the Brown Act.

Addressing the Council on this item was Jesica Giannola.

A motion was made by Councilmember Huber and seconded by Councilmember Brown to approve
the amendments to AP&P 10-1, with the Bidwell Park and Playground Commission authorized to
keep their three standing committees.
