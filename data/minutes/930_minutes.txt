ACCEPTANCE OF FUNDS DONATED FOR UNMANNED AERIAL VEHICLE (POLICE DRONES)

The Chico Police Department is currently using air support provided by the California Highway Patrol
Valley Division Air Operations and the Butte County Sheriff's Office. The aircraft utilized by CHP
include helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft, while the Butte County Air Operations is operated by a
helicopter. CHP Air Operations are based in Auburn and covers nearly 23 counties in Northern
California. Their aircraft is often unavailable to assist the Chico Police Department due to the
mission’s nature and the large geographic area they cover. The Butte County Sheriff's Office
helicopter is also often unavailable due to budgetary constraints and pilot availability. The Chico
Police Department was approached by a local community group wanting to donate the funds needed
to get the program started, with needed funds estimated at $26,000. If accepted by Council, the funds
raised by this community group will be deposited into a North Valley Community Foundation account
for this project. (Matthew Madden, Chief of Police)

AMENDMENT OF TITLE 10.52 OF THE CITY OF CHICO RELATING TO ABANDONED VEHICLE
ABATEMENT

Abandoned, wrecked, dismantled, and inoperative vehicles impact the quality, character, and safety
of neighborhoods. Inoperative vehicles contribute to the deterioration of neighborhoods creating
visual blight, affecting property values, and impacting quality of life. Inoperative vehicles are an
attractive nuisance for children, and provide harborage for rodents, insects and pests. Storage of
wrecked, dismantled, and inoperative vehicles in residential neighborhoods impact parking,
generating multiple complaints to Code Enforcement and the Police Department. To improve Code
Enforcement's ability to abate abandoned vehicles, staff recommended amending City of Chico
Municipal Code to be consistent with State and County regulations addressing this growing
issue. (Report - Tony Lindsey, Community Development Director, Building and Code
Enforcement)

Karin Wilhoit, Rob Berry, Matt Dutton, Erica Witowski, Nichole Nava, Ruth Sarnoff, and Jesica

COUNCILMEMBER MORGAN REQUEST - RECONSIDERATION OF VOTE

On December 8, 2020, the City Council directed the reconsideration of the Commercial Cannabis
fees, and as fees are directly coupled with program implementation, reconsideration would require
potential direction on program implementation. This agenda item allowed the City Council to pause
the current application process and to provide direction to City staff on any changes necessary to fee
structure and their related programmatic elements. Chico Municipal Code Chapter 5.42 authorized
the establishment of fees and charges associated with operation and application for commercial
cannabis businesses.

On October 20, 2020, the City Council approved Resolution 52-20 which established by resolution,
the creation of eight fees associated with commercial storefront and all other commercial cannabis
business types authorized under the Chico Municipal Code. (Report - Chris Constantin, Assistant
City Manager)

Addressing the Council were Anita Hoy, Marci Pittman, Lisa Currier, Jacky Smith, Catherine
Dasbach, Crystal Maddocks, Jessica Haggard, Jennifer Pratt, Andy Willhoit, Deborah Byrd, Rob
Berry, Gary Viertell, Matt Dutton, Amy Marie, Erica Witowski, Nichole Nava, Robyn Engel, Michele
Cooper, Ruth Sarnoff, Jesica Montgomery, Michelle Hale, Curtis Bortle, and David Peterson.

A motion was made by Vice Mayor Reynolds and seconded by Councilmember Morgan to pause and
delay the application process, while looking at the fees and taxes, development agreement or fee
schedule. While fees are being evaluated, staff was directed to not accept any additional applications,
and asked to reach out to the one applicant to see if a refund is preferred instead of waiting while the
review takes place.

The motion carried by the following vote:

AYES: Brown, Denlay, Huber, Morgan, Tandon, Reynolds, Coolidge
NOES: None
