Please join me in pledge allegiance to the flag.  Salute and pledge.  I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America,  and to the republic for which it stands,  one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.  Let's have the roll call, Madam Clerk.  Council Member Huber.  Here.  Council Member Morgan.  Here.  Council Member Ori.  Here.  Council Member Reynolds.  Here.  Council Member Stone.  Here.  Vice Mayor Brown.  Here.  Mayor Schwab.  Here.  A couple of announcements.  This meeting is being conducted in accordance with Executive Order N-2920,  and the public may view the meeting on Comcast Channel 11  or through the streaming video found on the city's website.  Please note the citizens are able to participate in person or via email.  The Engaged Chico Civic Engagement Program was available for citizen input  on individual agenda items prior to the meeting,  and during our meeting,  citizens can send their comments to publiccomments at chicocca.gov.  That's P-U-B-L-I-C-C-O-M-M-E-N-T-S at chicocca.gov.  During tonight's meeting,  public comment will be accepted via email to the publiccomments at chicocca.gov  prior to the close of the public comment on an item.  The public is encouraged not to send more than one comment,  one email per item,  and not to comment on numerous items in one email.  This is a special agenda.  Due to the COVID-19 pandemic,  the public shall have an opportunity to address council by email  and or Engage Chico on any item described on the agenda  before or during consideration of that item.  The city council is prohibited by law from considering any other business  at this meeting since it is a special agenda.  And we have two items on the agenda.  The first is the Homeless Solutions Plan,  and we have an introduction from City Manager Mark Oram.  Walk up here with a smile on your face and why bother?  Nobody can see it anyway, but good evening, everybody.  Here are some bottom lines through staff's eyes that I want to share.  The city will not solve homelessness tonight.  Nor has any city completely solved homelessness to date.  This conversation will be ongoing to be certain,  and it certainly deserves its own meeting to be dialogued over,  and I anticipate there will be more.  The city can mitigate the impacts of homelessness,  but it is a statewide issue that needs state and county resources,  keen collaboration from service providers,  and this city council to ensure clear direction and resources  are given to city staff to make it happen.  However, if the city does engage on this matter,  it could be very expensive to the city, as we've seen some of the numbers.  What you're being presented with tonight is primarily the compassion side of the scale.  But the only way that the city will successfully mitigate the impacts of homelessness,  is through a clear and sturdy level of accountability as well.  Because how do you help that percentage of folks who do not desire to be helped?  Let me share the public outcry that city staff receives literally every day,  as I'm sure council does as well.  What experience is our citizenry and community reporting in seeking help and finding solutions to?  People, citizens, and community members are all in this together.  We simply want a safe and healthy place to play and recreate.  A place to call home without illicit activity being conducted at their back fence.  And an acknowledgement that trash in public spaces will be cleaned up as readily as possible  when it has been reported, and in the best case scenario, proactively cleaned up.  People are truly at their wits end.  Because none of these basic and regular issues are being addressed.  And people who have rightfully sought after desires are 100% assured in this unique time in our city's history.  What is it that staff is hoping for tonight?  Well, constructive community dialogue and feedback, obviously vitally important.  And a clear vision and direction from the city council on where you desire staff to go from here.  As this is only part of the puzzle, but a vital part of the puzzle.  I'll now step away and ask our homeless solutions coordinator, Ms. Suzy Calkins,  who's been diligently coordinating with our community partners and working on finding solutions, to take it from here.  I know that the city council has asked for this time and again to come up with solutions.  Staff has not neglected that.  We've evaluated a tremendous amount.  You've seen a portion of it in this report.  But there has been a heck of a lot of work.  There's been a lot more that's been happening.  And I just want you to know that it's our privilege to be able to serve the best that we can to try to find these solutions.  And I am utterly thankful and grateful that we've had the opportunity.  Thank you, council, for allowing us to hire homeless solutions coordinators so that we can try to come up with some viable options for you to consider.  With that, Suzy.  Thank you, Mr. Orme.  Good evening, Madam Mayor and council members.  My name is Suzy Calkins.  I'm your homeless solutions coordinator.  Most of you I have met have the honor of presenting the city's draft homeless opportunities plan this evening.  Let's get started.  If I can get this to work right.  As city manager just spoke to you a moment ago, city council has requested staff to develop a comprehensive plan that alleviates the impacts of homelessness on the city.  And by discussing these opportunities this evening, we could improve public health and safety by connecting persons experiencing homelessness to supportive services, housing, and case managers.  The plan that we are presenting this evening is a very aggressive approach towards combating homelessness, primarily street homelessness.  And it will require an unprecedented level of leadership, teamwork, and accountability on the parts of yourselves, the council, city staff, city council, and city council.  parler  parler  parler  parler  parler  parler  parler Do we ask questions as slides come up or do you want us to hold everything and come back around? Since there's really no staff report other than the slideshow. I guess I would defer to the speaker. I think that it would be okay to ask questions as they come up. Because I had a question for Mr. Orm that I held up.  I had a question for Mr. Orem, but I held up.  Would it be okay if we had a question?  That's fine.  Yes, absolutely.  Thank you.  Did you have a question there?  Okay.  Okay.  Thank you.  All right.  Through this plan, the city can make some positive changes in the lives of its residents,  and I'm not just talking about the citizens.  I am talking about persons experiencing homelessness as well.  Through this plan, we can create a combination of system improvements  and expansions.  We can implement innovative practices through stronger partnerships,  and those partnerships include city staff, county staff, and the state government.  Through today's process, we hope our outcomes involve the city council  providing direct feedback to the plan,  that we allow the vital input of our public and stakeholders,  and that we affirm the path forward to facilitate how our staff can take this plan  and put it into action.  In developing this plan, we made many assumptions.  Here's just a handful of them.  I had to minimize the screen.  So most importantly, the homeless plan and solutions are not a one-size-fits-all.  We have to offer a plethora of services that meets the clients where they need to be met in order  to solve their particular barriers to housing sustainability and placement.  Any opportunity that we provide, or any action that we take,  must be done with compassion, integrity, and dignity for those that we're serving.  Again, the strategy's goals and actions must follow and focus on getting the highest number  of the unsheltered homeless on the streets, in shelter beds, and or housed permanently.  We need to be able to connect them to services that will improve their sustained,  or excuse me, improve their health outcomes and their potential for sustained housing.  In doing so,  we have calculated the number of unsheltered homeless using the 2019 full point in time count.  And that means that we have a deficit of 258 shelter beds,  which are using the COVID numbers for the pandemic,  and 207 pre-pandemic.  And that's because of spacing.  So let me see if I understand that.  There's 258 more homeless than there are existing shelters.  So that's the number of unsheltered homeless that are using the COVID-19 response system.  Correct.  Thank you.  So why are we here today?  Well, primarily my goal is to talk about the homeless crisis response system.  And to better define that, a response system is a system that identifies homeless persons,  or persons experiencing homelessness.  It tries to prevent homelessness as best it can, when it can.  And connects people with housing quickly, hence rapid rehousing,  and provides support for people with disabilities.  And it's a system that allows people to have supportive services when they're needed.  Our services should be client-centered and client-directed,  meaning our clients can choose the services that they need,  or believe that they need, to improve their health outcomes  and eliminate barriers to self-sufficiency.  The plan in front of you today captures and elaborates on a multi-layered approach  to service analysis, to the options available,  and is a response that I believe will have lasting impact and changes  for those people experiencing homelessness,  as well as it supports the homeless crisis response system.  In front of us today are several stakeholders that did have an opportunity to chime into this plan,  prior to it being reviewed by yourselves and presented to the general public.  However, I would like to take the opportunity after this evening,  if you so desire, to allow for a community-driven engagement and review process,  where we can get a better understanding of the challenges that we face,  feel an input from the greater public on what they believe should be included in this plan,  or articulate steps moving forward.  So some of the things that guided the development of this plan,  and City Manager spoke to this just a minute ago,  accountability, again accountability on the part of the Council,  on the part of City staff, the homeless themselves, and the greater community,  and the City of  Chico's residents.  We need to listen to the homeless.  What do they believe is most important to them?  And that's why that two-week review period that we were going to talk about a little bit later,  and I just spoke of, is really important.  We can often articulate what we think is best for persons experiencing homelessness,  but that doesn't necessarily mean that's what they need.  One of the guiding principles also included housing options.  And we don't just mean providing beds,  we mean housing options that are evidence-based,  meaning that they have been successful in other jurisdictions,  and henceforth could probably be just as successful here.  And then ensuring a strong system of care that prioritizes communication and collaboration.  And this plan is significantly about how we collaborate with the City, County, State, and our service providers.  There are pivotal access points to the coordinated entry system,  and housing have to be working together and in tandem.  To get to these goals of the plan,  we implemented, or would like to implement, several strategies.  One is a systems-level approach, getting all of those partners on board at the same time, heading in the same direction.  The thing that is most important to me is number two, increasing mobile outreach and engagement.  Many of our service providers have an outreach worker or an outreach team.  But I think we need to do a better job of collectively working together  to get to the individuals living on the streets in encampments or staying at the city park,  and work together to coordinate services to really reinforce a shelter bed and the opportunities that that would bring them.  And we can't do that if we're all working in silos.  I think it's really important that we all work together.  We need to leverage that.  We need to leverage community resources.  As Mr. Orme was saying, this is expensive.  Homelessness and solving homelessness or putting opportunities out there is costly.  So we need to be able to leverage multiple opportunities and multiple funding sources  to make bigger things happen and to sustain them long term.  That will be sure to obviously reduce homelessness and impact our outcomes in the long run.  And then increase the production of affordable housing.  I know this year, I understand between the city and the county,  we're getting to develop 1,500 units of affordable housing, which is excellent.  But I think we need to continue that trend to make sure we're not only going to be able to house the homeless  with subsidies and permanent solutions,  but that we have enough housing to keep up with the working poor that need that lower burden of housing to their household budget.  And then, for example,  if we're successful at doing items one through four,  number five will come naturally,  improving the performance of the existing system.  Ms. Cockhams, I have a question.  Item number one up there, accountability.  You said accountability of council, city staff, community, and people experiencing homelessness.  Can you elaborate on each of those?  How accountability would...  How would you say that would be the most important thing?  Would accountability be measured with each of those people or groups?  Well, I think if...  The easiest method of accountability would be to track the number of people that we are able to get off the street and into housing.  And that could be an emergency shelter bed, transitional housing, or permanent housing placement.  And then how long they stay there.  So recidivism is really high with the chronically homeless population.  So what I have typically done in the past,  and has been successful,  is offering a progressive program engagement.  So moving a person, if they desire,  from a potential tent environment or living on the streets  to an emergency shelter bed, to transitional,  and through the ranks, if you will, to a permanent solution.  So if we were able to track that,  and how long they were in a housing placement,  it would be sure to dictate or indicate, I should say,  our accountability,  at least at the lowest level.  So what have we done so far?  So the Butte County Continuum of Care is our local planning body.  They're the entity that is responsible from a state and federal government level  to coordinate housing and services  and the funding for persons experiencing homelessness in our jurisdiction.  The COC must provide, if they want to be successful,  multiple intervention types that meet the client where their needs are.  This creates a crisis response system.  In my opinion, solutions should include a viable option for sanctioned camping  and safe parking to be a comprehensive crisis response system.  Previously, when Joy Amaro was in this position,  she did vet and find nine different locations  that were identified across the city as potential sites  for sanctioned encampments and safe parking.  I believe those items were discussed in a presentation much like this.  At that time, no action was taken.  The project sites were deemed either cost prohibitive  or non-viable at that time.  On the next two slides, I have demonstrated  which nine sites those were.  I don't know if you guys want me to go through these details.  Of these nine sites, we looked at many things.  This was primarily location, if they had amenities such as water and power,  if it was close to shopping.  When we look at developing a project site,  whether it's an emergency shelter,  affordable housing, not as much important,  permanent shelter, things like that,  we need to look at how close a person who is homeless,  who probably doesn't have a car,  how close they are to services,  how close is the grocery store,  how close is the bus stop,  how close is their case manager at behavioral health,  or any other public service.  Public transportation has to be available if it's a little bit farther out,  but that was one of the examples.  And then we looked at the categories that Joy assessed  when she conducted her research on these nine properties.  I wish I could tell you why each particular site was not deemed viable,  but that information is not readily available.  If I could comment, I think the term viable,  I don't remember us going through each of these and saying...  Whether it's viable or not.  ...whether we're going to pursue it.  For example, the CHP site,  as small as that might be,  I don't think there was any viability issues.  I'll let Mr. Arm chime in, if you will.  Sure, happy to.  Obviously, one of the things that we have to ensure  is the integrity of our operations,  and that is one of the most difficult ones.  I actually said, let's just move forward with the CHP site.  But in talking with our operations,  it wasn't as simple as I thought it might happen to be.  There is a transition that has been taking place.  As it relates to the PD facility.  And that transition is actually in the midst,  and it will be occurring over the next number of months.  It will continue to occur, that transition.  And there's evidence back behind the fence.  There's just a number of reasons why no's kept coming my way.  In addition to that, and these are just some of the sites,  these were the primary sites that we evaluated.  We looked at properties outside of the city limits.  Large properties.  I had conversations with private properties.  We looked at property owners.  We looked at, I even looked at our detention basin.  On just past MLK and East Park and down in that area.  And because of environmental constraints,  I mean, we looked at literally a vast array of sites.  These are just the primary ones that we evaluated.  If council desires to give us direction to move forward  with bringing one of these back to just proceed,  then obviously that direction can be resolved.  But I think that's just the general idea that we received.  We just are trying to be reasonable with trying to facilitate our core operations.  And in this instance, it's public works and police that are over there.  And it would cause concerns.  Always happy to have the chief come up or Mr. Gustafson.  Mr. Gustafson's on vacation today.  But the chief can come up and kind of speak to that if you'd like him to.  But I just want to share with you there were always pitfalls with every one of these sites.  And I just want to assure the council that all of these were vetted.  And I was to a point where let's just move forward with one of these.  And ultimately what it always came down to is it would impede our ability to conduct basic operations.  So for whatever that's worth.  Well, I go back to my point that I don't think there's been a council decision to eliminate sites.  So it's news to me to hear that staff has.  And I'm not going to ask you to go through each of these sites.  I'm just saying that I think that as we measure viability of any other site that these are, this is great criteria to be looking at.  And that inconvenience to a department may end up not being a deciding factor in my mind.  But thank you.  Fantastic.  And you're 100% right.  Council has not said no to any of these sites as far as I'm aware.  Which begs the question, what's changed?  Since the last time that we evaluated the CHP building, which seems to have been a little bit more of a !  Because it seems so much more likely to have yeses all across the line.  What's changed today?  Anything?  No.  Nothing at all.  OK.  Mr. Orme, I'd like to take you up on asking Chief Mahdon to come up and speak to that.  Sure.  Thanks.  Good evening, Madam Mayor, Council.  What's changed since I think the last time we really talked in depth about it.  I think even council got a tour of the facility is we've actually officially have begun a remodel  project at the police department and so that property incorporates that remodel one of the  things that we have to do right now is we had to remodel our dispatch center our communication  center with because we have system upgrades coming from the state with the new 911 system  the viper unit and so we started that remodel probably about two months ago so that's really  what's changed is currently our records division is working out of that facility  which moved dispatch into records as we're redoing that room so what that also causes is that that  facility is also in this remodel project will be our evidence system and so with the remodel that's  going on we've had to move physical evidence  and !  criminal cases to that facility as well to include vehicles and things that we have and some of the  more high profile crimes so chain of custody evidence is incredibly important it makes or break  a criminal prosecution case and so one of the concerns I had the last time we talked about this  is is just beyond that gate is vehicles associated in our evidence system with pending prosecution  of significant  crimes and all it takes is one breach to destroy that evidence and some of these cases are very  serious cases several homicide related vehicles are in that parking lot and so to maintain the  security is really really important for us you know so now even the parking lot because records  is all over at that facility that's where the employee parking is occurring and a lot of the  construction vehicles are there areas of the parking lot that are not in the parking lot and so that's  really important for us to be able to maintain that security and so we have to we can staff that  during the day for civilians to come in and out but then we secure it all at night and so my concern  was that if you know we just have one person go over that fence rummaging around I've compromised  every piece of evidence that's potentially out there so I hope that answers the question if I may  so what a few of us toured that facility six eight months ago it seemed like there were three !  potential opportunities there there was the front parking lot the inside of the building in the back  parking lot back parking lot seemed like it was out because it held all the evidentiary vehicles from  past cases or pending cases or whatever on the inside of the building it sounds like you're going  to be using for dispatch the front parking lot once the construction is done and internal affairs  discussed the possibility of bringing this forward and I think that's a really important part of  the council of using that as a safe parking area for people living in their vehicles do you see once the  construction is done on the inside of the building will that front area be freed up or will it continue  to be impacted I think it's going to continue to be impacted but I think that the idea that there's  going to be some parking spaces that are going to be used to keep the parking lot and the parking lot  is there the other concern that I have right next door is your actual police facility and since day  one I started at Chico Police Department I've been concerned about the safety of that facility it's  not it's not secure not even by a little bit and so you know we have staff coming and going all day  and night you know we have unarmed civilians dispatchers walking through that parking lot and  different things so I have to also consider my staff's  safety when you recognize and if you don't anytime if you want to come to the actual police facility  I would sponsor that I have some really really concerns about the safety of that facility and how  it's designed so we are working on a plan that ultimately is going to be part of a larger remodel  project and there's also some other things we're working with trying to work on some private  donation to address some of those  real safety concerns but right now the only thing that's between our staff and that facility is some  chain link fence and so that poses a real real concern for me  Chief Madden I appreciate that and there were a number of us that did tour that facility and had these  questions and I remember the discussion about the dispatch and research records department so I get  the sensitivities what always surprised me was that you know we're looking for  opportunities of highest and best use and that may not immediately be what the police department was  hoping for a year ago when we toured this facility but you know we've got space out at the airport  we've got an FAA line and you know I don't know whether that's some opportunity that we may be able to  secure the evidence in another facility but one of the benefits to this specific CHP site is you've got  transportation and you've got access to all of the rest of the facilities that you would need in the  municipality in the first place you don't have that at out at the airport but you don't have necessarily and this is a  question do we have to have an evidence facility like that that is in the core in the center of city or is it  is it someplace that can be relocated that's less advantageous for all but still would allow an opportunity for safety to  monitor it so probably one of the most liable driven internal processes for a police department is the  maintenance and control of your evidence system  it's highly important that's where you make or break so taking a facility completely off site trying to find the ability to monitor and maintain that security 24 7 all the different things that go on I mean officers come in daily four or five times a day to book in their evidence from that case because it's a chain of custody you got to account for it for every second of the day if it's going to be relevant to court and so when you start spreading out facilities that are not in the  first place first parler parler  parler parler And there's two major outside of the law enforcement and police officers on the street. The two main liabilities for me is that holding facility that we have, custodial holding facility and the evidence system. !  parler  parler  parler  parler  parler  parler  parler  parler  parler !  parler So I'm willing to have any further conversations, but I can just really tell you that the whole design of this was to finally create on the compound an evidence system that is secure 24-7, that is accessible. ! !  parler  parler  parler  parler  parler  parler  on the compound an evidence system that is secure 24-7, that is accessible, and we maintain  the credibility of all the things that we're doing on the street. And so I wouldn't be  comfortable moving that away from the facility, to be very honest with you. That's why we've spent  years designing this remodel program to facilitate an evidence system on this deal. The other thing  we have is we have part of this system is all the bikes we book in. So we have a section there.  Everything's right there. And then the other thing is we have a very expensive, large-scale  refrigerator system on site that we have to maintain biological evidence. That's really  important. And so that's already there. So again, my recommendation is we continue with our remodels  that's been designed, and just be creative.  And the only other thing coming from me is it's not a very big parking lot. There are really no  trees there, and there's no shade. And for me, are people really going to come and stay right  there next to the police department with cop cars coming in and out? I don't know. I'm willing to  have those conversations, but those were just some concerns that I had.  It was also a concern of others. I have a follow-up question, if you don't mind.  What we moved into the CHP building, maybe Mr. Orem can answer this for me,  is CHP was occupying that building up until what, three years ago, four years ago?  Right.  So where were these facilities while CHP was leasing our building? Where did we have them?  In other words, all of this migrated to this new location within the last three years.  So what's going on is you have a pretty small evidence system inside the police facility.  The problem is that we have completely outgrown the police facility.  Yeah.  At one point, we had to get a portable lock-on.  We had to get a locker room, basically a portable for people to don and doff their uniforms and those types of things.  So one of the major issues as we're building out, we've been told in this remodel to live within your means and be on that property for 10 years.  That's the direction I've been given.  And so this remodel incorporates that.  And one of the things is we have to provide an area for officers to don and doff their uniforms.  It's a legal requirement.  It's a legal requirement to do that.  And so we're out of locker space.  It's really, really old.  And the men and women's locker room kind of run like in an L with each other.  And they dead end right at where the evidence system currently is.  And so the only way to expand that locker room, given the footprint of the building, was to move that.  We've spent, this has been a three-year project, building this remodel.  And so the plans are in place.  And we're definitely moving forward with that.  So that's one of the reasons why it's actually moving.  And the idea of, and really one of the big reasons why we looked at purchasing the CHP other than just that whole corner right with the city of Chico.  But that was another big reason for us.  Anything else?  Great.  Thank you.  All right.  Are there additional questions about the nine sites at this time?  What did you call them?  The nine sites.  Sorry.  All right.  Call to action.  Each of the parcels that we researched, obviously, as we've discussed, were not a viable solution.  But the one parcel that had the most minimal, let's see, needs that needed to be alleviated was that of the BMX property.  And that was the one parcel that had the most minimal needs that needed to be alleviated was that of the BMX property off of MLK.  The BMX site at MLK is owned by the city.  Has all the basic necessities or amenities to serve as an appropriate site.  Has some ingress and egress issues that need to be remediated.  As well as the potential for a sewer, water, and electric connections to be upsized.  Those have to be evaluated.  In order to utilize this particular site, a commitment to continue to support the BMX site.  The BMX youth activity must be concluded.  This will require the city to support an existing effort underway to create the BMX relocation at its new airport site.  If the MLK site is not utilized for sheltering needs, the city should renew the BMX lease in place now.  Our recommendation, staff is requesting the use of one-time funds to complete the new location and preserve the BMX site currently.  As a potential option for future efforts.  Those efforts could include sanctioned camping and safe parking.  And it could include a low barrier navigation center.  Which in my opinion, in speaking with the state, should include what they call non-congregate shelter beds.  It's the direction that the state is going in.  Instead of one large room or several large rooms, more individualized units.  Where a homeless individual can store his or her own shelter.  Or their belongings.  And feel some sense of space in their own, like, dormitory style living.  Further studies of these options obviously are necessary and need to be completed before moving forward.  Safe camping, or excuse me, safe parking and...  If I could go on that slide for just a second.  Go back.  What I was confused about reading through was whether or not any of the...  Proposals coming ahead of us needs the BMX site to go forward.  For example, there's talk of an expansion of tourists where they are today.  Not another navigation center, but adding, I think, 20 beds or so to the existing tourist shelter.  Does that require the BMX property to...  No, it does not.  And so, what this does is just makes a parcel available.  Correct.  For further investigation of environmentals and zoning.  To see if it's a viable solution.  As well, we need to fix that, get an easement.  So we don't have the ingress and egress issues that are currently present.  So there's some preliminary work that needs to be done before we can determine that that's a project site.  We could put sanctioned camping or safe parking there.  A lot is big enough.  It's, I think, 3.65 acres.  That we could, on one end, put safe camping.  Or safe parking and sanctioned camping.  And then use the other part of the parcel to develop the non-congregate shelter.  So the existing BMX site is about 6.5 acres you said?  No, 3.65 acres.  3.65.  I believe.  Yes.  And I'm all, you know, we need sites.  I just would like to introduce the cost-benefit analysis approach.  That $600,000 to get 3 acres may well be a bonanza.  I don't know.  But it does seem that we're not looking at both sides of the equation with some of the proposals.  Yeah.  It's pricey.  Mr. Orme, did you want to chime in at all about that?  No.  But it is the one site that I didn't get thrashed for saying it can be used for something that council's looking for.  Everything else has so many pitfalls.  This is a dollar sign.  But all the other aspects were minimal compared to some of those other sites.  So, yeah.  But I understand.  It's a lot of .  I think you have been trashed.  We voted it down twice.  I don't know if you don't mind my humor on it.  Yeah.  Yeah, no.  I'm trying to bring you every option.  And if you don't like it, you don't need to move.  That's just another option.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You had looked at that.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Did you have another question or comment?  No.  Thank you.  But we had looked at that site for the renewal center.  For the Jesus Center.  So, it was a pathway that we were going down.  Yeah.  We made the commitment to the BMX Club organization.  They've already had some work done out by the airport, correct?  Amazingly so.  Our community has really come together for it, yes.  Right.  And that activity brings in tourism dollars to our community in terms of hotel stays and other things.  And meals and whatnot.  So, in one way, we could look at this as an investment in that activity and tourism.  Yeah.  Well, that's...  I mean, obviously, if...  And, Mayor, you're right.  And, Council Member, you're right.  Bottom line is, it is about the ledger.  And that ledger is going to tell you, A, there is a cost, but what is the benefit?  And obviously...  And I feel like I've been down this road before.  Sorry.  I feel like just stopping there.  But the benefit is what the Mayor just shared.  And we don't know what those numbers will be, but we do know that there's already a  world-class BMX legend out helping to put together this new site.  It's going to attract worldwide attention.  And so, I don't know if that ledger...  I don't know how quickly that ledger will end up balancing.  But it will happen.  It's just I don't know exactly when.  So, yeah.  But I'll stop there, unless there's more questions.  The question I was going to ask at the very beginning of your presentation, we're talking  about $2 million here tonight.  And how in the world does the city have $2 million?  Are you going to address that later tonight?  Happy to answer it now, just to get it out of the way.  Okay.  I think that's very important for us to realize that there's rumors that the city is, you  know, probably going to be a little bit more expensive than it was in the past.  Because it's so close to bankruptcy.  But that is not the case.  Yeah.  So, with COVID-19, nobody knows exactly where we're going to be in a year from now, right?  We see the first couple of quarters.  And so, we know where we're going to be at the end of this past fiscal year.  And it's sitting in a very good position.  This will be presented at your next meeting, first meeting in October.  But we will have sufficient one-time funds.  One-time funds.  I'm not saying they're ongoing.  One-time funds that will facilitate an ability to manage the whole time.  manage this very, very easily. And also another recommendation that you will see coming from me  is to fully fund our emergency reserve with those other one-time funds. This is something no city  council sitting here has ever had the opportunity to do. And it's been astounding. Our economy has  been bolstered by disaster, unfortunately. But I will tell you that I can't tell you what the  third quarter is going to come in at. I'll know in about a month what the third quarter is going  to be. And that's when a huge detrimental reverse of the state happened to our city. So I can't tell  you where that's at. But I can tell you we have one-time funds to deal with this. So that hopefully  answers your question. Can I ask a follow-up question or just make a statement? I would have  waited till later for this. We've put off far smaller dollar amounts. And what we heard from  council members,  was this is something we should talk about when we talk about the budget. When we talk about the  budget, I mean, when I say smaller numbers, I mean like $20,000. But the action items on tonight's  emergency meeting are calling for $2 million to be spent for a plan that was put together in the last  two weeks. So my statement is only, I'm reading this may do this and this could do this and may  and could and could and may, may, could, may, could, may, could. And then next week, everybody here  will be talking about the cost benefit. And I think that's what we're talking about. And I think  that's what the money is. And you just said, I just wrote it down, we can manage this. We can manage  to spend $2 million anywhere. What's the cost benefit? Tonight we have a meeting solely based on  one thing. So we're looking at everything we're talking about tonight, we're looking at through a  keyhole. This is how that looks. We could spend $2 million to do this, maybe could, maybe can,  may, possibly, maybe. And what are the other things that we could be doing? We're not talking  about those. And it's important. And you said, Susie, that, you know, this is a system-wide dynamic.  Managed plan. It's not. It's for this specific thing. The city has many, many other responsibilities.  Tonight we are looking at one, which is fine. It's a good conversation to have. The thing that bothers me is that we have action items on here.  That it would be immature of us to vote on any of them until we have a much better idea where we are holistically to follow up on your statement.  That was all. Thank you.  If I could, I think that those are all valid points. These are not on for action. They're on for direction.  And if you direct us, they'll be a part of next council meeting's meeting as a part of the budget.  And so I don't want you to feel the pressure. I mean, obviously, you're the council. You can take whatever action, urgency actions that you feel need to be taken.  However, staff is not having this brought forward for an action tonight. What we're seeking is direction.  And this is an ongoing conversation, as I opened with.  This is not.  A comprehensive, overarching, holistic plan.  This is a comprehensive component of a plan.  And this facilitates primarily compassion.  This facilitates primarily the peace to shelter people now.  And so, for whatever that's worth, I totally get where you're coming from.  And yes, council hasn't authorized $20,000, $10,000, maybe even $5,000 recommendations that I had.  For good reason.  Because you're on.  And so, we're still unsure where we're going to be.  But I can tell you, we do have one-time dollars coming in.  And it's ultimately up to the city council to make a determination where they want to spend them.  It could be in something totally different.  However, council wanted to have this dialogue, and that's why we're bringing this forward.  Hopefully, that helps.  As a follow-up, and that was kind of what I was asking earlier.  What's different? Because these are all proposals that we've been through, addressed, we've looked at, didn't work, wasn't viable.  Now we have 2.4 or 2.1 million dollars from our conservative spending over the last year that we think our budget is going to end up at that route.  And I believe that Scott's a wizard with performance on our budget.  However, we know on the back end that we're going to have tremendous expenses and that's basically what you just reiterated.  But what's different is we have money today that's one time money that we didn't have previously.  So that's the answer that I was looking for.  Thank you.  And I would argue that it's more than the 2.3 million dollars that's being proposed here.  Enough money to go into our operational and our emergency reserves to fully fund them.  I think we're probably getting ahead of ourselves with our discussion.  So I'll leave it there.  So, um...  Ms. Cockrums, and this may actually be for the city manager.  Um, I know in the, in sort of the formal request that we're, or formal recommendation from the other part of this agenda,  there's a question of appropriating 600,000 dollars for the BMX move and then appropriating 100,000 dollars from the general fund for the required planning and environmental review of the old BMX location.  Thank you.  I don't know if you referred to it here, but it's referred in that other part.  And my question is, since we already own the property, is there any reason why we couldn't make the possible appropriation of that 600,000 dollars subject to a successful results of the planning and environmental review?  So we would know in advance that it was approved.  We would know that it was approved for the purposes that we had in mind.  And we would have an idea of what the costs and what the mitigations were before.  So we could approve that, I guess I'm suggesting, the idea that what if we approved the 100,000 dollars to take care of that environmental review portion and then made the 600,000 subject to the results of that.  Could, could that work?  You can always put continuous.  You can always put contingencies on items.  Obviously one of the things that we've become very accustomed to is the city attorney being able to speak to a variety of issues that potentially become risk.  And so if you're approving specifically a project, then obviously we want to ensure we go through the environmentals before we do the project.  It can't be under the assumption that a specific project will be done because we need to ensure that we have covered all the bases.  In accordance with all the rules and regulations because that obviously is something that we attempted with others in the community to try to move forward with projects that didn't necessarily end up coming to fruition.  Because we need to make sure and do it in a fashion that is in abidance with our legal counsel.  And so I don't know if Andrew, if you want to speak to that or if that's enough or if you could bring clarity to something I said.  Okay.  So.  Okay.  So is there any risk that we could spend the $600,000 and then find out that we couldn't do some of the things that we wanted to do with that property?  So we have the benefit of having good community partners who have already gone through some level of environmental.  So we have a fairly good level of confidence that we are in a good.  But yes, that is always there.  We are fairly confident that we'll be good on that property for whatever use is necessary.  But I can't guarantee it because we haven't gone through the formal process to complete that review.  So Scott, if I might, I have a follow-up question to that.  My understanding was that the Jesus Center had done environmental review on that property.  But we need to do another one for another $100,000 to make sure we can do our $600,000 thing?  Yeah, go ahead.  So there's essentially two types of environmental review.  There's environmental review.  There's environmental review for looking for hazards on the site to affect people, phase one, which might lead to a phase two environmental analysis.  The money that's being asked for here is a different type of environmental review.  The planning aspect of it in order to do the sequel review.  And in particular, this site has some site constraints relating to access that need to be solved.  There is essentially a flag lot with some gates up against some other property.  You can get there through Silver Dollar Fairgrounds.  I believe you can also get there from a street that comes south.  But that needs to be formalized as an access route.  And so it's those types of things that this money would be going for.  That was a good, it's a different environmental impact.  Slightly different, yes.  It kind of fit in.  It's a different type of environmental change.  All right.  Thank you.  Okay.  Let's go back to sanctioned camping and safe parking.  At this point, a service provider considering a step forward for sanctioned camping and safe parking would have to use probably both staff and volunteers to cover a project site 24-7, 365.  Such an administrator would have to develop program guidelines.  Basically the rules.  The rules of the campground and safe parking.  And then those guidelines need to fall within the compliance guidelines for CDC and public health and safety and then best practices known around the country for sanctioned camping.  There are a couple of sources of potential revenue for this program.  Primarily private donors, which I have had several dozen step up and say that if we move forward with a sanctioned campground at a future date, they would like to chime in on as a private donor.  And then of course, city funding.  If I could.  Sure.  And I don't, I hope, I mean our job is in due diligence is to ask a lot of questions.  So I'm hoping that's taken in that spirit.  So what's in front of us does not include sanctioned camping at this point.  You're correct.  And the money, two million plus or whatever, does not include whatever cost it will be to us to provide the camping.  So at the end of the presentation on the very last slide, there is a request to appropriate a million dollars to handle multiple things.  So if council so chooses to appropriate that hundred thousand dollars that we were just speaking about to do the environmental planning on the BMX current site, and that proves positive and as a viable solution, that million dollars would go to cover some of the operational costs.  And to prep the land.  And do some one-time purchases like portable showers and laundry and things like that.  That would be encompassed in that million dollars.  But that million dollars also will cover some remediation at our public parks and greenways.  Once the illegal camping is resolved and folks have left the area, there needs to be some remediation there.  So that one million dollars will go for a lot of different potential sources.  When we get to the million, I had questions.  I know you have some questions about that, too.  But if I'm hearing you right, I don't want to pin you down because I hope there are other options.  To get to a sanctioned campground, we're thinking it will be the BMX site, which requires the BMX to be moved, and for environmental planning work and infrastructure before we get to the point of sanctioned camping.  Correct.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  know how much time that might take?  I think I saw something in here November 1st.  No, the November 1st  date is for the new  navigation center, which we haven't got to yet.  No, at this point we don't  know how long it will take. I think the  weather, BMX moving  out, if that's what we're doing,  might take some additional time.  We're getting towards the winter months, so  the weather will impact a lot of that.  I would like to say, and Mr.  Arm can chime in, it will be  all hands on deck, but that's not  my purview.  Two questions.  So if we,  and I don't know if this is  whether this should go to the city  manager or to the  homeless coordinator,  but if we wanted  to specify that within that  one million that  we wanted  one of the  results of that  to be a  sanctioned camp  ground, could we include  that in the way  we  agree to that?  Yeah, absolutely.  Okay.  Question number two. It sounds to me like what  we're saying is we would, once  we had  the property  configured,  that we would, what, do a request  for  proposals or contracts with  private administrators that would,  that would then run a program there?  How would that work?  Yes. Yes, exactly.  Right now, we don't have any,  I mean, I've, in my short seven weeks  with you guys, have connected with  a lot of our service providers and the  general public. At this point in time,  as of right now, we don't have  a provider interested in stepping  up to be the administrator operator  of a sanctioned campsite,  campground, or safe parking site.  But there's potential out there,  and I don't want to divulge too much, but there's potential  that a group is working on that to be ready  at a future date.  So that brings up an interesting question.  Is there something about operating  a campground that is  less desirable to a service provider  than operating a shelter  facility? In other words, is there  less money available? Is there  less, what? Yes.  To answer your question, yes.  You have to operate it 24-7 with  security. You know, that's pretty  expensive. The elements have a lot to do.  With it, you know, the clientele often  needs a lot of guidance and bringing  service providers in that are case  managers takes a lot of coordination. It  is an expensive task, but it's also one  that many of our providers have never  ever done before. And it's pretty new in  the housing and homeless arena to have  sanctioned camping, and it's popping up  in primarily urban areas and major cities.  across the United States really heavily  on the West Coast. So there's not, you  know, 25 service providers saying, you  know, I've done this before, I'm  experiencing like to do it again.  So it's a new and challenging So it's a new and challenging environment. And I would chime in and add that there's a huge amount of liability that goes along with it because it is a low barrier situation and people have all their stuff in their tents. because it is a low barrier situation and people have all their stuff in their tents. !  parler  parler !  parler  parler  parler !  parler  parler  parler  to step up or organizations?  So we have seen that these are happening  in some other communities.  Modesto, I think, has one under the freeway overpass.  They've got a bunch of tents and that sort of thing.  Do we have enough history that we can see  that they've been able to, in the short time  that they've been running those things,  have been able to make them pencil and make them viable?  Yeah, so the majority of them have a lot of support  from private donations and primarily foundations.  Major metropolitan cities have often chipped in  several hundred thousand dollars or millions of dollars  to make it happen.  They have been successful in connecting persons  to resources that are available in the county, city,  jurisdiction to make sure that they have what they need,  again, client-centered, to get them to the next step  in the process.  And whether that is from a sanctioned campground  to an emergency shelter bed or some long-term solution  as permanent housing, they are seeing that.  But it's still so relatively new,  we don't have comparative data for a 10-year span to say,  in this economy or this demographic  or this part of the country,  we were more successful than in this part.  It doesn't really answer your question fully, but...  You bet.  Okay.  All right.  We've been talking a lot about the crisis response system  and potential gaps that we have in our system.  I'd like to take a few minutes to introduce.  We have a group of our service providers that are here with us  that had input into the plan in front of you today somewhat,  and they will be the significant pillars of our community  that will carry whatever the crisis is that we're facing.  So we're going to take a few minutes  when we make it forward.  The city is not typically a service provider  in the homeless arena.  We don't run emergency shelters or permanent housing programs,  but the folks here do.  They're our experts, and they have the tenacity  and love and support and compassion for our homeless  and the business sense to make it happen.  So I would like to introduce Joy, which all of you know,  Joy Amaro is the Executive Director  of the True North Housing Alliance,  and she's going to be talking about the crisis response system  and she's going to spend some time talking to you  about emergency shelter.  Let's see.  Deb, how do I minimize this?  There we go.  Thank you.  Takes a team, told you.  Okay. Pop up.  Maybe she already put it up.  There's Joy.  Okay.  Here you go.  Okay. Good evening.  Thank you for having me.  So I'm just here tonight to just kind of go over an overview  of what True North really does.  We do more than just sheltering, and then we'll dig in deeper  throughout the presentation later on regarding the expansion,  as Mr. Orrie asked.  So I'm going to start with the first part,  and then I'll talk a little bit more about the potential  and then the potential low barrier navigation center.  So first of all, we are a full spectrum continuum  of care provider, and so what that means is  that we have our hands in kind of every little pot imaginable  within the continuum of care.  So with outreach, emergency shelter, transitional housing,  rapid rehousing, permanent supportive housing,  and even permanent housing.  So three years ago, when I was in the emergency shelter,  when I was hired as the director, we had the opportunity  to really spread our wings, and we knew that we had  to develop other outputs to get people into housing  because of the lack of vacancy rates.  So outreach, it's not, as Suzy mentioned, it's not that formal.  We had just a little bit of money  through our rapid rehousing grant that we utilized  when the pandemic hit, and so we were able to get people  out into the encampment.  to get people out into the encampment, to do COVID education,  meal prep, until the funds ran out, and so then we had to kind  of close up shop, and we weren't able to continue those services.  We also work hand in hand with the target team,  and I have nothing but good things to say about that team.  They're essentially very compassionate  and just want the best for our unsheltered population.  So moving on to emergency shelter, the next slide.  This is a fiscal year, the last three years, of what we have done  with our guests at the Torres Shelter.  Starting off with in 17-18, we served 851 unique individuals,  which increased to 931.  So that's a unique count.  That's not a duplicative count.  So when you find a unique count, you're going to have to do a lot of work.  So we have a figure we have on average 160 people  in the shelter pre-COVID.  This fiscal year, which is the, this is actually ran  on the state fiscal year, we dropped significantly  to 593 unique individuals.  And the reason for that is because as when COVID hit,  we moved people out, and we moved our most vulnerable people  out into the project room key.  And then as, because of COVID, we moved our most vulnerable people  out into the project room key.  And then as, because of COVID, we were holding our census and saying  that we weren't taking new people because we wanted  to contain our environment to ensure  that we kept our guests safe.  We currently are taking new people, and most recently,  our count as of this morning was 78.  And we can go up to 120 to maintain social distancing.  But I really wanted to highlight on the rest of these numbers the amount  of, you know, the number of people that are in the shelter, and the number of people that are in the shelter.  And I think that's a good work that my staff do.  We employ four case managers.  It's a pretty much, pretty high ratio.  It's not ideal, but it's what we can afford.  And so we refer constantly.  Our biggest partner is Department of Employment and Social Services.  You know, referrals out for, you know, whether it's Medi-Cal  or CalWORKs eligibility or general assistance.  We also refer out to private mental health providers.  And these are all people that are in the shelter.  These are the numbers of referrals that have gone out every year.  And so we track all of this data.  And so it just really amazes me that this is the wraparound services to make sure  that our clients are successful.  The next slide demonstrates the average length of stay within the shelter.  And again, this was from July 1 through June 30 of 2020.  And so pre-COVID.  Pre-campfire, we were at an average of 50-ish,  55 length of stay before someone would exit the shelter.  Now, as the campfire hit, we, our average length of stay increased  because there was no housing available, right?  So now you've got it, it was kind of steadily growing.  And then now it's like bam, March, April, May, June.  It's exponential.  And again, it's because there's no output.  There's no permanent housing.  There's no transitional housing.  People are stagnant.  And so it's truly become a bottleneck, if you will.  The next slide is, I'm jumping into demographics.  And I apologize, I didn't put the percentages on the slide.  But I will read them to you.  So of the people that are in our shelter, there are 64% report  that they have a disability and 36% report that they don't.  And the next slide, of the folks that have a disability, you know,  you can see there that the largest, well, both is physical  and chronic are pretty much hand in hand.  And so when you're looking at success rates of getting people into housing or into employment  or what have you, vocational, if they have, this is the three conditions,  it's called trimorbidity.  The likelihood of someone getting placed into a successful situation of employment  and or housing without assistance is not likely.  Again, the largest group that we serve is between the ages of 26 and 59.  But I can tell you that the majority of our folks, even within that population,  have the chronic, the trimorbidity that I just spoke of.  It looks like assisted living facility within the shelter if you walk through it.  Okay.  The number of wheelchairs, walkers, COPD with their, you know,  the breathing machines, oxygen.  And so the 60 and older population continues to grow.  And again, getting people exited out if they're on social security or disability,  what they're getting from the state isn't even equitable to what they have to pay  in expenses for rent and utilities.  So this next slide is the number of shelter guests placed in housing.  So in 17-18, we had actually placed 312 people into housing.  And that was 33% of our population.  Now, the national lives and homelessness rates, that 10% is being good.  So at 33%, my staff were doing a phenomenal job.  Again, it dropped then.  In 18-19, because of the campfire, to 216 people, which was 20, about 20, 22%.  And then again, now we're at 15% at only 89 people that we've exited into permanent housing.  So we're still at 15%.  That means that we are still above the national average, but we are half of what we used to be able to do.  Again, the inventory of housing is just not there.  So with the 1,500 units coming on board, that's great.  But with the timeline on that, it's not today.  It's not fast enough.  So moving on beyond, I know specifically I was supposed to focus on just emergency sheltering  and what we do at the shelter, but I also wanted to let you know that we have collectively placed 88 people  in transitional housing this last year.  We have placed 53 people.  We have placed 23 people in rapid rehousing and 24 people in permanent supportive housing.  And so we have had to create our own output because there isn't any.  We've had to think outside of the box and be creative.  And I am, you know, truly blessed to work with these fine providers behind me because without them, we wouldn't be successful.  And so looking at initiatives like the safe camping,  like the car camping, like tiny homes, we need it all.  We do.  We need it all and we need it fast.  So with that being said, in summary, pre-COVID, the Torch shelter was at a 1% vacancy rate.  The average length of stay was 150.  And now we're in the midst of COVID.  And when I wrote this, we were at 50% vacancy rate.  We were actually at less now.  We were about 40% vacancy rate.  It's on the rise.  More and more people are checking in every day.  I don't know if it's because of the smoke or what have you.  They're feeling more comfortable coming in because of COVID or whatnot.  I have not asked staff to inventory that.  But as of June 30th, the average length of stay was 214 days.  We are an emergency shelter.  We are only supposed to let people stay 96 months typically.  But obviously, we're not going to kick anyone out.  If they want shelter, we will provide them shelter until we can find them housing.  But we're in this anomaly right now because we don't know what the new face of homelessness is going to look like with COVID.  Right?  We don't know.  And so as we get on to the increase of shelter beds and services, we don't know what the new rate is going to be when we do the pick count in January.  What number are we going to be at?  We don't know.  But I would guarantee we need to plan.  And COVID is not going away, so I can't serve 160 people every night.  And other providers can't serve their max capacity every night.  Because we have the right numbers.  We have to downsize so we can social distance.  Can I ask a quick clarifying question?  Yeah.  Just looking at those vacancy rates, is the vacancy that low because of COVID restrictions?  Or is it because of just lack of access?  So the 50%?  50 now 40% vacancy.  Right.  So initially what happened was we were at capacity when COVID hit.  And we moved very minimal.  About 25 people into Project Roomkey.  And so they went and did their thing.  And so that reduced our numbers.  And then as people were self-exiting, we call that forfeiting services and not returning for service, we were not filling their spot.  Because we needed to drop our numbers.  And so as more and more information comes out from the CDC, we get more educated every single day.  And so what we need to do to protect staff and clients.  And so we held who could come in.  We capped it for a while because we really just needed to control the environment.  And then now we've allowed people are now able to check in.  And we will go up as high as 120.  So we have 42 beds open right now.  Thank you.  So I understood that there was a challenge because someone had to test negative for COVID before they could enter the shelter.  And the.  Testing results were taking a week or longer.  And I understand that we were trying to get some more rapid tests.  What's the progress been on that?  And is that still a barrier?  It definitely is a barrier.  I can tell you that.  I struggle honestly with that recommendation from the CDC.  They're actually saying that we don't do.  We don't require COVID tests.  But first parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler  parler parler parler parler  parler  parler  parler  been exposed and whatnot. And so I just, I'm very careful because if we have an outbreak in the  shelter, that's huge. I'm going to have to put everyone, including myself in a motel room for  two weeks, you know? And so it's, it's this fine line. And then again, you get a, you get a test,  but within the test, if the three days comes back, the results, you could have been exposed  within those three days. So it's just this catch 22, but you're absolutely right. We've been  exploring, I've been working with city staff about trying to figure out ways to do that,  working with public health because thus far, knock on wood, you know, we haven't had any issues  at the shelter since March. So again, I will speak later. Any questions that you may have  with the two proposals?  Thank you.  I'm going to let Susie jump back in and let the other service providers. But again, without these  people behind me, they have my back and I have theirs and we're all in this together. So I  appreciate your time this night.  Thank you for everything that you're doing. That's for all of you.  Thank you, Joy. Next, I'd like to present to you Laura Kutsona.  With a cup of water.  Which most of you probably know, she is the executive director of the Jesus Center,  the Renewal Center, let's see, Sober Sheltering and Transitional Housing.  Okay.  I don't want to.  Okay.  Okay.  parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler  parler  parler  parler  parler  parler  parler  parler  parler  parler !  parler !  parler !  parler  So I'm here to give you a report on what's going on with our move and our  expansion that we now call the Renewal Center. After exhaustively trying to make  the BMX site work, and I will just highlight three areas real quick because  it did come up earlier, the ingress and egress we spent a solid two years on, the  environmental as well as the removal of the current tenant. So after some  exhausting work on those three levels we decided in conjunction with the city  staff that we would move on to look for another site and we spent another nine  months looking for a new site which right at the point of COVID coming to be,  one of our teams said what about the work training center and it was as easy  as picking up the phone, saying to  Dr.  Don, how about selling your property? He said let me check with my board, three  days later we got a yes, we got a price and we entered escrow in three weeks. I  call that a win-win. It's one of the few easy things that this project has ever  experienced. So we're really thrilled to have 6.2 acres under our control. We own  that property today on Fair Street and we're very excited. We think it'll serve  both our needs, the work training center's needs, and of course our community.  So we're excited to be here.  I just want to remind you real quickly, this has become one of my life verses for  this project. It's our signature of why the Jesus Center exists and this is from  John 10 10, because I came to bring life and life abundant. Our belief is that  every human being is created in the image of God and carries the dignity of  God in them and that God in God's infinite wisdom believes that we should  live our best life.  Not just survive. So as we look forward for our next 40 years after just  complete about to complete our 40th year, we're continually asking the question of  what does help look like? That's going to be our best role and contribution to  focus on restoring hope and renewing lives.  One of the things that we have spent a time over the last four years, I was  enjoying parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler  parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler  parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler  parler parler parler parler parler parler parler  parler parler parler parler parler parler  parler parler parler parler parler parler  parler parler parler parler parler parler  parler parler parler parler ! I am so grateful for my team, Joy and I.  parler  parler  a lot of kudos for our work, but we have incredible people behind us. Shelly Watson and Amber  Abney-Bass have worked tirelessly with this community to increase our ability to serve  well. And Shelly, I actually think, is watching with her class because she's in her master's  program tonight, and she introduced this idea of the stages of change. It's an old model  used mostly in recovery. And we began to tease this out. What does this look like to address  people in need in their cycle of change? And we looked at it from the individual's experience,  and we looked at it from the point of view of our community. And honestly, we looked at it in terms  of what is the Jesus Center's contribution in this cycle. And we've been around for four years.  We've shown up and helped in lots of different ways. We've done the very lowest of barrier  entry-level kind of contact, all the way to very successful rehabilitation,  and transitional and permanent housing. We, of course, had a shelter in the middle. So we really  decided, and on the point of moving in the 40th year of our life, where is our focus? And although  this plan is amazing that we are hearing about tonight, we all know that a lot of this has been  in the works. It wasn't just shy of two years ago when we began work to open a low-barrier shelter,  the famous Orange Street Shelter. That was a collaborative project to open a low-barrier  shelter. And we've been doing that for a long time. And we've been doing that for a long time. And we've been  doing that for a long time. And we've been doing that for a long time. And we've been doing that for a long time.  This was right on the cusp of the Torre shelter becoming a low-barrier shelter. Prior to the fire,  we did not have a permanent low-barrier shelter bed. We had some for domestic violence victims,  and of course, we had safe space winter shelter on temporary basis, but not in a bricks-and-mortar,  long-term, open to everybody. So we looked at this rubric, and we began to analyze,  what are we doing, and what are the others doing? And we began to analyze, what are we doing,  and we've seen variations of this, and we just saw one from Joy. And this is essentially a  continuum of care, starting with outreach and going all the way to the permanent housing.  And we took our own inventory and said, okay, who is the best suited to do the different work in  those different areas? And again, I could stay all night and just talk about the improvements  and the growth in our service providers in the last four years since I've been a part of this.  But one of the  biggest contributions, we'll hear from Don later and the HOME program, but Don Taylor's  and the Department of Social Services, Shelby Boston's leadership, to bring continuity and  consistent leadership from the county has made a huge difference in the strength that the rest of  us can bring to bear. This is a pretty simple graphic, but I think it's important that you  understand where we see ourselves today. We think that we're not going to be able to do the same  work as parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler  parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler ! And so we think they're going to be successful, whether it's through this version of the plan or they're just incredible tenacity and hard work.  parler  parler !  parler !  parler !  parler !  This is kind of exciting. We just had our neighborhood meeting for our use permit.  So this is a shout out to RGA and particularly Matt Galloway for his incredible work.  As I mentioned, we've looked at several properties over the last few years in addition to the BMX site.  And what is so stunning about this project and what's so great is that we are able to have a site that encompasses an east side and a west side.  And we're nestled right beneath where the fairgrounds is down at the bottom of the screen.  It'll come up in a minute.  In one of the most historic neighborhoods in our community in what they call the triangle or the wedge.  And they really...  We hope that there's going to be a lot of development in this area.  And we believe we're going to be the beginning of that.  So on that orange parcel up on the right is where the Jesus Center headquarters will be.  This allows us to both develop our own identity as well as be able to be a catalyst for this larger facility.  We're talking about this now in phases.  And Scott...  Huber called me today and asked me about the timeline.  And I'll finish in the end to tell you a little bit more about the timeline.  But the exciting part is we're actually renovating this west side or the east side of the property right here.  And that's our phase one.  And that's where we will have the Sabbath house.  And I'll explain in a moment what that will look like.  And our Jesus Center identity and headquarters.  And then the other side will be our phase two renewal center, medical facilities, and permanent housing.  So what are we going to be doing at the Jesus Center?  It's really important to understand that we have fought long and hard about this.  And we realize that in the wave of increased use of the low barrier method,  if someone is working on their sobriety, their addiction management,  we're trying to maintain that.  And they need a space where that is the norm.  We've gotten affirmation from county and other specialists in this area.  There is absolutely a place for sober sheltering.  And so we're going to continue in that vein.  And we're going to move from 23 beds where we are now to probably between 65 and 70 sober beds,  including men and women.  And it'll be 24-7.  Our daytime program will include far more wraparound case management,  more in-depth information,  more in-depth vocational training,  and of course all the typical amenities of a day program  and our partners in play there as well.  I'll show you the space.  It starts on the left, which is actually north.  So closest, if you will, to 20th Street.  And that'll be our administrative hub.  That's where if you want to come to a meeting, that sort of thing, you'll come in there.  Then we have the men's shelter.  There is a space within the shelter that will be for the sleeping quarters.  And then there will also be outdoor and indoor daytime facility.  This is actually the dining hub.  And this will be our central kitchen on this side of the road.  And as well as that green on the right is for the women's dining.  And then actually there's an orange parcel at the top that's for the men's dining.  And then the women's shelter, which includes daytime space.  And then the perimeter.  And then the perimeter is all the shelter suites like we have in Sabbath House now,  which are between four and six beds.  And this is all being designed with trauma in mind.  Trauma-informed care approach is our primary lens  that we're building both the facility and revising and remodeling, if you will, our program model.  Okay.  Yeah.  And that just shows you the outdoor space.  If you're wondering where Mulberry is on this, Mulberry is at the very top.  We still have a buffer to the residential with the parking lot behind.  We won't be building any new structures there.  This will be the renovated facade.  If Shelly were here, she would tell you that we really are focused on how we do what we do.  The needs around us before the fire, because of the fire, and now because of the pandemic.  And I'm sure you've heard this before.  The economic downturn have moved us to sharpen this model.  After much study and research on Shelly's recommendation,  we will be using this trauma-informed strength-based approach to help people live their best life.  Each person will work with a staff member to develop a plan for personal improvement,  and it will be focused on independent living and permanent housing.  We will offer one-on-one relationships with mentors, providing the encouragement needed,  because most of the folks who come in are...  deeply depleted in the hope arena, and you can't program that away.  That's relational.  Life skill development will be offered in concert with what we've been doing now.  Mental health and addiction services will be on site.  And of course, as a faith-based organization, we will continue to offer Bible studies and spiritual growth programs.  We'll have service learning and skill development for each person to discover their strengths and build a life of purpose.  Many have asked, how will someone actually enter this shelter?  And of course, we always rely on self-referral, our partners in the county, and other providers.  Some will find that this is a good place to come after landing on their feet and stabilizing in a low-barrier shelter,  or a campsite, and others may be referred here by another case worker.  We also have found that there are some who just don't survive in a large congregate shelter.  We also have found that there are some who just don't survive in a large congregate shelter.  And we couldn't be a community without the Torre Shelter's complement of shelter beds.  But we also recognize, and I think Susie referenced this, that people really need that dignified private space,  or at least semi-private space.  And so we're really, again, speaking in trauma, on the trauma approach, really trying to engage that.  I also want to just mention that many people see the Jesus  Center really as just a food provider.  And we indeed have a long history of feeding those in need.  And we've designed our new facility with this in mind,  and in keeping with our ever-changing landscape, our distribution of food will change.  In concert with the changes we are hearing about tonight,  particularly in the expansion of full-service low-barrier sheltering 24-7,  with services and case management, we have offered to partner with the city,  Safe Space,  Winter Shelter,  the Torre Shelter,  and the county to contract for food provision in these new locations.  Just as we have successfully done during Project Roomkey,  where even today we provided 600 meals, including our own to-go meals at the center.  We are also hopeful that as our city takes up a stronger role in outreach,  that we would be selected to partner on food provision for that as well.  So as we move to the other side of the street, I want to just mention that,  again, I think you all are aware of the renewal center's vision.  It has morphed particularly since when it began in 27,  when Mark Orme graciously offered the purchase of the BMX site.  We had imagined a very large low-barrier shelter there.  And again, with the growth of our colleagues doing that in various places,  we looked around and said, we don't think our system needs more low-barrier beds.  They've got that already in the queue.  Not to say there's not going to be low-barrier beds,  but it won't be that large shelter that was originally envisioned.  But we will build a multi-agency campus concept,  and we think this Fair Street environment is a great place for that.  It allows for the co-location of programming,  so that our shared participants can experience  and access several critical services at once,  and allow those providers to fill gaps currently under-addressed.  We really are focusing on this triad of mental health,  addiction management and recovery, and trauma recovery.  And we really think that that's the basis of not only our current folks  who are experiencing homelessness,  the folks we are seeing from the campfire through our disaster case management,  but also those who are going to be suffering as a result of the crisis.  And we're also focusing on the pandemic's economic impact.  I might add that we are still solidifying our final list of partners,  but I will share with you who we're talking to now.  We have the support of many folks,  but now we're really looking at who's going to take up and join us on this property.  And right now we are continuing our conversations with the County of Butte,  Elijah House and their partner,  Sierra Health and Wellness,  Jamboree Housing Corporation,  Enloe Medical Center,  Butte County Office of Ed,  Butte County 211.  And then we are also working on the shelter with the Back to Work program,  which is a collaborative of three or four different agencies,  ourselves over there,  Nation's Finest,  formerly known as Veterans Resource Center,  and Enloe for Medical Rescue.  The main building,  you can see this now on the orange there,  is the main building on that side.  And,  thanks to the amazing Matt Galloway,  it's going to appear.  This is the downstairs.  That group of little graphics in the middle is the dining room.  The kitchen is adjacent,  a small medical clinic,  the interior shared space.  This lower part,  which is about 7,000 square feet,  is still open right now,  and there's conversations going on in terms of what we'll be putting there.  The second floor is the, !  is,  again,  the other providers we're working with are looking for alternatives to large-scale sheltering.  So we're really playing with what that model is going to be on the upstairs.  It may be more micro units,  or what you might see in a dormitory where you have a centralized space around which you have five individual doors.  But we imagine the capacity up here to be an additional 50 beds to the 45,  to join with the 45 to 60 family beds.  That is a rendering of it,  what it might look like.  And then that's just an up-close and personal.  Going back to the main floor plan of the,  or the site plan,  I want to mention that it's phase two.  Here's the renewal center.  And phase three is a full-service health service department.  Our partner Elijah House,  I believe left a comment for you in Engage Chico.  They are imagining and building a plan to develop a full-scale facility.  This will include outpatient substance use programming, medical detox bed for both adults and adolescents,  and mild to moderate mental health provision to complement what is happening at the county level.  We've had an amazing amount of work over the last three years on medical care for the homeless,  out of which came the mobile medical unit.  That is a collaboration with the Butte Countywide Homeless Continuum of Care,  as well as Ample Health and all of our providers who are hosting that mobile medical,  as well as the hotel program.  We are absolutely struggling to pilot this program in the time of COVID.  But we are doing our best as our partners at Ample to make this work so we can really test this.  We have had an incredible ongoing advisory team that is working with Elijah House  to make sure that this is the right work that we're doing here,  working with our managed health providers, Ample, Public Health, Mangrove Medical, Behavioral Health,  Enloe Medical Center, alongside the team at Elijah House.  They're actually building a facility very similar to the one they want to build here in Clear Lake right now.  So we're letting them guinea pig out there, and then we'll take their learnings and bring them here.  The final phase, and I don't know if it will be in this order,  but there's actually a one-acre parcel that's already set apart,  and we have this on reserve for a permanent housing structure,  probably SROs, single resident occupancies.  And we have been in conversation with Jamboree,  as you know, Jamboree has already successfully done their due diligence to obtain the disaster tax credits.  43 Section 8 project vouchers,  and they've won the favor of the city staff.  We've been over backwards to work with them on our Park Avenue property.  I think you all remember that this was my dream,  that we would sell the Park Avenue property to permanent housing to do our part,  and this is another piece of that permanent housing.  So I think that's a great opportunity.  Finally, the timeline.  We are in renovation.  We're walking the site on Thursday to look at the furniture.  The work training center is left,  and we're working on our final approvals with the city,  so we can begin renovation in October of our new headquarters and move by March of 21.  Jamboree will be beginning their build in March of 21 on Park Avenue.  So that's a great opportunity.  That's our little kick in the backside,  because when that building comes down,  we won't have a place to be,  and we'll begin probably late spring the renewal center build,  and open at the end of December.  So that's your update.  My question, I could,  would be just trying to keep the puzzle pieces straight.  Is any of the...  Is any of the proposals in front of us,  two million plus,  going to assist this project?  Or is this a scandal?  Are you asking me or are you asking him?  Well, you would know if the money's coming to you.  No, it is not.  We're privately, still privately funding this project.  So when there's talk about a permanent navigation center,  that's not you, that's something different?  Correct.  Great, thank you.  Thanks, sir.  It's all very exciting.  Thank you.  Next, I'd like to introduce Deanna Schwab.  She is the board president for Safe Space Winter Shelter.  And she does not have a presentation, so we'll just...  Okay, good evening.  Thank you for having me here.  I have good news and bad news.  The good news is, would you each please stand up  and do a happy dance or something just to get the blood moving?  I'm just getting a little weary sitting.  Anybody else want to join me?  Really?  Really?  Come on.  Come on, admit it.  Okay.  Thank you.  The bad news is, I am your PowerPoint presentation.  Safe Space Winter Shelter.  Thank you for the presentation from Joy and from Laura as well.  I was thinking that you may be having the same questions  that a lot of the people who may be viewing tonight are having.  We're talking about shelter beds,  for the Torres Shelter, for the Jesus Center,  and for the New Navigation Center.  And maybe you're asking, why do we need three shelters?  Isn't that overkill for Chico?  And I thought, no.  Well, why do we have Big Al's?  And why do we have Burgers and Brew?  And why do we have Fifth Street Steakhouse?  They all do the same thing.  They're all restaurants.  You start by getting hungry and going someplace for food.  And you end when you leave with a full stomach full of food.  They're the same, right?  Well, except what happens in the middle is not the same.  The dining experience, the menu options, all sorts of things.  So what I'm saying is, yes, we're looking at three shelter operations  for emergency sheltering, but they're all different.  We all have the same entry point.  We want the best for our guests.  We're welcoming.  Come as you are.  The outcome is, let's find a place where you can thrive and succeed.  And how we get there may be different.  And that's okay.  Because we all need a little flavor in our life.  Safe Space is, for the past seven years, has operated a nomadic, temporary winter shelter  during the coldest, wettest months of the year.  Being low barrier means that we invite guests to come as you are,  but not do as you please.  We ask that their behavior is what admits them into the shelter  and what keeps them there.  We welcome guests who may have pets, who they consider their family.  We also allow partners to stay together.  And probably one of the other biggest issues is that we have a robust property,  personal property storage program.  Because as you know, a lot of our homeless people come with a lot of money.  And a lot of stuff.  We save lives.  We reduce visits to the emergency rooms and jails.  And we provide a platform of stability and dignity where guests can literally catch their breath.  So that they can make better choices.  Guests say things to us like,  you know, after four or five nights of good sleep,  I don't hear the voices anymore.  Or a guest may say,  you know, since coming to Safe Space,  this is the first time I've felt like not everybody hates me.  Now don't get me wrong, we did not create this wheel.  We were modeled after the Housing First principles that Lloyd Pendleton spoke to us about four years ago.  We also modeled after the Interfaith rotating winter shelter in Davis,  which has been operational for 20 years.  And our current model is based on the Interfaith Works program out of Olympia, Washington.  We didn't get here by ourselves.  We're not here acting as a solo vacuum.  We don't operate in a vacuum.  We've had a lot of help.  For the first five years of Safe Space,  Safe Space's history,  we were a program of the CHAT,  Chico Housing Action Team.  We've collaborated with the Torres Shelter in terms of intake procedures,  shared guests,  and policies and procedures.  We've worked with the Jesus Center when we shared intake space  between the Jesus Center property and Calvary Community Church,  dealing with neighborhood issues and how to be a good neighbor,  and how to be respectful of neighborhoods as well as implementing our programs.  For five years, we operated as a program of CHAT.  In September of 2018,  we separated from them and formed our own 501 .  Two months later,  the Camp Fire disaster became a reality.  During that time,  we have become an integral and I hope important partner with the Butte County COC.  It's very interesting what disaster will do to organizations.  First, we had the Oroville Dam spillway disaster.  Then we had the Camp Fire.  And as I like to describe the COC,  no offense,  previously,  the COC kind of operated like this.  You know, kind of everybody kind of,  you know, doing their, you know,  but after two, let's see, two disasters,  plus COVID, plus the new fire,  we've gotten to be very good.  And now I describe the COC instead of being this, like this.  The growth of that organization has been absolutely phenomenal.  It is a very robust organization of service providers  and government agencies and entities,  all with the shared idea of ending homelessness.  So I hope you'll take advantage of this homeless solutions plan  because there have been some giants in our communities  that have taken the time and their talents to put this together.  Currently,  Safe Space has spent the last six months  as the operational part of Project Roomkey.  You may recall that on March 19th,  Governor Newsom declared a statewide shelter in place mandate due to COVID-19.  Along with that, he also mandated Project Roomkey  with the understanding that how do you shelter in place  when you have no shelter to go to?  And that's what we're doing.  Two weeks later,  Butte County Continuum of Care implemented a countywide system of collaboration,  and it was all hands on deck.  We had FEMA from the federal government,  we had the state government,  we had the county government,  and everything in between.  Project Roomkey accepted their first guests,  and they were able to get us into Chico downtown motels about a week later.  For those of you that don't know,  FEMA requirements for getting into the hotels are this.  You must be 65 years or older,  and or any age with chronic disabilities.  Heart disease, respiratory disease, diabetes, or cancer.  So you can imagine that people who were formerly on the service,  on the streets,  now had an opportunity to be isolated in a single hotel room,  sheltered 24-7,  three meals a day,  showers,  bathrooms,  probably TVs,  24-7 monitoring,  and case management.  Talk about housing first.  That is the ultimate housing first.  And the results have been outstanding.  Over the past five months,  there have been 353 FEMA qualified unique individuals.  The motels average around 150 guests between the three hotels,  and most remarkably of all,  we've had 46 of those previously homeless,  chronically vulnerable individuals  exited either into permanent supportive housing  or transitional housing.  Just to give you an idea of their vulnerability as well,  in that five months,  we've also had five of those guests who have passed away.  Our future plans are to collaborate with,  True North Housing Alliance,  to open a 24-7 navigation center.  Now this may be a new idea to you,  but this is not a new idea to Safe Space.  Since year one,  at the end of every season,  we've said,  this is craziness.  We have just stabilized these people.  We've only been with them for 14 hours every day for 12 weeks,  but we can already see that there have been dramatic changes  in their stability,  their decision making,  their social skills,  not to mention that several we could already see were ready for that next step.  And we kept saying,  what comes next?  What comes next?  We can't just continue putting these people back out on the street.  This doesn't make any sense.  So since at that time,  we were part of the Chico Housing Action Team,  being the proactive people that they are,  started their master lease program.  And I applaud them for that.  And that's how that came to be.  I'm kind of looking forward to the two-week process  that I think should be coming up.  I hope it's coming up.  When we have an opportunity for the public to comment on  what we're doing here about the homeless opportunities plan.  And I know that one of the things that they and you are interested in  is obviously the cost.  Because everybody says it costs too much.  It costs too much.  These numbers are outrageous.  Well, I say it costs too much,  but compared to what?  Our community is already paying the cost  in the form of additional policing,  unreimbursed trips to the ER,  and nights in the county jail.  For example,  according to a local source from Enloe Hospital,  homeless patients presenting themselves at Enloe  have more than doubled in four years.  Conservative estimates put annual loss to Enloe  from serving the homeless population  at a minimum of $15 million annually.  And could easily approach double that  when all factors are taken into consideration.  Mr. Orme, if you don't already have information  from the police department about what the cost of  the  the cost of the  the additional policing and, you know,  do they have a category that we could possibly gain information  from them about what does it cost the police department  to handle dealing with the homeless people,  either in terms of additional hours,  in terms of additional manpower?  I would really, really like to know that information,  and I think the public would like to know it as well.  So we can really compare what is the cost.  It's cost of policing.  It's cost of hospitalizations.  And then secondly,  if you could get that same information  from the Butte County Jail,  because we know a lot of the people  that we deal with do end up in jail  simply because they have no place else to go.  Could you do that?  You'll work on it?  Okay, great. Thank you so much.  So what I'm asking you to do today is to rethink  your approach about the Homeless Solutions Plan.  Homelessness is not just a housing crisis.  It's also an urgent public health crisis.  So let's think of things in terms of system-wide plans.  We have an education plan that's system-wide,  and it goes from Head Start all the way to PhDs.  We have an education system  that is system-wide.  Oops.  We also have a medical system  that is system-wide  that goes from walk-in clinics to Mayo Clinic,  and it involves everything from the federal  to the state to the county and to the city.  So why can't we approach homelessness the same way?  Lastly, I think these opportunities  that have been presented to you are very, very, very exciting.  I think it's a rare opportunity for us to make an impact  on the city that we all love.  And I'd just like to invite you to join us.  Let's get to work and make Chico the city  we know that it can be and should be.  And let's not let perfect get in the way of good.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I have a couple questions.  Not many.  You mentioned working with the navigation center.  There's two different references.  Is this the temporary navigation center?  Yes, this is the temporary five months  with the possible renewal at least for seven months.  Yes, sir.  That was another question.  Thank you.  And I'm just trying to keep the puzzle straight.  Yeah.  You and me both.  In the Roomkey program and the other things you're doing,  my imagination is that you're going to be working  with the city that you're accessing volunteers  that you don't have a dozen.  No.  Those are people who had previously worked  in safe space as volunteers.  But because of the money that came from the federal government  to the state government to the county,  those people are paid staff.  And we have three shelter operations people  and 16 additional paid staff in the form of monitors  and case managers.  Does that...  What happens to that one?  What happens to that one when Roomkey goes away?  That's a really good question.  In an ideal world, we would love to have Project Roomkey  and have a navigation center open for them to go to.  Does that make sense?  And if they were to move to the navigation center,  who's their employer?  No.  That would be Safe Space and True North's collaboration partner.  I can try and chime in.  You, please.  I'd also like to ask a follow-up question  to Councilmember Ory's question.  I feel like I had heard that there's funding  and resources available in...  that the county is operating, housing every single one  of those people in Project Roomkey.  Is that not accurate?  I would actually address that question to Dawn.  Taylor is in the audience.  Okay.  Because my understanding is that people wouldn't be moving  from Project Roomkey  into a shelter environment that they actually...  there is our plans to move these people into long-term housing.  Right.  Well, there's multifaceted questions and things happening here.  So, Carl, with your point...  Sorry, Mr. Ory.  That the contracted staff that Dan is referring to  have been previously their volunteers or staff of Safe Space,  but they're actually contracted staff under True North Housing Alliance.  Right.  And we are contracted with the county to funnel the funds to pay them.  And so that's how that is actually funneling through.  True North will get into a lot more detail, but that helps.  Thank you.  I'm sure you will with Dawn's presentation.  I don't know what he's going to be speaking on tonight.  But, and then as far as...  You probably ought to stand up to the mic.  I'm sorry.  As far as the navigation center that you were referencing, again,  so...  True North Housing Alliance has worked with...  As the fiduciary for Safe Space and acquisition...  Acquisitioning funding from HEAP funds,  which came down probably a year and a half ago.  That's just been sitting because we've been waiting for a spot.  And then True North also acquired emergency shelter dollars  specifically for Safe Space to use.  To expand shelter beds and capacity.  And whether that's either increased number of shelter beds  or whether it's an increased duration of sheltering,  whether it's like 50 at a time.  And so, and then Vice Mayor Brown,  as far as your question about exiting from Project Roomkey,  I will let Dawn Taylor talk about that.  And then if you have any other further questions,  but I just wanted to interject and clarify the role of True North Housing Alliance.  With Safe Space, contracted staff, et cetera.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Ms. Cochins, could we take a 10-minute break?  Yes, please.  Okay.  Thank you. !  parler parler  parler  parler  parler  parler  parler  parler  parler  parler  parler  parler  parler  parler  parler  parler !  parler  parler  parler  parler  parler  parler  parler !  parler  Thank you. I'd like to introduce you to Leslie Johnson, director of the Chico Housing Action Team CHAT.  Thank you.  Hi, everybody. Thanks for having us. Thanks for doing this great plan.  I'm Leslie Johnson. I'm one of the founders of CHAT, and I'm the executive director at present.  We're a housing provider that creates housing opportunities for people who have been homeless.  And I guess that's what I would emphasize. If you just knew one thing about CHAT, we do housing.  So the way we see it is once people have come into a shelter situation or a campground or navigation center,  they can get a lot of help and support and services, but there has to be some housing out there.  And we have to be able to get them out there at the other end to keep them flowing through.  So CHAT sees our role as continuing to do housing and create housing.  We primarily do this through master leasing. We rent houses for the most part,  and we just then sublet the house or sublet individual bedrooms to individuals who are homeless.  And we started renting our first four-bedroom house in 2014.  And we started subletting individual bedrooms to people we had gotten to know during Safe Space  who had some income and we felt, well, they can afford to rent a bedroom. Let's give it a try.  The next year, we rented one more. So the first one was the CHAT house.  Then we had to call the second one CHAT 2 because now there's more than one.  Then we started building some momentum. I'm signing a lease tomorrow for CHAT 51.  So we have a lot of houses scattered throughout Chico. Houses, apartments, trailers.  All sorts of things. And we try to make them all affordable.  So people are paying maybe $500, $550, something like that.  And maybe they just rent a bedroom, but at least they have a little place that they can afford  and have that dignity of being a renter like anybody else.  They don't have much money, but they can pay that rent and have that little private bedroom.  We don't put people together in a bedroom. They have their own bedroom.  Unless they, you know, want to be, it's a couple or something,  but they can't afford to rent a bedroom.  So it's a surprisingly simple approach really, but we've been able to,  we're housing around 170 people right now who were formerly homeless.  I say around 170 because we don't even know how many we have. It changes so fast.  I think yesterday we moved in a family of seven into a house.  So initially all of our case management, our bookkeeping, our everything,  was all done by volunteers.  We were a completely unfunded volunteer-run community-based group.  We got together to try to find solutions to homelessness.  We have right now a staff of 11 people.  We have a housing program for Chico State students.  We have a program for people with mental illness, a program for campfire survivors,  and we do have our family housing program.  And we're just starting a veterans housing program.  That's the lease I'm going to sign tomorrow.  So, um,  most of these people do cover their own rent.  We do have some rental subsidies for some of these programs.  One of the houses for people with mental illness that has five beds is supported  by a CDBG grant through the City of Chico, which we gratefully acknowledge.  So, right now one of the main projects we're working on is Everhart Village.  That is something that we're working on.  That is something we're developing with the county, behavioral health, because a lot of people who are living outdoors that are behavioral health clients lose their medicine.  They have their stuff stolen.  They get assaulted because they are vulnerable.  They don't get enough sleep, so then they don't get to their appointments.  They just can't maintain their treatment plans with behavioral health.  So, we feel this will be a huge help to them and will help behavioral health work successfully.  That will be an emergency shelter located right near behavioral health services.  You probably have heard about this Everhart Village project.  CHAT's goal and purpose is to ensure that everyone in our community has access to housing that they can personally afford.  We are real excited about this project planning that's being done by the City Homeless Coordinator right now, because it is such a comprehensive approach.  CHAT wants to continue developing more housing projects.  We are looking into possibly purchasing a motel that we would be able to turn the units into studios, SROs, that people could afford to rent.  We're also looking into building apartments.  So, those are things we're exploring.  We want to keep finding ways to increase the housing opportunities for people in our community.  We are eager to see the campground project happen. We are eager to see the campground project happen in particular. And we note that nobody has stepped up to do that. It was suggested that maybe CHAT could do that. We would love to. However, because we're focusing on creating transitional permanent housing, our board's determined that's not something we're going to take on. However, because we're focusing on creating transitional permanent housing, our board's determined that's not something we're going to take on. We have been meeting with a group and trying to help create a cohesive organization that has already been meeting for several weeks.  think that it's going to come together and be able to take on the operation of a project like this  if needed. The organization is called Coast Coordinated Outdoor Assistance and Shelter Team.  It's being creative for the sole purpose really of operating a campground and bringing people who  are presently camping outdoors without any clear path for reintegrating into society, bringing them  to a campground where they have intensive case management services. So the organization has  taken already a number of steps in preparation for taking a leadership role in operating such  a campground, starting with researching many other campgrounds and similar projects being used in  other areas. We have a lot of work that we've done on that, seeking and securing a fiscal sponsor,  which we have done. We have an agency that's willing to be a fiscal sponsor until this  organization is able to create  a campground.  A non-profit and get its own tax-exempt status. We have secured an attorney who would help work on  that non-profit, developing the non-profit structure for the organization.  And we have been working, as I said, we've had a series of meetings to build a cohesive team with  a shared understanding and vision. We have created a board. We have a board of eight people.  We've been working on a detailed campground plan and we've done some intensive work on a budget.  And the next steps we see where we, I should say, not we chat, but Coast, presently developing a plan  for doing a survey of people who are presently camping in our parks to see what they feel they  need. Because as other people have pointed out, we need to find out what the people want because if  they don't like it, they're not going to come and we'll all be very disappointed that we put in a  whole lot of money to something that people might not like. We want to find out what it is that they  want and they need and they see that it's a good thing. And we're going to be working on that.  And we're going to be working on something that would make them want to come to this campsite and  then be willing to work with case managers and receive services.  The next steps, also creating a nonprofit, getting that in place, filing articles of incorporation  and the bylaws. It's been challenging to develop completely the plan that we're talking about because  we haven't even known for sure the location. We're certainly interested in the BMX property, but we  realize that still up in the air.  We're looking at the idea of 85 sites because that's a number that we were told.  That's a lot.  That's really big.  It would probably have to be sort of in pods or sections.  Once we know the location, we would just continue developing this plan,  and we would be hiring a director.  So those are the next steps.  The organization is moving forward and wants to be available to take this on,  and they're not.  I think that's enough.  I just wanted to let you know that's being worked on and prepared,  and we do think that campground is a crucial piece of all this  because for people that have been outside,  there might be a lot of reasons why that's comfortable for them,  and it might be a more general transition to come to a campground  and then.  And have an organized, managed facility with a lot of services provided  and case management and opportunity to feel settled and safe  and have services available to them.  I mean physical services as well as social services,  to have bathrooms, laundry, showers,  and to be able, as other people have talked about,  to feel settled and relax and catch their breath,  get their sleep and be able to think more clearly  and hopefully be ready.  And I think that's something that we're still waiting for people  to get ready to move forward and improving their lives  and getting housing.  So that's all I have.  Thank you.  Thanks.  Thank you, Leslie.  And I'd like to call up Don Taylor from Butte County DES and Home Program.  Sorry.  It's still on.  It's still on.  Maybe.  Maybe that.  Okay.  All right.  Good evening.  Mayor Schwab, Vice Mayor Brown, council members, and city staff.  Don Taylor with the Butte County Department of Employment and Social Services.  I'm the homeless and housing coordinator.  And I thank you for the opportunity to present, provide some information.  I'd like to begin with just some real brief introductory information on our department.  There are four operational branches.  The administrative branch is really the business end.  This is the fiscal support, human resources,  payroll, disaster response, information systems, services.  You might be familiar with some of the services to adult services,  children's services.  That's the child welfare system.  That is our adult protective services, public guardian.  Employment eligibility.  Most people are familiar with that in the form of what you might call  kind of the mainstream benefits that are offered.  You know, cash aid through CalWORKs,  through general assistance,  medical insurance through Medi-Cal,  food stamps through the CalFresh program.  Also our veterans services office is located within one of the employment centers,  the one here in Chico.  Okay.  The fourth branch of Department of Employment Social Services is the housing and homeless.  That's the branch that I operate.  And it's a relatively new branch.  The Board of Supervisors authorized it in August of 2019.  I was hired on in October of 2019.  And we got our team put together and all hired in February of 2020.  So, you know, we're relatively young as far as a branch in this agency.  As we got together in February of 2020,  pandemic came along and the county along with the state and our countries  went into pandemic response.  So since March of 2020, we have been knee deep in project development.  We've been working with the county and the county's public health department  to really get the project room key and providing care and shelter for some of our most vulnerable folks  that are here in the county.  And have really welcomed the opportunity to work with several of the service providers.  We've been basically administrative in support.  We put together the contracts with all the service providers.  I try to obtain funding to keep this thing going.  And we have really enjoyed our opportunity to make that collaboration more county wide  and really get people working together, open up those lines of communication.  The objectives of our housing and homeless team.  We've got several. I'll just hit upon a couple of key ones right here.  It's really to enhance the communication between county departments.  You know, we've got multiple county departments that are involved in housing  or involved in homeless in some way or another.  So we've got, you know, development services. We have general services.  Our department, behavioral health, public health, county administration.  So one of the keys was for us to bring in communication internally  and then take that communication out to the community.  So we've got, you know, a chain of command, kind of a line of communication  going out to our partners in the community.  So internal and external communication.  And also was to position our county and our department to be more efficient  in securing funding for housing projects and for homeless projects as well.  And when I mention housing, it's more along the lines of affordable housing.  Working with the county.  Working with our affordable housing developers.  And really the third kind of main goal or objective of what our team was put together to do  was to really support our continuum of care.  That local planning body for, you know, homeless services.  And so I'd like to say that the county has assumed several roles within the COC.  It is COC support that we provide. It is not a county operated COC.  You know, I'd like to be really clear about the fact that we do support the COC and its endeavors.  And for the most part, we provide administrative support.  Okay, you'll see several of the roles listed up here that the county has assumed.  These are roles that are designated by HUD and are required.  Multiple things are required.  And one of the reasons why the county became more and more involved with our continuum of care  was because there was this layering of additional administrative obligations, duties, requirements  required by law, layered on by HUD, layered on by our state as well.  The state of California put a lot more requirements in place for data to be collected.  For data to be analyzed, interpreted. For performance outcomes to be tracked.  And so with no money going to administrative support for the COC, and with the county staff expertise,  very similar to city staff that have expertise in managing grants,  it seemed natural to bring the county in as a partner with the COC to provide this ability to do the data management,  data collection, data reporting, monitoring of the contracts, and the fiscal management of the grants that are coming in.  And along with some of the tasks that my team's working on,  and my team specifically does, is put out grant applications.  Many of the grants that come through are pretty technically challenging.  And it takes quite a bit of preparation, quite a bit of shabby to get through the regulations  to make sure that you've got all your T's crossed and all your I's dotted,  to make sure that you can secure those funds.  The reason is, is often these grants are very, very competitive.  And so we've got to make sure that we've got our best foot forward in order to bring those funds into our region.  Much of the work that we do is in securing the grants initially,  in the name of the COC or in the name of the county.  And then what we do is we'll put out requests for proposals.  We'll have the agencies, the organizations, our community-based providers,  put in applications, proposals for grant dollars.  We'll award those grant dollars.  And when I say we award those grant dollars, it's not the county that's the decision-making entity.  In much of the funding that we are obtaining,  it is the COC Council that is actually the decision-making entity.  And that's something to remember.  You know, it's not the county saying, hey, we'd like this to happen.  We provide the administrative leadership in putting forward for those proposals,  rating, ranking them, providing that information to the council, and letting the council vote.  We also provide administrative support in the contracts that we put in afterward.  Once those programs have been awarded, we need to put the contracts in place.  Because the county is functioning as the administrative entity.  We have a contract typically with the state or with the federal government to bring those dollars in,  and then we contract it out.  You know, there's a significant amount of monitoring, you know,  and reporting back to the funding source that has provided those funds for whatever programs that are put into operation.  So monitoring can occur. It's often on a quarterly basis.  It can occur more often if we're noticing that one of our partners is having a hard time.  And we can try to bring in some technical assistance.  We can bring in some expertise to help them out.  Reporting really depends upon the source of funds.  Some of the reporting is done on a monthly basis.  Others is done on a quarterly, semiannual, annual, and there's often a final report done at the end of the funding cycle.  So those are some of the things that our team does.  And really, this is bigger than any one department or agency when we're talking about providing services,  you know, and trying to solve homelessness, you know, within our region.  You know, one agency is not going to do it.  One department's not going to do it.  One community partner is not going to do it.  It really takes all of us working together to make this happen.  Jurisdictions, the county, the private, the public.  And what I'd like to do in the interest of time, I'm just trying to move through here because I know we're running late this evening.  What I'd like to do is present a couple of the programs that were already in place at DES.  These aren't ones that necessarily the home team operates, but we communicate with and we collaborate with.  But it's to give you an idea of a couple of the programs that are existing.  We have a CalWORKs Housing Support Program, a Homeless Assistance Program, a Housing and Disability Advocacy Program,  Home Safe Adult Protective Services Program, and then most recently we have propped up the Bringing Families Home Program.  And I'm not going to read through the PowerPoints.  I know that's irritating for most folks.  I have somebody come here and speak to the words.  But you can take a look at the types of services that are provided.  In our HSP program, it's basically for those who are CalWORKs eligible and they're virtually homeless.  You know, they are on the streets.  They're in a place not meant for human habitation.  And this brings services and funding to assist them and to get into either emergency shelter or into housing.  Our CalWORKs Homeless Assistance Program is very similar.  One of the main differences there is the fact that we have people that may be presumptively eligible for CalWORKs services.  So this gives us a leg up on getting the funds or the resources to them in a quicker manner.  Because we're assuming they're going to be eligible.  So we can give them some more immediate assistance here.  The Housing and Disability Advocacy Program is a wonderful program that focuses on housing support and advocacy for getting disabled folks benefits.  This program works with individuals.  Who don't have any disability benefits but are disabled.  I mean, they may be eligible for SSI.  SDI.  They may be eligible for Veterans Disability.  So the whole point is to get them these benefits so that way they can afford to get into somewhere.  They can receive, you know, housing.  And we currently have one HDAP case manager and we've got plans to put in a second.  This was originally a three-year pilot program.  Conducted by the California Department of Health.  And the California Department of Social Services.  And has now become an allocation.  And we are putting forth an application to request for our allocation.  And then some additional funds as well.  Because we think we have enough need here within the community to support two case managers full time.  Doing this type of work.  The Home Safe Adult Protective Services Program is for our either homeless or at risk of homeless clients.  Clients who are in the Adult Protective Services System.  And it provides a number of services.  The legal help.  Financial help.  Part of the goal here is to keep them from becoming homeless.  So there is a prevention.  And one of the interventions is homeless prevention.  Bringing family home.  That's one of our newer programs.  And it's really established to provide housing for those families that are homeless.  That have had their.  Children detained by the child welfare system.  And it's an effort to bring reunification back to that family.  Let's get them into housing.  Let's get these families back together.  In the long term that's what's going to work best for our community.  Get these people propped up and back on their feet.  I've got a couple numbers here.  For anyone who has interest in any of the programs I had mentioned.  Here's our contact information.  These are the employment centers.  In Bolchico.  In Orville.  There's a home team number.  For my team specifically.  If you need to reach us.  And with that I'll take any questions you may have.  Thank you.  I was wondering if you could reference the question I had previously asked.  Project Room Key.  The folks that are in that program.  Is there another program that is funded through the county.  That is working to get those folks into housing.  From those hotel rooms.  To those programs.  The answer is yes and no.  Okay.  The simple answer is we do not have another program in place.  We're not getting funding to specifically get those people housed.  However, what we have done is we've taken some technical assistance from the state of California.  Through some of their TA providers.  We're propping open.  Or propping up.  We're in our fifth week now.  We're putting together a COVID rehousing team.  And what we're doing is we're taking some models that have been shown to work.  Where you put together teams.  An assessment team.  It's a group of individuals that are working on those individuals in Project Room Key to assess where they're at.  Where's their housing readiness?  Do they have resources?  Do they have a source of income?  Do they have credit scores that are good?  Bad?  Do they have evictions on their record?  So we have a team assessing the readiness of someone to go into a place.  We have a team assessing what units are available.  It's a housing locating team.  And so they're cold calling landlords.  They're touching base with the individuals that we have already fostered relationships with.  To try to see how many units are available.  Coming up with a list of those units.  We have another team that's the move-in team.  They're trying to secure beds, linens, kitchen supplies, couches, tables.  Whatever it is that people may need to move in.  We have another team that does housing navigation.  That are coordinating the efforts of these ones.  And we've got our planning team that puts it all together.  So the idea is you've got very specific tasks for groups of teams.  To work together to put these people into houses.  To assist them getting in.  So that's being done by all volunteers.  We've got nothing but volunteers working on that.  But we just put the system into place.  And that's part of what our team does.  We look at systems.  We look at models.  And see how do we best provide resources and leverage what's existing.  When there are no resources.  So that's how that's working.  Now to answer your question when I said yes and no.  We do have some money available.  We have a small pot of money.  We have a small pot of money that came through our California emergency solutions for housing grant.  2018.  Which is specifically for rental subsidies.  So we very quickly put together the ability for the county to put money out for first last deposit.  To do some landlord mitigation.  We can also provide some of the money for funding up to 12 months.  Up to 24 months.  Depending upon the individual's needs.  So we have ways.  And it's a smaller pot of money.  But we're putting that into play as well.  So it's money that was existing.  But we had other partners that had other grant funds that were coming up first.  Some of these homeless emergency aid program funds.  There were several pots of money for housing assistance.  And those monies need to be expended by June of 2021.  So we were waiting for those to go.  Then we put these other dollars into place.  That's how we're trying to get some of our project folks.  And some of our project room key folks out into housing.  Are we going to get 100% of our project room key people into some form of permanent housing?  Permanent supportive housing?  No, we're not.  We know that.  But we're going to do our darndest to get as many as we possibly can.  And those others.  We've got our other partners working on emergency shelter operations.  And if they can do it safely with the COVID.  Then that's a solution as well.  But we're still getting people off the streets and into emergency shelter.  Some individuals may not be ready.  And they'll tell you they are not ready to get into a new park.  So we have to have multiple options to really meet the people where they're at.  Thank you.  I appreciate that.  So Mr. Taylor.  We're getting comments from members of the public that why is the city having to spend money for emergency shelters?  Isn't that something that they're asking?  I think that's something that the county or the state is doing.  Or should be doing.  You have a lot of different programs available to house people.  To get people into sheltering.  Why isn't there the assistant from the county to help the city with a campground so that people aren't camping in Bidwell Park?  A shelter so that we can start moving people to more permanent housing?  Okay.  As mentioned previously, our department is working as the administrative entity for several of these grants that are coming down from the state.  So we're not the decision making entity.  We're the fiduciary agent.  So we're holding out of those funds and we can put those funds into play.  For example, the housing, homeless and advocacy program, which is referred to as HAP, are dollars that our team, our home team went after.  We put the application in.  We got the application.  We got the application received and awarded.  And then subsequently we're now putting together the proposals to get that out.  It will be up to our community partners to apply for that.  And for the COC Council to award money to go for those endeavors.  Now one of the things that our team does is, and this is some of the administrative support beyond just the fiduciary part that our team does.  We held a series of public meetings.  We did an online survey.  We did a survey by email.  All related to these HAP funds.  This is what our team put together.  And what we did is there are eligible activities under the HAP funding.  And what we wanted to do was prioritize where are the greatest needs within our community.  And you have to remember when we're talking the COC or we're talking my home team, we're talking county wide.  We're talking regional.  The state is also requesting and asking for people to apply.  And we're asking people to work on a regional basis.  Okay.  But we put together those public meetings.  We put together the surveys.  We put together the email surveys.  We gathered all the data.  We compiled it.  And we took 11 different activities and looked at the data and got it down to three.  And presented that to the COC Council and said, hey, these are three priorities we would like to see used from the HAP funding.  We also took data from our HUD TA individuals who had been here assisting us for the last 12 months.  And had done previous surveys, work groups.  We combined that data with what we had compiled.  And we came up with the same thing.  We're looking for outreach.  We're looking for emergency shelter beds.  And we're looking for navigation centers.  Okay.  So what we did is we take models.  We take data.  We can put it together and then present it, you know, on a platform for the COC to say this is where money can be spent.  There are dollars available.  We're working on getting those requests out.  So we can get the money out.  We're working on getting the money into play.  But is there enough money for all the navigation centers, for all the emergency shelters?  No, there won't be.  Okay.  I'll be frank about that.  There is way more need than what there is coming from the state or the federal government.  You know, earlier I mentioned this has to be a combination of public and private intervention.  You know, so we are going to be needing some private donations.  To come in and join.  Braid that funding with our public dollars as well to make this work.  The thing that we need to do is we need to work and be smart about what we're doing.  You know, we don't need to prop open ten emergency shelters.  You know, we have very specific needs for very specific individuals and we have programs that we know that are going to work.  So we need to prop those up and support those.  I have a question.  I have a question for you.  So one of our recommendations is putting this navigation center together running through True North.  Is the county then committed to coming alongside and putting some of these new positions that you said you're going to have and wrapping your, you know, we're talking about collaborative effort.  If we go forward and do this or if the city goes forward and do, is the county committed to coming in and assisting with whatever resources you can possibly help us with?  Right.  So we are committed to propping open and assisting with the navigation center in the North County and the navigation center in the South County.  Okay.  Thank you.  And so we will be committed to working within navigation centers in both sites.  Okay.  Thank you.  Wasn't there a state program cleverly named and I can't remember it that was replacing Roomkey?  Homekey.  Homekey.  There was a project Homekey.  And that was $600 million that was put out so that entities who were operating Project Roomkey could obtain things such as board and carers, hotels, and then convert them for use for the Project Roomkey posts.  The NOFA came out and our county team along with our housing consultant and along with the executive director of the housing authority and several other individuals, we looked over that NOFA.  We did our due diligence and looking at sites, we talked to multiple owners of hotels.  And we could not in good faith move forward with any of the projects because the timeline that was put forward from the state was so aggressive.  It was very apparent that if you had not already done a lot of your due diligence, if you didn't already have a program that was in the queue, that you were not going to meet the timelines that were required in order to put a project forward.  It was very apparent.  And I applaud the state in putting the money forward in wanting to assist communities in accessing these hotels.  I get it.  I understand.  It's a way of putting additional units into play as soon as you possibly can.  And given the nature of where that money came from because it eventually had come from federal sources which needed to be spent by December 30th.  You may be aware of how county and state.  And city processes work.  For us to close escrow on a property after doing environmentals, after doing all the due diligence, would be quite the challenge to get that done by December 30th.  You know, we explored the options.  And there were just the requirements were too unwieldy.  So no home key dollars will come to Butte County?  No home key dollars will be coming to Butte County.  What's very telling about that, I'll let you know, Councilman Norrie.  Yes, Chair.  In round one of the awards for Project Home Key, out of the 600 million dollars they awarded 76 million.  For something of this nature, 600 million to go towards the ability to purchase hotel rooms, you would suspect that would have been over prescribed.  You would have thought there would have been multiple proposals coming in from every jurisdiction.  But it was such an intense scrutiny and the level of work needed to be done in such a compact period of time.  It was overwhelming and there was no way possible in good faith to put forward a project.  And we did our due diligence.  We spent nights and weekends going through this.  Believe me, we did.  But the fact that there was 600 million and in the first round they awarded 76 tells you  how stringent the process was going to be.  If I heard the numbers right, will there be another round?  There was a round two just announced and I hadn't heard the final figures on that.  Did you apply for any of those?  That timeline has passed.  I'll ask it a different way.  Did you apply for any of those?  We did not apply for any project home key dollars.  And the city could have applied as well.  Was the yes or no question?  The city and the county both could have applied for project home key dollars.  And unrelated, I'm just trying to keep things.  Do you also administer county CDBG and home dollars?  County administration does that.  Our team does not.  Okay.  Thank you.  Any other questions?  Thank you.  Okay.  Thank you all.  Okay.  Thank you.  Okay.  I would like to thank Don and introduce Debbie Villasenor, who is a housing consultant for  Butte County, primarily working on capital development, affordable housing projects.  And she is here virtually.  I'm sorry.  That's okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Then I would like to bring up Doug.  I'm going to pronounce your last name probably wrong.  Gillen.  Okay.  He's a private party that has some very interesting projects.  He's the manager of the !  why don't we build some buildings for the county of Butte.  I originally reacted negatively, said,  Bill, I don't think we have a lot of interest in doing that.  The county's financial position  might be questionable at this time.  Bill Brower, being Bill Brower,  brings Marianne Helps into my office, supervisor,  and she has a long conversation with me,  and I once again graciously decline.  Two weeks later, Marianne shows up in my office and says,  Doug, you're building that building,  there's no more question about it, and that's that.  And that got us into the building business,  building facilities for Butte County.  Today that facility, or that property houses  about 200,000 square feet of facilities, eight buildings,  DC, DESS is in there, DCSS is there,  public health is in there,  and behavioral health is in those buildings.  Fast forward several months ago,  one of our employees comes in, Jennifer's,  and she's telling me about a problem  that we had at the industrial park with some vandalism.  And as I was going on and on, and a mini rampage,  she stopped me and says, Doug,  why don't we look at the hospital  that's up in Paradise as a detox center?  That might be a solution, just like you did years ago,  that might be a solution to a problem.  Maybe we ought to look into that.  As a result of that, we talked to many people  in the community, and there seemed to be some interest  in doing that.  We got ahold of James Gallagher, asked James to set up  a meeting with the people at Feather River Hospital,  and their CEO was gracious enough to meet a group of us  up there.  We toured the facilities, and immediately we could see  it had a ton of utility in an area that I hadn't heard addressed  tonight, and that is critical to be addressed,  I believe, in this community,  and that's mental health drug abuse.  It's already set up.  It's a hospital.  It has intensive care.  They have no intention of reopening the whole hospital.  They will have emergency services up there,  but there's a ton of real estate available up there  that would serve that need.  In talking to the director up there, I'd come to find out  he has a ton of experience in this area.  He'd done programs in Fresno with the mentally ill  and drug abuse and drug substance abuse.  The hospital seemed to have an interest in that area,  and they were obviously searching for things to do  with that building, and this seemed to be within their area  of interest.  So immediately I could see there's some possibilities there  of forming another joint venture partnership between  the private sector, which could be seven,  or it could be the Adventist Hospital,  or it could be other individuals,  private sector individual, bringing that real estate in,  which is a critical component to anything that we can do  in this community to address the needs of mentally ill  and people that have substance abuse problems,  long-term intensive care.  It's that population that most affects  our business community.  It's the population, in my estimation, that without real  estate work, without parler parler parler parler parler parler  without the proper real estate can you really address their needs and what they  need to get off the streets to get the  care that they need. So with that in mind,  after that meeting we were very encouraged.  We were fortunate enough that I talked to Susie. She  sees some cross-pollinization between the organizations that spoke tonight,  both private and non-profits  and the county. We had a Zoom meeting where we  had the county involved. Don was in on that meeting.  We had DESS on that meeting and we  discussed the concept and all I was after is does this have  any possibilities? Does it have any legs to it? Is it anything that you think the county  in conjunction with the state and maybe even the federal government would be  interested in a pilot program to take this unique opportunity  an incredible opportunity to take this facility and do something  in the mental illness, mental health  field? The answer was yes  and so we're trying to set up a meeting in the next two weeks to bring  that group up to Paradise, meet with that CEO that I  mentioned earlier and discuss the possibilities.  So it's a big endeavor. It's  something that's  a unique opportunity. You couldn't build that facility today and it did get  damaged in the fire but not to the extent that it doesn't have tremendous  utility. So this is bigger than I believe Butte County. It's going to involve the  state but I think the state has an appetite obviously to address that  segment of the homeless population that has drug and mental illness issues. So I  think the pieces, the So I think the pieces of the puzzle around the table now it's up to maybe a group to try and put that together. So I'll only bring that to your attention because it's an effort ongoing. !  parler !  parler !  parler  parler !  parler ! But what you're talking about here tonight in terms of the business community is critical. The impacts to our businesses from the homeless situation is dramatic. !  parler !  parler  parler  parler  parler  parler  parler  parler  Chico's very fortunate to have a company called Nanotech.  They've been in our industrial park for three years.  They're leading technology, and Scott, I believe you've met their president.  They're leading technology in battery technology and energy storage.  They have a patent that's a tremendous asset,  and this company is going to be worldwide and be a very, very big company.  They've invested $5 million in our building and a research center.  The only reason they're in Chico is because one of the scientists lives here and loves Chico.  And we've heard that story over and over.  That's how you get companies to come to town.  That company, if we had that picture, it would be nice to put up.  We were in negotiations with them to not only take the building they're in now,  which is 45,000 square feet, employs about 50 people.  They do joint ventures with the university.  Exciting company.  It's everything we've ever wanted.  When you start talking about economic development for our community.  It's hard to see, but you see the building with the blue top.  The one directly on top to the left is the building they're in now,  and they've been in there for three years.  That's the research center.  We were in negotiations to build the building to the right, which is 100,000 square feet.  That building was going to house a battery manufacturing facility.  That building was going to cost about $8 million.  For us to build, they were going to put in $175 million.  $175 million in that building to actually manufacture batteries for sales to, you can imagine, who.  Unfortunately, the state of California, some of the policies the state has come up with,  particularly when you start talking about some tax bills on the desk,  that facility is probably not going to get built in Chico.  We're still going to maintain the other facility.  But the whole reason I bring this up is scientists that they brought up  that were going to work in the research center said they didn't like Chico.  When have we ever heard that?  And that was in a reaction to what they had seen on the streets  and what they see behind that park.  In Comanche Creek.  Total negative.  When I was recruiting business years ago, we recruited a lot to this community.  I knew if I could get any company on the dirt in this community, we were going to get them.  Because it sold itself as a great community.  And now to hear individuals say that they wouldn't come to Chico  because of a certain element is not acceptable.  So everything that these groups are doing to try and address that situation,  we fully applaud because it is having dramatic impacts on our community.  And we're here to do whatever we can do to help solve that issue.  So having said that, any questions?  Just a comment.  Mr. Gillen, I certainly appreciate your efforts in trying to find mental health facilities,  detox facilities, because that is a huge corollary problem.  Okay.  And I think that's a problem with many of the folks that are on the streets.  And the point that you brought up there at the end is the investment that we make  in creating facilities for sheltering, for wraparound services,  for things like you're proposing for mental health facilities,  that's an investment in Chico's future, in a future for business communities.  I think at the university, this post-COVID, we have an opportunity  to be able to attract businesses, to attract individuals to Chico,  the university students.  But after a break, people may be coming into our city and taking a fresh look at it,  not like, oh, we're going to Chico State, we're going to Chico State.  They've had a break now.  Where do they want to go?  Where do they want to locate their businesses?  And if we have a problem with people on the street, we're not going to be able to attract those businesses.  That run our economy, that enable us to provide services to the whole community.  Two million dollars is a lot of money.  However, I feel that if we don't get a handle on this situation,  it is not going to bode well for us in the future.  So thank you for bringing that up, giving me an opportunity to speak about that,  and also the work that you're doing to provide more.  And I hope that this will help you in your mental health services.  Again, it is something that we've done.  It's just a tremendous opportunity that that facility is there.  It was because of an unfortunate event.  But that being there and repurposing that building,  I think is a one-in-a-lifetime opportunity.  So we're going to do everything we can do to try to make it reality.  Mr. Gillin, you've read the proposal before us tonight.  Does your group and the groups that you're working with,  with have a position on this proposal? In terms of? In terms of support or? I see  the players are in place. Once you have the real estate you already have  programs that are in place so I think it's a it's a question of  collaboration between those programs. I was told by Richard who is the CEO that  there's there's money out in this he knows about the industries he knows  where the money is it's out there it's a question of getting the agencies  together to work together collaborative manner. He and he brought this up two  things he brought up that got my attention. Sustainability it's got to be  a long-term program with long-term funding not to me says state federal has  to be involved he knew those sorts sources and actually cited them in that  meeting. The other thing he said that I didn't  mention.  I don't know if you've heard of it but I think it's a great question.  A real and I had to ask Don this but a real unserved portion of the population  of youth mental illness and youth that's something I hadn't heard before not  really really got my attention. They have another facility up there  separate and apart from this hospital that would be fantastic for  transitional housing. Fantastic. So again there's other possibilities but other  individuals smarter than me Scott know what they're doing.  He's saying first parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler  parler parler parler parler parler parler  parler parler parler parler  parler parler parler  parler  parler  parler !  housing, capital development, and primarily affordable housing.  Good evening, everyone. Can you hear me?  Yes. Wonderful. Thank you all for the accommodation  of being able to present to you via virtual.  It's been a wonderful evening, and it's always great to hear all the great work  all of our colleagues are accomplishing on behalf of the homeless  and our community. As reported by Susie, I am the  housing consultant for Butte County Behavioral Health, and  I am tasked tonight just to give you a brief and a promise-based presentation  about the housing programs that Behavioral Health utilizes for their  program participants. So Butte County Department of Behavioral  Health has a variety of housing programs linked with support services to assist  eligible adults and transition-age youth with serious mental health disabilities  who are either chronically homeless, at risk of chronic homelessness, or  homeless. The program provides  housing that is safe, decent, and affordable. The participants in partnership  with Behavioral Health staff develop a housing plan as part of a larger  treatment plan, and they voluntarily engage in a variety  of support services to successfully obtain and retain housing  and achieve their goals of self-sufficiency. And I want to highlight this point  that Behavioral Health itself is not a housing developer like  the Housing Authority or local affordable housing developers like CHIP.  We utilize and partner with  affordable housing developers to gain access to housing for our clients as  part of their overall service plan. That's an important point to distinguish.  Behavioral Health utilizes the recovery model philosophy to assist the  participants in realizing their individual goals for change and to improve their  health and wellness. One type of the housing program that we utilize is a  tenant-based rental assistance program, and Behavioral Health partners with the  Housing Authority to implement several housing programs that are  included in the HUD continuum of care homeless assistance grants that provide rental assistance.  The HUD CoC grants serve unaccompanied adults with serious mental health disabilities  who are homeless or chronically homeless. These programs utilize existing rental units in the  community. I'm going to pause there because I think we all could recognize that right now  that is an extremely challenging concept is to try to utilize units in our community  that are really not available. Our vacancy rate again is probably falling below one percent.  So even if we have rental assistance, it's hard to access housing units at this time.  As I mentioned earlier, Behavioral Health partners with affordable housing developers to build  permanent supportive housing that targets our special needs households.  The affordable housing developers build, own, and manage the permanent supportive housing units,  and Behavioral Health will apply jointly for project funding for the special needs units  and provide on-site and off-site services to supportive housing tenants.  I'm going to take one second here and take a pause and try to explain for those who aren't aware what is  permanent supportive housing. I'm going to start that explanation with what permanent housing is not.  It is not emergency housing. It is not transitional housing. It is not licensed community care.  Permanent supportive housing is affordable long-term multi-family housing.  Housing is linked with supportive services for homeless people with disabilities.  Supportive services are provided on-site and off-site by the U of K County Department of Behavioral Health and other community  service providers. The supportive services assist the tenant to retain housing,  improve his or her health, and increase his or her self-sufficiency. Supportive housing reduces  demand for services from first responders, emergency rooms, and police. So that's the  definition of permanent supportive housing. You've been hearing a lot of housing models. I want to  clarify that one. So currently a permanent supportive housing project we have in pre-development is  a project that is being developed to assist homeless people with disabilities. This is a 101-unit  mixed-use multi-family project. 100 units will serve extremely low and very low, I'm sorry, extremely  low and low-income seniors 62 years and older, and 15 of the 100 units will assist no place like home  eligible seniors. No place like home serves persons with serious mental health disabilities  that are either homeless, chronically homeless, or at risk of chronic homelessness. The project partners  in this project are Community Housing Improvement Program Program, Community Housing Improvement Program, and Community Housing Improvement Program.  They will be the owner, developer, and provide the property management. City of Chico is providing a  long-term lease and project funding. Butte County Department of Behavioral Health submitted a joint  application with CHIP to No Place Like Home and we are awarded funding a little bit over 3.4  million dollars and provide on-site and off-site services. The Housing Authority of the County of Butte  has awarded 100 project-based vouchers to this project and the Butte County Department of Employment and  Social Services will provide service amenities to all hundred tenants. As you can see when you're  doing a project for affordable housing, in particular permanent supportive housing, it takes collaboration  and a lot of partnerships and I'm proud to say that in Butte County in our area we've successfully  been able to have partners that are willing to come and work together on the project so  I want to let you know other permanent support housing projects that are available to behavioral  health clients right now. That would be Valley View Apartments, which is  a project that Butte County and Chico collaborated on, and they're  providing funding to assist in the development  of this project. The Valley View Apartments consists of 14 one-bedroom units,  one two-bedroom manager's unit, a community room, and vegetable garden.  The complex is owned and operated by Northern Valley Catholic  Social Service and Palm Communities, and Behavioral Health provides  on-site and off-site support services. Avenida Apartments  is owned and operated by Caminar of Butte County, and Butte County and  Chico provided funding to assist in the development of this project. Behavioral  Health provides support services, and the tenants are referred by  the Butte County-wide Homeless Continuum of Care's coordinated entry queue.  Via Serena is owned and operated by Northern Valley Catholic Social  Service. The City of Chico provided funding for this project.  Behavioral Health provides support services to tenants on a case-by-case  basis. And finally, Base Camp Village, which is located  in Oroville. Caminar owns and operates this affordable housing complex  that consists of 12 units. Behavioral Health provides support services to  the tenants, and tenant referrals come from Butte County-wide Homeless Continuum of Care's  coordinated entry.  We have potential projects in the future that we're looking for, and we're looking for  from additional rounds of No Place Like Home funding, and we're  exploring with affordable housing developers for rounds  three and four. And some of the project areas we're looking  for are the City of Chico and the City of Oroville.  And the No Place Like Home funding rounds for round three, we anticipate  applications are due in January of 2021. And round four,  we anticipate applications due in January of 2022.  I know that's a snapshot.  That was quick, but I think as long as all this information has come your way  this evening, you probably appreciate a short presentation, and I'm available  for questions.  Any questions?  Thank you, Ms. Villasenor.  You're very welcome.  Thank you.  Thank you, Debbie.  Thank you.  All right.  Let's go back here.  All right.  I want to thank all of our presenters this evening for painting a wonderful picture of all the  services that they provide and the efforts that they are under in creating, establishing,  operating a wonderful homeless crisis response system, which is our focus tonight.  As many of the presenters said, none of us could do it without the other members of the committee.  I want to thank the other person and people in this room.  So thank you all for what you do and continue to keep plugging away at that bottom line.  Appreciate your efforts.  Okay.  I'd like to kind of delve into some opportunities now.  Let's get to the meat of the subjects that we're here for this evening.  First of all, I want to go into immediate opportunities, things that we can work with.  Hopefully implement rather quickly.  The first one is something you've heard about several times this evening, and that is a  collaboration between True North.  Sorry.  Oh, I'm not paying attention.  Thank you, Joy.  Between True North Housing Alliance and Safe Space, and that is the development of a low  barrier navigation center at a site that has already been identified.  Potentially, True North Housing Alliance and Safe Space can open this navigation center,  by November 1st, given necessary funding to do so.  They're short on operational funding.  This is a short-term operation between five and 12 months.  It is a low barrier navigation center, which is allowed by right under Government Code  Section 65662.  This low barrier navigation center would provide post-COVID 300 beds, during COVID 160 beds.  Okay.  This increase in shelter beds will improve the potential for the COC to release Project  Roomkey participants into a shelter bed if there is no permanent bed or alternate available.  One of the goals from the state was the success of Project Roomkey, and several of our presenters  discussed it.  They've seen a lot of success in those individual rooms.  They don't want to turn around and release those people back out onto the street.  They've made such significant progress.  So it's important for us to, at the least, release them out of Project Roomkey when that  comes to an end, into a shelter bed.  But more importantly, it would be wonderful if we had non-congregate shelter beds to put  them into.  So moving from a motel or hotel room into a non-congregate room would be absolutely  wonderful.  Important to tell you that city funds provided supporting such an action does not constitute  a project.  Okay. I'm not going to go through all of these, but it's a pretty comprehensive list of services that homeless individuals participating in that program would have access to.  parler  parler  parler  parler  parler !  parler  parler  parler  parler  parler !  parler  parler  parler  parler  of those services would be available. Okay, thank you. You bet. Immediate opportunity number two,  this is discussing the additional 50 beds at the tourist shelter. Currently, per COVID guidelines,  they're obviously serving less individuals because of spacing, but when post-COVID hits,  they're able to serve 160 persons per night, and that's including overflow beds. The addition of  50 beds would take it up to 210 beds, and we're not proposing action on this today per se  because we still have building and planning approval that needs to be vetted. With the 50  beds at Torres and the additional beds at the new navigation center, we could potentially house  approximately 400 individuals that are currently in shelter.  Through emergency shelter beds, which is the majority of our homeless, as you see in the last  point. Costs for these immediate opportunities, both one and two, the short-term navigation  center would create that additional 300 beds post-pandemic. For a five-month operating period,  it's slightly under $658,000. The additional 50 beds to the Torres emergency shelter,  bringing the bed count up to 210 post-COVID, would run about $300,000 to finish that construction  project. And of course, as mentioned earlier, additional planning and environmental review  is necessary before that moves forward. Potential sources of revenue to support both opportunities,  but primarily one in this slide is CDBG, the COVID funding.  Round one, there are subsequent rounds two and three, and then funding from the City of Chico.  Why is our goal to promote navigation centers? Because that's the easiest way to increase our bed  nights.  Are we leaving that other slide now then?  Go back.  Well, I don't know if you want to talk about it.  Thanks, Carl.  These $2 amounts, $657,000 and $300,000, aren't they being identified as general fund sources?  Yes.  And yet you...  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Are we expecting CDBG COVID dollars to also be available?  Yes. CDBG COVID-1 is currently available, and Mark, I'll let you speak to that if you would.  COVID-2 and COVID-3 have not been released as of yet. So they're future funds.  I mean, the question is, is it in addition to the $657,000? Or is it possible that the general fund,  especially the $650,000, is going to be available to the City of Chico?  Yes.  And that the expenditure will be reduced by CDBG COVID money?  Yes. I think that is the exact statement, is that the CDBG COVID money is a portion of that $657,000.  Mr. Constantine, if you could help on that one, I'd appreciate it.  For expediency, we're requesting the allocation come from the general fund with the intent to utilize the more restricted funds.  Mr. Constantine, if you could help on that one, I'd appreciate it.  For expediency, we're requesting the allocation come from the general fund with the intent to utilize the more restricted funds to take the place of the general fund funding.  Mr. Constantine, if you could help on that one, I'd appreciate it.  And so the CDBG, there's a process still involved with allocating CDBG funding.  There's a process to allocate if we do any other sort of state or federal funding.  And so if we wanted to proceed quickly with standing up a navigation center, we needed to have the money immediately available to provide to the nonprofit to be able to proceed with that navigation center.  But again, just like what you heard before from Scott Dowell, we'll use more restricted funds.  But again, just like what you heard before from Scott Dowell, we'll use more restricted funds.  And so we'll use more unrestricted money first before we use unrestricted money.  And the total number, $600,000, is the total number.  It's not $600,000 in general fund and then an addition of some other amount above that.  That is the total project number.  Have we already been awarded the round one money?  We have. That was the $600,000.  Yes.  Yes.  And how much is it?  The total available, I think, was $268,000 that was left.  $282,000.  There you go.  $282,000 that's left.  So am I hearing right then that the hit to the general fund will be less than $283,000 or whatever number came out?  If we're allocating the $282,000 to this project, which is what I believe we're doing,  I think there's one slight thing that needs to happen in the consolidated plan.  But yes, we would be reducing that $600,000 something by the $282,000.  And the second one is on the emergency shelter of tourists.  The second question.  It says the gap is $300,000.  If we could take a second to what are the other funding sources?  The gap of $300,000, what are the other funding sources going into the construction project?  That is all that's needed.  We've received a private donation already, but that would be all that's needed to complete the project.  And that's just an estimate.  We have a project estimate budget already completed.  And it was not prevailing wage.  And so I just took that amount and threw 40% on top for prevailing wage costs associated with.  And it's just a renovation.  It's not new build.  Do you mind mentioning what the size of the private donation?  It was $50,000.  $50,000?  Thank you.  Thank you, sir.  Chris, so I just wanted to confirm the remaining, the CV2 and CV3 money, do we have any sense?  Is that going to be approximately the same as the CV1 money, the $282,000?  Or what do we know about that?  I'm sorry, can you repeat the question?  Yeah, sure.  So I think you said $282,000 was what we got out of CV1.  So Marie Demers is here and we just talked about it.  There's actually $283,000 that is available.  Okay.  And the request would be that we utilize the 283 for the first component and the remaining component would be general fund.  Gotcha.  But we still expect to be receiving CV2 and CV3 money in the future?  I'll have Marie answer.  Okay, thank you.  She administers those funds.  I have a question.  Here.  So the CV2 monies came to the state.  Those are not available to us.  Those are for non-entitlement jurisdictions and we are an entitlement jurisdiction.  So we don't get those funds.  But we have been awarded the CV3 funds, which is about $683,000 approximately.  That is coming with additional guidance.  We don't have that guidance yet.  There's potential we could be able to use some of that for that.  But basically what came down from Secretary Carson was that evictions was the big impetus for that funding.  So prevention of homelessness.  So we may look to potentially do rental assistance to present that as an option.  So I think I'm going to the same place that I think Mr. Ory was,  which is trying to get a grasp on where,  how much we're talking about exactly.  So of $657,000, we know that we have $283,000 available from CV1.  We would take the rest from the general fund.  And there's a potential for some of the CV3 money to also offset that $657,000.  Or the portion that we took out of the general fund.  $375,000.  $375,000.  $375,000.  If I may, if the council decides that this is the direction to proceed,  the dollar amount you'd be putting forth would be $657,000 minus $283,000.  And then so the general fund would be funding a little less than $400,000.  In terms of the additional CDBG money,  since we don't know what the guidance is yet and whether this type of expenditure would be allowable,  what we could do is,  the current plan was to do a navigation center for five months with the lease document allowing for 12 months.  There hasn't been identified funding for the remaining months to push this out to 12 months.  In the plan, if the desire is to move towards a more longer term solution,  you may need more time with a navigation center.  So you may choose to use some of that CDBG, CV3 to extend the term to get to the full 12 months.  And so we will have time to see what the guidance says.  And if it qualifies for that, that could be an option for the council to consider.  Okay.  Our goal is to promote navigation centers.  And that's in order to centralize services and provide an array of supportive services to persons accessing the navigation center.  The city supports development of a permanent low...  Excuse me.  Excuse me.  We'll move on to the second sentence.  Such a project will include up to 200 non-congregate shelter beds.  Such project may include exterior space to develop the camping and safe parking that we spoke about earlier  for temporary use by persons who are homeless or lack adequate shelter.  City can and will collaborate with the shelter provider as the administrator operator of the navigation center.  That will comply, of course, with public health orders and the CDC guidelines.  The Lowberry Navigation Center is allowed by right again under California Government Code section 65660 in all areas zoned for mixed use and non-residential zones,  permitting multi-family uses, and when in compliance with operational requirements.  And those operational requirements are pretty lengthy, but it's nothing that our service provides.  It's not something that the providers aren't already doing.  Can I ask a quick question?  Sure.  Is this is particularly the...  Okay.  This is a permanent navigation center, not the temporary site.  Correct.  So there would not be a designated space for campground or parking areas in the temporary...  Correct.  ...navigation center.  Correct.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  Services and amenities for a long-term navigation center would be the same as a short-term navigation center.  We'd have to go through site navigation, excuse me, acquisition, renovation, an operational agreement with an administrator operator.  We'd have to provide and should want to provide showers, toilets, laundry, storage units, and we can move those from the short-term navigation center.  Funding requires a commitment to ensure sustainability, and as Don Taylor was speaking just a few minutes ago, there's never enough money to do what we want to do.  But that's okay.  There are multiple sources that are forthcoming.  HHAP dollars round two comes to mind that can help us fund some of these things that we want to do more long-term.  And of course, code compliance is always required, ensuring the compliance with required planning entitlement and other necessary codes.  So for a long-term or more permanent navigation center...  Okay.  So we're going to go through some of the assumptions right now.  Project site acquisition and renovation is estimated at approximately $7 million.  It's for a large facility and the renovation to accommodate a navigation center and beds.  Estimated operational cost would include multiple staffing, levels of staffing, utilities, water security, sanitation, and those costs are roughly at $1.5 million annually.  Additionally, one-time costs would include a shade structure, picnic tables, and benches for outdoor gathering.  Again, hopefully COVID will be completed by then.  Potential sources of revenue, again, braiding resources is really important if we're going to do something to this magnitude.  HHAP dollars, the emergency shelter grant, several sources of COVID money, ESG, CDBG.  Project homes.  I believe we'll have another round coming out.  Hopefully something we can apply for there.  Community services block grant funding that is COVID-related and City of Chico funding.  Yes.  Is there anything in the funding being requested of us today that affects that proposal?  Say that again.  I'm sorry.  $7 million for a new facility.  And the funding that we're being asked for is $7 million.  Is that being asked tonight?  And the direction we're being asked tonight?  Are you asking for dollars for this?  Are you asking for?  No, no.  We're not prepared to come with an ask at this point.  If we are able to move forward with the plan that we have indicated this evening, there are many goals that are within the city's reach.  The first four that come to mind are decreasing our unsheltered homeless population by 50% by increasing shelter capacity.  And housing opportunities.  We can establish enough shelter beds to provide a bed for every unsheltered person currently living in tents or on the street.  Again, something that I really focused on when I know the people behind me that presented this evening support is that collective outreach and engagement.  Utilizing outreach workers from each one of our service providers to work together along with the target team to navigate the homeless from where they're currently staying.  Whether they're staying on the streets to a shelter bed or a different opportunity that's more long-term.  And then we can improve the city's public health and safety by enforcing codes and ordinances that provide for public protection.  Something we've all heard a lot about lately.  Path forward.  Recommendation staff shall proceed with implementing the following.  Legal camping or parking.  We need to seek out an operator.  And finalize a site.  We want to work with True North to evaluate the feasibility of expanding the shelter beds by 50 at the tourist shelter.  Again, environmental and planning needs to be done.  We would like to provide funding to True North and Safe Space to facilitate their efforts to establish that new navigation center.  And put 160 beds during COVID in place.  We need to provide funding to the city to develop a site that will be a safe and safe place for the residents.  Is this the temporary one?  Yes, temporary.  Yes.  Explore the viability of developing a site to include non-congregate shelter units versus congregate shelter.  And exploring it and or exploring a different location for the same.  Again, the state is really recommending as a result of Project Roomkey that we implement those smaller units.  Single room occupancy, if you will.  Maybe with some shelter beds.  Maybe shared restrooms and showers.  But non-congregate shelter is where it's at right now.  And that's where the successes have been noticed.  Provide funding and additional support for development of a permanent navigation center.  And then preserve the Martin Luther King BMX site for future utilization by supporting completion of the airport BMX site.  Action by Council.  City Manager recommends that City Council take the following actions.  One, appropriate $600,000 from the General Fund to facilitate the completion of the new airport BMX location, which would preserve the existing BMX location for an alternate future use.  Appropriate $100,000 from the General Fund for the required planning and environmental review of the old BMX location.  To potentially be used as a navigation center, non-congregate shelter, and or sanctioned camping environment.  Appropriate $657,967 from the General Fund to provide a grant to True North to facilitate their efforts to establish the new short-term navigation center.  Authorize city staff to work with True North to evaluate the new BMX location.  To evaluate the feasibility of expanding shelter capacity at Torres Shelter by 50 beds.  And then finally, appropriate $1 million from the General Fund, authorized in power of the City Manager, to take all other actions necessary to implement the strategies, goals, and recommendations herein.  And to enter into agreements to reduce homelessness in compliance with city codes and policies.  And all county and state public health orders resulting from COVID-19.  That $1 million, as we discussed earlier, could be used to remediate or alleviate environmental concerns as a result of illegal camping in our parks.  It could be used to provide for operational assistance at a sanctioned camping environment.  It could be used for further environmentals.  There's so many different things that we could potentially use.  There's so many different ways that we could use that money for.  But we need to be able to move quickly should those actions have to take place in a short-term time.  Susan, I need to ask a question. Sorry.  Yep.  So you could appropriate $1 million from the General Fund to clean up the campsites that this Council actually promoted people stay in.  So there's $1,657 from the General Fund to give a grant to True North to facilitate their efforts.  Can you go back a slide?  Yep.  $600,000 for the new BMX location.  $100,000 for the environmental review.  So I'm at $2 million.  And we haven't created a single bed.  Not one.  If we just go clean up the existing sites and do the things that you're talking about that you said, and I'm a fan of yours, but you said we're not actually, and the skipper at the beginning of the meeting, these are not action items.  But when the public sees the slide that says the City Manager recommends the City Council takes the following actions, they think the City Manager is saying the Council should take the following actions.  So I don't know who made the slides, but what you're saying and your slides do not go together.  Not even a little.  And the math doesn't really work either.  I'm just one person, but I know other people are watching this going, I'm confused, if anybody's still watching.  Right.  And so we've got to somehow hone in on where this message really is after three and a half hours of reporting out.  Mr. Orm, do you want to address any of that?  Yeah, absolutely.  So for clarity's sake, these are options to consider.  And the City Council, we're just seeking direction.  We need community feedback as well and public input.  And that will allow Council to then be able to deliberate to find out what direction you'd like us to head.  Right.  So we're going to go ahead and say one, two, three, none of the above.  Just give us some direction so that when we come back with the budget conversations, we can bring back a supplemental at a future meeting and have Council action based upon the direction that we received.  So that's what we're seeking tonight.  And to that end, we should clarify that these numbers, we should be saying up to, to ensure that we're utilizing the most restrictive funds and that the general fund would cover what remaining amount is necessary to complete those items.  And if we still choose, one knows.  So Mr. Orm, if direction is not action, then is direction consensus?  Are you looking for consensus?  Yeah, I need at least four heads nodding that we give the city manager direction to bring back fill in the blank.  You're welcome.  Are there comments before we open up public hearing?  I do.  I interrupted her on both issues.  Oh, no, I was.  Okay.  That was not my intent.  No, no, it's fine.  I do have some comments.  I was at the continuum of care meeting on Monday  where you presented a version of this plan.  And a couple of things are said in that meeting  that I feel are kind of pertinent to address  because that's a room full of experts.  And one of the things that was discussed  is that Catalyst Domestic Violence Services,  which is a shelter provider in our community,  kind of wasn't involved in this conversation.  And part of the reason that feels important to me  is that the more centralized locations that you're building  for people to access services,  the more referrals are going to go to these more specialized services  such as domestic violence, veterans, et cetera.  And because that entity hasn't been involved,  that level of expertise and kind of influence  in this conversation hasn't been recognized.  And to me, it feels like a missing piece.  And I'll read from the pit count in 2019.  Domestic violence survivors who are homeless,  12% of the respondents to that census  reported being a survivor of domestic violence.  49% of those people reported being unsheltered.  30% of those...  Those people are chronically homeless  and 78% of them are women.  And so for me, it's just critically important  that we're engaging all shelter providers  and that that piece was missing,  you know, kind of negates the fiscal impact  that it would have on an organization  that has a more specialized level of service.  So that's just one thing that I want to provide some guidance on  and hope that we can kind of fill that gap  because it feels like I don't have that information.  The other thing is, you know,  I feel like this council has been pretty direct and explicit  in that we want the priority to be around  sanction campground and legal parking.  I understand that there's been a variety of sites explored.  I do not know the mechanisms by which those were checked off the list  because we have not heard about each of those individual sites  and those reasons.  That's difficult for me  for reasons that Council Member Ori had already mentioned.  But I do think that there's a lot of work to be done.  I think if anything comes out of today for me,  that that should be one of the major priorities  of the next step in this process.  I don't know that it has to be at the BMX site  because I don't know what the other sites were  or what the issues with those sites were.  But that could probably save us some money  if I could understand what the barriers and challenges  of those different sites were.  Again, I don't feel confident that I can make these decisions  without that information.  And the last piece I want to mention is that it doesn't,  and this is not a criticism of you, Susie.  I know you've been working incredibly, incredibly hard  for the weeks that you've been here.  But my understanding is also that the continuum of care  was not consulted as it relates to the development of this plan.  And again, that's a room full of experts.  It is our commitment to a countywide response  to the issue of homelessness.  And so I'm also wondering and feeling like a gap  in my understanding is that I don't know how this plugs  into that broader vision or if there's input from,  from those entities about how we might strengthen this.  And so without those levels of consultation, again,  I don't feel like I can make a strong decision.  So those are my comments.  Sure.  So let me address, I think, two of your questions  or comments in there.  You're absolutely right.  Not everybody in our continuum was allowed to provide input  for two different reasons.  The first reason, I've only been here seven weeks  and I tried to meet, really,  meet and greet and discuss options and opportunities  with as many people as I could.  You know, given two or three more months,  I probably would have been able to vet a lot more  of those conversations.  But it's also important to realize that I've asked  for a two-week input period following this meeting  so I can get all of that input  that I had not had the opportunity  to gather beforehand.  Second of all, I did want to get additional input  from particular COC members.  Under the advisement of legal counsel  through the city attorney, I was asked not to do that.  So I did share at the COC meeting,  which you were a part of, the general concept.  And I think, you know, what you said about not having  all of the input from all the players  was the most important comment that I gathered out of that.  I think, generally speaking, the majority of persons  on the call supported it, and I did get several emails  to follow saying that.  But, again, we did look at it.  I think we did leave out some people that needed  to be part of that decision.  And I'm specifically addressing shelter providers.  I understand that you can't bring in the voice of everybody  that would play a role in this.  And I guess if this were to translate to direction  over the next two weeks, my request is that we do gather  that input and that just for me to plug that into my brain  and kind of where that fits, that we have some information  or a report on that next time.  And I was a little confused where you were going.  Okay.  Do you think that we wrap up this discussion  and then what kind of public comment review?  Well, we have speakers.  We have speakers that have been waiting all evening  to give input.  We've had information emailed to us.  So I didn't know whether my time would be better.  Well, let me comment because we're looking for direction.  Just where I'm coming from in the beginning.  Yes.  I like two, three, and four.  I think that we can see some shelter beds out of those two,  three, and four that if we take a look at the site  where BMX is today, that money looks like well spent.  And that if we move forward on the temporary navigation center  and the True North expansion, that those seem  to be reasonable things.  What doesn't work for me so far,  is that our, you know, some kind  of temporary tent-based housing would be available  at the BMX site.  I don't quite see that.  The appraised hour, if I remember right,  that the Jesus Center gave us was what,  about $300-something thousand dollars,  the appraised value of the BMX site.  Right.  So that's a good estimate.  And, you know, maybe it's just a word, appraised value,  but that means that there are comparable sites available  in that price range.  That's how you do appraisals.  And to say that we're going to put out $600,000 in order  to open up this site, I just have a problem with that.  I think fine tuning that, I'll be open  in the next two weeks to hear people.  One of the things that I'm thinking of is,  maybe we don't need to be the 100% funder of this thing.  Maybe it ought to be on a loan basis rather than a grant.  You know, when I was on the Nature Center Board,  the city made us pay back a park grant over 10 years.  The folks out at the airport museum are putting up big bucks  in order to use that museum and doing it.  So I won't go on from that, but that's a barrier for us.  And I think that's a big barrier for me is trying to figure  out cost benefit of that kind of expenditure.  And then the last one on the million dollars,  I would like to see something that starts, you know,  100,000 here, 300,000 there, some guesswork on how you might  want to spend that money rather than a blank check.  So that's where I'm at on that.  I hope that's helpful in not using up other people's time.  I had a couple of comments.  Casey, do you have something?  No, I was just going to say, could we get the public in as soon  as possible?  They've been waiting three and a half hours and we're almost at 10 o'clock.  I feel bad that they've...  I do want to say a couple of things.  You know, seems like homelessness and sheltering has been the number one topic that this council  has been dealing with for the last two years.  And even more so in this last year.  It's clear we need a multifaceted community support approach that emphasizes both kindness  and accountability to address this problem.  Resources for a plan forward, they're not forthcoming from the state or the federal  government.  Or if they are, they're so unpredictable.  I realize that when we authorized funds for a warming center, that if we wanted to have  a warming center, we would have to have a building.  But if we had a building, if we had a building center, if we had a building center, if we  had a building center, if we had a building center, if we had a building center, if we  had a building center, if we had a building center, if we had a building center, if we  had a building center, if we had a building center, if we had a building center, if we  had a building center, if we had a building center, if we had a building center, if we  had a building center, if we had a building center, if we had a building center, if we  had a building center, if we had a building center, if we had a building center, if we  had a building center, if we had a building center, if we had a building center, if we  had a building center, if we had a building center, if we had a building center, if  is blaming one another and what it's done is just left us stymied and not one step further to finding solutions.  We need to put that blame aside and decide if this is something that we want to do then we have to commit to it.  You know, we all know that Bidwell Park is not the place to have people living. It doesn't have toilet facilities,  it doesn't have cooking facilities, it is not a  proper campground.  These are vulnerable people that need to be connected through compassionate support to be sheltered and find appropriate  resources to a path forward and we have heard from each and every one of our partners and that is what their goal is.  We are not just  providing these handouts. We are helping people find their way back.  It's not humane to turn our backs to the needs of these people.  We all know that the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals  has ruled sheltering needs to be provided before we ask people to relocate and when I hear comments that we should just  arrest people, we should just bust them out of town, that is not an option for us. We have to address this.  We all can agree that Bidwell Park is the crown jewel Chico and this community is worth fighting for.  If we have people  camping on our sidewalks and on our streets and people are looking to relocate their businesses or trying to  decide if this is where we're going to stay,  they're going to say no. When parents are bringing their kids to Chico State to see if this is where they want to be,  they're going to say no. We have to step up and be accountable for the  people that are in our community and I'm just asking that we need to invest in  solving this problem. I understand that this question of how on earth could we have two million dollars to  contribute to this situation since we have  been to the brink of bankruptcy and beyond  and with you know 10, 12 years and now we have surplus money because of a disaster.  I think that's what people don't really understand is that where our finances are and  understanding what that  potential of spending that money and it's so different than what we have been up against.  But it's for our future that I think that we need to do this.  And we can't just talk about it anymore. We have to do some things. Pretty soon it's going to be  impossible for us to get back from the brink. I don't want this to be our new normal.  I want us to be the community that takes care of  everyone that lives here, has pride in their park, has pride in their downtown and that can work together instead of being torn apart.  I'm putting aside blame and agree that  this is something we all want to solve.  Yeah, I share many of the same sentiments with Mayor Schwab. You know this is on us.  There were some suggestions in the  comments from Engage Chico that we should  use our influence with the county and the state to have them solve it.  And I think we can see how well that worked out with the Silver Dollar Fairgrounds.  No one else is going to come to help us.  This is something that we have to solve.  Reducing the impacts of homelessness has been the issue that has dominated every  regular meeting since before I joined the council.  And  we've been pushing for solutions for a year and a half.  As we saw earlier, we've been told repeatedly that each location that was under consideration  previously was not viable.  Here finally is a plan.  We've been waiting, we've been asking for a plan, we finally have one.  Is it perfect? No.  Will there be hurdles? Yes.  Is it expensive?  We knew it was going to be expensive.  What is it worth to our community, what is it worth to us  to reduce the number of people that are living out  for their benefit as well as for the rest of us?  If we pass on these options, how long will it be until we have another option?  We're going to have to wait.  parler parler  parler  parler  parler  parler  parler  parler  parler  parler !  parler  parler  parler  parler !  parler !  first first  public spaces. So my suggestion is that we accept the recommendations with the following  changes. I'd like to see that we make the $600,000 for the relocation of the BMX track  subject to the successful mitigation of issues that could hold up development of that site.  So spending the $100,000 and the $600,000 would be subject to a sub-project that would  help us being able to solve any issues with egress and ingress. And number two that we  stipulate that the $1 million requested in item E or 5 include establishment of a sanctioned  campgrounds. Those are the things, those are the changes that I'd like to see in this and  I'd like to see us move forward rather than just beating this to death for months and  months. I'd like to hear from the public, but I'd also like to point out as we're hearing from the public, you know, we used to spend $6 million a year in affordable housing.  parler ! I'd like to hear from the public, but I'd also like to point out as we're hearing from the public, you know, we used to spend $6 million a year in affordable housing. !  parler  parler !  parler  parler  parler  parler  parler  parler ! So these numbers are not quite as daunting to me, at least in the commitment that we have had going back 20, 30 years. [inaudible] !  parler !  parler !  parler !  parler  hearing all these presentations and I've seen so much of these exact same presentations. These are  the people that we're partnering with. This is how we're going to do this. This is how we're  going to accomplish this. We've heard this before. What's new is that we had a change from the Jesus  Center's use at the former BMX site or the current BMX site, depending on your perspective.  And so we had already committed ourselves to use this space for this type of intended purpose.  There's definitely a need there. There's definitely more money available to us for this  particular purpose. I'm very uncomfortable spending $600,000 out of the general fund, even if it  whittles down to $375,000 or something else because we get commitments elsewhere, in order to  relocate the BMX site. Again, as Councilmember Orrie pointed out, the type of this building and the  availability of additional land, you know, this is a relatively affordable site because of its  surrounding  public agencies that own and operate around, or quasi-public agencies that own and operate a property  around that site. We wouldn't be able to find something like this for $600,000, $1 million, $2 million  for such a facility. So this, I'm sold on the location. I'm sold on the type of use of funds.  It comes nowhere near the commitment that we used to have for housing and housing affordability.  This is homelessness, which is a different animal, of course. But one of the reasons why businesses  don't come here and settle here,  isn't because there's homeless people running around, as much as there isn't housing available that's affordable.  Okay? We got the median home price is $48,000, or excuse me, the median income is $48,000 a year for a household in Chico.  That's four people. And your median home price is in the $380s. You can't have an employer that comes down here to make sense to hire employees that will live in Chico and be able to afford to live here.  So it's one of the reasons why we have such a tremendous problem. It isn't necessarily the homeless people that we have in the streets.  We've got at-risk populations coming out of Project Roomkey. That's the technical definition.  They're at risk because they're going to lose the housing that they have available, and that means that they're going to go back out into the streets.  So, you have my support on it. However, these are not – these numbers are daunting.  $657,000 – $375,000 – after COVID-1 funds are made available – that's for 5 months.  This is a $1.6 million operation. That's a significant amount of money.  Now, again, we used to spend – through redevelopment agency funds – $6 million a year on housing that was getting us approximately  $ parler  30 units of subsidized housing in the community.  So it is far past time that we make a commitment towards our housing,  whether that's housing affordability or housing homeless people.  It's far past time that we address this.  This isn't something that we've been talking about for the last year or 18 months.  This is something we've been talking about for 10 years.  I can remember Mayor Grendel here with an absolutely irate community  yelling at all of us from the back of the room.  So this isn't a new phenomenon at all.  What it is is after since February of 2012, when we lost our RDA funds,  we have not committed to provide additional housing.  We have a number of service providers that have told us all of the great work  that they're doing in our community, and they are, I know,  because I've been on some of their boards while they were pushing some of these  projects.  These efforts.  They're fantastic people, and they do great work,  and they're the ones that can do this if we enable them.  But we haven't made the commitment in this regard at all.  We haven't made it for affordable housing.  We haven't made it in terms of doing anything other than allowing the Jesus  Center to purchase a site from us.  So it is far past time that we address this.  But what we've done is we've culminated a whole bunch of ideas.  What's new?  We have some COVID money.  We have some disaster money.  And we have,  the Jesus Center pulling out of their location where they have another facility.  I appreciate all of the information that was provided today,  but my continuing question was, what's new?  What's different?  Money and a free location.  The city has not committed anything else beyond just using that same site that came due.  We haven't had campground facilities.  We could annex a CHP building.  I mean, I just can't get my head around the concept that we can't get evidence locked  for lack of a better description, but you all understand what I'm talking about.  Shifted from a place that's right in the center of town, right where it's most needed,  a facility like this is most needed, and we can't find another location in the entire city,  airport, behind the FAA gate, or anything, where we can't change uses here.  This is the highest and best used opportunity.  And I mean, I don't know whether the CHP building is appropriate.  I'm not shirking it or anything.  I'm just saying that this is a facility that we're talking about, and I'm not saying that we're  going to be doing that or spreading extra attention on it.  Other than to say, really, what we're talking about is using a facility that this city has  already committed to this type of use in the first place, and help some of our partners  expand in that capacity.  So in terms of direction, I'd like to hear from the public as well, but in terms of direction,  I'm generally supportive.  That's a tough bite to take on a $600,000 general fund relocation of a facility.  I'm going to have a tough time assigning on to that.  But it's long past time, and so, yeah, I'll let the public take it from there.  Well, let's hear from the public.  How many speaker cards do we have?  Well, we have 10 individuals over in the other room.  They're actually getting them ready to come up.  And we also received 53 comments and engaged Chico.  We received another 17.  We received another 17 emails and the public comments throughout the day and this evening.  Okay.  So let's take five minutes to read the comments, and then we will hear from the speakers, and  each speaker can have three minutes, if that's okay with the council.  Okay.  Yes?  Yes?  Yes?  Yes?  Yes?  Yes?  Yes?  Yes?  Yes?  Yes?  Yes?  Yes?  Yes?  Yes?  Yes?  Yes? ?  Yes?  Yes?  Thank you.  Everybody else?  That's what I asked as well as we locked in.  No, no.  We're allegedly reading the comments,  if you haven't already read them.  All right.  All right.  I should have explained it.  You're supposed to be reading.  All right. [inaudible]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I had no idea you were such an amazing speaker.  I had no idea you were such an amazing speaker.  I'm a present bell.  I'm a present bell.  I'm a present bell.  Just like the girl.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Sorry.  Sorry.  Sorry.  Sorry.  Counsel had an opportunity to read all the comments?  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Morgan is.  Who is our first speaker?  Okay, so I'm going to call up the first three,  Lee Alter, Kim Dietz, and Angela Frazier.  Good evening.  Hi.  My name is Lee Alter.  I'm part of the group of 22 community members  of Leslie Johnson,  referred to as Coast Project,  Coordinated Outdoor Assistance and Shelter Team.  It's been working to develop a plan for a campground  to serve the diverse population of unsheltered in Chico.  The city of Chico has embraced sustainability  as a high priority.  A holistic approach to sustainability  means that no community member  gets left behind.  Sustainability means that the basic needs  of every community member get met.  We are developing what we hope will be a plan  for a campground that's safe, clean, and secure  and provides case support for each campground guest.  I want to emphasize that the Coast Project  is a project that is being developed  The participants are engaged in the project  because they feel that when we help the most vulnerable  in our community, the quality of life is improved  for everyone in Chico.  The campground we don't see as an option.  It's a primary necessity to provide the most appropriate  place for people to stay, much more appropriate  than our primary needs.  And I think that's what we're doing.  We're working with the community to make sure  that we're providing the most appropriate place  for people to stay, much more appropriate than our primary needs. It's a primary necessity to provide the most appropriate place for people to stay, much more appropriate than our parks and creekside areas. On a personal note, some of you know me as a horticulture professor at Chico State. I teach a course in horticultural therapy and I've also helped with the Jesus Center Farm. I teach a course in horticultural therapy and I've also helped with the Jesus Center Farm. So I know something about the physical and mental benefits of flower, fruit and vegetable production.  part of the campground project, a working landscape and a garden project within the new campground.  Thank you for your efforts on this. I think it's very worthwhile for our city.  Thank you. Kim Dietz followed by Angela Frazier followed by Rob Berry.  Hi, my name is Kim Dietz and I am speaking on behalf of two investors who own property located at the corner of Cohasset Road and Eaton Road.  For the record, I have no personal interest in this property.  Am I public?  Comments are intended solely to make this part of the public record.  Last week, I was approached by the owners who expressed interest in offering this property as a donation for consideration as an option for the homeless opportunity plan.  I met personally with both of the owners this past weekend and agreed to send an email to city staff, Susie and city council.  Those emails were sent at 920-922.  One of the owners, Ed McLaughlin.  Ed McLaughlin was here.  He was supposed to speak right after me.  He just couldn't last three and a half hours.  He had a tragic accident on his farm today and his employees and I see you.  Anyway, about the property.  The property is 35.33 acres located near the corner of Cohasset Road and Eaton Road.  To the best of our knowledge, it is surrounded by property owned by the city of Chico.  It is zoned A40.  Aviation.  PFS.  Public facilities and services.  Record of survey shows it is not in the airport clear zone.  However, the east side of the property line is a clear zone boundary line to the adjacent city property.  There is an existing 16-foot access easement to the property from Cohasset Road through the city-owned property.  In December of 2018, right after the campfire, the owners were contacted.  Um.  As a.  A possible site for FEMA.  And so they felt that if this property was appropriate for FEMA for trailers, that it certainly would be appropriate for this emergency that we're in today.  So they agreed.  They did agree with the city in January 2019 to move forward as sewer application was processed.  However, an alternate location was chosen, so no further action was taken.  So there's lots of advantages to this.  property. I'm sure if you guys are interested, Mr. McLaughlin  would love to speak further with you, show you the property.  It's within a couple miles of shopping  of our new governance center there.  There's many markets, bike paths, public transportation.  It's very close to power and water.  So anyway, they just wanted to present that to you  as an option. I think it's going to take all of us to solve this.  So thank you very much. Thank you.  And you can talk to Ed or just email me. I think you guys all have my email  if you want anything further. Thank you.  Angela Frazier, Rob Berry, Angela McLaughlin.  Good evening. My name is Angela Frazier  and I'm here as a senior citizen.  I just wanted to let you know that I have friends  and through my church community, we have all  been involved with the Jesus Center and the Taurus Shelter.  I would appreciate, though, before  I start, if you could, from the beginning, if you could  from now on, let the speakers come in.  I've been here almost four hours and I'm 84 years old.  And it's just about the end of my time  for being here.  This is one of the first times I've been to Chico  since we've had the needle program.  My friends are in the same problem.  We are afraid to come here.  I came here and had dinner with my daughter and son-in-law  and we were sitting out there and we were talking about  how we're going to do this.  And I was sitting outside at this little place  and a young man came and sat down and my daughter said,  how are you?  And he said, I'm afraid.  I've just been attacked by a crazy woman.  I was walking down the street and she not only attacked me,  but she attacked others.  Here I am, a firefighter, came from out of town  to help with the fire and I come to this city to have dinner  and I don't feel like I can come back here anymore.  I'm afraid.  I think we need to make our community safer  for our families and for the people that come here to see us.  And that's all I have to say.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Rob Berry, followed by Angela McLaughlin,  and then followed by Jessica Giannola.  Good evening.  My presence here is a futile attempt to bring reason and balance  to these chambers, but by your actions last week,  you made it clear that you could care less.  So tonight you introduce us to a homeless opportunity plan.  While key stakeholders in this area are the people who are  responsible for the community,  the city claims it would like the opportunity to engage  in a community-driven review and input process designed  to build ownership of the plan and its priorities.  Obviously, you have no idea what community-driven review  could possibly mean.  Apparently, you define stakeholders as the beneficiaries  of public funds and community as those willing to offer unfailing support  for your grand designs.  With an initial price tag of nearly $2.5 million,  we hear nothing about how you will deal with those  who refuse or resist your wonderful services.  It will be fascinating to watch how you try to conjure this money  out of the general fund.  We learn of a homeless crisis response system,  which claims responsibility for preventing homelessness when possible.  When exactly, and for what numbers of current street dwellers,  will that be possible?  You have no idea, and you would not admit it if you did.  Public trust in local institutions and government is at an all-time low,  and for good reasons.  While devoting tremendous time, energy, and resources,  advocating for less than 1% of our population,  by your own flawed accounting,  you willfully dismiss the legitimate cries of 99% of the citizenry  impacted by your policies.  They have tried to advocate for themselves, repeatedly.  Yet you persist on focusing all of your attention on how to transform  this city government into exactly what Mark Orme himself said  it is not intended to be,  a social services agency.  What is the City of Chico?  By Mr. Orme's own words,  an enforcement agency.  That is correct.  You have forgotten that.  Despite this glaring, self-evident truth,  you insist on forging ahead as if you,  above all others, have the solution to homelessness.  There are no true and final solutions.  Only trade-offs, and the quality of life of the citizens of Chico  is being traded for your erroneous, inaccurate,  diagnosis of the problem,  which you helped create,  and for which you now propose a solution.  All you ask of us,  is simply to follow and obey.  Let's see how that works out.  Thank you very much.  Angela McLaughlin, followed by Jessica Giannola,  followed by Patrick Newman.  Good evening.  I just want to preface this with a thank you to city staff,  council, and shelter providers for bringing this forward.  It's long overdue,  and I'm excited to see solutions on the table.  There are those that will argue that we can't afford this,  and there's some truth to that.  We will need to work on raising revenues concurrently,  and we very much need a city sales tax.  But it's also true that the community will pay the cost no matter what,  just in different forms.  Whether it's police time spent doing work that social workers are better qualified for,  emergency room and hospitalization costs for people whose ailments  could have been easily resolved,  and impacts on our parks and waterways,  there's no way around that this is costly.  This plan is a step forward,  although we have some serious concerns.  We need places for legal camping now, not later.  Many of us have been saying this for years.  It should have been done immediately when the pandemic hit.  Because it wasn't, the local right-wing PAC has spent the last several months  stirring up antipathy and outrage in the community  against the homeless, against the city, and against council members.  Aside from the local PAC,  whose goal is specific,  specifically to sow anger and division in service of getting  conservative council members elected,  most of us would prefer to come to some consensus.  We all want a clean, safe, and beautiful city,  and anyone who says otherwise is foolish.  At some point, the council needs to recognize  that as much as we would prefer consensus,  we have to stand for something.  Appeasing local members of this PAC has led only  to serious challenges for several of your council members.  The council has been a great support to the local council.  They never intended to support this council,  and despite efforts to reach out,  they've used your efforts against you,  and as of today have spent about $70,000  to try to get rid of you.  Add to that that you've spent your time trying to avoid  frivolous litigation from a man whose only goal  is to obstruct progress on initiatives that relate to homelessness or harm reduction.  You should vote yes on this project,  but just as importantly,  you should select immediately at least one location  for safe camping, preferably several.  Pass an emergency ordinance under the shelter emergency declaration,  and direct staff to place porta-potties, waste receptacles,  shark containers, and ensure potable water and shade are available.  There isn't any reason that this can't happen swiftly.  It's time to stand for something.  Thank you.  Jessica Giannola,  followed by Patrick Newman,  followed by Nicole Nava.  Good day, council.  Wow, I can't believe that we had this discussion tonight.  We always say we.  But us as a community,  but it looks like we're moving forward in some really great directions.  Four hours on one topic,  it shows that you're dedicated.  It shows that we're moving forward.  Homelessness is not a partisan issue.  I see there's signs out there,  and they're blaming the five, the four plus one,  or whatever for our situation.  We all know that this is everywhere.  So I just want to applaud everybody for really asking these questions tonight,  moving forward.  For me, I just want to just kind of address to the comments  and the feeling in the community about people  and the money being spent on the people.  We're not solving homelessness here in Chico, or not.  We're trying to take care of Chico.  And Chico, we have to invest in the people.  That's all the people.  That's the homeless people, too.  They're our people.  They're our relatives.  They're our friends.  They're people who come to city council meetings  and end up in bad situations that could have been avoided  if we had better support systems in place.  I don't know.  I mean, I don't have too much to say tonight  except that I support this program.  I wish we got to it sooner.  We have a winter ahead of us.  I hope that we do some camping or parking spaces in the meantime  so that people have somewhere to go.  Just thinking of those items.  Thank you.  Have a good night.  Patrick Newman, followed by Nicole Nava and Jeff Creed.  So I've been coming here for seven years now.  From the very beginning, looking at things from the point of view  of people on the streets as much as I can.  I've been here for a long time.  parler parler  parler  parler  parler  parler  parler  parler  parler  parler !  parler !  parler  parler  parler !  parler  parler  providers have never stood up on these issues for the most part. In fact, they've been almost  entirely absent, which is frustrating, but there seems to be some great divide there.  As I hear all these solutions proposed, as I've said many times, this is not a solvable problem.  This is a predicament that can only be managed. It can't be solved. And we do that more or less  humanely. So in my time of watching this over seven years, it's funny that Laura brought up  Lloyd Pendleton because around the same time Robert Marbutt was brought here also by the  Jesus Center. It appears to me that what's happening is that the Jesus Center is following  the Marbutt model, not the Pendleton model. They're very different. So if you look at housing  first as a model for fixing homelessness, you don't fix people.  You get them housed, and the housing fixes people. And it works very, very well.  And that's what we ought to be doing. If we were an honorable society, we would never have let this  get to where it is today. So in all these solutions that are proposed, I guess I would ask you,  as people who are sworn to uphold the Constitution, to try to put them on the spectrum of  honorability from Pendleton at one end to Marbutt at the other, and look at the human rights  dimensions.  And look at the civil liberties dimensions in all these solutions. And when some realtor  developer starts talking about getting a huge building up in paradise and bringing the mentally  ill and addicts up there, maybe put that in the context of history and look at where we've  come since 1960 or the late 1950s with the Lanterman Act and everything else. We actually  made some progress during that time towards civil liberties and human rights for people  with disabilities, mental illness, et cetera.  They're going.  They're going backwards. And so there are some solutions here, but there's a great  spectrum of honorability in those solutions. And I wish we could go deeper into that.  Anyway, thank you.  Nicole Nava, followed by Jeff Creed.  All right.  So your short and long-term plans.  For homelessness do offer a way out of our parks and public spaces if people want to go.  What happens if they don't?  Many don't want the services.  Your own staff have even said so, as have the NPOs and the police cost.  Why does the burden fall on the taxpayers for a solution that the city might be proposing  versus having the county take responsibility?  They have more access to the direct funding required via grants and other connections.  This is not just an upfront consideration.  There is ongoing cost involved.  So it's time to adopt it.  and for those that do have a term date how are you going to enforce that you've shown a distinct  lack of willingness to enforce anything so how are we to trust that it would end  cause your plan is not getting at two major root causes of homelessness drugs and mental illness  i am not seeing anywhere supplementing and creating actual addiction and mental health  treatment facilities i did hear from doug gillen tonight and i was super stoked and my friend casey  brought that to your attention two years ago so just saying how on earth do you expect people to  be able to remain at these places when you have wraparound services with nowhere to point them  towards is there anything occurring that this community is unaware of that answer should be  transparent to all of us butte county has a high ranking of the aces which is the adverse childhood  experiences and until we deal with that and the addictions and the untreated mental illness i  will say it again that all the houses in the world won't help harm to the children  what is the right way to deal with that and i'm going to give you a few examples of some of the  things that we can do to address that and what about the children once again i do not see a plan  involved for the nuanced population that lives among those who are addicted or severely mentally  ill if there are some people who are homeless only because of circumstance not related to addiction  and mental illness this person is at great risk among placement among people who could take  advantage of them is there a plan for clear separation so i heard someone refer to the signs  outside yes we had picture of needles we had pictures of tents we had pictures of volumes of  trash throughout and what i heard tonight was a bunch of people giving his history on what they've  done and not a lot of the substance as to the outcomes you can refer everyone you want with  these wonderful wraparound services i am totally in favor of wraparound services what i'm not in  favor of is giving people false hope about repression of somewhere where there's nowhere  to catch them and so doug's plan is at least a step in the right direction but why are we the  city doing that so for you majority council that have earned the moniker of the foul five  here's this for you you put your partisan you put your politics before our community  these are the donkeys this is supposed to be a non-partisan spot you hold here this is embarrassing  and um we're in here late we appreciate the same respect you all get when you get to talk i've been  really appalled that there has not been a balance in sharing in the way we  treat the community here and to then hear some of you trying to roll things back or say things  differently because we're near an election is shameful and truly you need to think about that  you had someone who wanted to speak that got their time very shortened and y'all voted to make that  happen right up front it's an embarrassment please put your politics down look at this  community and please start doing the right things thank you for your time  jeff creed followed by janiyah babby  uh yes it is  wow so i got this plan the other day and i was all excited i waited for months and months and  weeks and actually i waited for years for this plan and it's a failure from the first page it  says homeless opportunities plan what it really is is a  homeless service providers plan because this is just a money grab this is straight up money grab  and if an employee brought this to any ceo and any other you know branch or any other profession  besides government they'd be fired this plan is based on old data this plan doesn't start go start  the bottom or bottom start to finish this plan you're talking about building all these great  transition housing this this this this that  you're not talking about doing anything but moving about moving people out of the camps  except like queen anne's house or council or his friends house who's already cleared and clean  right but  we're not talking about actually moving people out of the camps  enjoying anything for the city if this was a plan for the c parler with start with parler If this was a plan for the city, it would start with how you're going to deal with the problems the city is facing, not the problems the homeless is facing. Your job is not to solve problems. Nobody in this room is there to solve my problems.  parler  first  is there to solve my problems.  If I stop paying rent and move into the creek,  it's not your job to fix my problems.  When I go to the store and I buy stuff  and I can't get it home  because I bought too much stuff,  it's not your job to carry it home for me, is it?  Vice Mayor Brown.  How's the email going?  So,  I think anybody who brought this forward  should really be put on a two-week notice.  If you don't like that idea,  I'm sorry, I doubt many of you will,  but the problem with homelessness in Chico  is you don't know who's on the street,  you don't know who's in the bushes,  you don't know how and what kind of services  you need to provide,  and it's not your job to provide them anyway.  So your job is to protect the community, right?  That starts by enforcing the law.  And you've worked up a situation  where you need a campground to enforce the law.  You don't have to have personal storage  at that campground.  You don't have to have anything other than an outhouse  and a hand-washing station.  And somebody tonight provided you with a location.  So if you can't come back in two weeks  and say we're putting something together  at that property and we worked out a deal,  then what's the point?  If I owned a business in this town,  I'd be leaving.  Because you're only talking about  bringing more people to Chico.  You're talking about bringing more drug addicts  and more people.  You're going to build all these high-level services  and you're not doing anything to shut off the influx.  I will continue debunking this 30-page fallacy.  It's just YouTube.  Chico debunked.  It's a thing.  It's a joke.  Our last speaker is Jenea Batty.  Good job.  I will.  It'll come up when I click it.  Yes.  Yes.  I am completely appalled and disgusted  as a community.  I am a community member in Chico.  How dare you, Ann,  waste our time and call for an emergency meeting  dealing with homelessness.  Yes, I am talking to you.  Do not have to look away.  I am talking to you.  This is absolutely disgusting.  I am a tax-paying homeowner,  mother of five,  living in Chico,  and you have the audacity  to call an emergency meeting  focusing on housing homeowners  and homeless?  What about me, the taxpayer?  What about me?  I paid the taxes.  Where is the money coming from?  This made-up Kung flu is ruining our society.  Businesses are closing.  Where is the money coming from?  And then you have Ms. Brown with a brand new deal  that sends all the homeless to go poop and leave needle litter.  And this is not time for your reelection campaign  on the city's dime.  Now we have to focus on spending a million dollars  to clean up the waste that was brought to this council  by Alex Brown?  And you all are accountable for passing it  and allowing it.  I get bruises at my house  from dumb liberals stealing from me  and our police officers' hands are tied.  Can't arrest them.  And you want people like me  to come to a city with children  who are losing their lives?  You want people like me  I hop is gone.  Outback is gone.  Pier 1 is gone.  What do you want?  Sears is gone.  You think taxpayers want to come and live here  when all you care about is drug addicts?  And Alex, you need to look at me.  My time is worth it.  Your blatant disrespect  and your lack of consideration for this community  is why each and every one of you  have been pimping and pandering to this community  for so long.  And I will tell you that 2 Thessalonians 3.10 says  for even when we were with you  we commanded you  this if any is without work shall not eat.  But you want to take from me, a mother of five  to feed drug addict pedophiles  who are raping women at the college  instead of focusing on your community  and your constituents.  This is not time to be  This is not time for your campaign.  And I hope each and every one of you  Randall, I haven't forgot you.  Ori, you're gone.  But I remember each and every one of you.  Count my time down 10 seconds.  And your time is up.  My time on the clock is up.  Election is November 3rd.  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  parler  parler  parler  You know, I'm not, again, I think we're seeing some consensus in some general directions.  It's probably worth mentioning, and this is going to upset a certain segment of the population that was here speaking and watching at home.  But, you know, one of the problems with the cite or arrest and move out of town, I guess the objective that some people would like to see us do,  you need to crack down on these people, you need to cite them, you need to arrest them, you need to move them out of town, whatever that is.  You know, you can't do that if you don't have enough shelter spaces.  So if we don't find the 200 housing at least temporary for the 258 people that are homeless,  and if this is an opportunity for 400 people, that allows you to encourage, I'll use the word compel people to either seek services or provide housing.  So this is literally the workaround that the people that just came up a few minutes ago,  to yell at us about not doing, and this is actually the solution that we know works in other communities and is mandated.  So kind of incredible to be hearing it on the one hand, you're not doing what you're supposed to be doing, this is what you need to be doing,  and the solution in order to do that is exactly the thing that we're doing.  So it's one of the reasons why it becomes challenging when we're talking about homelessness.  We have people that are not as well versed, that are not as well researched on these issues, have not looked at other communities,  have not looked at other communities in the community.  And there are people in California that are subject to the California state constitution.  You can't move people along effectively or legally without providing shelter space for them.  And somebody else came up tonight and said we needed to leave this alone.  I think that was Mr. Berry, but I'm not sure.  We needed to leave this alone, and what a strange concept, because that's exactly how we got here in the first place, right?  I remember being on the streets of, not living there, but running.  It was a very strange experience.  I remember being on the streets of Washington DC in the 80s, and seeing homeless people on grates,  and astounded that a community could not address this.  There was snow falling on the ground.  These are problems that seem to cycle back into our communities throughout the country over several decades.  So precisely what's happened is we were dedicated, communities throughout the country were dedicated to addressing housing affordability,  and that is still an ever present problem, especially, most acutely in the state.  And I think that's why we're here in the city of Chico.  There are solutions to that as well.  But we used to spend a whole lot more money on affordable housing and very little on housing homeless people and substance abuse.  The whole system has been upended since the 60s and 70s.  So the suggestion that the city should just leave this alone is outrageous.  That's exactly how communities throughout this country have been not dealing with this problem.  And why we see, and one of my students was working on a project I was working on.  I teach real estate finance at the university.  And they were looking for potential development projects.  And what I was seeing in some of these suggestions was, well, they've got a really bad homeless problem in Chico,  or they've got a really bad homeless problem in Redding.  And I thought, well, you know, Redding's problem is actually worse than ours.  In fact, I know many communities that have it much worse.  We have community or business owners that can't locate or relocate to Chico because housing is so expensive.  And that's exactly, as those costs spike, that's exactly how we see people,  see people destitute and start to engage in substance abuse.  Something else happens in their life and they end up on the streets or they end up being exploited through bad housing options.  We can't leave this alone.  That's exactly how this problem was caused.  We weren't interested seven years ago.  I don't care who the council was.  We weren't interested seven years ago in addressing this.  Heck, we were barely interested in this three years ago, four years ago.  What we have now, what's changed,  what's changed now is we have a site that we made available for this intended purpose  to address homelessness and substance abuse and other itinerant problems, associated problems.  And that site's use fell out because they found an additional site, which is fantastic news.  I'm seeing you now.  I'm so happy that you were able to pull that off at your old site  or are pulling that off on Park Avenue, L.A.  That's exactly what I had hoped for in that neighborhood.  This provides a number of different opportunities throughout the city,  but especially concentrating in one particular area.  We heard a lot of service providers tell us about all the great work that they're doing now  and have been doing for years and years and years.  So in terms of direction, in terms of what the city manager's looking for in terms of support,  again, I reiterate my comment that I'm uncomfortable with the BMX,  but I'm not uncomfortable with the BMX.  I'm not uncomfortable with the BMX relocation.  But I don't want to throw that baby out with the bathwater.  It's going to be necessary to relocate them in one form or another.  They're the existing use on that site.  We promised them that we'd help them.  I don't know if that translates to over half a million dollars in support,  especially at a time when we're looking at some of these more daunting operational costs  as well as acquisition costs.  There was something that I was trying to remember.  I'll yield my time.  There's another point that I wanted to make.  I'm not remembering it.  So Scott, do you want to summarize your thoughts again?  Essentially, it was to accept the five items with the whole sort of amendments and that was that in regards to items number one and two,  I think that was the first item.  I think that item number one, which is the $600,000 for the relocation of the BMX track,  the subject to item number two, which is the ability to assure that property can be used for that purpose.  So we want to spend the $600,000 before knowing that we had solved the egress and whatever other issues  that there are.  The second item, my second item was I wanted to assure that the million dollars in item five contained a sort of guarantee  that a portion of that would be used for a sanction.  Those were the two amendments that I made to this item.  So are we looking at that motion or direction?  I would love to get, I would take that as a motion to direct the city manager to head in that direction if that's council's desire.  So that's what we would be looking for.  Just second with a caveat that I'm not excited about that.  But he's put enough pressure on the $100,000 that we can leave it at that at this point.  Thank you.  So first let me start with none of this is personal.  And I want to give a little bit of history and what I think some other people may be seeing and perhaps it's just me.  So three years ago we talked about the ACT initiative, accountability, compassion together.  And the idea of a consolidated services center, the Chamber of Commerce was pushing hard and everybody kept talking about fragmented services.  And we had all these different services all over the place and people in need could go from one to the other.  There wasn't any way to track them and we came up and I didn't come up with it.  I talked about it first.  But it wasn't my idea.  And the Jesus Center, they called it something else.  But at the time we were called the Consolidated Services Center.  That's when the idea of the BMX track came up.  I was there when the skipper got the phone call from the people that might have had somewhere for the BMX track to go.  And there was some kind of excitement.  It was like here's something we can do for wraparound services.  A navigation center.  It was fairly well thought out.  And we thought people would come in line.  The first thing that happened is we got a letter from the board of the Tories.  I don't know if you've heard of it.  The Tories were at the Tories shelter going no.  They will write this off in some other way.  Sorry.  That's what they said.  They said no.  This isn't our plan.  We're not interested.  Go play in your own sand.  That's what the Tories shelter board said.  Now some people have rescinded that but that's what their board said.  So I put together an ad hoc committee with Bo Choy and Laura on it.  Some private people.  Doug Gillen was on it.  Rob Berry was on it.  There was some law enforcement on it.  We were trying to move and we had somebody outside come and moderate the thing to see how could we get along to move towards something that would work for everybody.  I thought it was kind of fairly well run.  Then the campfire came.  We had chaos.  Through nobody's fault.  Right?  And the council changed.  Things happened.  At one point Mr. Huber talked about putting together, and I don't know, he may have done it, an ad hoc committee to do that kind of thing.  And I said, you know, I've done this if you want to hear anything.  I don't know what happened with that.  Jump forward to the last six months or so.  The city hired a homeless coordinator.  I think that was a good move.  I think it was time the city got involved to try to get it done.  We had to figure out all these different nonprofits, all these different service entities in the county and all these people.  We heard from all of them today ad nauseam.  I mean everybody, the whole 15-minute presentation limit, that didn't exist at all.  Talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk.  So we had the homeless coordinator for like six months and then we got another homeless coordinator.  And then Governor Newsom on September 16th announced $76 million to local jurisdictions.  $76 million.  These projects will bring these communities chronic homelessness to functional zero in two years.  But it was too complicated.  It was too complicated for everybody apparently that is in this business for us to get any of that money.  We got to ask for it to come out of the general fund.  So now we have a new consolidated renewal plan by the new homeless coordinator who's been here seven weeks  that looks nearly identical to the consolidated services plan that we had three years ago,  except this time we've got city money going to an organization by the city's old homeless coordinator's nonprofit.  And we're asking for $2 million to help plan, fund, and conceptualize the designs of the original plan to do something.  Meanwhile, the people that designed the original plan have gone off and done something else entirely with some of the same private dollars that everybody's going to want in order to make any of this happen.  And Mr. Huber, I appreciate your motion and I appreciate that the council is going to ask the city staff to kind of move in this direction  and keep looking at these options because we've been told repeatedly these are not action items.  I am totally against spending any money at this point.  We need to get to one plan.  We need one champion, whether that be our homeless coordinator, whether it be the Butte County Department of Employment and Social Services,  homeless housing support, and all the millions of things that they do apparently.  Fewer initiatives and we need an agreement on that one plan and that one champion.  Otherwise, we're spending taxpayer dollars on feel-good initiatives with, if history is any indicator at all, very little chance of success.  I heard too many times, may include, could include, possibly.  I got Susie to admit, yeah, you guys could spend this $2.5 million and not put a single bit in.  That's a problem.  To me, after listening to the Butte County guy, Department of Employment and Social Services,  who say they coordinate regional efforts and collaborate across parts of the state,  it seems like it's the whole group that's involved in this.  I'm not sure.  And then finally, the solution to our homeless challenge is a lot like this meeting.  Overwhelming with many players, different goals, sometimes competing missions.  I believe it would be wholly premature, unsustainable, unwise, and maybe foolish to act on the basis of this meeting.  I said at the beginning of this meeting, key whole vision.  We're looking at $2 million in one place.  We're not comparing it to anything else.  But having said all of that, I like where this is.  is heading. It was time to have this meeting and get everybody in the room and go, how can we start  marching together? Because we haven't been marching together. I did not see one consolidated plan.  I listened to everybody. I'm not sure we're there yet. I think moving forward, we can get to that  degree. I actually agree with Mr. Stone. We can't do nothing. I come down far more on the  accountability side. I don't think that's a secret to anybody, but I also know we're limited in what  we can do on the accountability side if we don't have places for people to go. But two and a half  million dollars to clean up the park and not put a single bed in, that's unwise, but I think we can  get there. So that's my non-supportive way of supporting moving forward, but not spending any  money. Because again, we've said no to you for $5,000 before. Supplemental budget appropriation,  no, we can't talk about that budget. We can't talk that till the budget. Can't talk about the budget.  So we come forward today, these are non-action items. Can we please take action on our non-action  items? No.  But that's what the slide said, whatever. But if you want to move forward and try to find a plan  that makes sense that we can get behind, I can get behind that. So I don't know if this is a motion  or a nod. If it's a motion, I'm a no. But if it's a nod, yeah, Mark, keep working in this direction  in this impossible task we've given you. Sure.  Any other comments?  I failed to mention earlier, we tend to have, because of the conservative budgeting that we've  been going through for, I don't know, the last seven, eight years. Well, I'll say it.  Eight years. The conservative budgeting that we've had, we've had $2 million or thereabouts  every single year as surplus funds because we've kept the belt tight. And so, again, that's what  we're seeing now. It's not too much of a surprise to see that. What is a surprise is we have this  budget surplus going in with this tremendous problem with homelessness, just as every community  in the United States is having, while at the same time seeing some opportunities for revenue.  And it doesn't look very pretty on the horizon. That's, I think, what's scary. It's not surprising  that we have $2 million at the end of a budget cycle. We've been seeing that as of late.  We have a lot more than $2 million.  There's, yes. And we haven't seen that number quite yet. But so it's still floating out. And  we also have a huge gorilla, elephant in the room, if you will. So it's both of them. The gorilla's  on top.  And it's ugly. I mean, this is the COVID nightmare that we have been expecting that's on the horizon.  And we don't know whether the federal government's supporting us, and we don't know whether the state  government's going to fully indemnify us. So $2 million right now, that's where it came from.  It may not stick around for too long. And that's because of the efforts that we've taken  in previous years and right up to the end of the last fiscal year.  So anyway, that's all I got.  Any other comments?  So we do have a motion on the floor by Mr. Hubert and seconded by Mr. Stone.  Council Member Hubert, I know you were on the COC call as well and heard my comments about  including the additional shelter provider in some of these conversations.  Would you be willing to amend your motion to just check that box of bringing Catalyst's domestic  home?  I'm not sure if you're going to be able to get that box of bringing Catalyst's domestic home  into the conversation over the next handful of weeks and making sure that that is part of what comes back to us?  Absolutely.  Thank you.  And would you be willing to accept?  Yeah, absolutely.  Okay.  So we go from a head nod to a motion?  We did go to a motion.  Yeah.  I would at least hope that we could, I can't remember the right term, split the question.  If I'm on an agreement on three of these things, it seems like that's a win.  But to have to vote against this because of some things that still need to be looked at.  We heard tonight that there may be other places for camping, sanctioned camping.  I think we really need to just couple the idea of the BMX relocation with everything else that we're ready to move on.  Yeah, they're going to need to be relocated.  At one point, we were asked for.  Now we're being asked for $600,000.  What's their skin in the game?  Can they take out a loan?  If this is going to be a wonderful economic development thing,  is there going to be a revenue stream from them in the future?  I just have so many more questions.  I'm not saying we leave this alone, but why make that our primary action tonight?  We're calling this, what is it, a $2.3 million?  Is that what we all agreed on?  There's $1.6 million here that we don't need to act on tonight.  There's the $600,000 to talk about more about the BMX relocation.  And I think what we're basically doing is taking a million dollars that could go into a reserve  and give some kind of authorization.  Authorize and empower the city manager.  I don't know what that means other than you're free to spend.  And I...  You know, I would think that we would want to take time with that $1 million.  It's not going anywhere.  Sure, let's budget $1 million for additional homeless opportunities.  That's fine.  We're going to adopt a budget in a couple weeks.  But we don't need to take this emergency action of trying to speed things up  by giving Mark the ability to spend $1 million without coming to council.  So, you know, let's...  Let's...  Let's split the question.  Allow us that have doubts on one and five to take the time and not commit ourselves tonight on that  and move on the three things that we're in agreement on.  I'm ready to do that and I'm more comfortable doing that.  And to be clear...  I think the heart of the whole proposal is one in five.  I mean, I think that's what puts things in action.  If we don't relocate the BMX, we don't have something to work with.  We just had 35 acres possibly donated to us that could possibly be in place.  We've had a lot of possibilities thrown at us that have not panned out.  I just...  I wonder, Mark, if you could speak to...  Can I?  What is that?  Yeah, sure.  Do you want to speak now or...  No, go ahead.  Okay.  Let me get my...  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  So it would look like if we're authorizing you to move forward with the concept of this million dollars,  what happens next?  What do you do next?  What do you come back to us with?  Yeah.  So as we've already said, this is seeking direction on where you want to go.  And so there's no appropriation of any funding tonight.  Right.  This would come back to council at a future date.  It sounds like there's some additional engagement.  That's necessary.  It sounds like it was accepted by the first and the second on that.  And it sounded like that was a part of the plan anyway, try to engage at least for a couple more weeks.  And it sounds like...  So that's going there.  So here's the bottom line.  One of the things that council's asked is that staff proceed on getting things done.  Without resource availability, I can't proceed with the executive authority that I have under the circumstances.  I brought that forward months ago already.  And I understand the prudence of the council was that we're not sure if we're going to have the funding.  So we're not going to authorize that.  That was the rationale.  And I totally respect that.  In this instance, what we're attempting to do is try to develop an ability to lend flexibility to my ability to understand what council desires and the direction they want to go so that I can bring that back and move some initiatives forward under the authority of the council.  So it's the whole idea of the executive authority that I have.  Because it's the executive authority that I do have.  Contingent upon council direction.  It's not some wild card going out and doing stuff.  It's getting things cleaned up and trying to help move in the direction that council desires.  I don't take offense to council not wanting to give me that authority.  I don't.  I'm just trying to give you an opportunity to help me achieve some level of success immediately.  As immediately as possible.  So...  I...  I...  Fortunately, I understand where everybody's coming from on this, and so I'm not going to debate one person's idea over somebody else's.  But the bottom line is, ultimately, the council's got to make a decision on which direction you want to head, and we will follow through and get it done if we have the resources.  As a part of my introductory speech, I said direction and resources.  We can have direction without resources we can't implement.  And so it's pretty simple.  But I also understand of the unknowns in the third quarter and the fourth quarter, fiscally speaking.  So I get where you're coming from, and so that's what I would lend to that.  I don't know if it helped you, but it's the reality that I'm facing and that staff's facing, candidly.  So I'd like to modify my motion so that it's clear that I'm not asking that these expenditures be approved.  What I'm asking is that we provide the city manager with direction to come back with a more detailed plan for how the money would be allocated.  That was my understanding as well, was we were talking about possibilities and giving the city manager direction.  It's one of the reasons why I was a little uncomfortable with the motion in and of itself.  But look, this site...  out behind the Silver Dollar Fairgrounds, it was already intended to be used for this purpose.  We already saw some value to that, and I don't want to see that opportunity leave.  It's got a whole lot of hurdles and a whole lot of hair on it, but I'd like to give the city manager direction to try and shave some of that, if you will.  And see if there aren't some... still some opportunities to achieve the same or similar objective.  Yes.  It was direction rather than explicit...  So, that's it.  Authority.  So, council ready to vote?  I just wanted to say one quick thing.  I just wanted to remind everybody that one of the crucial parts, I believe, of this was...  I can never say your name right, Susie, but...  that there would be a two-week engagement period of the public.  And if we are going to be successful in this, we need to take that time to do that engagement.  So, I think voting to move forward with having staff continue to look and bring...  bring us back information, I'm comfortable with.  But right now, when we've barely heard anything from the public and not had that time, I'm not comfortable, you know...  I want us to move forward and keep looking at it, but we need to take the input.  We want the buy-in of the community.  If we want to be successful at this, I think it's important we have the community on board as well.  So, is there a...  Is there a commitment to the...  No, I'm sorry.  I can comment that that was part of...  That is part of...  That was an important part of it, is the two-week...  So we really can't do anything if part of her proposal is to get two weeks of engagement from the public  We really can't officially do anything until we've had that engagement time and have more  detail brought back to us  And I'm so uncomfortable about this vote that I'm actually gonna abstain even though I'm fully behind this but I don't like the vote  Explicitly saying this is what I want to see happen at this point. We're giving him we're providing the city manager with direction  That was our intention  I get it. Yes, I agree  clarification from city attorney  from city manager  I've got direction that you like this path  You're in you're uneasy with regard to appropriating funding now get that  You want a more?  specific plan to come back  conceptually speaking  the types of sheltering options that have been presented are  reasonable  but you want it to be more thoroughly vetted by other parties and  You want a more comprehensive plan around particularly the 1 million dollars and how that would be utilized  So I think I got the direction and I see a lot of heads kind of go on this  So I I think I got the general direction. That's good enough for me unless the city attorney  Says otherwise and he's writing so I don't think he's gonna say otherwise  and  it'll be  In two weeks we're gonna have the budget discussion so it'll be a much better understanding of where we are  I think we're missing a chancer though, and I'm not pushing a second motion  But I think two three and four there is agreement and I think it's  the idea that we're funding significantly the expansion of the tour shelter it's a big deal that's the  That should be, I don't see number one  as being the lead in the relocation,  being the core of this.  The core of this is allowing to our shelter to expand.  And then the other is the Carmichael site going forward.  These are two big deals.  Both of these things together, as the report says,  gets us almost 90% of what we need for shelter beds.  So, you know, if you're seeing direction  that, you know, on one and four,  that is different than mine, I don't know,  but I'd like to see a lot of nodded heads on two, three,  two, three, and four, you know,  that we want to move forward with the expansion  of the Torre shelter.  That's good news.  We want to move forward with a five months  to 12 month navigation center.  You know, let's talk about the BMX  and let's talk about budgeting, but you know,  let's, let's,  let the good news be the headline,  not that the council tabled it or, you know,  that we did, we took no action, you know.  So that's a smaller head nod on two, three, four  than a week head nod on five.  Is this a week head nod?  All right.  I think we will, we're finished.  And we will adjourn to October 6th.  There's one other item.  May I move approval of the supplemental appropriation?  Yes.  Public comment?  Was there any public comment?  Second. Okay.  Motion and a second on item 2.2.  It's actually a new item.  You can't vote on it.  Okay.  Does anyone like to make a motion to suspend the, oh.  10 o'clock or 11 o'clock?  It's 10 o'clock somewhere.  When it's convenient.  Okay.  Council member Huber?  Yes.  Council member Morgan?  Sure, like we should have the first one.  Council member Horry?  Yes.  Council member Reynolds?  Yes.  Council member Stone?  Aye.  Vice mayor Brown?  Aye.  Mayor Schwab?  Aye.  Carries seven zero.  Okay.  So with that, we will adjourn to Tuesday, October 6th,  at six o'clock.  Thank you.
