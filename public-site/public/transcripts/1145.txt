 Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you, Mayor.  Let's pray.  Lord God in heaven, thank you for your grace.  Thank you for this city of Chico.  Thank you for this beautiful place in which we live, work, and we make home.  Lord, you've ordained government for the good order of society,  and I pray that tonight you'd give wisdom to our mayor and fellow council members  that we would prosper in many ways.  Lord, we need your grace.  We thank you that you give it abundantly in the name of your son, Jesus.  Amen.  Amen.  Amen.  All right.  Let's close the door to the back there.  And then please stand and join me in a word of prayer.  I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America,  and to the republic for which it stands,  one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.  Amen.  All right.  And the point of control, please. Here. Here. Here. Here. Here.  Here.  Here.  All right.  Special note.  So item 2.1, which is the active exhibition management format,  is actually being moved to the consent that we consider the first item on the regular agenda.  Just a note.  So the speaker card announcement.  Anyone wishing to address the council meeting has not or already listed on the agenda unless  there is a speaker card.  There should be a hand written back to the table.  Turned in Maya on your right to sit and explain.  So once we've started on a particular topic,  no large speaker cards will be accepted.  And I'll always take any questions.  So we have a closed session announcement from our attorney general.  All right.  Thank you, Mayor.  Good evening, Mayor, City Council.  Earlier this evening, the City Council recessed in closed session.  There were several items on the closed session agenda.  The first one was a conference with labor negotiators.  With respect to this item, Councilwoman Tandon did recuse herself with respect to the discussion  on SEIU bargaining unit due to a potential financial interest because her spouse is within  that bargaining unit.  She was present for all other items.  For items with respect to 2.1, City Council was provided a briefing.  Direction was provided.  No final action was taken on that item.  Item 2.2, security of public buildings.  City Council was briefed.  Direction was provided.  No final action was taken on that item.  For item 2.3, conference with legal counsel pending litigation.  City Council was briefed.  Direction was provided.  No final action was taken.  That concludes my report.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  And now we will have a presentation.  Thank you.  Ladies and gentlemen of the Council, citizens of Chico, thank you for this opportunity to  present some information about the Chico Rescue Mission tonight.  Cambridge Dictionary defines disciple as a person who believes the ideas and principles  of a leader and tries to live according to these ideas.  The goal of the Chico Rescue Mission is to take men who are in addiction, alcohol, drugs,  whatever it may be, people who are homeless, people who are fractured, people who are broken,  and through the transformative power of the cross, change their lives.  That 12-month process, they are termed disciples.  And it is a disciplined process.  Because we need discipline in our lives.  And that is what the Chico Rescue Mission tries to do.  The Chico Rescue Mission was started by Neil Bennett in 1993 in Chico at 13th and Broadway.  It moved to 2612 Esplanade in 1998.  It has a capacity to house 90 men.  This is no cost to the city.  We do not receive public funding.  We do not receive federal funding or state funding.  We currently have 30 men residing in the mission.  The cost to these individuals is nothing.  This is a free program.  It is a live-in 12-month program where they get mental health, medical health, dental health,  and other health care.  They go through a discipleship program where they meet twice a day in a 12-step program  as well as a faith-based program in the evenings.  Through that 12-month program, they get right mentally, physically.  They get housing.  They get dignity.  Most importantly, they get dignity.  In the process of that, they also go through work vocation.  They learn how to work again.  They learn that there is value in work.  They learn that through the process of work, they get value.  The process of this 12-month program has transformed the lives of thousands of men in this community.  Many of you may not know who we are.  The reality is, is over the last five years, the Chico Rescue Mission has fallen out of favor within our community.  Through apathy, through attrition, through bad management,  it has ceased to be relevant in so many ways.  We have a new board of directors.  We hope to change that.  This is a faith-based program.  Let me rephrase that.  This is a Christian-based program.  Unapologetically, at the foot of the cross, all are equal.  I know that may be offensive to some, and I apologize for that,  but I do not apologize for my own sin.  I do not believe in the power of this program.  That being said, I realize there are limitations.  I am not here tonight to ask for city, state, federal funding.  It is a faith-based program.  As such, it needs to rely upon faith-based organizations.  It needs to rely upon the community of Chico.  This is an individual plea to every member in this city.  This is a city that wants to see an end to homelessness.  More importantly, an end to homelessness, a cure for homelessness.  Getting people off the streets without giving them a cure for what is ailing them is mute.  Mental health, rehabilitation, getting right with God and with themselves is the cure to this.  My plea tonight is not for the city council's help.  This is a venue for me to talk about this for the citizens of Chico to hear.  On August 17, 2015, the Chico Enterprise Record wrote an article about the Chico Rescue Mission.  It talked about a need of $700,000 in order to pay for this mission and where these men are living.  Chico responded.  They took care of it.  That need is now in the hands of the city council.  Now only $250,000.  Currently, the Chico Rescue Mission supports itself through the work vocation program and a few minor donations from the community.  Its day-to-day operations are being currently met.  But it's an old building.  It's an old motel.  In order for the Chico Rescue Mission to become the mission it needs to be, the resource that the city wants, we're going to need money.  We're going to need donations.  We're going to need people to support us.  Right now, Chico Rescue Mission has a website called Chicorescuemission.com.  People can log in.  They can make donations currently right there on that website.  People can come by.  They can visit the mission.  They can see the program.  They can make donations in person.  We need prayer.  We need money.  And we need volunteers.  The reality is, is these men, as they go through this program, come to a worker's phase.  Nine months of sobriety.  They go in the community and they get a job working beside you.  We need people who will be willing to give them a chance.  Who will hire them.  Who will help them in this process of reintegrating into society.  I don't expect everybody to agree with me or my thoughts.  A happy, healthy community is a diverse community.  This program will not be for everybody.  That's okay.  There's a lot of other programs out there that can help those that don't agree with the philosophy or the doctrine of the Chico Rescue Mission.  But I firmly believe it is the best solution for this city.  If I didn't, I shouldn't be here talking in front of you tonight.  I truly hope and truly pray that this Chico Rescue Mission can be the city on the hill that it needs to be.  It is my hope and my prayer that the Chico Rescue Mission will be a shining example of the value of the Chico Rescue Mission.  It is the best way to bring people to cities throughout all of Northern California on how to humanely, dignifiedly take care of homelessness and addiction.  Thank you for your time.  Thank you.  Okay.  I'm going to move on to the consent agenda at this time.  Item 2.1 obviously has been moved.  But all matters listed on the consent agenda are considered to be routine and nature.  Again, please note about 2.1.  And then are there any council no votes or disqualifications?  All right.  Seeing none, do we have any speakers?  We have three.  Okay.  And I'm going to call for the first two names.  And if you could line up in the middle aisle, it would be great.  James Hutchinson followed by Nicole Nava.  All right.  And if you were going to speak on 2.1, we can move here.  You would want to hold off and wait until that item is heard under regular.  Okay.  Thank you.  I seldom come before you and say somebody has done an MOU correctly.  But this on 2.2, the side letter agreement between Michigan and Managed Employment looking at that synopsis of it, that beautiful letter, has done well.  And I want to say thank you for laying out the purpose behind it, that it was part of benefiting the city as a part of the city as a whole.  well as benefiting the employees. It was nice to see. It's nice to see somebody doing it correctly.  Thank you. Thank you. Nicole Nava, followed by Greg Scott.  Good evening, Council. Nice to see you. I am, as you know before, was not a fan of diving into  the housing business for the city perspective because I feel like we have enough to contend  with outdated infrastructure and are frantically trying to get caught up, right? I think we all  know that. However, we are down that path. And as such, on 2.4, I just want to say it is good  that you are trying to grab what money you can because I think what people need to understand  is that may help us with having to dig less into our general fund to fund some of the needs for  the homeless here locally and other housing assistance.  Thank you.  Thank you. I want to say how much I appreciate the speaker who is here from the Chico Mission. I'm well familiar with their services and it is excellent. What I particularly think is important as we look at these grant funds and things like that,  Thank you.  Thank you. What I particularly think is important as we look at these grant funds and things like that, we go to dispense them and award grants to maybe service providers that are doing these things is to look at the components of their programs and see if it is something we as a community  components of their programs and see if it's something we as a community can get behind it.  And what I really appreciated about the gentleman's speech was bringing in the pieces about  accountability and it's okay to expect something of yourself and others. And it's okay if it's  also faith driven, if that's what somebody needs to pull themselves through and get sober, then I  think hurrah for them. I think that's wonderful and we should all be supportive of that.  I think that programs such as that one and the adult recovery program through Salvation Army  are worthy places doing extremely good work and that have good success rates for people  trying to recover. I've gone through the facilities before. It's been quite a long  time since the mission, but not so long since the ARP one. And I would just encourage people  to go visit and I also would encourage you to donate. After being refreshed on the Chico mission,  I  will make a donation there and appreciated hearing more about the services and the commitment to  helping people and pushing through. And the diversity aspect is also huge. We do have a very  different composition in our city. We have young students and people that are homeless that are  very young. We have the elderly and we have all manner in between lots of single males that also  have a great deal of trouble getting assistance if they don't have a tie to children or other  things like veteran service.  But they are Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese  Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese  Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese  Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese  Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese  Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese  Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese  Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese  publicly thank Tom  for his support and guidance.  It's been a pretty long  nine months as we're restructuring DCBA  and he's been very helpful and we  appreciate it. And hopefully  the confirmation  Dale has been to every meeting  and our councilman has been  to every meeting and we really appreciate  that. So I just wanted to say publicly thank you  on behalf of DCBA.  Thank you.  All right. Entertain  the motion.  Motion from Vice Mayor Reynolds, second from Council Member  Tandon. Madam Clerk, when you're ready.  Okay. And that was  a motion and a second to approve the consent agenda  with item 2.1 being heard under  regular business. Council Member Bennett? Yes. Council Member Morgan? Yes. Council Member Tannen? Yes. Council Member Van Overbeck? Yes. Council Member Winslow?  Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds? Yes.  Mayor Coolidge? Aye. Carries 7-0.  All right.  So we  will move on to public comments. Members of the  public may address the council at this time on any  matter not already listed on the agenda and  that are within the jurisdiction's authority.  So the council cannot take  any action on this meeting at requests  made under this section of the agenda.  I know we're going to have speakers on a variety  of topics, but let me just say  this because we did have some  issues last time around.  If and in fact  you want to talk about something relative to  the city of Chico and the area  and jurisdiction and the authority that  we have, that is fine.  If you want to talk about Israel or Hamas or  Ukraine or Russia in terms of international policy,  that's not what we're here for.  So very specifically, your comments must tie to the city  of Chico and within our areas and aspects of our purview.  This is very much a business meeting.  We are here to conduct the business of the city of Chico.  Signs, thank you for having them in the back.  We do not boo or clap.  And I heard a few earlier, we do not also make outbursts  during this meeting of any sort.  So we do not want to discourage anyone in any way,  shape or form or encourage anyone in any way, shape or form.  So please adhere to those rules.  If we don't have those, we will recess.  If we have to clear the chambers, we will do that.  We do not want to do that.  So how many speakers do we have?  We have 23.  All right.  Let's do two minutes.  Two minutes.  Okay.  So I'm going to call again.  Two names.  And if you could go ahead and line up in the middle aisle.  Dea Amar followed by Terry DeBose.  Good evening.  I'd like to present this to you.  The last time I was here, I presented the council with an agenda.  Or excuse me, with a resolution.  I would like for the council to agendize looking and adopting this resolution.  This resolution is to adopt a ceasefire in Gaza, as many other cities around the country  have.  I'm asking you to read it, look on it, agendize it.  This does affect the Palestinian folks, citizens in the city of Chico, myself included.  And I would be greatly appreciative if the city council would do something for us.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Terry DeBose followed by James Hutchinson.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Good evening, council.  Thank you for the opportunity to speak.  I'm here tonight on behalf of Congressman Doug LaMalfa to convey his enduring support  for our Jewish neighbors here in Chico and our United States ally, Israel.  Our Jewish neighbors deserve to feel safe in our city.  Unfortunately, anti-Semitism is on the rise.  It's in relation to Chico and the people in Chico.  Okay.  We need to have it directly related to the city of Chico and the business here.  It's...  Go ahead.  It's directly related to the previous...  We will not have outbursts.  Thank you.  It's in relation to citizens in our town.  So are you telling me I can't...  I need to stop?  What I'm saying is it has to be relative.  So Mr. City Attorney, we'll get his...if you can outline this for us so we're all clear.  Okay.  Thank you, Mayor.  What the Mayor is referring to is, as indicated on the agenda, the Council has certain authority  over certain items in their purview.  So as you know, this is a very complicated geopolitical issue that the City Council has  no authority to impact or affect.  And what happens when there's discussion that's outside of the City Council's purview is that  there is no ability for legitimate issues that are affecting the residents that is within  the City's purview.  So what the Council is indicating, the Mayor is indicating, is that discussion should be...there  should be a nexus between City of Chico issues that are within the City Council's purview  and any issues outside of the purview should not be discussed at this time.  It does impact other members of the audience' ability to discuss other issues that are currently  on the agenda or outside the agenda that is within the City's purview.  Okay.  So, and I'm just not understanding, so just, for, say, for example, Chico PD to protect  our citizens in Chico from anti-Semitism issues, that is not part of...  You can make that comment, but not relative to supporting whoever it might be that whoever  you think we should support internationally.  So you can relate your...  You can relate your comments locally.  So if that's your concern, address that concern.  I think that would be...fall within that.  Is my time running?  No.  No, I turned it.  You can run it if you want.  All right.  I'll run it.  Okay.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I understand your legal aspect somewhat, but I just don't agree, and I feel like we  need to stand up for our citizens in Chico, every single one of them, every one of them,  no matter what race, color, anything that they are, and I feel that this is important  in regards to that.  So if I'm just asking you to please consider the public, you know, your constituents need to feel safe.  There have been protests in the town. There have been things that have happened that have made people feel unsafe.  You know, whether they're Jewish or whatever they are, they don't feel safe.  And I think that's your job to protect them.  So thank you.  Thank you.  James Hutchinson, followed by Io Savage.  Forgive me if I change my original topic here.  June Elliott, when she ran for city council, called on the city council to make Zoom available to people who can't be here.  In Berkeley, they did an innovative thing where they had the same problem you did.  It's disruption of the meeting.  They adjourned for 15 minutes, came back, it was disrupted again.  What they did was they moved to Zoom.  It could limit the two minutes to individual speakers.  You're sitting at a computer.  Make your statement.  You get your two minutes.  That's it.  Whatever it is.  That way you do not disrupt the entire proceedings with people yelling and screaming.  You have individual chances of people.  I think June Elliott was right about that.  I think making Zoom an available thing for you to adjourn a meeting and take it to Zoom for that period of time,  for that particular problem that's causing the disruption, is a good idea.  It gives everybody a chance to at least make their statement.  If you're not going to follow through on it, you're not going to follow through on it.  That's all there is to it.  But give them a chance to make their statement in a way that is non-disruptive to the rest of us who have other business.  And other business I'd rather discuss tonight.  It's not going to happen, fortunately for you.  But in terms of procedure, I think you ought to consider it.  I think June Elliott was right about that way of doing it.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Our next speaker is Io Sasse.  Followed by Marie Rodriguez.  Hello.  I'm here as a Jewish person asking you to please agendize the resolution that was presented to you earlier  to call for a ceasefire and to also combat the rising Islamic phobia and Arab phobia  that our fellow community members and students are facing every day as it increases.  And thank you.  That's all I have to say.  Thank you.  Marie Rodriguez, followed by Rasha.  I'm here to request the agendizing of the proposed ceasefire resolution.  Additionally, the attempt to issue a cease and desist order against Council Member Addison Winslow  for openly discussing public business is a concerning act of political repression,  distorting the intended purpose of the Brown Act.  Upholding the public interest requires candid,  and open discussions by policymakers a commitment Winslow strives to uphold.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Our next speaker is Rasha, followed by Shahira.  Good evening.  My name is Rasha.  I am Muslim Palestinian American.  I've been in this town for 30 years, and I've been in America for 40.  So this town and this country has been my country longer than the country I came from.  But the Japanese are Japanese.  But Japanese are Japanese.  But Japanese are Japanese.  Japanese are Japanese.  Japanese are Japanese.  Japanese are Japanese.  Japanese are Japanese. But we do as best as we can and wherever we're sent to. It breaks my heart that my own people who I grew up as I was  Japanese are Japanese.  Japanese are Japanese. It breaks my heart that my own people who I grew up as I was born in Palestine, I came to this country when I was 11. So as I was saying earlier, this country has done a lot for me.  earlier, this country has done a lot for me. It has done a lot for my family. It has done a lot  for a lot of Palestinians and a lot of foreigners. But you in this room are here to serve us as  humans. Your last part of the pledge of the legion, it says liberty and justice for all.  So what makes this country great is the people that live in it. What made me come here,  because this has been my home. And whenever anything happens, I'm the first to stand and say,  no. I stand with the kid who can't speak for himself. I stand for the people who left their  homes in paradise because their homes burned and they had no one to help them. And they chose my  mosque.  I stand for refuge. The first person that came to me when the fire happened was a military guy.  And his first word that came out of his mouth was assalamu alaikum, which took me by shock.  I thought he spoke Arabic. But he knew how to greet me.  That's time. Thank you.  I'm here to be a voice for the children of Gaza. So please, please.  Thank you.  And thank you for the time.  Thank you.  Our next speaker is Shahira, followed by Lena.  Thank you for having me.  Very good.  Hello. My name is Shahira. I'm a student here in Chico. As a town that revolves around the  university and its students, I'd expect a little more support from our council as we ask for a  safer environment as our schools refuse to do so. After 9-11, high school students here in Chico  were given a task where they were asked which of these is a terrorist and had to choose between  Sinai and Gaza.  But they are Japanese and Shia, two branches of Islam. Your Muslim students had to choose  between which part of their faith makes them terrorists. Last meeting, your Muslim students  shared with you the rise in Islamophobia they are now facing, all of which are directly  associated with the violence in Palestine right now. It's been made clear in our experiences  as students that Chico is not a safe space for students of colour, and it never has been.  But they are Japanese, Japanese- Japanese- Japanese- Japanese- Japanese- Japanese- Japanese-  step in making sure students feel both safe and supported. I said this last time and I'll say this  again. We have had to take on your labor to ensure that the city of Chico is safe for our students.  Our voices will not be dismissed and your silence will only mean one thing. We'll continue to grow,  we'll continue to mobilize, and we'll continue to make an impact because if our schools don't  support us, our council doesn't support us, our only option is to turn to the community.  Rejecting this proposal and refusing to agendize it will not result in our silence but further  mobilization. We want to come back from break to a community where we feel safe, we feel supported,  and we can just focus on our learning and we hope that you'll consider agendizing and passing  this resolution. Thank you. Thank you. Elena followed by Annette Jefferson.  Hello, my name is Lana and I am a Palestinian student.  I was born in Chicago but was raised in Chico from the age of four. Both my siblings were born  in Paradise and raised in Chico. My nieces and nephews were born and raised in Chico. My family  has been, my family is here, my family is in Chico, but my other side of the family  lives in Palestine. My grandparents,  we are all members of your community. At the last meeting, we were told by the council,  the Japanese government, Japanese government, Japanese government, Japanese government,  Japanese government, Japanese government, Japanese government, Japanese government,  Japanese government, Japanese government, Japanese government,  Japanese government, Japanese government, Japanese government,  Japanese government, Japanese government  Japanese government, Japanese government  Japanese government  Japanese  Japanese  Japanese  Japanese  Japanese  Japanese  Japanese  Japanese  Japanese  As Chico residents, the 16,000 deaths of our people right now is something that impacts me, my family, and the Palestinian community in Chico every single day.  This is not a secondary issue.  We are not secondary citizens, and we are pleading for a ceasefire to stop the relentless violence against our people.  By refusing to agendize and pass a ceasefire resolution, the city of Chico has blood on its hands.  Thank you.  Thank you. Annette Jefferson, followed by Danielle Hildago.  Is Annette Jefferson here?  Okay, we'll move to Danielle Hildago.  I'm sorry if I mispronounced that.  Hidalgo.  Thank you.  Please agendize the updated resolution.  I'm very grateful for the resolution that you have been presented, a resolution that aims to support and protect our Palestinian American, Israeli American, Arab, Muslim, and Jewish community members here in Chico.  I'm a professor at Chico State, and I'm speaking up for my students who have, for the last two plus, nearly three months,  continued to be impacted by the devastating atrocities.  we're witnessing in Gaza  and hope you will seriously consider the resolution.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I have to relate your comments to the city of Chico  and what is happening here.  Thank you very much.  Our next speaker is Yamo Hakwa,  followed by Rain Share.  We received a document from DIA.  These are meant to go with that document for your review.  Last month, you were presented with a resolution,  a resolution that's been adopted  by even more city councils across the country,  and the same exact text that you're presented with  has been presented in Congress by Cori Bush,  the same exact text that we presented you.  So other city councils around the country  are showing that, in fact, this is within our purview.  This is how the government works.  Civics, there's levels of government, right?  Our local government,  you definitely do things  that are supposedly outside of your purview.  You talk about paradise.  You talk about things.  It's my time.  I understand it's your time,  but it's also the community's time.  So comments relative to local issues.  Exactly.  We do not...  Do you talk about...  You've been presented with a resolution.  That's my right.  Yeah.  Okay.  It's my right to present a resolution.  It's not your right to present a resolution.  It is, in fact, your right to speak on topics  within the purview of the city council.  Exactly.  Doing a resolution per our rules,  unlike other cities who don't have those rules  that they follow.  In our rules, it says very clearly  that we are not to do resolutions on issues  outside of our purview.  Okay.  I'll talk about your rules.  Talk about...  Talk about local issues.  That's fine.  Talk about what's happening internationally.  That's not our purview.  So, unlike other city councils that I've been at,  right,  there are many...  The majority that I've seen,  and across the country,  obviously do take into consideration...  This council has, in fact,  taken issues outside of their purview,  and they do it all the time as of now  for other places like paradise.  You know, that's not in your purview,  but yet you take positions on that.  You do moments of silence for that.  So, this also...  Usually, a city council to agendize a resolution,  which is absolutely the right of the public  to present to you,  usually takes one council member to propose it  and one to second it.  Yet, this council has its own set of rules,  special set of rules,  where it takes four of you  to even put something on the agenda,  which is incredibly undemocratic.  It's silencing of your people,  here.  You should be going the other way,  where it should make it easier for the public  to bring issues to you and you discuss them.  But there's obviously a political agenda  that is amongst particular political affiliations  amongst you that want to make sure  that nothing you want to talk about  gets put on the agenda.  That's quite obvious.  And I hope that we can vote some of you out.  Okay, thank you.  A brain chair followed by...  Excuse me.  Hold on one second.  Okay.  No snapping, no cheering, no clapping.  Please.  Thank you.  Is that a sign or is that illegal?  Ma'am, please do not make another outburst.  And if I could please queue up the next speaker,  which is Mohabin.  Thank you.  Go ahead, Rain.  Okay.  So, I have been in Chico since 2004,  and I have been a local small business owner since 2014.  I have been a community advocate and volunteer for many years.  I am here to ask you to agendize  the community proposed resolution for a ceasefire.  I am a Jew who was born in Jerusalem.  I am both an Israeli citizen and a U.S. citizen.  A central value of Jewish tradition is called Tikkun Olam,  which means repairing the world.  It is our duty to speak up for respect for all lives,  both here and abroad.  In addition to agendizing and adopting the proposed resolution,  I also urge you to be proactive to meet with local educators  and faith leaders to address the real experience and concerns  here in this community of the rising racist harassment  that particularly Muslim and Arab and Palestinian members  of the community have been facing.  This is a matter of public safety,  and that is certainly within the city's purview.  Actually, it is central to the city's purview.  If you actually read the resolution that has been proposed,  it speaks for the protection of both Israeli and Palestinian lives.  That speaks to our local community here,  which includes the Palestinian, Muslim, Arab community members,  as well as Jewish community members.  This is something that would actually take very little effort on your part to do,  though you seem to be really resistant to that.  And it could make a really big difference in the overall environment of our community,  and the general public safety to make such a statement.  Thank you.  Mohammed, followed by Shandana.  On Thursday, November 16th,  you, Mayor, came to Chico High School and answered some of our questions.  One question I asked was why can you guys, as the city council,  not send out a resolution or a statement?  But the Japanese government is Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese  Japanese  Otherwise, this is all we are asking from you guys as the City Council is to adopt the resolution and send out a statement.  I truly urge you guys to establish a resolution as perfect as the City of Richmond did, which we gave to you guys already.  One last thing before I end this off is neutrality supports the oppressor.  Continue oppressing.  Thank you.  Okay, Shandana, followed by Ramzia.  Hello, my name is Shandana, and I'm a student at Chico High.  I'm frustrated, as we all are, dealing with racism and discrimination in schools and other public areas.  This is a direct issue in Chico because I'm dealing with this, and so are my friends who go to Chico High.  Mayor, you came to our school, Chico High.  I asked you.  In the end of the club, I asked you if you as the mayor could write a statement for us Muslim and Arabs because we do not feel safe here in Chico.  You said that other council members did not agree with the idea of writing a statement.  We're frustrated with the ongoing cause and the effects it's having on all of us.  Why can't you write a statement knowing it will make us feel more safe in Chico?  Or do you just not agree with doing a statement to make us feel safe?  We are here asking you again.  Knowing you have the power to put out a resolution and a simple statement.  We're facing a lot of discrimination against our face and just by how we look like.  Again, we do not feel safe in school or outside of school, which is why we're asking for your support.  This is our last resort.  Otherwise, we wouldn't be asking here.  Okay, Ramzia, followed by Bill Monroe.  Hello.  Hello, my name is Ramzia.  My name is Ramzia and I'm a student here at Chico.  I want to start off by apologizing for our disorderly convenience students at the last meeting.  We understand the points of the committee and want to ensure that everyone has time to speak.  We are simply students who are frustrated because it feels as we have no place to go.  Islamophobia has been on the rise all over the country, especially in Chico.  At the last meeting, we shared our experience with rising Islamophobia on campuses and public areas in Chico.  But the Japanese government has been Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese  for the last 60 days of violence in Palestine  and adapting your resolution  would support your students and community  by bringing a halt to the justification  for this Islamophobia.  Over 50,000 women in Palestine are pregnant.  They are having surgery  without any medications  and mature babies are being killed.  So again, relate the comments.  Yes, they're being killed  because there's no electricity, there's no food.  And it's not within the city of Chico's purview.  It has to be within the city of Chico's purview.  Ma'am?  Okay, we're going to take a 10-minute recess.  Ma'am, you're disrupting the message.  We're going to take a 10-minute recess.  We're going to take a 10-minute recess.  We're going to take a 10-minute recess.  We're going to address.  We don't stop it now.  It doesn't ever end.  There are babies being killed  because they cut off electricity.

Thank you.  Thank you. Ma'am.  Ma'am. Ma'am. Ma'am. Ma'am.  Ma'am.  Ma'am. Ma'am. Ma'am.             Ma'am.  Ma'am. Ma'am. Ma'am.  Ma'am. Ma'am.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you. All right, folks, let's come back to order.  Let's come back to order.  No that's it.  Go ahead.  Oh hello.  I'm Bill Monroe.  I live in the fourth district.  We now have district elections.  I think this is a very important thing.  I think that people who have without indicating, people who have issues that are of concern  to them and they live in a certain district should contact their district representative.  Edison Winslow is mine.  He is in district four.  The others are all in different districts depending on what part of town you live in.  And that's a much more effective way I think to email and contact and speak with your individual  district folks.  If you want to get something done from the council.  And that being said, I was kind of shocked and amazed to see the article on the front  page of the ER today in which Edison was subject to a cease and desist order or some kind of  craziness in my opinion.  And I find that very, he is my representative.  He's my representative.  And I think that he was treated very disrespectfully and inappropriately by this council in closed  session.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Nicole Nava followed by Ann Harrison.  And if you could please line up in the middle corridor.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you. !  Hello again.  So I want to talk about safety.  I want to thank you for the encampments that are shrinking around town.  We still have some hot spots, of course, but I'm very impressed at the swift noticing that  happens directly upon conclusion of another, so things have tightened up there, and I think  our community very much appreciates it.  However, there are RVs and other vans and folks posting in the comments, not in the  up in neighborhoods who are making messes with trash and other and we're dumping raw sewage  and so people are calling that in tags from 2004 so and it's not a non-op he drives around  and this happens with other vehicles too I feel like there is like a different classist  thing happening here where if you're homeless you basically have a free-for-all pass and I know that  that's not the city's intent that's like DMVs involved too and others and people not being  willing to accept large vehicles and tow lots however it is a big problem and there's a safety  issue happening too with some of these folks the other is the city attorney it would be great if  we could please implement something where you can actually start doing the civil part related to  the prosecuting or maybe it's the criminal part when there are issues instead of  military  actions  the  other  element  of  safety  for  me  I  want  to  bring  up  that  the  local  Jewish  community  has  a  Hanukkah  celebration  downtown  in  the  city  plaza  this  Sunday  at  four  o'clock  that  looks  like  an  open  invite  and I  think  that  would  be  the  appropriate  venue  where  we  can  come  in  support  of  them  and  I  do  feel  for  the  Palestinian folks as well that feel that their people are unsafe too. So I hope we come together.  Thank you. Thank you. Ann Harrison, followed by Ann Palovka.  Hello. I have put together a list of action items that the council can take to address  local issues within our community. Number one, you can meet with local educators and school  officials to discuss ways to address the experiences of racism that students have shared.  Number two, you can reach out to community leaders, including those of community centers,  non-profits, and religious institutions, to ask what they are experiencing in the community.  Work with them on a plan to provide support. Make sure to include Palestinian voices during this  time. Number three, educate yourselves on local racial disparities in income, health care,  police violence, and school disciplinary  education.  Number four, stop shutting down the voices of those who are the most impacted. You cannot  speak for those who you have never listened to. Please agendize the resolution for ceasefire,  which was presented to you. Thank you. Ann Palovka, followed by Monica McDaniel.  Hello, council members. I'm speaking as somebody who's lived in Butte County and Chico for most  of my life, worked here for years.  For decades. And I'm speaking to the matter of purview. What's the purview of the council?  I've noticed over the years that I've lived here that we've had a history here in Chico  of affirming and expressing solidarity with those that are militarily involved in international  struggles. As examples, the photos on huge posters, huge banners along East Avenue that  have been decorated with the photos of young men and women serving in the armed forces.  And that's a way of promoting.  And honoring the military and those who choose to serve their country in international military  adventures. And Chico has adorned the front of this very building with a statue of a Hmong  general, deemed a U.S. hero in the Vietnam War. Again, a promotion of the military and  the militaristic way of resolving international political problems. And now local Chico people  are asking the council to affirm support and solidarity with those that nationally and  internationally are asking for an immediate ceasefire and an anti-U.S. military funding.  of Israel. So I ask also in support of council resolving to support immediate ceasefire  and an anti-U.S. military funding of Israel to protect lives that are being snuffed out  by the relentless bombing. And that instead those funds be redirected towards support  of some of Chico's and Butte County's, especially Chico's because we're Chico here. Basic needs  for housing, mental health care, addiction care. Thank you.  Thank you.  Monica McDaniel followed by Florence.  Good evening, council. I am the liaison between the Chico Arts Commission and the Chico Arts  and Culture Foundation. And I've been asked to just come and let you know we're having  a year-end mixer and we have invitations for you. And you can make it great. If not, we  wish you happy holidays and a happy new year. So I'll get those to you for now. Thank you.  Thank you. Florence followed by Gina Backs.  Thank you.  Hello. I am a local Chico resident my whole life. And I'm here to support the resolution  that Chico adopt to support a ceasefire. This is a resolution to local Palestinians, local  Muslim community in need of your support. And you can do these things that if you don't  want to do this resolution, you can show the constituents your support in other ways, like  Anna was talking about. Talk to your community leaders. Talk to the religious leaders here.  And see why there's so much racism and economic disparity in Chico. And see what you can do  as city council members to change that. Thank you.  Thank you. Gina Backs followed by Patrick Noll.  Good evening, council. First of all, I want to say that I'm very surprised none of you  have made a point of order. I'm very happy to be here. I'm very happy to be here. I'm  very happy to be in the City of Chico, when people make comments that do not belong to  the City of Chico. And I'm also very surprised that you didn't give Terry DuBois the opportunity  to speak when it was related to the safety of the Chico in the residents of Chico.  I don't know why, but, anyway, I also want to thank you for your continued dedication  for the City of Chico in the work you do to improve the quality of life of its residents.  I'm here to request you continue to vote in the City of Chico in the work you do to improve  continue to make this city a safe place for all members of our community, especially to  those who might be feeling threatened by some of the anti-semitic chants we have heard at  past meetings and also all over our community.  And please give the same opportunity to all to speak as you are doing with this group  here.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Our last speaker is Patrick Newell.  Good evening, and thank you for this opportunity.  My name is Patrick Newell.  I live in Chico, and I'm here to speak on behalf of funding by the city for the libraries.  I'm sure that you have heard that all the Butte County libraries are on the chopping  block for next year's budget.  To temporarily curb this, the county supervisors approved spending contingency funds that pay  for three additional days.  The county library branches would be open each week.  This was a one-time bailout.  Using contingency funds, the county library branches would be open each week.  This is the Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese  Japanese  Japanese  Japanese  Japanese  Japanese  Japanese  Japanese This was a one-time bailout using contingency funds to supplement the general fund monies until June, at which time the libraries will be open three fewer days per week. ! [inaudible]  works to develop its budget for the next year, please include funding for the Chico Public Library  branch. I urge the members of this council to work with their counterparts in the county  and with the county supervisors to collaborate and secure ongoing funding for the libraries.  We seek a return to full funding that will keep our library branches available to the community  at least five days a week. Thank you for your time.  Thank you, and that was it for business from the floor. Excuse me, public comments.  All right, item four, public hearings. If we don't have any, move me on to our regular agenda.  Item 2.1, resolution of the City Council of the City of Chico determining the  preparation of the active transportation plan.  And I believe we have a presentation from Mr. Ottoboni, Director of Engineering.  Oh, we do not.  Jeff.  Jesse Hudson will be taking this one.  Jesse's got the lead. Go for it, Jesse.  Good evening, Mayor and City Council members. My name is Jesse Hudson. I'm an associate planner  with the Public Works Engineering Department. As you know, we received a grant to prepare  an active transportation plan. This plan will identify a short-term action plan of  implementable projects while also establishing a long-term vision for improving city-wide  walking and bicycling. We included robust public input efforts during numerous phases  of its development. If adopted, this plan would supersede the  existing plan. We would also include a grant to prepare an active transportation plan.  We would also include a grant to prepare an active transportation plan. We would also include a  existing bicycle plan and continue the city's eligibility to apply for active transportation  program grants. I would like to introduce Summer Lopez and Todd Tregenza from GHD Inc.,  our consultant who helped prepare this plan. Summer and Todd will give a presentation highlighting  the development process of this plan and some of the main content of the document. We're  happy to answer any questions after GHD's presentation. Thank you.  How do I?  Oh.  Free Palestine.  Thank you.  How's that? There we go. All right. Thank you, Mr. Mayor, Council Members. My name's  Todd Tregenza. I'm a transportation planner with GHD. With me, I've got Summer Lopez,  who's also a transportation planner with GHD. We're looking forward to presenting our plan  to you here tonight, and we'll certainly be here for any questions you may have.  We'll be happy to answer any questions and answers at the end. We'll try to keep the  presentation snappy. We want to talk a bit about the background and goals of the plan.  Why are we updating this plan? Why are we creating this plan? We want to talk a bit  about some of the highlights, the prioritization, the improvement projects, the top ten, kind  of what next steps and what we believe that this plan accomplishes and where it takes  us from here. So what informed the plan? This plan rests on the shoulders of a lot of recent efforts that the city has undertaken.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you. We've added onto that. That plan strictly was for bicycle modes of transportation. This new plan, as the name implies, is all active modes, so that includes pedestrian modes as well. We do include some policy recommendations for the city to consider, perhaps when updating the circulation element of the general plan in the future.  the city to consider, perhaps when updating the circulation element of the general plan in the  future. It also includes some non-infrastructure programs. And again, it rests on a lot of a wide  planning foundation of citywide documents, including the general plan and local roadway  safety plan. The goals of the plan are, as you might imagine, to encourage active transportation.  These align with a lot of the state and regional as well as local goals and funding strategies,  funding criteria. So something you'll hear from our presentation is that we wanted to ensure to  align the plan. One of our key drivers was to align the plan and make the city eligible for  funding opportunities down the road. We wanted to also build on your investments. You've made a lot  of investments in cities' active transportation system, particularly trails,  and paths. And we want to make sure we connect those and maximize those. I'll talk a little bit about how we do that in the presentation.  So this is our project schedule. As you can see, we started our project last spring in April and had a lot of engagement throughout that time in this last year.  We released our public draft plan in October of this year and are now here tonight to talk about the final plan.  Engagement was very critical to the development of this plan. All of our recommendations were very  important. We're guided by public feedback. And the reason that it's such a high priority is because it really helps the city to  successfully receive grant funding in the future if their engagement is very strong.  And one of the reasons for that is many grant programs, especially the highly competitive and  sought after active transportation program, requires that engagement be not only robustly  conducted in the community, but also that it's written about in the application. And this plan  achieves that goal. So we're going to talk about that in a little bit.  So all comments that we've received during the public draft period, as well as any comments we received tonight from you or any public comment will all be included in an appendix after tonight.  This is just a couple of photos from our community engagement. From left to right, we have  our workshops, which is workshop one through three. These are some examples of our boards.  You see a dot board. I just wanted to give an example of how folks engaged with us and kind of  telling us about what types of facilities they preferred.  The right is comments that we received. And this is just one image of many that we had from maps,  of little post-it notes that people left comments on these maps during our workshops.  What we did with this information, we then took it back and digitized the comments onto our website,  which I'm going to talk about now for a moment. This was what our project website looks like.  It gave folks an opportunity to get involved, to learn about project background,  to kind of follow along with our schedule, with our public  events were happening, and of course, download any important project documents.  We also had a survey. And what we did with the survey was we presented it for folks who  attended the early workshop, but also anyone that maybe didn't get a chance to attend a workshop.  It gave them an opportunity to kind of have some questions to mull over and think about what type  of feedback they wanted to provide. And for those that did attend the workshops that also took this  survey, just kind of gave them a little bit of extra food for thought if they weren't able to  provide us all of their comments. And then we also had a survey that we presented to folks who  wanted to listen to the Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese  Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese  Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese  Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese  Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese  Japanese Japanese Japanese  Japanese Japanese Japanese  Japanese  Japanese  Japanese  In the very early phase of our workshops and our public engagement period, we actually received over 1,000 comments on this interactive map.  And some of the themes that we got through these comments were a desire to see more trails and the connectivity of Bikeway 99, enhanced trail amenities, better bicycle and pedestrian connectivity, improved and safer crossings, especially at intersections,  improved maintenance, which specifically addressed things like potholes or the actual condition of bicycle pedestrian facilities, as well as like leaves in the bikeways.  And, of course, lots of comments around safe routes to school.  Pass it back to Tom.  Thanks.  We're going to go back and forth just one more time.  I want to do a quick reorientation to the types of bikeways that are in this plan.  Some of these are things that you're already familiar with.  The city has a number of them already.  Class 1 shared use paths are outside of the street.  They're a separate right-of-way.  They can be used by cyclists and joggers, pedestrians, people with strollers, all of that.  Class 2 are essentially bike lanes.  These are pretty standard.  You've probably seen, well, you have definitely seen a number of these around the city.  And then there's an enhancement to that called the buffered bike lane, which is on the right of the screen, which adds a little bit more physical separation through paint between the cyclist.  And the motor vehicles.  Class 3 is a shared road.  This tends to be on a low-stress street, so a neighborhood street, some facility with less traffic, less conflict, a lower-stress environment for the cyclist where they can share the space with a vehicle.  It's kind of the least separated facility type.  And then the lower three are new to this plan.  And these are class 4.  And these are similar to bike lanes, the class 2.  But they are physically separated now, not just by paint, but by bollards or a curb or a planter box.  And so these are becoming a new tool in the bike planter toolbox.  And you will start seeing these pop up more and more frequently where appropriate.  So just some numbers on what the plan accomplishes.  You all already have a good amount of...  of bicycle infrastructure, but the plan really increases a lot.  You know, the class 1 trail system that I think you already should be very proud of, it's more than doubled in the plan.  So the plan at Build Out would more than double the amount of class 1 shared use paths.  It would also more than double the amount of bike lanes.  And it would more than double the class 3 shared bike and road environment.  There's also...  There's also an enhancement to that called a bike boulevard.  We can get into that if you have any questions.  But the last one is perhaps the most significant where you already have a short class 4 bikeway today.  But we call for a total of 25 miles of that.  And one thing I'll also note is that these recommendations, they were prepared.  We were looking at the entire city.  And so it was a relatively high level study.  These enhancement...  These project recommendations may be bolstered or modified during the delivery of the project.  But we wanted to at least have a preliminary recommendation based on the data that we had and the constraints that we had identified.  But new constraints, new opportunities will present themselves as the projects do materialize and continue down the development phase.  This is one of my favorite slides.  And it kind of answers the question, you know, why are we doing this?  And I hope that you can see it on your screens a little bit more clearly than I can see it on that one.  But on the left...  There's a map of what we call the level of traffic stress.  And that's where we basically put every street, every facility into one of four buckets.  The lowest stress, which is where you would feel comfortable taking your kids of all ages.  They can ride...  It tends to be, you know, shared use paths or streets, maybe neighborhood streets with very low traffic volumes to level of traffic stress for.  These are the red lines on the map.  And these are the ones where really...  Unless you're the most experienced.  Unless you're the most avid and confident cyclist.  You're not going to be showing up on those roads.  Those include things like East and Eaton.  You know, your major arterials, Highway 32, Park Avenue, things like that.  So then the middle image is your low stress network today.  And what you can hopefully see is that there's lots of pockets of low stress.  These are your local neighborhoods.  And what's preventing connectivity between them.  So people need to get across these red line barriers.  And they can't, right?  Because there's these stressful networks that are breaking apart the stuff they want to get to.  Whether they want to get to work, school, church, whatever it is, right?  The improvements that we get from implementing the bikeway is the map on the right.  And you can see all those pockets are connected.  So the plan at build out, which albeit is a large build out.  It will take many years to build the entire thing out.  But at build out, we plan for a connected system that eliminates those barriers.  Those stress islands.  Those low stress islands.  Anyway, sorry.  I'm geeking out on that a little bit.  But I also want to talk about the pedestrian mode.  This was new.  This was added.  Pedestrians can obviously benefit also from the class 1.  Those shared use paths.  Those trails.  There's more than 120 crossing improvements.  There's a lot of funding for flashing beacons.  Bulb outs that bring pedestrians closer.  Tighten in the crossing distance.  And more than six miles.  Which is a modest number of sidewalks.  Because frankly you have sidewalks in most places.  But we did want to close those gaps we identified.  So this is our recommendations development process.  As you can see, we held outreach and engagement throughout this entire process.  We began with the needs assessment.  That helped us look at identifying the gaps in the bicycle and pedestrian connectivity.  Collision history.  The LTS analysis that Todd just mentioned.  As well as looking at public comment.  We then moved into our project recommendations phase.  And then prioritization.  Which was our methodology for determining how to score these projects.  We also did a stakeholder presentation series.  Which was a mini presentation series.  With the Chico active transportation technical advisory committee.  Chico staff.  BCag.  In low.  Area.  Area.  finalized all of this as part of the draft plan, taking it back out to workshop three.  This is our methodology process, and its purpose was to really help us dig in and discover  which projects would rise to the top of the lists. And all of this came from grant language  or requirements, and it will really help the city to write narratives for grant applications  that are strong and competitive. And the things that we looked at included safety,  connectivity, gap closures, public comment, multimodality, safe routes to school, and equity.  There's themes here kind of going on that we've found throughout our entire public engagement  process, and we wanted to represent that here. It also really, like I said, mirrors the criteria or  the requirements in grant program language, specifically the active transportation program.  And then just how this will work in practice is we ended up actually with one list of priority  projects that we were able to get to. And then we also had a list of projects that we were able to  get to. And then we also had a list of projects that we were able to get to. And then we also had  realized that we really needed to separate it into two. There's kind of low-hanging fruit,  achievable projects that added on to a maintenance project may only be in the tens of thousands of  dollars. So we had these low complexity projects that we wanted to pull out and separate from the  bigger projects. The bigger projects are pouring new concrete, whether that be a class one or the  class four designation that I mentioned earlier. Those tend to be the more expensive ones.  And again, this is high level, but it's a first raw,  complex project that we're trying to get to. And then we also had a list of projects that we  wanted to separate in order to separate the cost of the cost of the cost of the cost of the cost of the We can start assembling projects together here and adding in, when you are putting together your grant application,  of  the  cost  cost  of  the  cost  of  the  cost  of  the  of  the  cost  of  the  cost  of  the  cost  of  the  cost  of  the  cost  of  the  cost  of  cost  of  And then these are the higher complexity ones.  As you can see, they're almost entirely class one or class four bikeways.  So bigger projects provide a lot of benefit, but clearly more expensive.  We also have proposed policy recommendations, and these really cover the five E's of non-infrastructure.  Including these does not mean that the city is immediately adopting any new policies,  but rather they're here to really help set the city up for success in receiving grant funds.  And what I mean by that is that these are kind of quicker to implement solutions,  and they also really help strengthen an infrastructure application, which I'll talk about in just a second.  But these policy recommendations under these five E's include things like training programs, hazard reporting,  bicycle detection, and then signage to indicate that bicycles are in the roadway or pedestrians are coming, etc.  Those are just a few examples.  We also have non-infrastructure as part of this.  And again, this is also a very powerful tool to pair with an infrastructure project,  specifically in the active transportation program's combination project type,  which blends infrastructure and non-infrastructure together in one application.  Overall, historically, those projects tend to score higher and receive more funding more often than other projects that are standalone,  such as non-infrastructure only or infrastructure only projects.  The strengthening piece of this, the reason that this makes projects stronger,  when you include things like those policy recommendations or non-infrastructure as part of an infrastructure application,  is because it shows commitment by the city to include active transportation at all levels and for all people.  It also helps to teach and encourage the public to use active modes,  which is really important in shifting ideology or shifting behavior change, getting people out of their cars,  all of that stuff is really important, especially when the city makes such a strong investment in actually building infrastructure.  We want people to use it.  So these things help do that.  So what does this plan accomplish?  It identifies and documents challenges and priorities.  It describes all types of projects and proposed recommendations.  It provides an achievable strategic plan for implementation,  and it includes grant-ready content that will kickstart future funding applications.  Ultimately, we really want this plan to lead to real on-the-ground projects that enhance the quality of life for Chico's residents  and creates a safer and connected bicycle and bicycle community.  It also includes a plan to build a pedestrian network for people of all ages and abilities.  To do that, again, the city must be successful in receiving different types of funding, specifically grant funding.  And so that's really why this plan exists.  It's here to help set the city up for grant readiness and ultimately to be successful in actually receiving funding.  That's all we have.  So I think I'll turn it back to Brendan.  Nothing further from me.  Great job.  So I guess we'll toss it over to Brendan.  I'll toss it back to the council for consideration and open up for public comment.  All right.  Questions from the council before we go on to public comment?  Mr. Winston.  First, I just want to say, great job.  I don't know that I've ever seen such robust public comment and engagement through the whole process.  And I just kind of went to the workshops, met you guys there, and seen a whole lot of people be involved.  And it's a really high-level project that involves a lot of details about our streets.  And people are from different parts of the city.  And I'm familiar with them.  So we got a lot of really good info.  So I have all the public comment right here.  And it's just like, yeah, there's a lot.  It's even denser than it looks, really.  You mentioned that class four, no, sorry, not class four.  Class three is a bicycle boulevard.  And that's, you know, what I want to understand is you say this is an achievable plan.  And I want to make sure that what is achievable about it isn't held up by what you think is feasible up here.  That we're not going to hold up a more ambitious plan for making our streets better.  And that we're not going to hold up a more ambitious plan for making our streets more safe.  So could you explain what a bicycle boulevard is, how it differs from a class three, and why we would in certain places propose just a class three and not a bicycle boulevard?  Yeah.  I think I'll start.  And then, Todd, if you have anything to add.  So bicycle boulevards often include traffic calming measures as a part of the actual, like, class three.  And, again, we didn't really get super into it.  But the reason that we might propose a class three would be on a very slow pace.  Like a much slower street, like a residential street or something that's lower in that traffic stress.  So when we rated the streets for the level of traffic stress that's rating the comfortability of a cyclist in a roadway, a score that is at a one or a two is something that's far more comfortable.  It's usually, like, less than 30 miles an hour.  Something that's just a slow, usually residential street.  Those might call for a class three.  And the reason that we might want to suggest a class three boulevard versus a just, like, a class three street.  And that's a class three bike route.  We would do that because it might be a street that maybe it's something that's closer to downtown.  Maybe it's something that's on a residential street that needs to be slower, that needs to maybe have some speed humps or something else to kind of slow the traffic down.  In addition to allowing the road space for bicyclists to use.  Do you have anything to add to that?  Some minor things about bike boulevards is that you tend to reduce the amount of traffic control for the cyclist.  So if there's stop signs, you want it to be on the side streets.  You want to give the cyclist priority.  And then they often include some sort of way finding.  And it may be really useful in closing the gap between a trail system.  If you have a nice local street, you can continue some way finding, you know, this way to Bidwell or, you know, something like that.  Yeah.  So one of the examples, and I know that we could get, like, into so much detail on this because even just that, like, proposed bicycle facility map or pedestrian project map.  Is like very, I mean, just the whole city, right?  And we're looking all over the place.  But one, C and O, this avenue goes right by Pleasant Valley High School.  And this proposed class three bike grow, but not a bicycle boulevard.  And that's the kind of thing I'm like, well, what, you know, maybe we can bump that up with something I've had in mind.  But a couple more questions about crosswalks and protected bike lanes.  So in the, in that survey, the 152 responses that you mentioned, in crosswalks, we had people,  62% of people said they were more comfortable with high visibility markings.  And after that, pedestrian refuge islands and a little piece of concrete in the middle of the street that, and flashing beacons at 55%.  And so you guys are the consultants, so maybe it's not even a great question for you.  I don't see a policy that, like, really has a hard improvement on current policy with regard to crosswalks.  It's a concern of mine because of a few recent projects that have removed painted crosswalks.  An intersection is still a legal place to cross the street, but it just becomes less safe.  So on Park Avenue, 15th Street, 17th Street, 18th Street all had crosswalks prior to the rehabilitation.  And then they're lost.  And I wonder, I mean, do you think there's anything in the plan that would prevent something like that from happening again?  That's the question I said.  Or can a policy be added to this?  Is this what I'm looking for there?  Yeah, I'll take that one.  So that is more of a traffic.  Yeah.  It's a traffic operations kind of element.  And so from a crosswalk standpoint, there's a time and a place for those.  So there's a lot of different factors.  So I think it's difficult to have an overarching policy that would say in these situations apply this because there's a lot of different applications and uniqueness to scenarios.  And so in terms of, like, Park Avenue, that's a major arterial roadway with higher volumes at higher speeds.  So from a safety standpoint, not wanting to put pedestrians in an unsafe condition.  It's a very complicated condition where they're trying to cross a five-lane roadway without any sort of traffic control device.  I think that's more of a safety concern.  So we evaluate them at, like, the project level of when and where they make sense.  Obviously providing locations for pedestrians and bicyclists, mostly pedestrians for crosswalks, to cross a major thoroughfare like that.  We want it to be in a controlled manner so that it's safe.  And so across town you've seen a lot of the rapid flashing beacons.  It's a very complicated issue.  And so we want to make sure that we're not going to have to go up in those types of scenarios where it's not like a traffic signal control, but it is a mid-block crossing that we want to make sure there's a safe mechanism to notify motorists that there is someone in the street trying to cross that roadway.  In other cities that you work with, have you seen similar things or policies to try to, like, maybe increase the level of priority?  Like, if we're rehabilitating a road and we're now seeing traffic speeds are so high it's no longer safe to cross, well, previously we had a paid-in crosswalk.  Like, can we set the priority to safe crossing of these streets on a more general level, I suppose, looking at the plan?  I think it's difficult to have a global policy because there are, you know, so many factors to consider when it comes to actually implementing the project.  Similar, going back to your question about the Class 3 versus the Boulevard, you know, I think that conditions during the time of the project being implemented, you know, are going to be very, very difficult.  But once those are implemented, I'm sure the city would look at opportunities to make it the best bikeway possible, right, balancing the different priorities.  So to the extent that I've seen circulation elements that, you know, promote the construction of the striping of crosswalks and the construction of ADA ramps, yes.  But I think there's hesitation to do that.  I think that's a very difficult question.  I think it's very difficult to make global requirements and standards before you're able to, you know, uncover all the facts on the ground.  I'm not sure I answered your question, but it's kind of a tricky…  Yeah, I mean, it sounds like the answer is it is tricky to…yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  Moving on to just a question on protected bike lanes.  So similar from the survey, what we had is 91 percent said they would feel comfortable completely separate from mobile traffic, and that's expensive.  There's right-of-way constraints and such.  But what I'm more of a…  think is important is there's  77% people said that  physically separated, so class 4 bikeway  that makes them feel comfortable.  Wide painted buffer was down below at 61%,  62%. Well, just  the dedicated bicycle lanes  adjacent to traffic, that's just 27%. So there's  a 50% spread of people.  These are people who fill out the survey, which probably  leans towards people who ride bikes already, right?  And we're trying to look at other  people. This plan's not for me. I already ride a  bike. I'm comfortable, but it's for people who would  if  things were different.  So there's a number  of streets here where we  have currently class 2  bike lanes, just a painted  strip, oftentimes high  stress, high traffic,  and fast speed  roads where we don't propose any  upgrades at all. And I'll mention  there's Notre Dame and Forest  Avenue I mentioned because  this isn't our capital improvement plan. In the next  few years, we should be repaving these roads, so  it'd be the opportunity to upgrade these facilities  where there's existing class 2,  but no proposed upgrade.  Warner Street is another example. It's the  entrance to the university. We have specific policies in our  general plan promoting  safer entrances into the  university, and I believe there's even conversations  up until now  about improving those facilities.  So is there a reason why  there are no proposed upgrades here?  And can we  recommend addition of some  more...  more...  safer facilities?  May I suggest this is not the right venue  to do the engineering  at this level of detail?  I really love the plan.  I'm a cyclist,  but I think this is a level  of detail that needs to get worked out in a  different venue.  Thank you.  This is the plan. These are  just examples. I could go on, trust me.  I know you can.  Just in general, the concept is we have existing  class 2s. The reason we put these bike lanes  in until now because they are priority  bicycle routes, but in the past we considered  that that was good enough, and we found that it's not.  So, Council Member Winslow, I'd just say  at this point, let's ask questions.  So if you have further  questions, and then  save comments for the comment.  The question is, do you see  the opportunity, or did you find physical constraints when you  did not recommend upgrading these  bicycle facilities that already exist?  So, I might take a first step.  There are certainly  some  things that we're not going to do.  There are some  modal conflicts and constraints out there on some of your busier roads.  It kind of goes back to the map I was showing where we want to make sure we're connecting  people to these low stress routes.  And so, East Avenue with bike lanes may never become comfortable for everybody to bike on.  And I think that's okay as long as you have redundancy in your system that there is a  path of least resistance, a path of comfort for all ages.  And so, I believe that that was one of the things that we wanted to do.  And that's one of the things we wanted to make sure we accomplish with this project.  I personally, I would always advocate for the most robust active transportation facility you can put in.  You know, even at the expense of other modes sometimes, but that's not the role of the plan to propose, you know, road diets everywhere, which is what you would need to achieve that.  I think those are going to be corridor level specific studies that are going to need to address that and look at the pros and cons.  But I do believe that that connectivity of the low stress network is going to get you a long way towards encouraging people to get out and seek alternative ways around.  But I think you have something to say.  Just one thing to add.  We actually put a few disclaimers in the plan that states that any existing recommendations in this current plan can be upgraded at any time based on safety need, based on feasibility studies and public comment.  A lot of the projects will require more like public engagement before they go out to the public.  But they are pre-planned in the sense that they are pre-planned in the sense they are pre-planned in the sense they are pre-planned in the sense they are pre-planned in the sense they are pre-planned in the sense they are pre-planned in the sense they are pre-planned in the sense they are pre-planned in the sense they are pre-planned in the sense they are pre-planned in the sense they are pre-planned in the sense they are pre-planned in the sense they are pre-planned in the sense they are pre-planned in the sense they are pre-planned in the sense they are pre-planned in the sense they are pre-planned in the sense they are pre-planned in the sense they are pre-planned in the sense they are pre-planned in the sense they are pre-planned in the sense they are pre-planned in the sense they are pre-planned in the sense they are pre  point actually you know engineer it design it and then move forward from  there but it can change at any point I think is the point that there's several  disclaimers that state that so thank you I will admit when I when I read that  sort of disclaimer I was thinking more that's a that's a reason to downgrade  the facilities in the future not so much that we would bump it up because in this  plan we should be shooting for you know the most optimistic outcome  understanding that it will take decades and lots of commitment in the future to  make it happen but thank you for answering the questions all right for  the questions thank you very much all four of you thanks yeah and public  comment we have four speakers all right three minutes okay and by Kirk Kaufman  followed by rain chair hello so I'm a founding member of the Chico safe  streets coalition  and so I've been riding my bike around Chico for 33 years plus and I use my  bicycle primarily for transportation and I almost never drive anywhere and I'm  lucky I live along lower bidwell Park so I can use the park as my main thorough  firm not everybody is that lucky so a lot of people tell me they would love to  do what I do but there is no safe way for them to get from their home to their  house to where they need to go so I'm really happy to see the city of Chico is  preparing this transportation this active transportation plan but I think  we could be more ambitious than what the plan currently is so the most important  change the city could make to encourage active transportation and really make  this city even better than it already is is to just rethink the purpose of  of transportation infrastructure.  And I feel that the purpose should be  to facilitate human activities that maintain  and enhance the quality of life for all residents of Chico  and to not look at the transportation system  as just a way to move as many cars as possible,  as quickly as possible.  So one thing that we could do is we could just decide  that every project that involves repaving a road  in Chico should make that street then safe  for bicyclists and pedestrians  and all the other forms of active transportation,  including say adaptive hand cycles.  So for example, the current transportation plan calls  for a lot of painted bike lanes to be added,  but a lot of those could be class four,  say parking protection,  or some other protected bike lanes  or some other way protected bikeways.  We could beef it up.  And so basically what I'm asking is,  please do beef up this as much as you can  and pass it and then implement it.  Thank you very much.  Thank you, Rain Share followed by Bill Monroe.  I'll be relatively brief and I'll sincerely apologize  and admit that I am not thoroughly educated on the proposal  and I did have to step out for part of the presentation.  But I do wanna say as someone who's lived in this town  for 19 years, that more safety for bicycles  and pedestrians is super important.  And I support anything that increases that,  increases the accessibility of as much as possible  of the town for bicycles and pedestrians.  I have known countless people who have been hit,  sometimes very, very seriously injured  by vehicles while riding their bicycles,  including in downtown Chico,  a friend of mine who had a severe head injury  and was temporarily paralyzed and wheelchair bound  for an extended period of time  because she was hit on her bicycle in downtown Chico.  And yeah, so that's a serious problem.  And the only thing that I wanna add to that,  which is, you know, like as much bike lanes  and pedestrian access as possible  and minimizing car use and increasing more  public transportation options when feasible,  as far as buses, et cetera.  And I just wanna add to that,  that it's also really important to make sure  that as we are increasing the accessibility for bicycles,  pedestrians who are walking,  that we're also making sure that places  that become less accessible to cars are still accessible  to disabled folks who are ambulatory impaired,  who use wheelchairs and other mobility devices.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Bill Monroe, followed by Bruce McLean.  Yes, well, what a great plan.  And I hope you guys,  I'm pretty sure you guys are gonna vote this in.  So that's fantastic.  I have a critique, however, about the presentation.  One of the first photo illustrations in your presentation  was of a woman on a bicycle, smiling, really beautiful,  no helmet.  And it's not funny.  It's not funny.  I'm a public health, excuse me.  You have to address us.  I'm sorry, that's right.  I'm a public health nurse and I've seen the results  of bicycle accidents without helmet.  I fell on a bike.  Once with my helmet, the helmet was destroyed  and my brain was not, but maybe that's the way I am,  the way I am.  But there was another illustration later on  toward the end of the presentation of a woman driving,  riding her bike in front of,  looked like in front of the university,  also with no helmet.  And I would recommend that the city  and all your publications about bicycles  and that every time there's someone on a bicycle  or about to get on a bicycle,  that person needs to have a helmet on  because we have to normalize this behavior.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Bruce McAleenan is our last speaker.  Hi, I'm also, I admit to being a cyclist.  I'm also a member of the Chico Safe Streets Coalition.  My vision of what I'd like to see Chico go towards  actually comes from my experience  and my experiences, extensive experiences in cycling  throughout the country of the Netherlands.  You can cycle from one end of Holland or the Netherlands  to the other and be on a protected bicycle only lane  without ever coming in contact with a car.  It's not surprising that two thirds of the Dutch people cycle.  It obviously has lots of benefits.  Health wise, life extension, limited pollution.  And I'm impressed with the program,  but my vision is to have as many,  and I feel safest on designated bike lanes.  And as I cycle around and through Chico,  I try and maintain those lanes.  Many of those lanes need to be repaved  like little Chico Creek.  I gave those comments.  When we were giving comments on the bike plan,  it's gotten to the point where it's almost,  it's difficult to cycle on because it's so bumpy  and full of cracks and creaks.  But I encourage you to approve this plan  and put us in a position where we can seek  as much external grant fund  to improve our whole cycling network in Chico.  Thank you.  Thank you and that ends our speakers.  This item.  All right, comments from the council.  Yeah, I have one question I forgot to ask.  Definitely a Brendan Audubon question.  What would be the implications of providing  for the direction and delaying approval of the plan?  Well, time and consultant time is money.  So take more money and time.  The intent of an adopted ATP is to be leveraged for grants.  So pushing up against potential future ATP grant applications.  I think it's important to remember  that this is a planning level document  that is continually updated, you know, every so often.  And so there's always the opportunity to add to it  and tweak it.  So my personal recommendation would not be to delay it,  but more we could add commentary to it.  I believe Summer mentioned at the beginning of the presentation  that comments received through this process,  can be included in the appendices of the document.  So I think there's a way of achieving additional information  by also moving it forward.  And again, it's gonna be a living, breathing document over time.  So continuing to add on or enhance it  is always the option as well.  One short follow up.  In the event we did provide direction,  would you rather be very specific about streets  or rather be general about some upgrades we'd like to see?  I think both kind of can be used, because, you know,  especially as it relates to projects that are the outcome  or derived from the plan,  it's good to maybe add specific locations  for specific types of treatments.  But then there's also the opportunity to kind  of speak more globally to policies  or general applications of things.  So I think it can be both.  Okay. I am ready to propose a motion.  Okay. Let's see.  Anyone else has comments?  Yeah, I would like to ask to direct staff  to come back with a,  to return to council with the plan  after seeking opportunities to upgrade proposed facilities  from class two bike facilities to class four  or class two buffer, class three to bicycle boulevard.  Yeah, and some specifics, just to make sure that we're  clear on the plan.  So, I think the plan that we're trying to do  is to make sure that we're not just going to be  looking at the  I was just going to say,  I think we're getting into the weeds  and we're trying to do an overall plan,  but we don't know what money we have to spend.  All this is so we can go apply for grants to do projects.  Those upgrades would be great,  but until we have money to do them,  we don't even know if that's possible.  So spending more staff time and more time  with our lovely consultants that I think we spent $299,724  with already might not be the best use of funds.  Let's do this and see where we get grant funding at  and then determine if we can upgrade those.  It's my initial thought.  All right.  Thank you.  Our engineering director made the comment  that this is a high level planning document.  And I think that's where we need to move it forward,  but keep it at that level and not be mandating details  of specific levels of bike paths  for specific locations at this time.  But I'd like to see it move forward.  Okay.  So let me ask you a question then.  So if in fact, would you reverse it out past plan?  And have them bring back those three facility, three roads?  So pass the plan and come back and review the plan soon?  Yeah, with the possibility of.  We did that with the urban forest master plan.  It worked fine, right?  True.  Mr. Alderman, what do you think?  I'm not sure the level of effort that might take.  So it's hard to articulate maybe what that might consist of.  What you might do is offer direction to staff  to include or consider those.  And we can amend with your direction tonight  so we can achieve approval  while also considering those, that input.  I'll just again reiterate that as a high level plan,  there's always gonna be the feasibility of those.  We're not getting into the weeds here on each location.  And so whenever we do a project, we evaluate this of how  to enhance and incorporate.  Bicycle and pedestrian facilities.  So the plan has given us a general roadmap for connectivity,  but there's always the opportunity to enhance like a decrease  or increase the classification of bike facility.  So again, high level plan that's eventually going to be  analyzed in a much more microscopic way when we get down  to a project level detail.  And I guess, and I'd probably say this is Mr. Wood's concern.  And as it is a little bit of mine, we don't get to,  and rightfully so, we don't get to get into the weeds with you.  But sometimes what that ends up with is our constituencies being  ignored in terms of what they want.  So I know like for example, I'll agree with Mr. Winslow  on Warner Street is I have an outcry of people in my district  who want Warner updated for bicycle traffic  because of the kids that are on it.  So, you know, I don't want to agendize that specific item,  necessarily.  But at the same time, I don't have any other place  to voice it.  So that's where my level of frustration comes in.  Okay.  Yeah.  And I guess context is important.  So which portion of Warner Street,  because the right of way for Warner from Second Street  to West Sacramento is a lot wider.  But I mean, I'm just saying, you know,  that's I think the frustration that you feel.  Gotcha.  And you know, the hope is that we've done as we presented  a tremendous amount of public outreach that those types of,  that type of feedback was garnered through that process.  But again, we can always amend the adopted plan as well.  So I guess partially it's hard for me to sit here  and support maybe coming back later on because we can adopt it  and always add it and amend it.  Sure.  Yeah.  No.  And I think that's a more efficient way  of doing it personally.  Okay.  And what would you suggest as a timeline for bringing it back  and amending it if we were to include it in the plan?  Yeah.  We can strategize with our with GHDR consultant and look  at coming back timely if, you know,  within the next couple of meetings.  I think that would be appropriate.  I just think that when we send this meeting off, this is like our,  this is the scale of our commitment to saying  that safety is paramount on our streets  and that we're undoing incrementally 80 years  of automobile dependence  and really changing the orientation of our streets.  It is the high level planning.  But this is like how high are we shooting  for is what I'm seeing here.  And I think just to describe that, you know,  maybe to reiterate the general pattern that I see is  where we have existing bike lanes  that were considered maybe the best we can do at the time,  but now we have higher expectations.  We're looking at putting in protected bicycle infrastructure  to keep people separated from car traffic.  And where those bike lanes are put are really priority places  and I see that they were not included in proposed upgrades.  Okay. And I wouldn't necessarily agree with you  on all those points, but I do agree that, you know,  we need them.  So would you reverse your motion then?  Yeah.  And you'll get a second?  Reverse motion, but include then that we're going to  So basically say we're going to approve the plan,  but at some point, yes.  Come back in a timely manner to review some  of the proposed pedestrian bicycle facilities policies.  So what was your motion?  Well, so motion, now it's a totally different motion.  So let me just make it.  And then motion to approve the plan while directing staff  to return to review the proposed list of bicycle  and pedestrian facilities and policies within the plan  to potentially beef them up.  Sure.  May I request that the clerk read the motion?  Sorry.  You know what?  For the first time in probably 23 years, I can't.  I'm sorry.  I have that.  The original motion was to approve the plan, but I'm sorry.  So the second motion was to direct staff  to come back with the plan.  There were a number of items that.  I forget that one.  Councilmember, I recognize,  but I need to go back into it,  to address Notre Dame, Forest Avenue, Warner, those items.  And then it was to then approve the plan  and have staff return to review the other areas?  Are the areas that you?  I said, because there's a lot of things in the plan,  the proposed bicycle position, the bicycle position,  which is a map for post-pedestrian facilities also a map and policies which  are like three pages within the document okay and then it was seconded by mayor  Coolidge. Councilmember Bennett. Yes. Councilmember Morgan. Yes. Councilmember Tandon. Yes. Councilmember Van Overbeck. Yes. Councilmember Winslow. Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds. Aye. Mayor Coolidge. Aye.  Carry 7-0. We're gonna take 10 minutes or we're gonna take a break.  I won't put a exact number in case we come back at one minute or one minute and a half.  All right back from recess.  Hope everybody got a turn on the swings.  All right. 5.1 consideration to execute a work order with PG&E for project  proposal phase 3 under SST program using internal financing. A report from Eric Guff.  I'm being held hostage here to give my presentation. The other department heads  paid me to not allow Eric to ever make a presentation.  Just saying.  Sorry.  Just for that I have a long robust one.  Thank you Councilmember Morgan.  That's time.  All right tough crowd tonight but we'll get through this.  Mayor Council members Vice Mayor thanks for the opportunity to speak to you tonight.  This is the phase three projects of our on-go-bound program.  multi-year sustainable solutions turnkey program, a partnership with PG&E and Southland Energy out  of San Diego to deliver energy conservation projects and meet our climate action and cost  reduction goals. A quick overview. We'll just touch on kind of a review of the SST program.  We haven't talked about it for a couple of years, so just a quick review. Talk about the phase three  projects, our energy conservation measures, as you'll see in the presentation. Talk a little bit  about the financing and a tax credit through the Inflation Reduction Act that we're eligible for,  and then land on a staff recommendation. So the SST program is an opportunity to do deep  energy efficiency audits that result in large-scale energy conservation measures, so ECMs,  which are the projects. You'll hear that term a lot through the presentation. And this really  started back in fiscal year 15-16, where we retrofitted all of our streetlights, our 7,000  streetlights.  That was kind of our first infancy SST program project. And then phases one, two were much  larger projects that delivered big savings on the energy front. The SST program is unique.  It's mandated, excuse me, the public utility PG&E is mandated by the CPUC to push out energy  conservation measures to local agencies. And so why not take advantage of that? And per the  California Government Code, we're able to partner with PG&E and contract with them in their  subcontracts.  So we're able to partner with the subcontractors to deliver design, project management, and  deliver the overall projects.  The Sustainable Solutions Turnkey Program objectives are pretty robust. We'll go through these  quickly.  First and foremost, reduce energy consumption and costs, improve facilities performance  and comfort.  We replaced almost all of our HVAC systems at city facilities over the last few years,  and also brought in building automation to make the controls much easier.  And we're able to do that in a very streamlined way.  So hopefully everybody's more comfortable in our city facilities.  Improve infrastructure, reduce maintenance costs and demands, which are important to us.  Advance our climate action goals of greenhouse gas and CO2 emissions reductions.  Leverage cost savings to fund the projects.  That's what's unique about these energy conservation projects is that we utilize, we deliver the projects  and then utilize the annual savings to pay for the projects in many instances.  And this is a big one, especially tonight.  Insulate the city from a lot of the energy that's going on in the city.  We insulate the city from large capital replacement costs.  So these projects that you're going to see tonight, we have to do anyway.  So by partnering with the utility and their subcontractors to deliver these projects,  we insulate ourselves from upcoming capital project or capital replacement costs, some  of which we would have to do on an emergency basis, which is never efficient or effective.  So that's kind of a main staple for tonight's projects.  And of course, it mitigates future rising energy costs that we're all getting used to  with time of use.  But the Japanese government is Japanese government. with the LED light conversion, July of 2020, council authorized a contract with PG&E and Southland Energy for phase ones.  Japanese government is Japanese government. and Southland Energy for phase ones. June of 2021, council authorized phase two projects, which were finalizing as we speak. And now we're getting into phase three. So some of those phase one and two projects, I won't go through all those. I know we're on a quick time constraint,  constraint, but you can see them there. And phase one and two combined, we're looking at an  estimated annual utility and operating savings of nearly $1 million each year. So if we hadn't  delivered those projects, we'd be paying up to a million dollars additional now more each year for  annual utility costs. Here's our phase three projects. The first column is the energy  conservation measure description. The cost is the next column. The tax credits that we'll discuss  on a future slide is that second column kind of highlighted in gray there. So then the next column  is the ECM net cost and then the annual utility savings. So the first project is replacing our  co-gen and gas cleaning system at the wastewater treatment plant. You'll see a lot of these  projects are sewer-centric because that's where the highest demand of our energy consumption is.  So most of them are  wastewater-centric. The next one is replacing and doing some improvements to our digester heating  boilers and heat exchangers. We're throwing a storage building in there for our wastewater  operators to store materials and supplies. We're adding and replacing the solar array on the  parking structure. A lot of people don't know we have a solar system on top of the parking  structure on Salem between 3rd and 4th Street. So it's reached its useful life. We're going to  replace that. We have a little bit of HVAC  replacements to do at city-owned facilities at the airport. And then the last item there I'll touch on,  we've included this because it's a potential cost. It's a PG&E interconnection fee. So with  replacing the co-gen at the wastewater treatment plant, we're going to be adding more electricity  potentially to the grid. Not only are we going to offset our usage at the plant, but potentially add  more to the grid. So similar when a developer develops a residential housing project and  increases, you know, kind of the cost of the grid, we're going to be adding more electricity to the  grid. So it's a potential cost. We're going to be adding more electricity to the grid. Not only will  If there's any capacity impacts to that area, we condition them with certain conditions. And  that's essentially what PG&E is doing here. We will increase the capacity or the energy being put  onto the grid, and they'll have to make some infrastructure improvements there. So that's that  potential cost. We're currently negotiating with them for that to maybe go away. We hope we don't  have to pay that, but we wanted to include it just in case as it could be a cost to us.  Altogether, the projects listed in Phase 3 will save us close to $500,000.  a year in annual utility costs.  We'll highlight a couple of these projects.  So that's our Cogen unit there.  And it's a GE-branded  Yenbacher that's reached its useful life.  It's been extremely problematic, temperamental, hard to keep running.  It was designed really for  full plant capacity, which is treating 12 million gallons  per day of sewer. As you know, we average between  6 and 7 million gallons per day, so that's part of the problem.  It's just been problematic and very temperamental and expensive to keep  running. And we want to replace that  and size it right. So it's a unique  apparatus, too. Inside that connex box, it looks like a  locomotive engine with a generator on it.  And that should be running at all times. It captures  the methane gas that is produced in the biological process,  burns that methane gas, produces electricity.  It's called a Cogen because it also heats water that's pumped  back into the biological process that helps us treat the sewer  and wastewater. So it functions in two points  and it's essential that we have this thing operational.  Here's the  second large ECM.  And we'll just do a pointer here.  So this is our digester heating boilers and heat exchangers  replacement. So you'll see these large digesters here.  That's where we capture the methane gas.  There's a lot of underground infrastructure that you don't see here.  But how it's supposed to operate, we capture the methane gas.  It's cleaned, piped, and then burned here in the Cogen that you saw  on the previous slide. Unfortunately, that Cogen has been down for two years.  It's non-operational. It needs to be replaced.  So currently, we're piping that methane gas out to this flare here  and flaring it, which is not sustainable long-term  and something we don't want to do.  We need to be utilizing that byproduct of the biological process  and running that Cogen, offset our electrical usage at the plant,  and then also clean it up.  So putting some to the grid.  This is an aerial of the solar array at the parking structure.  It's actually a pretty good shot of it and its condition.  You see it's pretty worn and tattered.  It's reached its useful life.  A handful of the panels have been replaced,  but it needs to be fully replaced, and that's part of the Phase 3 ECMs.  Here's just an aerial of the airport.  Here's some of the city facilities here that need some HVAC replacement.  So we won't go into great detail.  We'll go into detail on that, but it's just some standard HVAC replacements.  And here's just kind of a summary of the Phase 3 projects again.  Substantial projects, again, sewer-centric, about $9.6 million.  We hope we don't have to pay for that PG&E interconnection fee.  We'll continue to lobby them to get out of that cost,  but we included it just to be safe.  Again, with an annual cost savings of close to $500,000 on the far right.  Here's a picture of the PGE interconnection fee.  The source funding, how we're proposing to fund these.  There is an opportunity to finance these.  However, we're looking at, I think, the best due to interest rates right now.  The best position for us is to use some reserve fund balances to pay for the projects.  Again, total cost is $9.6 million.  A little over $8 million, including overhead,  are for the sewer-related projects that could come from the sewer reserve fund.  And then about a $1.8 million with overhead.  And then about a $1.8 million with overhead.  And then about a $1.8 million with overhead.  So that is really general fund projects, which were the HVAC at the airport and so on and so forth.  I will mention there, there's some tax credits that we're subject to,  which is great news due to the Inflation Reduction Act we'll talk about on the next slide.  But the Phase 3 projects are qualifying for about $1.3 million in tax credits.  You saw a different number on that previous slide.  It shows it as $1.5 million down here.  But that's including the PGE.  The PGE interconnection fee, which is also subject to the tax credit.  We're hoping we don't have to pay that, but then we'll get a little bit less on the tax credit back.  So that's why we're only reflecting $1.3 million as our estimated for our Phase 3 projects there.  So a little bit about the Inflation Reduction Act that the federal government passed.  It allows municipalities to be eligible for these tax credits when delivering renewable energy projects.  Some fantastic news, thanks to staff's efforts.  PGE's efforts and then the subcontractor, Southland Energy, their efforts as well.  We found that our Phase 2 projects are eligible to be retroactive, which is fantastic news.  We're finalizing those projects now.  So we are going to get a tax credit in the form of a cash payment from the federal government for those two Phase 2 projects for $2.5 million.  And once we get that money, those tax credits will go directly back into the reserve funds to pay back the debt to pay for these Phase 3 projects.  Same with the Phase 3 projects that qualify for an estimated $1.3 million.  Once the projects are delivered, we get the tax credit, it goes right back to the reserve fund to pay down the debt to fund the projects.  So we're financing ourselves, if that makes sense.  Here's just a final breakdown of the cost.  $9.6 million, again close to $4 million in tax credits.  That leaves the remaining Phase 3 cost of $5.7 million.  Estimated annual energy savings of $485,000.  Simple payback.  Our annual payback on ROI is 11.9 years.  If we don't have to pay that interconnection fee, that will reduce the ROI by a year.  So it will be 10.9.  We're getting to the end here.  This slide is pretty important.  It symbolizes our approach towards net zero from electrical usage.  After completion of the Phase 3 ECMs, only 24% of our electrical consumption will remain when compared to baseline.  So you can see in the graph there, Phase 1 savings yielded about 10% of our usage.  Phase 2, large projects, big solar replacements at the wastewater treatment plant, added some solar at the corp yard where my office is, yielded about 44% of savings from baseline.  Phase 3 is estimated to yield 22% of savings.  What remains is that orange piece of the pie, and that's our street and traffic lights.  And there's really nothing we can do about that 20%.  Again, early in 15-16, we retrofitted our street lights to LED.  So we're paying, it's a flat rate.  They're not metered, of course.  There's not a meter on every single street light.  So we pay a flat rate, and we're paying the lowest assessment we possibly can because we retrofitted them to LED.  So I kind of, you know, talk about this with staff.  Let's manage what we can control.  If we try to manage what we can't control, we'll manage ourselves crazy.  So we're going to focus on what we can control, and we can't control street lights.  It's just a cost of doing business.  It's what municipalities do.  It's there.  So we're going to kind of discard that orange piece of the pie.  And that remains only 4% of our remaining consumption is coming from the grid.  So we're very, very close to net zero.  We've looked at that 4% every which way possible, and we're getting into the realm of the law of diminishing returns.  We just, it's not cost effective to go after that 4%.  It might be in the future.  When, you know, potentially battery technology improves or the cost of battery storage technology reduces or maybe the cost of solar panels reduce.  But as it stands now, 2023, it's not feasible or cost effective to go after that 4%.  That might change in the coming years.  And we'll, of course, you know, bring some projects back to Council to take care of that 4%.  But as it stands now, it's not worth it.  It's not cost effective.  All right, we're here.  Last slide.  So I recommend that Council authorize the city manager to execute.  A work order with PG&E and subcontractor Southland Energy to complete proposed phase three ECMs under the SST program contract and execute the necessary reserve fund balance transfers to fund the projects.  That concludes my presentation.  I can take any questions.  All right.  Questions.  Just do it one more time.  Is that under 10?  Thank you, Mr. Council.  Thanks, you guys.  Appreciate it.  Speakers.  We have one.  Rob Berry.  All right.  So I'm not here to raise either support or objection to the presentation.  Obviously, I'm in favor of saving money.  But in looking at the recommendation, I just had a question that I couldn't figure out the answer to.  Without looking at the cost of money or lifecycle costs or opportunity costs, it looks to me like you're spending like $23 million to save about $1.3 million.  And without the tax credits and so forth, that's almost a 20-year payback.  And so when you start adding cost of money and lifecycle costs, that extends that payback period.  And so I'm trying to understand the economics of it and what the payoff is.  If it's not economic return, is that $9 million that we're spending to save $400,000 a year a good return on that $9 million in light of other priorities?  And how much?  How much value do we put on achieving net zero as a ideological or a policy position if we have to invest money that has a rather poor ROI attached to it to achieve it?  So my question is just to try to understand that aspect of the proposal.  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right.  That's it.  Council comments?  No comments.  I have one.  So he may not remember this, but in 2013, I wasn't on the council, but Sean Morgan was,  and he entertained a meeting with a company which started talking about this program.  Eventually, that ended up with the city manager who then switched over to PG&E after entertaining a variety of bids and went with the PG&E program.  Of course, a lot of staff work went into that, but Council Member Morgan was a big part of this.  And really brought it to the city.  So I'd like to thank him for that.  So some kudos with no side effects, Sean.  So he's the one who actually, Council Member, that actually entertained the conversation with that company originally and got it in front of the city manager.  So here, here.  All right.  I'm happy to make the motion to approve.  Can I ask a question?  Sure.  Sure.  Sure.  Sure.  Sure.  But the city manager, or you, Eric, either one, what would happen if we didn't do this?  I mean, what are the consequences?  I don't know that I'd term them as consequences, but, you know, taking, you'd have to look at the individual pieces,  like the co-gen unit out at the wastewater plant that's tragic that we're just burning methane.  So there's an opportunity to.  to fix that tragic loss of energy that could otherwise be used.  Airport's one that, if you look at it on paper,  or if you look at it just as an ROI proposition replacing HVAC units,  it doesn't look that good, except most of them need to be replaced anyway.  So we've got the capital cost that we're exposed to anyway.  It just becomes a whole lot more palatable under this program.  So I don't know if that answers your question.  There isn't one single answer.  You have to kind of look at each of the different pieces.  Well, and I get that the return on the co-gen is a no-brainer.  The rest of them, if you just look at it from an ROI standpoint, are less attractive.  But what's not in the financial analysis is, you know,  what's the life of the existing equipment and when do we need to replace it?  So needing to replace it anyway is something that,  if I can suggest, that the next time you come with something like this,  that you have that as part of the analysis so we...  Well, I did have it put on some of it, like the solar panels on the parking lot.  They're end-of-life.  The co-gen unit, end-of-life.  The HVAC work out at the airport, virtually end-of-life.  They're at a point where their cost to operate and maintain them is too high.  Thank you.  May I make a motion?  I already did.  Oh, I seconded.  All right.  I have a motion and a second.  Okay.  Council Member Bennett?  Yes.  Council Member Morgan?  Yes.  Council Member Tandon?  Yes.  Council Member Van Overbeck?  Yes.  Council Member Winslow?  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds?  Aye.  Mayor Coolidge?  Aye.  Carry 7-0.  All right.  Now we have a presentation where it goes to something else.  All right.  Sorry.  Sorry.  It's a long night.  Consideration of police staffing.  Establishment of uniforms and safety equipment.  Capital project.  And approval supplement on appreciation budget modification.  We have a report from Chief Billy Aldridge.  Welcome.  Can you see that?  Yeah.  Perfect.  Good evening, Mayor, Vice Mayor, members of council.  And city staff.  Tonight I come to you, number one, to say thank you for what you've done recently to help me increase my staffing.  After the decisions were made to staff our department, you know, help us recruit and retain, we have seen the recruitment just skyrocket.  And so with the help of human resources, city staff, we've now estimated that we will be at full staffing by the end of next year, potentially November of next year.  I do need some assistance, though.  And that's why I'm here tonight.  We recently froze five positions.  And prior decisions from council.  I'm at a point now where I'm ready to fill those five positions.  And I'm asking you tonight to allow me to hire for those five positions.  I have people in the pipeline ready to go.  And it will be planned to put them into the academy next year.  And that's just around the corner for us.  Likewise, next year I will have four retirements.  And I would like to over hire for those four as hourly employees.  And start getting them into the training program so that as those folks retire, we backfill with trained police officers and continue toward that goal of 100% staffing.  And building out our specialty units and starting to provide that full service that you expect from your police department.  The cost of that.  But the cost involved in this, upon conferring with the finance director for the last six months of this fiscal year,  we are looking at approximately $360,000 for one full year to add those five positions back.  We are looking at approximately $820,000.  We have worked that out through decisions from finance, like I said.  And so my request is that you allow me to move forward with those positions, unfreeze them, the five positions, and then also overhire those four and start getting them trained to backfill for the four retirements that I'm going to have next year.  So that's part one of my presentation tonight.  I don't know if we want to break it up, Mayor, or start on to the second part.  Yeah, because you're looking for action on two separate, correct?  Yes, sir.  All right.  So let's just, well, we have to take speakers anyway, so let's take them both.  Go both.  Do both.  Just going to do both?  Yeah.  Go ahead.  Okay.  The second part of my presentation tonight is with the increase in hiring, we have started to expend all of our equipment.  In order to equip those officers, it's very expensive.  We did not expect to be able to backfill those positions so fast.  However, with that success, we have expended our equipment line item in the budget.  And in order to not go over budget, I have found a solution that does not cost the city any additional funds to the police department.  Specifically, we had started a capital improvement project for replacement.  We had started a capital improvement project for replacement of our life scan machine.  That typically gets replaced about every seven years.  The cost on those typically just go up.  They don't typically come down.  But we got lucky this year.  They've gone down.  And the current, they call it the cabinet, the cabinet that all the equipment goes in for the life scan machine is reusable.  So it's all the same size.  That's another additional $18,000 savings that we didn't realize was going to occur.  In that capital improvement project account,  we currently have a $18,000 savings.  We currently have $284,000.  We don't need all of that.  And I am requesting that we move $100,000 into a new capital improvement project simply for public safety equipment line items.  So that would be my second request from you tonight.  Again, no additional cost to the city.  Simply creating a new capital improvement project and moving money from an already established account into a new account to help assist with this.  And I'm happy to answer any questions if you have them.  All right.  Questions on either of the two for the GP?  So, Chief, congratulations on such great results in recruiting.  And I think you told me earlier that all six of the academy trainees graduated or passed Huster.  So we got six for six, which is a first, right?  So this class graduates Thursday.  Yeah.  We started with six for six.  We're graduating six.  And we typically see about a 20% failure rate.  And this class is 100% pass rate.  Well, so my question is, over the last few months, we've been talking about hiring community service officers.  How's that coming?  It's coming.  It's slow.  We have several in background.  We have a couple in training.  And it's progressing forward.  Not as quick as I know you would like it to progress forward.  But it is moving forward.  And we're hoping to get some more quality training.  And we're hoping to get some more quality candidates in our next round of applications.  So I would just ask that you have a similar focus on that that you do for hiring sworn officers.  I understand sworn officers are the first priority, have to be.  But that we not forget about our community service officers.  We are actively recruiting.  We're actively looking.  And with any luck, we'll have another batch that go through the interview and testing process here in the near future.  Thank you.  Mm-hmm.  Councilmember Bennett?  I'm going to support your comment.  Congratulations.  It's fantastic.  It's great to see this moving forward so quickly.  Amazing.  Just one simple question.  What is the number for full staffing within the police officer position by the end of 2024?  Currently authorized is 109 positions.  That includes grant positions, also.  but that's just the authorized positions from the city.  So by the end of 2024, how many sworn officers do you expect to see on the street?  If everything goes correct, 109 sworn police officers positions,  but that counts for me down to the most junior police officer.  And you're a very important part of that number.  I will go work a beat if I have to.  Thank you.  Mr. Winslow.  Well, that just brought up a question.  So we have 109 authorized, but that's including unfreezing ones.  So they're kind of like stalled on authorization.  Correct.  So if we don't unfreeze, then it would be at 104.  Okay.  Okay.  Yeah, and it's just kind of hard to read the fiscal impact here and there.  It is 360K through 23 through 24, 820K through 24, 25,  but then overhiring is another.  So we're looking at 1,180,000.  I have that correct.  That's just next year and this year, right?  So you would take the 820 plus the 360.  360, but times two?  Because it's listed on here twice.  No, the first six months is just to cover this fiscal year  with those unfreezing those positions.  That's already spent at the end of 23, 24.  The start of 24, 25 would be your 820.  So you would take the 820 plus the 360,  and then you would overhire an additional 360.  So I understand we have a decent amount of officers  that are eligible for retirement.  So in future years when we are also anticipating retirement,  are we going to come back and again here to overhire  to fill this position in advance?  Well, that would be my goal is to always overhire,  have people ready to go and replace those positions  that we know are retiring.  Okay.  The other one on the, so the capital improvement program  that you're looking for, it says uniform and safety,  equipment.  This is for police uniforms like you're wearing.  It's the gear.  Anything that we need to equip a police officer or a dispatcher  or a community service officer, any employee that has to get any gear,  safety gear to do the job.  Not necessarily, because there are uniform allowances  for officers, correct?  Correct.  Yeah.  And it's, but that is separate.  That is just for suit and this is stuff that's.  This is the initial equipping of a new hire.  Is, are they still getting uniform?  They get a uniform allowance even though we would.  They get it after they complete their probationary period.  So it's after their year of service.  Sorry if it's just like a little bit confusing.  Sure.  But so you receive a uniform allowance only once you need  a replacement uniform because you have your first cover?  Is that right?  No.  So within their MOU, they get a yearly uniform allowance.  Whether they need it or not, it's a benefit that they get within their MOU.  So I forget what the payout is.  I think it's $1,200.  I believe it's $1,200.  $1,300.  $1,300 is their payout every year now and they use that for all of their replacement  items.  But the initial purchase comes from the city to equip an officer because we're not giving  them money upfront to go and buy their.  It's after one year.  It's after.  Thank you.  Yeah.  All right.  Further questions?  Public comment?  We have two speakers.  Is James having a conversation with the public?  Is James Hutchinson still here?  I don't see him.  So, Rainn, share.  Three minutes.  Oh, well, it's been a while, hasn't it?  It's your lucky night since I showed up to talk about the resolution and this is on the  agenda.  Of course, I might as well stay for it.  I'm concerned that the resolution is not going to be approved.  I'm concerned that the city will rush to fill such vacancies with candidates who are  underqualified to deal with the life and death situations that occur in our community.  Officer Gannibin and Fleer, who murdered Desmond Phillips in his home during a mental health  crisis in 2017, were rookies new to the job.  Officers who murdered Desmond did not even have the state mandated minimum of eight hours  of critical incident training at the time.  Why should the public trust that not?  New recruits are sufficiently trained and screened for minimizing the risk of violence  and death to civilians.  All officers on the force, whether existing or new, should complete a minimum of 40-hour  critical incident training, as well as additional training that emphasizes non-deadly means,  de-escalation, dealing with people in mental health crisis.  This has been a repeated issue in this community.  Okay.  Thank you.  The city has never properly or sufficiently addressed the police officers who have already  killed civilians in this town.  So why should we trust that the city is properly addressing whether or not new recruits could  possibly be committing such murders?  The Chico Police Department always wants more money and more military equipment, yet they  already get half the money.  It's not just about the city's budget.  There's certainly a lot of other things that the city could use that would actually support  the life and safety of civilians of this town.  I know you're going to approve this request from the police department because you always  give them everything they ask for.  I do appreciate asking for that clarification on the uniform situation.  If you'll remember the news story that broke several years ago about officers using that  stipend for a new uniform to buy firearms that they get to keep personally, even if  they no longer are officers.  There's a lot of money going to the cops that isn't necessarily actually about keeping the  community safe.  So anyway, since I'm here, I'm going to repeat what we've been saying for six and a half  years.  The emphasis must be on officers being trained and qualified in non-deadly means of de-escalation.  I'm going to repeat what we've been saying for six and a half years.  The emphasis must be on officers being trained and qualified in non-de-escalation.  We have never seen a real change in the City to address those issues or to give it sufficient  respect to the people who have been murdered by Chico Police Department, and, of course,  with my last three seconds, Justice, for Desmond Phillips.  Further comment?  Entertain the motion?  Move to approve.  I'll just say really briefly, but I don't feel like supporting this.  There's a lot of needs that we have in a lot of departments and retiring or being short  staffed is really common.  We had some people from fleet services that were sitting in the audience earlier.  These are things that relate really critically to public safety as well, but I'm not seeing  that we're getting the same level of treatment and priority for it.  All right.  Further comment?  We have a motion and a second.  Madam Clerk, when you're ready.  Council Member Bennett?  Yes.  Council Member Morgan?  Yes.  Council Member Tandon?  Yes.  Council Member Van Overbeek?  Yes.  Council Member Winslow?  No.  Vice Mayor Reynolds?  Aye.  Mayor Coolidge?  Aye.  Carries 6-1.  And since that motion was made, is a move to approve, does that cover both items for  you sufficiently?  It can, yes.  Okay.  All right.  Just wanted to double check.  All right.  Item 5.3, consideration of the November 6th internal affair recommendations.  And I believe we have Council Member Van Overbeek.  So we, internal affairs met on November 6th.  Two items.  The first was to change the name of downtown Chicano public documents and signage to  historic downtown Chico.  It was referred to the DCVA, Chico Downtown Business Association, to get their opinion  on it.  There are, this of course affects other people other than just the DCVA.  But they did not share my enthusiasm for the idea.  And so where we left it was that the item has been, I think, it's been, it's been  emphasized in the Council in the last year.  But they are Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese  Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese  Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese  Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese  Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese  Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese  Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese  Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese  on that. It was our determination that we did not have a problem with an excess number of  short-term rentals, but that it was something we wanted to monitor. And so the staff is going to  return in a year with an update to see whether any action is warranted. And that's my report,  Mr. Mayor. All right. Thank you. Questions?  Public comment? None. All right. I do want to just take a moment to revisit or look a little  maybe deeper into the report. While we didn't, as a committee, make a determination that  short-term rentals were enough of an issue to pursue further regulation, nuanced regulation,  at this time, Vice Mayor Reynolds was not present. So it was really more of a tie  vote in a way. So I do just want to briefly go over the recommendation that I had,  attempt to make it simple. This is probably one of the most complex issues that I feel like we've  dealt with. Wait a minute. You misrepresent this. There was not a tie vote. You voted for the  motion. It was 2-0. And you voted for it. So it wasn't a tie vote. Oh, that was okay. My motion  died without a second, which is to say that there was one more. That's right. And then I made a  motion, and you voted for it. It was kind of just a joke on a technicality. I just,  I just want to reiterate the motion. I wasn't joking. Yeah. I'm sorry you were. Okay. Moving on.  So the proposal that I had made was to direct staff to research implementing a short-term  rental fee schedule with a tiered system. Includes tiers for homes that are rented 20 days or less,  homes that are rented 20 days or more with homeowner on site, and 20 days or more with  no homeowner on site. This is drawn from other cities who,  design these tiers in order to encourage the kind of short-term rentals that usage that is  better for the city, provides flexibility in the short-term rental market at times that we need it.  It's when people rent out sort of rooms in their house, or they might vacate their house for a  time. And it discourages the kind that is harmful to the overall economy, where we see a concentration  of short-term rentals are in the walkable neighborhoods with mostly low-density zoning.  So there's a scarcity of housing there.  It is being used for short-term rentals rather than having full-time residents who would patronize  the businesses around there all the time and have more positive externalities.  And currently, we pay a percentage of our transient occupancy tax to administer this  program. Under California state law, we can move that to a fee schedule where we  charge the cost of the program. And that would free up our transient occupancy tax,  which is $124 per month. And then we'd pay $124 per month for the full-time occupancy tax for other  uses, which can include promoting tourism, public art, things that actually would benefit the  tourist market and benefit the people operating these short-term rentals.  So I would like to reiterate my motion here to recommend that council direct staff to, well,  sorry, to direct staff to research implementing a short-term rental fee schedule with a tiered  system, including the three tiers of homes rented 20 days or less, 20 days or more with homeowner on  site in 20 days or more with no homeowner on site. I did want to remind  you though that we don't have STR fees so we have nothing to tier. Well so we  have to first do a study in order to implement fees that's my understanding  correct? Correct. Yeah so yeah so what I mean the motion to do is to research  implementing the fee study I suppose in order to move towards a fee system  which would have these three tiers. Apologies for how complicated this can  be dealing with California law and fees and taxes. Mr. Sorensen what's your  thoughts on this? Good question. Again we don't have any fees currently we have  something that's akin to a TOT tax on short-term rentals.  Okay.  Okay.  So again we don't have anything currently to tier so I'm yeah we would  have to come up with some justification. I think what he's getting at is some  sort of a monthly or annual or biannual fee per unit based on its level of use.  So that's I know it's done in other cities. They get charged TOT correct? Pardon? Would they get charged  TOT yes? That's correct. But that specific UTOT goes into paying for the program to monitor them or no? Does it go?  Well they get a percentage. HTL gets what 18%? 15% and I think we are gonna go out to RFP again shortly to see if there are better deals on that.  So I would like to ask a question of the finance director. Mr. Hanoverbeck hold on a sec.  Is there a  So STR is a business. Do the property owners pay a business fee like a business license?  Yeah the business license tax they also pay that as well.  Okay in addition to the TOT. Yes. And that's a flat rate for they paid?  It's not.  Correct?  Yeah it's the same for it's based on revenue.  Okay. Mr. Mayor?  Yes. I have a process question.  Wait a minute it's my turn. It's my turn. So Miss Martin?  Would you please feel free to correct me if I'm wrong. We have approximately 50,000 dwelling units within the city limits of Chico right?  And the number of short term rentals is approximately 400, 350 or 400. So that's eight tenths of a percent of the rental of the housing stock is short term rentals.  We do not have a problem.  We do.  the city staff has plenty to do without spending time on fee structures to solve  problems that don't exist that's why we decided to with Councillor Winslow's vote  to just look at this again in a year and see if we have a problem developing but  right now we do not have a problem we do have a motion with the motion no I do  not want you to read it my process question is I've been up here a little  while I don't really ever remember committees coming forward with their  recommendations and then changing recommendations while we're here and  having a further discussion of a discussion that happened in the  committee so I have a complete loss as to why this is being discussed so but  thank you so those who asked the clerk the same question so we're either  accepting the  interaction with the city staff or we're either accepting the interaction with the  Internal Affairs Committee to leave things as it is or not.  All this other stuff shouldn't be happening.  Madam Clerk.  Council Member Morgan is correct.  The item that's before you is actually the recommendation that was passed 2-0 with one absence,  that the council leave the short-term rental process as it is currently,  and direct staff to continue to monitor the situation return in a year.  That's what's on the agenda.  So the citizens wouldn't have been notified that the failed motion that occurred  and the topic at Internal Affairs is going to be heard tonight.  And so they're not here to actually address that.  So what's before you is the acceptance of the report, or you can not accept it,  and then you can send it back to committee if you'd like.  Okay, so I have a substitute motion, and that motion.  There isn't a second, I don't think, to the motion.  There's not a second.  So there's not a motion.  So there's no motion.  So you can just make a regular motion.  That is to accept the recommendation of the Internal Affairs Committee.  Second.  All right.  Do we have a motion and a second for further discussion?  Just in response to Council Member Morgan's comments,  this item on short-term rentals had come up a few times.  I wasn't the original requester of it,  but it became clear we didn't have a straightforward proposal,  so I made the motion to send it to Internal Affairs,  where we further fleshed out a proposal,  and it was not accepted, but it was, as I would say,  by some measures, a tie vote.  So I had resurrected it here,  but currently we have a proposal to look at it again in a year  because we have a policy on the books to regulate,  or to, sorry, to, yeah, to, like, watch trends of Airbnbs,  or short-term rentals, so I'm content with that.  That's all.  I have no idea what you just said.  I have a question.  So Mr. Van Overbach's proposal is, or no, motion is,  so will that go for both of the topics?  Right.  The two recommendations are coming before you.  Can I vote to agree on one and disagree on the other?  Well, no, it's just the motion on discussion of short-term rentals,  as I understand.  No, we do have the downtown.  It's downtown.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  It's the acceptance of the report from there,  and then if you would like, I can make a note for the record.  I can make a note that you object to one or the other or both.  You can't make a substitute motion to accept one recommendation and reject another?  You could, in fact, yes.  Just to be clear.  Yeah, you can.  So if you wanted to be that specific, or you could just do one at a time.  I mean, I totally understand that right now we don't have any numbers,  but if we do,  if we do not put any concrete regulations,  it will become a problem,  and then we'll have to discuss it with a bigger problem than a smaller problem.  So I would certainly disagree with that,  but I would be in favor of not changing the downtown's name.  Okay, so you're opposed to the short-term rental recommendation  made by the Internal Affairs Committee on November 6th.  I'll make a note of that.  Mm-hmm.  And do you want me to call?  Further?  Questions, but yes, let's...  Both of these discussions are going to return in a year, just to be clear.  Right, it was directed that staff would bring that back with more information.  All right.  Councilmember Bennet?  Yes.  Councilmember Morgan?  Yes.  Councilmember Tandon?  Yes, with an exception.  That duly noted.  Councilmember Van Overbeck?  I'm sorry, you lost me.  What are we voting on?  Your motion that was seconded to approve and accept the right to use the property,  that was seconded to approve and accept the property,  and the recommendation is made by the Internal Affairs Committee.  So that is an aye.  Councilmember Winslow?  I'm just going to vote no.  Vice Mayor Reynolds?  Aye.  Mayor Coolidge?  Aye.  It carries 6-1 with one notation on the second opposition to short-term rentals.  All right.  Note that Addison Winslow wants historic downtown.  Can I just make a quick note since I was not at that meeting, and I do want to apologize, but I had a...  I had a dear friend from high school die the night before, and I was with the family, and so I do not make it a habit to miss meetings, but it was an extreme emergency, so...  Yeah, unfortunately those things happen.  All right.  Item 5.4, items added after posting in the agenda.  We have none.  Reports and communications.  Following reports and communications items are provided for the council's information.  No action can be taken on items under this section unless the council agrees to make it in a subsequent agenda.  6.1, city manager's report.  No report.  All right.  6.2, council member request.  Person of the day, PMP 1010.  Council members may verbally request an item be agendized at a future meeting after stating what the item would be.  A majority of council vote is needed for order of staff to agendize.  Do you have any?  I have one, but...  I have two, actually.  Who's got one?  Mr. Winston.  How's it going?  We have had people come in and speak on issues.  It's been controversial.  Just the idea of speaking on...  And perhaps call me naive, but I think just opening up a space for that conversation to happen would be better than having that conversation be repeated here for lack of a conversation.  So I would like to make a motion to have a discussion on recent upticks and instances of discrimination in our community and what the city can do to provide relief to those affected.  All right.  Do we have a second?  They want me to repeat it?  Yes.  Okay.  Okay.  I think everybody...  Did everybody get it?  Okay.  Okay.  Motion to add slide for second.  Anyone else?  No?  Okay.  I'll start with my first one.  So I'd like a presentation, but it's kind of in the theme of the SST, which we approved tonight, conversations with Cal Water.  They have a similar type program.  I'd like a presentation by Cal Water on a citywide water saving program along with the potential for action by council.  Okay.  Thank you.  I'd move to make a motion to agenda this.  Second.  Madam Clerk.  Okay.  Okay.  Council Member Bennett.  Yes.  Council Member Morgan.  No.  Council Member Tandon.  Yes.  Council Member Van Overbeek.  Yes.  Council Member Winslow.  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds.  Aye.  Mayor Coolidge.  Aye.  Carries 6-1.  All right.  The next is a review of council.  Code enforcement policy, code enforcement policies relative to the length of time of  large vehicles, trucks, RVs, boats, and trailers that they can be kept on public streets and  also possibly in driveways as well.  So I'm going to make that a motion.  Second.  Okay.  All right.  Council Member Bennett.  Yes.  Council Member Larson.  Council Member Morgan.  No.  Council Member Tandon.  Yes.  Council Member Van Overbeek.  Yes.  Council Member Winslow.  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds.  Aye.  Mayor Cooley.  Aye.  Carries 6-1.  All right.  Any further?  Okay.  We are adjourned.  We'll see you Tuesday, December 19th.  Wear your ugly sweater.  No.  Not really.  I'm not wearing an ugly sweater.  .  .  .  .  .  .  .
