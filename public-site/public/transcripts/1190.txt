 I do not know. I did not hear anything from him. Okay. I'll maybe give it another minute or two, but we have a quorum, so I'd like to start right at 6. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. thank you. re ready for roll. good evening welcome to the city of chico' bidwell park and playground commission regular meeting we will start with our agenda 1.1 call to order. . thank you. we are just warming up. commissioner alexander absent. commissioner lashley. present. thank you. commissioner glatz. here. commissioner scherer. here. commissioner shadley. absent. vice chair nava. thank you. we will go to item 2 the consent agenda. all matters listed under the consent agenda are to be considered routine and enacted by one motion. we have 2.2 the approval of the minutes of the 82624 bidwell park and playground commission meeting. we have 2.2 which is a permit to hold a color run in lower bidwell park on may 3, 2025. do we need to pull either of these items for discussion? we will go ahead and pull 2.2. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . So that's my thought. Question on that. Do we approve the run for food every year? I didn't think so. So there are other events that happen that way. Yeah, what typically has been done in the past is in the past, previous Park and Natural Resources managers brought a standard race course. And as long as it stayed to the standard race course, then we didn't have to come back to the commission on it. And this one was something that was different, but they are using the standard race course. So I just thought perhaps, you know, because sometimes you guys want to hear them and sometimes you don't, or don't mind not hearing them, I guess I should say. So I'm fine with it coming back. It's not a problem. It was just, I mean, they've been great, but it's just because there's so much cleaning to be involved. And it would only be for this group that I was asking for future because we have a track record with them. If someone new wanted to have a color run, I would certainly bring it back to you. Right, but I assume they're not going to have the same people cleaning up every year. I mean, that crew will change from year to year. So I think also that that's something that needs to be revisited after every race each year, in my opinion. Any other comments, questions? Yes. No, I'll just, so I'll make a motion that we approve it just based upon it. It does come back yearly for approval. Do we have a second? I'll go ahead and second. So, Commissioner Blashley? Approve. Yes. Commissioner Glatz? Yes. Commissioner Shearer? Yes. Vice Chair Nava? Yes. And Chair Thomas Petty? Yes. Thank you. We'll move to item four. This is the public comments section. If anyone is here for public comments, you need to grab a public comment card in the back and fill it out, and we can wait. We'll wait for you to do that if that's necessary. She's got one. Oh, you've got one already. Okay, it looks like we have a member of the public that also wants to speak. Let me just read our little blurb here. Members of the public may address the commission at this time on any matter not already listed on the agenda. Comments are limited to three minutes. The commission cannot take any action at this meeting on requests made under this section of the agenda. So while our member of the public fills out his comments, we will resume talking after this. The public comment card looks like we have one already. Go ahead. Julia Keener. Hey, everybody. Good evening. Good to see you. It's been a while. I have a few things. I'm sad that Richie is not here. Because I believe it's him I want to give complete kudos to closing a area by Pleasant Valley High School. Okay. That was a triangle that had all these native oak trees in there. And people have been parking on top of the roots for the last couple years. And all these signage just went up. And I don't know if that was the tree division. I don't know. It might have been right away. Because those are valuable trees. So I was thrilled to see that. A couple things. One is I've been at Upper Park. That's kind of my place I like to be. And I kind of oversee it. With the new road paving and all in there. And I don't know if any of you have been up there to see it. Seemed unnecessary to me. But there it is. But incredibly sad that there is no bike lane. So it is completely. There's a one section that starts past farther up the road. That has been set aside for bikes and walkers for a long time. But it doesn't connect to anything. And it's just really sad to see that we are still completely car centric. So there's no way to get up there. I'm on my bike. Cars are racing by me. The sign says 25. And no one is doing that. There may be double that. I would love to see in the future. Because that's already done. But in the future more thought gets put into other forms of transportation. Besides. Cars. Along with cars. So it allows people to get up there otherwise. So on that subject. Once again. I am a big proponent of having the road permanently closed. In Upper Park. Past Diversion Dam. I was up there today. And to see the fire. And you know. The things that are regrowing and what's happening up there. So I'm still a big proponent of that. That is just highly used now by bikers and hikers. And it's just not compatible with cars. And if someone drives up there. There is absolutely. If you're disabled at any weight. There's nothing you can do. There is no access to any trail that is appropriate to anyone that is not completely physically. So there's cliff faces. There's just rocks. There's. I mean the trails are just not designed. For anything unless you're super able. So I'm still a big proponent of that. I'm still touting that. And everyone I talked to was. Very shocked that the road got opened after the fire. So in Upper Park at all. They were. Everyone I've talked to was just like. They just couldn't believe. That that was a. Somehow that was a priority to let people back up by car. So anyway. And one real thing I hope you guys get more power on the commission. So that's something that I'm would love to see in the future. So thank you for what you do. Thank you. Jeffrey Miller. You look at the. That's me. Hi everybody good evening good evening. I live in Chico. I. I'm a cyclist. But more in the parks. I'm a runner. I. I run in lower park. Fifteen to twenty times. A month. And I run it up the park. Maybe five to ten times a month. I wish that numbers higher. These aren't. These aren't complaints. It's something. To think about. I. And it's. More. In lower park. I think there should be a ban on cigarette smoking. I personally am not a smoker. I. I'm not. Coming. Coming down on anybody's personal freedom. But I think cigarette smoking. What we know now. Demonstrates irrational behavior. I don't think I can expect. Rational behavior from an irrational person. I don't interact anymore. With. Cigarette smokers. Because every time I ask somebody. To pick up their cigarette butt. It's a fight. And it ruins my run. So I don't. If I just started my run. And I'm stretching. And getting ready to run. And I see someone butt out. Throw their cigarette butt. And I ask them. Would you please pick up your cigarette butt. So I don't have to. I wind up leaving. Because I don't. I go somewhere else. Bed. Yesterday running. I can smell smoke. The park holds smoke. You can smell it. It's. I think asking them. To smoke in designated areas. The way they do in Disneyland. I think that's. Unreasonable. Because I think we're asking for rational behavior. From an irrational person. They might think they're above the law. Or that the law doesn't apply. To them. Or. Something else. It's not only a fire risk. It's a nuisance. I think. I think that. A ban would speak for itself. I don't think it'd be difficult to do. The other. Comment. As a runner. And a cyclist. Is the dirt trails. Especially the single tracks. I just don't think there's room. For. Motorized vehicles. And I. Think. That. I. You know. If. If someone knocks over. A little old lady. And she breaks her hip. Because she can't jump out of the way in time. And you're jumping into poison oak. Make it. Clear. It's a single track. There's no room. And. We're going back to. Irrational behavior. And talking about. Running an upper park. I see mountain bikers all the time. We had a great understanding. It's. We're. We share the trail. It's different with these. People on the trail. There's motorized. Bicycles. It's not working out. And I. Just don't think they belong. On the trails. Especially on the single tracks. I. I've never seen. A national park. That allowed. Motorized vehicles. On a trail. This isn't a national park. It's a city park. I think it's a reasonable request. Before. Some little kid gets knocked over. Before. Some. Little old man. Falls and breaks his hip. That could be me. Fall and break my hip. I don't want. I don't want. I don't want. I don't want. I don't want. I don't want. I don't want. I don't want. I don't want. I don't want. I don't want. I don't want. it is already banned to not smoke in Bidwell Park. It's already banned not to smoke at Bidwell Park. It's just all city parks and greenways we already have that on the books. It's just an enforcement issue for us right now. And one more comment. We've been talking about e-bike regulations for two years three years and that has been on our minds and hasn't been done. So since we can't put anything on the agenda now we're at the mercy of the city council to make that a priority. So we'll do what we can. And we agree with you that e-bikes are a problem and not a problem but they're something that needs to be controlled and regulated in the park. We will be bringing it back to the commission for sure. So we will move on to item 5 public hearings. Item 6 regular agenda. 6.1 is consideration of installing a new metal fence around caper acres and a request from the chico sunrise rotary club to develop artwork for the fence. The bidwell park and playground commission will receive a report from staff regarding installing a new metal fence to replace the temporary fencing around caper acres. The commission will also consider a proposal that will be approved by the commission for the development of a new steel fence within caper acres within a! sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry ago and had a concrete curb around it as well. And it was not, I don't know, did it get storm or was it just, it was chain link fence also. So it's in the master plan, as you can tell, the Cape Reckless master plan was to do a more decorative fence around it and more permanent. And the wrought iron fence was an idea. And then also there was talk about artwork of some sort, as you see in the picture here, straight out of the master management plan. So we're, Shane was already working on trying to find a contractor to do the fencing as well as he's been working with the Chico State and Butte College construction management groups. They would be doing the concrete part because the concrete curb will help us better maintain it. And with it, instead of doing posts in the ground, we can bolt it to the concrete. It makes it easier to weed around as far as maintenance as well. So we think that's a good idea to have the concrete curb. And we've used concrete construction management classes before. They built the swings and the whole area there. So I think it's a great match with, to bring in the students of that and then have the fabricator, metal fabricator actually do the fencing. So we were really excited when Aaron Souza from the Sunrise Rotary came and he had heard about the fencing the group had and they were looking for a project. And Mr. Souza's here and he's got some slides he'd like to show, but they are... Their big project this year is a vocational learning project as well as a couple other components that he will go into. And he thought that the artwork would be a great idea to bring in graphic artists to do the designing, also welders or other type of vocational classes at high schools and in particular Fairfield High School. So if it's okay, I'll let Mr. Souza come up and talk a little bit more. And can you... Is that on for you? Yeah. Good evening. Good evening. My name is Aaron Souza. I'm the current president of Chico Sunrise Rotary. And for my year, I came up with, we're always looking for projects to do in the community. We're a service club. I came up with an idea to go after a regional grant from our regional rotary. And in summary, what the grant is, it's a vocational services grant. And it's been fully funded. Our club funds half of it and then district rotary. Okay. Then we also put a program in place for officers with disabilities with disabilities with disabilities with disabilities with disabilities with disabilities with disabilities with disabilities with disabilities with disabilities with disabilities with disabilities with disabilities with disabilities with disabilities with disabilities with disabilities with disabilities with disabilities with disabilities with disabilities with disabilities with disabilities with disabilities with disabilities with disabilities with disabilities with disabilities with disabilities with disabilities with disabilities with disabilities with disabilities with disabilities with disabilities with disabilities with disabilities with disabilities with disabilities with disabilities with disabilities with disabilities with disabilities with disabilities with disabilities with students a real world hands-on experience in producing some vocational products. Basically the idea is we' buying some equipment and offer some scholarships to the students as well for the students in each one of these vocational programs and hopefully to get them to promote some job ready skills. As far as the city concerned, the neat and fun aspect we wrote into this is what we're envisioning is that the cape breakers master plan was developed by Greg Melton who is a member of our club as well. And our sunrise rotary has put an awful lot of work into cape breakers. We've done the entrance into the cape breakers recently. Noon club has done several projects within the park. And so we thought it would be a project that would be a pretty natural tie to have the high school graphic arts students design some signage for the park. The signage has already been approved in the master plan. We're working with Milton design group which is the lead landscape architect on the program. So the education, the administrators are all on board on this. The teachers are all on board on this. We've met several times with the teachers and the students already. And we believe it's a pretty natural tie to have the high neat idea and fits with the plan of the cape breakers park. So at the end of the day we want to take all the vocational projects we're working on, the welding, the woodworking, the culinary and the graphics art and showcase them at our annual fundraiser event. So all the funds that we raise we're grossing probably well over $100,000 now on our yearly saint patty's day fundraiser. The kids will be showcased at the fundraiser and then a vast majority of the funds that we raise go back into the community. So it's almost like a fundraising event. So we believe it's dollars well spent. You're familiar probably with cape breakers plan. What we're talking about is the fence that surrounds the entryway. This was the conceptual design that Milton design put together. In talking with the kids we've already met at the park with the students and they've got some incredible ideas. They've been instructed in conversations with the city to design the ideas consistent with nursery rhymes, the traditional themes of the park. There's a million ways you can go with it. So the signs can be either, we're big fans of literacy too so we're saying what if each sign is designed by a nursery rhyme and you have the nursery rhyme printed on it so the kids can learn to read too as they're enjoying the signage. So the kids are entirely excited about this program. So are the schools, it integrates multiple schools which is a goal of the district. And it works with the city and also works with private industries such as Milton design group. Really the main reason how I came up with the idea was this graphic here. This personal friend Howard Slater passed away. This was one element of the park that didn't get implemented. This was going to be an entryway signage to the park. It was one of the last elements that our Chico Sunrise had on its plate to do and then after Howard's passing couldn't implement that. So the idea was part of our program to get this dragon finally up on the entryway. So if you're familiar with the entryway the thought was that the dragon would go somewhere up above as kind of an entry to the students. So when we're talking entry to the public, talking to the city they also had suggested we need to have a knight kind of fighting the dragon, something to that effect. So we got thinking about it and talking to the students and what we're thinking of is moving the dragon down onto one of the lower flanks of the entryway and then behind the castle when you enter there would be a knight maybe wrapped up in the tail and there would be a hole in the knight's face so the kids could stick their face in there. Kind of interactive signage. And so everyone's responded really well to that. So we're providing materials for the students, we're giving them scholarships, we're paying for the supplies so we've got that factored in. I know one of the concerns of the cities was potential engineering issues for adhering the signage to the entryway so we're not looking to adhere it directly to the castle. Moving it to the side we can post it into the dirt with posts so it won't be a structural issue with the entryway. And then at the end of the day we're And then our major fund raiser is where we will basically take the signage and unveil it to the community. And through live auction potentially auction off the kids signs individually for sponsorship for cape breakers park. So it brings in the community, brings in the kids, brings in the city, it's a multifaceted project that our club is looking forward and excited to fund and manage. So the deliverables again would be the dragon as you walk in, potentially a knight and then signage along the iron fenceway of the park. So that's kind of it in a nutshell. Linda had asked that I come and talk to you and request your blessing on it or I don't know exactly what I'm looking for at this point. But our club is very excited. Our district calls this an ambitious project. It's not a big plan to me. It's not because I've implemented and managed several plans like this in the past. It's one of the larger ones that they funded and to have the district fully fund it we' re very excited about it. And we' re excited to work with the city and the schools and give the kids some vocational opportunities. And that' s what I have for you. So if you have any questions I' m happy to field them. thank you, erin. Do any of the commissioners have questions or concerns? vice chair nava. not a concern. Just a question. On the part where you said the sponsorship piece. So does that mean something akin to plaques below the signage or something like that? again, we' re at the very design phase. So it would probably be a plaque maybe attached to the signage. We' re looking at probably six to ten signs that would go along the fence. individual signs. And then they would have the sponsorship piece. So we would have a plaque donated in their name for that sign. commissioner galatz. well, my initial thought is yes, yes, yes, please help. Do you know what I mean? but. there' e no but. that was the wrong word. and these guys are going to hit me. I' ve been trying for years now to get a mascot for the park, too. and I don' t know if it' s the dragon per se because that' s more nursery rhyme thing. but I think it' s a good idea. but just kind of when you guys are talking, maybe think about that. it was like a squirrel or something. something that can incorporate these ideas throughout the park. okay. so it' s not just. s actually pretty incredible. these kids had so many incredibly good ideas. very mature ideas. and a lot of them, what they want to do is tie them into the nursery rhymes. but we' ve also got the history of robin hood. right? correct. so it' s not all nursery rhymes. so there' is history to that park outside of just the nursery rhymes. and the kids were talking about how you could put little characters throughout the park and make it kind of a hunt for the other kids to find them, go around. so they' re thinking very high level conceptual ideas. so I would push in that direction. so I think shane, you did sherwood forest for a little while. you did something that didn' t last very, very long. because I don' t know. whatever reason. but right behind caper acres, you made a little like path with a bunch of stuff on it. yeah. there was an interpretive trail back there. and then different people moved into that area. msso. msso wasn' t sustainable. so we do have the benefit of having greg milton in our club who did the master plan. so we look towards him for authority on the design that was approved. and the kids again are very open minded. and a lot of ideas. so the idea is to really work with them closely, get milton design to work with them closely. so we make sure that the designs are professional as well. we' re working with high school kids but they' re very talented. and the goal is that we wouldn' our names behind something. If we don't think we can pull it off and have it be a very professional outcome. So just the summit is just like to take that idea and just see what ideas within there you could that can be used throughout the park. Okay. You know and then it ties it all together. What would also be fun is we're trying the main goal on this is to really educate these kids these students and to give them some real world experience. So we're also the instructors are very open to have commissioners come talk to the kids. I think that would be if someone has some time to go in and just mention that to them. Get them thinking get them engaged more in the public process let them know that they're engaged. Just not in the classroom but a very highly thought of park in the community. I think it would be potentially a good experience as well. Thank you. It would be my final thought. Any other questions or concerns? Yes. I just want to thank you so much for the idea and coming forward and thank staff for coordinating when I joined the commission this was one of the things that I wanted to see happen was to see a proper fence around caper acres for families with kids of a certain age a lot of time is spent there and I think it's appropriate to have a more permanent fence. So I just want to thank you for the work that you're doing. I did have a couple of questions. So you said six to ten pieces. Sure. It sounds like. And I'm assuming those are kind of facing like the sycamore field the ball field there. Well what we're we had to do a little side analysis last week and we're looking at the signs facing inward so exterior of the park you've got the planting berms and you don't want them going into the planters and there's obstructing views so it's safer from the inside looking towards the signs. That's how we envision them. Okay. Yeah. But those would all be kind of on that one side not I'm wondering if they're all the way around. We don't have. It's basically a start. So if you look at that initial image it was kind of generic graphics that I think they saw maybe envisioned kind of repeatedly repetition along the fence. This is maybe something that could be built upon down the road. So with the budget that we got and the materials involved I think we budgeted maybe eight to ten pieces stainless steel. And the neat thing is the kids are going to design them. The welding kids are going to fabricate them so it really brings in multiple disciplines. And they're going to powder coat them if we get approval to do the project. So again you obviously need guidance from the city. Not only guidance but really kind of keep us on track and make sure we don't get too far out of bounds on what we're looking to do. But in the future potentially you can keep the theme and build on that through the fence because it's a pretty long fence. Yes it is. That's what I was wondering. No that sounds great. The timeline here says completed June 2025. You mentioned the St. Patrick's Day fundraiser so I imagine the signs will be completed then and installation in June. There's also a note here about design concepts coming to the commission for review and approval. That maybe is what maybe city put that in. We're absolutely happy to do that. We're going to be working initially with Milton Design Group to go and work with the students to have conceptual designs. Have them for your approval. Our fundraiser is next March so we've got several months. The teachers are well aware of the duration of the time frame to get it implemented and we feel it's plenty of time to get it implemented for the design phase. The signs would go up after our fundraiser. We can work on storing them or what have you to get that. That sounds good. I personally don't need it to come to the commission. If other commissioners would prefer that, that's fine. Somebody should take a look at it. If it's park staff that would be fine with me. Just to make sure they're appropriate. I wouldn't want us to hold you up if we have a meeting get canceled or something and you need approval and can't proceed. I would like to thank you for that. Thank you. you' re welcome. thank you. I do have a couple of questions or comments. First I like the idea of a common theme. A riffing on the themes we already have. Obviously the Sherwood forest theme. We already have Humpty Dumpty in caper acres. The nursery rhyme theme is already there. I assume the fences. I have two children they' re not small anymore. I logged a lot of hours in there. I' m assuming the fence is either going to be safe to climb or impossible to climb. Those are my two caveats there. The one in the picture doesn' t I don' t know. I' m not thrilled with that design concept. I' m sure people that do these kinds of things for a living will make it so. Because children will climb on anything and anything that they can. Sure. I think that' s a great point. I think that' s also a great point. I also think that' s also a great point with respect to the family game. I also think that' s also a great point with respect to I also think that' s also a great point with respect to with respect to family game. I also think that' s also a great point with respect to with respect to family game. family game. family game. family game. and she doesn't know where it came from. It was Howard's major goal to get that up there, and that was really the last element. So our club kind of looks at it as a bit of a legacy project. Right, exactly. So I love that aspect of it, too. I don't know if you know Howard, but he had a very iconic white mustache. And I did the design where the dragon had a white mustache on it, so that was kind of fun. That's funny. But this really sounds great. Anything, people with children absolutely love this area. It's a place that we would bring friends and family with children who would come from out of town. Mine are 12 and 14 now, so we don't spend much time there. I grew up in Gridley, at Stone's Throw Away, and I spent a good deal of my childhood in Cape Reckless Park. That's right. People come from all over to enjoy that playground. So really thank you for leading the charge. We're excited about this, and we're looking forward to the opportunity, and I think it's going to be a great project. I'd say let us know what we can do to help. Okay, thank you for your time. Okay. Thanks. Any other questions or comments on this item? Oh, yeah. Do we need to make a motion? We might want to ask the public if anybody wants to. Oh, does anyone from the public want to speak on this item? Okay. No? So, no, it wasn't. It was just amongst us, kind of. It's a big thing, and I still think that somebody, even if it's a city council, should kind of finally approve what this look is, because it's Cape Reckless. Yep, I agree. And not that it shouldn't be just, I don't know if it should be one or two people. It seems like it should be a group of the citizens somehow approving this. But at the same time, we don't want to slow you guys down. So regrettably, it's probably up to you guys to kind of manage that workflow. Because if it's not us, council meets every two weeks. Just as somebody's involved on a big level, from representing the public on what it's going to look like. Yeah, and I think we'd be comfortable with that also. But I think we're looking at it at the conceptual design. So it should be pretty early on in the process. And then that way, we won't want them to fabricate it and then don't like it, right? So we would come as a conceptual designs first initially. And that's all we would really do, probably, is just the conceptual. And again, to reiterate, Milton Design Group, which basically drafted the plan, is in our club. And we're going to be doing that. And we're working very closely on this. So the original tent that was approved will still be maintained with Milton Design Group. Okay. But also, I think those were just conceptual, not, they're not going to look like this. But it's the concept of having something decorative and not just this wrought iron fence. So that's still open, I think, to interpretation. And the students have that ability, for sure. Yeah, and this is going to sound negative, but it's not. I mean, I know Greg does great work. But the city should still be involved in the decision of what this is going to look like. That's all. Sure, absolutely. Absolutely agree. It's also fun that students will be working on it. And if these are Chico kids, it's probably kids that have spent time in that park. Yeah, they have. And have that history. And that's really a cool thing. So thanks, and keep us posted, please. All right, thank you very much. Okay, thank you. Take care. We'll move to item 6.2, update on City Plaza reservation process. The bid will point to the city's The City of City Plaza Park and Playground Commission will receive an update on the City Council's approval to allow alcohol in City Plaza for both public and private events. Staff will provide information on City Plaza only permit application proposed, increased permit fees, and the multi-departmental permit approval process that will be presented to the council at their meeting on October 15, 2024. Report, Linda Herman, Park and Natural Resources Manager. Thank you, Chair. So as you're aware, previously the council had approved, they were looking to do some events in the park in City Plaza, and there was a desire to serve alcohol. So the council approved allowing alcohol for public events only. Since then, there's been some private event organizations that have come forward, one of which, as an example, would be CARD for during the ice rink who wanted to have a private event to their donors and other people who were involved in the event. So they were looking for a private event to serve alcohol at the ice rink as a private event. So that was kind of the impetus on it. So we've been working with the City Manager's Office, because the City Manager's Office really took that charge because it was, I think, Casey Reynolds who had originally brought it to the council and wanted to see something change. So that's why they're taking the lead on this process. So we got to thinking how do we, you know, how do we control the public events, how do we control private events, because, you know, they're going to be different types of events that might could go awry or might have some issues that we could be concerned about or that police department could be, you know, concerned about. So the idea is that we have a pretty good process that we know for sure that these are going to be events that are going to go well and not have problems. And when alcohol, you have a lot of alcohol, you have a lot of restrictions that you didn't have before. It has to be fenced, whether it's a beer garden that's fenced or if you want to roam around the plaza, the entire plaza needs to be fenced. And we've had some public events that have been pretty successful that we actually had the brew fest that went really well. So the other thing is we require security, and so what we're proposing is that they provide security for one for every hundred people. And then we, so there's all these little extra things, a map, and all. And then the barrier is that you have to have a security And then because of the popularity of food trucks, you know, we're getting more and more use of the parking stalls around there. And then they sometimes want those fenced in and they're not fenced in. So we needed to start really coming up with a process and some real rules and restrictions on how we are going to handle these events. Because we're just getting more and more popular. We've had so many public events in city plaza recently. So we're going back to the council to talk about the private events. And so before you we did our own, we decided that we were going to do our own separate application process because part of the part of the process of the alcohol is we as city staff and you as the commission approve the park permit. The alcohol permit is done on a different level. That's the city manager. the manager level approval and the chief of police level approval. We needed to fold that into our process but not necessarily hold up either one of those permits and then the alcohol permits can only be applied for the ABC permits can only be applied for 30 days prior to the event. There's all these little nuances and we're trying to figure out how do we make this flow for the applicant as well as for staff. So what we decided is a separate city plaza permit was needed because none of the Bible Park things really pertain to it and city plaza has things that Bible doesn't have like it has four different types of electricity. There's different animals in my mind. So that's what you see before you now and then the alcohol permit they have to sign a hold harmless agreement. So the way we got that approved and the process is going to go is they will come in and get a lot of times these most times these larger events are coming in the day after their event that year ahead of time. So we can't even give them an approval on an ABC license or anything until we get that 30 days before. So the idea is we would handle our park permit the same through the park division and then when it got to the point but it wouldn't be finally signed and approved the hold harmless agreement until I license in the or we got that approved liquor license in our hand that was gone through the process through the city manager and through the police department. So they have to go to apply for an ABC we just had one come in today for the pumpkin head thing they have to come in and get the land owner approval to have alcohol and that's the city manager's office so just to apply for the ABC license they have to get two signatures one from the city manager and one from the police department and that's ABC's rules not our rules. So then they go and they apply for it and once they get the permit it has to go back to the police department for approval just to make sure that it meets all of their concerns and when they're in they're coming by staffing right they need to know about these events and to know that they're going to have proper people on duty during these big large events that they may need to have bring online so they just need to be aware and so we're sharing the applications with them as soon as we get them in for city plaza we always were but now it's just a more streamlined process and we're going to add also on our park permit that the city that the police department has approved the permit there's going to be a checkbox with this police department just like it has the director and the BPC and all that for approval so that's kind of the process for the application component there's also a lot more staff time that's being involved just in plaza events at all and so that's also part of the program also also part of the program also also part of the program also also part of the program also also part of the program also also part of the program also also part of the program also also part of the program also also part of the program also also part of the program also also part of the program also also part of the program also also part of the program also also part of the program also also part of the program also also part of the program also also part of the program also also part of the program also also part of the program also also part of the program also additional fees and again that's to get to make sure that the people that are having these events are responsible and are going to be able to do all the logistics that we require and that hopefully are reputable events so that's when you see before you is that there's also the increase in the fees we have a separate alcohol permit we did increase the alcohol fees for the application because it takes more later review we still are going to have the refundable damage deposit of 150 wanted to add an alcohol deposit for 150 and then you can see when you have an event with alcohol in the second column on the page on section 4 those fees doubles so what was a $75 reservation for the number of people and it's again based on number of people it's 150 300 500 1050 and 1500 and then we also looked at our our fee schedule that we have already approved and looked at the sound and electricity the electricity was only $15 a day and then so we up those up to the maximum that we have in our fee schedule for those that the electricity and also the additional restrooms as well so those are just the main changes that you're seeing now whether council is going to prove these rest these fees I I'm not sure but but I think it's at least a chance to have some extra layer of cost to hopefully help make these successful events do we have any questions commissioner hold on I take the person that I've seen first and commissioner glass so so the committee basically the council's already kind of approved this idea so whether we agree with the idea or not it's happening is that kind of well they haven't approved it well yes I take that back they did approve the private events thanks for your time thank you so much for your time and I'll see you next time. also with respect to the with respect to the with respect to the with respect to the with respect to the with respect to the with respect to the with respect to the with respect to the with respect to the with respect to the with respect to the with respect to the with respect to the with respect to the with respect to the with respect to the with respect to the with respect to the with respect to the with respect to the with respect to the with respect to the with respect to the with respect to the with respect to the with respect to the with respect to the with respect to the with respect to the with respect to the with respect to the with respect to the with respect to the with respect to the with respect to the But if the council wants to do it, that's fine. And I'm sure the lawyers will get involved at some point. Anyways, I think your dollars are way low. I mean, this is a huge profit potential for someone who wants to throw a private event there. 200 people and you're charging $300. I mean, whoever's putting on this party is going to – you can charge more is my point. I think – I don't know if you've looked out to see what other cities do, but that's significantly low. I think – I mean, significantly low. It should be – because we're also taking money away from every other bar and restaurant around town. So we'd lose that revenue necessarily. The noise. The only reason I talk about the noise is because I was watching a Real Madrid game. And because they have a huge stadium in the middle of Madrid and the noise of a concert goes over 52 decibels. So they've canceled all concerts until basically next year. And they're going to have to wait until the end of the spring until the event can figure out how to keep the noise level down. So I don't know what the noise ordinance is in downtown Chico, but it should be part of this package. If you're putting together a new package, it should – maybe think about comprising that element as well. Because you don't want everybody – because this could become a very common occurrence. So you don't want necessarily all the people living right outside this ring to be listening to bands all night long or something like that. So I'll be – that's it. I mean, those are my thoughts. I guess I don't know if that was four. Maybe it was only three. But that was my thoughts. When you're putting this package together for council to think of these things as well. Thank you. Commissioner Shearer. Yes. I also had a question about the fees. Well, I don't know if there's like an hourly rate at which – for Prop 26, you must have done some staffing reimbursement rates kind of and how much your fee should be, right, to fully cover the cost of staff time. I don't imagine these do cover the cost of staff time. And it seems like – I also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also the changes. changes side-by-side and I couldn' t see all the changes and what happens below 150 people but for those above 150 which is more clear here that does seem very low. That' s my only comment. Since the rest is in motion it seems like. thank you. vice-chair nava. thank you. thank you. thank you. my questions. the first one was akin to what they were saying about the staff level of effort. I was also wondering if they' ve assessed given if it' s this many people we anticipate this many bodies of city staff will be needed for x amount of time it would be good to get an idea and quantify that if you have examples of where that' s going to be. is that what' s anticipated or just on the inner part? no. sorry I should have pointed that out. the sidewalks will be accessible all the time. we did have that one event where we did close it off but we had to put signs saying cross here cross here cross here. I made the decision because having to deal with that I think we should never allow unless it' m sorry for describing myself with the cpd signing off and having to go to abc to get a one day event permit. my question is then is our pd able to be nimble on these things? it is a quick trigger where if you' re talking city manager, chief and then it has to go up to writing to the abc and come back and like you said you that his person who does that was apparently not available and then they quickly got to it after the nudge. do we have an idea if they are admitted to the on board too? for one it' s not going to be the chief actually signing it. they always assign a I think it' s jeff durkin now who' s a lieutenant I think. I think they' re going to have a couple people on that e-mail in case lieutenant durkin was out someone else would see it and they' d find somebody. we did talk about that and yes I think they' re going to be good about turning those around. I agree with them on the cost thing that would bear some scrutiny because I wrote too I was a little concerned about the liability factor people can say whatever they want but I' d really be interested to see what other people think about that part of it. thank you. s it. commissioner blatchley. I guess I' m a little confused which is normal but this is we' re just looking at approving this application as far as how the alcohol is going to be served in what type of containers where it' s going to be served is that being to provide you the information, but it really is going to be city council's approval. And we don't allow glass in the park, city plaza at all. And so that, yeah, we'll have some already rules that we have for all our parks, all the same rules that we have for our bid will park and park rules, no glass, you know, no, you know, I forget all the other ones, but no, no smoking, all that is going to still be part of this application. So those rules still stay. And then police, it's the rangers are actually doing the events because we do have a ranger now on, on weekends. So they would do the enforcement and they'd bring in PD if they needed more enforcement issues. So, so it would be the same type of park rules that we had before in under city plaza. Would the ranger just do like a courtesy patrol through there? Just stop? Because they, he's, he or she has a lot of other areas to patrol. A lot of times they'll go to set it up, help to set it up. And like I said, we're, we're, we're having a facility staff or park staff or people who come in on overtime to get it ready to turn on the electricity, to do the cleaning, to do all that. The rangers there to kind of get them going as well. They can turn on that electricity. Then they'll go do their thing and come back and check, but they always give them their number. So if they have any issues, the event coordinator can call the rangers and they can come in if they needed to. Is there a process in the city? We used to call them yellow days, but that, over time and the time of a extra ranger on overtime could be paid by the event coordinator. Well, that's what the fees are supposed to cover. But the, the, the, the only one who's getting overtime are there are facilities who don't, who only work Monday through Friday. So it's the ranger that would be on should be on that schedule unless they're not available. Then they might have to bring a ranger in because right now we don't have two rangers on the weekends. If we ever do have two rangers in the weekend, they would not be on. So we would have to bring a ranger in. Unless it was after hours. We would take the ranger that was off duty that day and the event would pay the overtime and we would bring that ranger on to cover why the other ranger could still do general patrol. Yeah, we've done both. So we've had them both on at the same time. Okay. So. Can I ask a follow-up? So this was an informational item only, but you're saying somebody has to come in and get paid? Yeah. And they're paid overtime to do this. Yeah, there's no way these fees are appropriate then it would seem. So is there, so how does this informational item go back where our comments are, you know, provided back to the city council or something who's ultimately making the decision? Yeah, so I would go to the city manager's office because I told him I was taking this to you because I felt you should see it because, and so I will just give them your comments and then she may be able to work that into the memo. It would, it's Jennifer McCarthy who's the assistant. Or deputy, I can't remember what they're called now. But so she's well, you know, she knows that I brought, I'm bringing it here and so we would just incorporate those comments into the memo. Into changes? No. Or into the memo? No, into the memo to see if the council agrees with what you guys are asking. So we can also, correct me if I'm wrong, when the council looks at this, you can go to the council meeting, you can speak as a private citizen. If you are a member of the board of officers, you are also a member of the board of officers' board of the council is not going to you. Those are our options on informational items only. like I said I' m sure we could be able to put those comments in because it did come before you. It' s not an actionable item for you because council has the higher authority over that. any other questions, comments, concerns? That' s a lot of work. It was a lot of work for you. And thank Kathleen for that because how many times have we revised this? Good job Kathleen. That' s a lot of work and it looks very thorough. It sounds like our only concern, not our only concern but our main concern was the fees. We need to charge more. For a private venue for a party that big, thousands of dollars. I mean thousands. I mean thousands of dollars. I mean thousands of dollars. I mean thousands of dollars. Anyway, thank you again. We will move to item 6.3. Madam Chair, we did have one speaker call. I' m sorry. Is there someone who would like to speak on this? Larry willis. Item 6.2. a couple of things. A whole harmless agreement isn' You require that whoever is putting on the party provide proof of insurance including liquor liability. Secondly, the liquor license itself, I' m somewhat of an expert. I' ve done dozens of them. You fill out an application. You get the property owner to sign it. It was free. It' s now $14 when you pick it up. They give you a text message that it' s ready. You go pick it up. The police department already signed off on it. It really doesn' t have to go to redding and come back and go back through the city process again. It' s a one-way ticket. It doesn' t have to be done within 30 days of the event. I submitted one three weeks ago for an event in November. They won' t act on it until 30 days before. But you do not have a 30-day window to get the whole process done. Like I said, I did one three weeks ago for an event that our church is having in November. That' s my two bets worth. thank you, Mr. willis. I will take that. thanks for coming, as always. any other members of the public to speak on that? just one? okay. we will now move to item 6.3 on the agenda, update on the park fire in upper bidwell park. the commission will receive an update on the park fire impacts on upper bidwell park and the remediation and rehabilitation efforts. this is an informational item only. if you have any questions, please feel free to put them in the chat box. also with respect to P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P They weren't just members of the Chico Velo. They're citizens that are interested. So we were able to do work on the trails to make sure that we could have some sort of loop, because that was always the concern is that people want to go. They always like to go up North Rim, come down B Trail, and go down the road. And most of the damage, severe damage areas, are past B Trail. So we knew that this was going to be a phased approach, that we would be able to open up other areas as we were able to either fix the trails or take down trees, et cetera. So Richie, I think, last meeting said he – we already took the 15, 16 trees to get it first opened up to diversion dam. And then he said he identified about 55 other trees that could need to come down. So he's already got the contractor engaged to do that. So that will come pretty soon. I'm not sure the exact date, but they'll do those. And those – And those are the only ones along the road. He did not look at any along the trail. So we still have caution out there that, you know, if you – be aware. It's just – it's a little different idea in the sense that when you're riding a bike or you're walking or running or et cetera, you're moving, you're more of a moving target. Now, if you're at a picnic site or a campsite or a swimming hole and you're parked there and you're there for a while, those are the areas that are most concerning usually. And not that we're not concerned about them all, but those are the ones that are more likely. To be – should be handled first. The other thing that we're working on is we got what's called – and I don't know if I mentioned this at the next meeting, but CAL FIRE, DWR, and a bunch of agencies put together what's called a watershed emergency response. What's the T? Anyway, so they have put together the – what they think is going to happen to shore erosion. And they – what they're thinking is that what would be – and I know I'm talking about the – I'm talking terms from a weather idea, but what would normally be like the amount of erosion that would occur for a five-year type storm is they think is going to happen with a two-year storm. So they're working with Cal OES and also with the county search and rescue. And they have a working group that's working together. They are meeting. And it's – but Butte County has a responsibility for five-mile. So we're most concerned that any type of debris would get caught up at five-mile. And Diversion Dam, the county's poised to do that work because it's their maintenance facility, not ours. So they're all working together. We're all working together to see what we can do for that work response. Now, that's the Rock Creek, Big Chico Creek, and Mud Creek are the three creeks that they think are going to – so, of course, they're looking at, you know, the Kiefer Road area, Mud Creek, and DWR's Mud Creek also, and then Rock Creek. Where we are really just looking at, for us, the Big Chico Creek corridor. Today, actually, the Ecological Reserve, and I'm also part of a separate group with the Resource Conservation District, I mentioned, has taken the lead where we're trying to go upstream and do what's called process-based restoration, where it's a beaver – what do they call it? A beaver algorithm or something, or leaky weir – analog, yes, thank you. Analog or leaky weirs. Or, you know, just putting wood debris in the tributaries to try to slow the flow of the sediment. They are being trained. There's a training going on right now, today, tomorrow, and Wednesday. I think Shane's going to try to go to the one on Wednesday to try that we do that. All the tributaries have been – I think I showed you the map. And RCD did a map of it because we are such a small component of this erosion area, and we're downstream. So we do have, I think, a couple hundred – or 100 or so. More tributaries that we want to treat on these tributaries. They have thousands in the Ecological Reserve. And then you have the private landowners above that, you know, Higgins, the whole area and all that. So the whole idea is to try to get – they're moving. They're moving. Resource Conservation has gotten the statutory exemption for CEQA. They've gotten the water board permit. They even, I think, actually finally got the Army Corps permit. Okay. So they really have gotten this done in fast time. And so they will restart doing some of that. The CCCs, they have an agreement with the CCCs for Prop 68 funding for six to eight weeks of two crews of about 15 people. And then we also will have an agreement with – and we're part of this, too. They're including us as part of this work. So we'll get the CCCs probably after BSIR because, again, we want to get the upstream. We want to get the downstream first and then downstream last. And then we also have a separate agreement with CCCs for a different pot of money grant also that they are going to help us maybe look at getting some of the down and dead wood out of Lot A area where the goats were. So they're going to have that. I know that's not really in the fire area, but it's fire-related. And let's get the dead and down out of there, right? So the other – let's see. The last thing is we have – I have a contact with – a bulldozer who works on fires who's going to – he's going to come up and we're going to go up to Bloody Pin and the big fire break that they did down there this week. And he thinks he can do the work that we need to do to weatherproof and do the water bars and et cetera in maybe just a day when he sees it. So he's on board and we've got him kind of in the queue. So we'll know a little better when he comes up and looks at that fire break. Okay. And that's really the only – that one fire break I think is the only thing that we really need any help in because it's a pretty wide one. And that's what stopped it, like I said, from going west, more western. So did I get it all? I think. Gosh, that was incorrect. Sorry. That was – Does anyone have questions or comments for Linda? I think a lot of it's probably just wait and see and cross your fingers, right? I have one question. Okay. I've been hearing things about the ability to use Lindo Channel this winter and something about debris piling up and I didn't really understand the specifics of that. Yeah, and that's the five-mile diversion dam that I was talking about. So how it's supposed to work is it's supposed to come down Big Chico Creek and when it's too much for Big Chico Creek, it goes to Lindo Channel. And there's actually a sill in Lindo Channel that's buried now and that whole sediment is kind of changing this design. But the original design was you have – I forget how many cubic feet per second or whatever. It's 1,600 or so. I can't remember the numbers. So there's only so much capacity in Big Chico Creek. Then it goes into Lindo Channel and then it has that so much capacity and then it's supposed to go into the Sycamore Diversion Channel. And that's not quite working as well as it was originally designed, but it still works. We still get some in there. And that's the area that they are afraid that's going to get impacted, that's going to come down. The debris is going to come down and that's what's going to be the most impact. And so that's what they're – And that's what they're concentrating on. That other group, the one that's the bigger Cal OES group is concentrating on that. So we're going to be poised to – you know, the national weather – the way it's supposed to do is National Weather Service will issue a warning or a watch for floods. And then everybody are told to do – this is where you do next. This is where we go. You go here. We go there. We go there. And so that's all kind of being put together into a plan. And they're all meeting, I think. Another week, two weeks to make sure that everybody's all on the same page and using the same approach. So the RCD work is trying to limit the amount of debris, I think, that enters into Big Chico Creek. And then you're saying there will also be this active response. So while the storm is happening, people will be out at these, like, critical areas, keeping an eye on them, removing logs and things like that that might be blocking certain areas. Yes, absolutely. You nailed it. That's exactly what's happening. We have two factions going. Let's not get it there in the first place. And then what it is. It's happening. This is what we do. Okay. Thanks. Any other questions or comments? Commissioner Glatz? Sorry. Just a quick one. Just because you're focused so much on Upper Park right now, let's even take a comment earlier about the no smoking and fire dangers. And maybe we could really be – just since it's focused right now on no smoking signage, you know, just making people triply aware of what's going on up there. If you could also put a line up for us with P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P as well. thank you. anyone else? thank you. we will move to item 7 on the agenda reports and communications. items provided for the commission's information only no action can be taken on any of the items unless the commission agrees. I will move to item 7. 7.1. parks division report. linda hermann. again this is just an information item only. if you have any questions you have of me of the report provided to you I would be happy to answer. I do. lots of questions tonight. on college core. I remember it seemed like that started this year. I think it was in the college core. it says it goes to may. I was wondering will it continue on after that? this is our third year in with college core. I put that it goes through may because it follows the school year. whether it continues next fall I don' t know yet. it' s annually renewed the university decides each year? it' s a partnership between the college core. it' s based on funding. if there' s funds available it will continue. the initial program was slated for five years. the goal is to help students get some work experience and they also receive a stipend. thanks. any other questions or comments? I will ask the next question. I know the goats have been grazing this month. I assume they will keep going tomorrow. we' re talking september and october. to me who educates myself as much as I can on fire suppression, vegetation management. the optimal time to graze these goats would be in june and july. I will use my neighborhood as an example. we had the goats late may early june. after the spring growth and then it dried out we had them in canyon oaks where the fire just started. the upper park fire started about a half mile from my house. there' s a reason the wind was blowing one way my neighborhood is safe because we have no vegetation. we are fine if we have it. we graze them late may early june. to me september and october we are at the end of fire season. sometimes our fire season is over in october. I' ve said this before I don' t understand and I know it' s based on availability and budget. those are two concerns. why we don' t have those goats ready to go next june. we don' t get them contracted if they have a habitat issue. there' s nothing you can do about that. to me this is not the optimal time to graze those goats. I was hoping jesse would be here. could someone sort that out for me? it' s because of your neighborhood. we have them. you have them. he calls them in january and february. they also have contracts in july and july 1. they need to have all their areas grazed by july 1. those are contracts they held before us. we do try to get them in here. we have had them get in here. we will have them next year because I have a separate contract with CAPRA for the lindell channel. that includes what we just did now. that was a little later than I wanted to. they' ll be back in may or april or may next year and then fall again because I have to get two grazings in before the grant runs up. we had to have three grazings total. we may not have done the fall. I don't know if you have seen lindell channel but it looks awesome. it' s as dry as can be and it doesn't stop them. I was just wondering. you can blame it on my neighborhood. I meant that teasingly. it' s been a schedule thing not a budget thing on their end. they' re just becoming more and more popular and they have all these existing contracts. somebody needs to open another business. it' s a money maker. it is. my husband, we go to maui sometimes. they have one person that' s doing the big fire they just had there. there is a real need for this. they do a great job. they are sought after. they have reasonable prices. they always come in as a lower bid. we did have one other bid on lindell channel but it was almost double the cost. they are in popular demand. they really are. they are doing a really good job. they are very conscientious. I think we have one more year on the contract and it will go out to bid again. it will be earlier next year. in lindell channel we can have them after that. then it can go all summer. okay. thank you for clarifying that for me. vice chair nava has a question. it' s more directed to peers. I noticed that item d under this update is the pals volunteer appreciation event in october. there' s also make a difference day is f. also in october. I' m going to be gone. I would like to encourage if any of us that will be here could make an appearance. I think that' s great. I know shane and others always appreciate when they have others on hand. that would be great if we could calendar that. I was at the 37th annual bidwell park cleanup. my daughter and I handed out all the we had to get every little faction of the community represented. I love seeing chico state students and high school kids. especially the chico state kids that were coming into their adopted community some of them and working really hard to clean it up. everyone was so proud when they bring their big bags back. it was really cool. if everybody could calendar that thank you for pointing that out. october 12th. 5 to 7. commissioner pletch. I was going to comment on your thing on fires. there really is no fire season anymore. it' s almost every year. this time of year when you deal with an oak woodland environment which is basically a understory grass. it' s the wind that carries it. this time of year you notice we' re starting to get the wind again. even though we couldn' t get them early it' s great we have them now. if we are going to have a fire in lindow channel or anywhere and the winds are starting to kick in they will move real quick. that' s where the fire season is. I do understand that as I pointed out. I' m glad they' re here any time but I just wondered when the optimal time was to have them. any time. they also target different species at different times. for instance they like the poison oak when it' s green. they' ll eat it when it' s red but they prefer it when it' s green. the fall and the spring is that also you' re getting different types of species as well. I' m glad they' re here. I' m glad they' re here. you can tell. people are really happy with the comments. once everybody has been able to ask their things on this I have a comment I' d like to make if I need to go around to the front to do it I' ll do it. kind of like a question comment. is it on linda' s report? it' s not on linda' s report. I' m concerned from a commission perspective as well. it' s not as an individual. you' re going to be noted in the minutes as speaking. let' s go through the agenda first and then before we adjourn. any other comments or questions on the parks division report 7.1? no? okay. 7.2 the street trees division report richie bamlett and obviously he' s not here and he e-mailed us. I did have one thing I don' t know if he put in his e-mail or not but we are going to be removing they are going to be he may have the contractor now be removing those dead trees at rod and gun club that we talked about so he did put that in there. that was one we discussed about when we were talking about the parking lot so I wanted to know if he did go assess them and they are dead. are you going to give him his kudos he got tonight then? one of the yes. I just want to make sure he hears that somebody called him out specifically with some kudos. I don' t know if that was his doing. that' s right away property. that' s not street. he may have. she may know more than I do but I don' t know for sure. him to go ahead and email his report. before we adjourn, vice chair nava. I' m getting complaints again about the number of tents and the action going on and I know we' ve all got ongoing things so if we can get an update maybe at the I know I won' t be here but at the October meeting and maybe some about how things are going to be prioritized. it' s getting really bad with the litter again and the park people try to do a good job of keeping up and all that but I know a lot of people that do the walks in the neighborhood so we get stopped all the time because they know we' re here and it' s like hey down by spot number whatever and I do encourage people call it in so it can get on a list but I' m concerned because I' m also seeing photos of stuff in the water and it' s just not okay. I' level and I' m concerned about the water level and I' m concerned about the water level and especially with considerations of runoff and other things that we all know the water level is going to come up is it going to get worse what else is going to get in there so I would like to see that we stay on top of that and then I don' t know if you could bring up to city council that the tents that are right up against the curb when you' re in your car and if you have a passenger that is going to be in the way thank you. thank you for coming up here into the building. that' s it. thank you vice chair nava. we will go ahead and go to item eight adjournment adjourn to the next regular meeting on october 28th 2024 right here. thanks to everybody thanks to staff always thanks miss julia our super park ambassador. thank you.
