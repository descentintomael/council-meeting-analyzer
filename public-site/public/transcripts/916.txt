 Good evening. I'll call to order the adjourned regular Chico City Council meeting of August 18th. Let's begin with the Pledge of Allegiance. Please join me. I salute and pledge. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. And can we have the roll call, Madam Clerk? Council Member Huber? Yes. Council Member Morgan? Yes. Council Member Orry? Yes. Council Member Reynolds? Yes. Council Member Stone? Yes. Vice Mayor Brown? Yes. And Mayor Schwab? Yes. To start the meeting, we have a presentation from the community group Concerned Citizens for Justice. Marty Dunlop and George Gold will be giving a 15-minute presentation, and then there will be opportunity for questions from council at the conclusion. Welcome. Thank you. Thank you for inviting Concerned Citizens for Justice to speak before you, the City Council, this evening. CC4J, as we refer to ourselves, first communicated with the Chico City Council in January 2019 about our focus points for police reform, and then again in May 2020 about important information to gather in background checks for a new police chief, and later with a summary of the 40-plus local groups and prominent citizens, who support CC4J's objectives. Members of the CC4J also have made several presentations to the council during public comments. As a local group, CC4J promotes a police culture that preserves human life, reduces the use of force, values the dignity of all, and includes citizen participation in establishing the policing needs of the community. At this time, CC4J believes a fundamental and systematic change is needed, to transform law enforcement into a public service where respect and trust are reciprocal between peace officers and the community they serve. In January 2020, the California legislature passed AB 392, redefining the circumstances when deadly or lethal force is deemed justifiable by a peace officer. As you are aware, there is an ad hoc group which has been convened at the behest of the City Council to review the CPD use of force policy. CC4J believes that not only lethal force, but the use of excessive force by the CPD needs thorough review. The California legislature elaborated further when AB 392 became law, that individuals with physical, mental health, developmental, or intellectual disabilities need to be considered thoroughly as these individuals' abilities to understand or comply with commands from peace officers can be compromised. The California legislature has also passed a new law that would allow police officers to be able to conduct police operations in a safe and secure environment. Right here in Chico, we only have to go back to October 2018 to watch in horror as half a dozen police officers handcuffed an 8-year-old boy, his hands cuffed behind him like some sort of criminal on the TV show Cops, sitting on the sidewalk, crying uncontrollably. And then upon the road, after a request from the woman who filmed the incident to remove the cuffs, the cops refused. Then in 2019, another group of cops conducting a welfare check on an 11-year-old girl in a bikini, tackling her to the ground, sitting on her, because this 11-year-old girl was some sort of threat to the officer's safety. These officers involved incidents unite to clearly demonstrate that these officers either have not taken any sort of de-escalation and crisis intervention training, or more likely, they do not know how to apply in the field what they learned in the classroom. Guardians, not warriors. So what does this mean? It means that 99% of police interactions with the public, the police should be wearing a guardian hat. They should be smiling, not frowning. And they should have in the frontal cortex of their brains a point of view that they understand our society. That they have a skill set where they are trained to de-escalate conflict situations. That they have enough training to recognize a mental health crisis, and that they know what to do when it's presented in the field. One of the biggest mistakes cops make and buy into is the command and control mindset. You must immediately respond to every command I utter instead of, let me stop, take a step back, reassess, and when necessary, call for a mental health professional before going to the next step. This runs counter to the military style training that says, never back down, never retreat. In 1964, Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart, while talking about pornography and obscenity, famously said about obscenity, I know it when I see it. If I watch those videos of that 8-year-old boy and that 11-year-old girl, what I see, that is obscene. For peace officers to reduce the use of force they apply during encounters with citizens, it is clear that ongoing advanced training is necessary in de-escalation techniques as well as in the avoidance of implicit bias. However, training is not sufficient in itself. Skills in de-escalation must be demonstrated in the field by officers. As we all know, changing one's behavior is not a simple matter. There needs to be either positive or negative reinforcements employed by the CPD to bring about change in officers' behaviors. There are three populations who are most vulnerable in our society and need responsible treatment by peace officers. Those who are mentally challenged, people of color, and the unhoused community. The passage of SB 230 in 2019 also speaks to training and use of force that needs to be implemented by the CPD. Across the country, most police departments provide recruits with a rather extensive weapons and use of force training. Here in Chico, approximately 160 hours a day, in weapons and use of force techniques. De-escalation and CIT training, about six hours. In our society as a whole, about 6% of the population join the military. Yet police departments make up about 26% military veterans. Lots of people say this is good, but therein rests some of our use of force problems. Hiring individuals with military training or background leads to people who will follow orders without question. And in fact, with the high rate of PTSD among our veterans, these candidates who have learned to never retreat, never back down, actually may not be the best candidates for police work in the 21st century. Instead, we should be recruiting among our university social services, and mental health disciplines. Transparency and accountability are the foundations upon which a democratic society stands strong. SB 1421 also went into effect in January 2020, and addresses the release of records under the California Public Records Act. These records include officers' violations of civilian rights, shootings, and other serious uses of force. These types of actions by a peace officer can quickly undercut the public's trust in law enforcement, undermine the ability of thousands of hardworking officers to do their jobs, and endanger public safety. Also new passed this year is SB 978, requiring law enforcement agencies to conspicuously post on their websites all standards, policies, operating procedures, and training materials. Posting these types of information online ensures that law enforcement agencies are more transparent, leading to greater understanding and better relations between law enforcement and the community. CC4J wants the City of Chico and the CPD to fully comply with these two laws. Transparency. Just a few days ago, during the meeting of the City's Policing Review Ad Hoc Committee, it was revealed that an outside vendor performs the background checks for new officers, and therefore the new police chief. But when I asked for more information about this company, our city clerk sent me an email indicating that my request was a Public Records Act request, and that I should have to pay 25 cents a page to get that information. SB 978 specifically requires law enforcement agencies to, and I quote, conspicuously post on their website all standards, policies, operating procedures, and training materials. Last month, I was invited as a support advisor to two African American gay men who were attacked at a party for being black and gay. A hate crime. While sitting in the interview room with the victims and the Chico PD detectives, we noted that one of the detectives had a copy of the police report in their hands. When we asked for a copy of the police report, Chico PD refused. And now, months later, we still do not have a copy of the police report. Last year, when I executed a public records request for a copy of the police report of that 11-year-old girl, I got a three-page denial of my request from the city attorney. So yes, redact that data that is precluded because the subject is a minor. But give us a report. What CC4J is concerned about is the Chico Police Department's complete lack of compliance with California law again and again. These three laws, they're not bills, they are the law of California. AB 392, SB 1421, and SB 978 combine to change the way police departments conduct business as regards the use of force and transparency. These days of 100% secrecy cannot continue. And is not allowed. And the California law is 392, 1421, and 978. And just a word about accountability. It's pretty simple. Each and every police officer has a moral imperative to speak up and intervene when they see something they know is wrong. And that means when they are in our neighborhoods or in the administrative offices at police headquarters. We have all heard the country-wide call for defunding the police. CC4J believes this is a statement being made loud and clear for the need for significant change in current policing practices. CC4J believes that due to the increase in mental health incidents, many times resulting in the unnecessary loss of life, there needs to be a mental health intervention team operating 24-7 that shifts the lead from law enforcement to mental health professionals. This also would require a shift in some funds from the police budget to the most appropriate social services. Eugene, Oregon has a 30-year history of success with their CAHOOTS program, a mental health intervention team. CAHOOTS fielded 24,000 calls in 2019. Of those, 1% required police assistance, saving the city on average $8.5 million annually. CAHOOTS teams in 2017 responded to 17% of the Eugene police call volume. The CAHOOTS budget is approximately 2% of the Eugene's annual police department budget. A recent study compared homicide rates across the U.S. and their attendant police budgets. The homicide rate across the U.S. in 1994 to 2013 decreased by 32%, yet police budgets rose by 46%. Here in Chico, the annual city budget is approximately $45 million, with the CPD budget at half of that, at $27 million. Citizens need to participate in establishing the policing needs of their community. CC4J believes improvement in the Chico law enforcement requires citizen oversight. Oversight is defined in the dictionary as watchful and responsible care. An independent, impartial citizen board with the authority to review police files is essential. Boards or commissions such as these have been established throughout the country and state, such as in Davis, California, and Eugene, Oregon. A citizen oversight board would review all use of force incidents, citizen complaints, recommend disciplinary action when necessary, and participate in improvement to police policies. If I might take a second just to correct my friend and colleague, Marty Dunlap. The statistic for homicide rates is from 1994 to 2017 decreased 32%, and budgets have risen 46%, police budgets. And one other thing, the police budget right now, as I understand it, is about $54 million, not 45, which makes up about 52% of this city's budget. There are plenty of models around the country for policing alternatives. Davis, California, and Eugene, Oregon, just to name two. I visited Davis and Eugene and interviewed both of the independent police auditors in these cities to see firsthand how they have changed their policing paradigms. I would like to suggest that this city council take a close look at Davis and Eugene. And by pure coincidence, I have a friend in Eugene that over the last week, as regards her adult son who does have emotional challenges, has called CAHOOTS three times to assist me. And I would like to stir with issues that have arisen. CAHOOTS, just CAHOOTS. Our police officers are essential. Police work is both dangerous and stressful. First responders have higher levels of post-traumatic stress than that found in the general public. Full mental health support must be made available to officers following any severe crisis situation. Counseling must be mandatory following discharge of a weapon or any use of force incidents to ensure the mental health of the officer and the safety of the public. The receipt of counseling services must not result in any stigmatization of the officer. Police suicides. This is an ongoing tragedy. In 2017, 172 cops killed themselves. In 2018, 174. In 2019, 228. In 2020, 108 already. Clearly, something is wrong. Chico's former police chief and the current police chief have repeatedly touted Chico PD's compliance with Lexapol and Post. So let's unpack the elephant in the room, Lexapol. This city council, the chief of police, the city attorney, have told us again and again that they are in compliance with Lexapol and or Post. Yet it is Lexapol, yet it is Lexapol has been denied certification by Post. Any of their classes, not once but twice. Today, none of their classes are certified by Post. Lexapol. The city has told us again and again that the city is in compliance with Lexapol. But Lexapol, a private company, to this day declare that their most basic principles rests on two pillars that are Lexapol's foundation. First, reduce liability and risk. Second, to avoid litigation. That is what they're about. To quote Lexapol, Lexapol's trainings are designed to be costly, but also cost effective training delivery method that serves as a safety net against lawsuits. Mr. Dave Grossman is a police trainer who travels the country some 200 days a year and teaches in huge training rooms filled with hundreds of police officers. Here is what Mr. Grossman says to his classes, and I quote, When you get out of bed to go to work, if you're not ready to kill, get another job. Later in the same class, he says, after you kill someone, go home and have sex. It will be the best sex of your life. Mr. Grossman's classes are part of what he calls his killology method of policing. Obscenity? I know it when I see it. Mr. Grossman is on the Lexapol advisory board. This type of training does not contribute to the health and well-being of our police officers. In fact, this sort of training is an insult to our police officers and the public. A number of different parties need to be included in such a transformation of the CPD. The city council, the new police chief, the police union, and the community. CC4J has developed a detailed action plan that outlines the actions they believe are necessary to bring about such a transformative change. It is clear that at the foundation of bringing about change is the care and support of peace officers. Who and what entities are most able to bring about such change in law enforcement practices and address the care and support needed for our officers? I've talked about that 11-year-old and 8-year-old children who were detained here in Chico. Fortunately, these children are alive today. It is said that the eyes are windows to the soul. Just a few weeks ago, there was a memorial anniversary just down the street from here for the anniversary of the killing of Tyler Rushing. At that memorial, I met David Phillips, the father of Desmond Phillips, and Scott Rushing, the father of Tyler Rushing. We three men, coming from very different backgrounds, but we have one distinct commonality. We all three have sons. Well, kind of. My son is alive and well in the East Bay. David's and Scott's sons are dead. When I looked into their eyes, I see unimaginable pain and loss. I don't want to ever see that again. The California law, known as SB 230, says in Section 1, and I quote, Law enforcement officers shall be guided by the principle of reverence for human life. To reach that goal, reverence for human life, we need fundamental systemic change, a paradigm shift, not just a reform in how we police our communities. Change is hard, but we need transformative, systemic change in how our police department conducts itself. Make no mistake, we are at a crossroads. If we don't change, all of us will pay the price. We will pay the price in the loss of democratic freedoms that we have taken for granted, right here in this city. Thank you. Thank you very much, Mr. Golden. Ms. Dunlap. Does Council have any questions for the presenters? No. Thank you very much. Thank you. You're welcome. I'd like to just make one correction. I said that this was the meeting of August 18th. This is the meeting of August 25th. The agenda is continued from the 18th. Madam Mayor, I have two items that came forward since the posting of the last agenda that I believe are emergency items, and I'd like the Council to consider adding them to today's agenda. Before we go into that, can I read just some information about how the public can attend the meeting and participate in that? Sure. Okay. I want the public to know that this meeting is being conducted in accordance with the executive order N-2920. Attendance of the meeting. The public may attend the meeting in person at 421 Main Street. Speakers may also sign up to speak by checking in at one of the speaker card tables located near the sidewalk on 4th Street. All speakers will be given instructions to queue in the speaker line. Please follow the instructions accordingly. One of those instructions is that if you enter the Council chambers, you must wear a mask, and you must wear a mask at all times when you're presenting. We also have remote public participation during the meeting as an option. The public may view the meeting on Comcast Channel 11 or by using the Granicus View meetings online capacity. The Engaged Chico Civic Engagement Program will also be available for citizens to access and input on individual items, agenda items, both prior to and during the meeting, and that program can be accessed through the city's website. Public comment will also be accepted by email and can be sent to publiccomments at chicoc.gov during the meeting prior to the close of the public comment on an item. The public is encouraged not to send more than one email per item and not to comment on new items or numerous items in one email. Council Member Stone. Thank you. The two items that I'd like us to discuss and consider as emergency items are one, a tangent from the cooling centers, but also the fact that we have smoke-filled skies, which makes the breathing much more difficult. I'd like us to discuss options if that's somehow connecting with CARD a little bit more closely. And the reason this is important and this is an emergency item, of course, is because we have smoke out there in conditions that are not healthy now, and we can expect this to continue throughout the fire season. And we realize that we don't have the resources that we think we do, given the cooling centers. I can announce them both, and then we can take them one by one. Well, let's just kind of go over procedurally from how we are permitted to bring up emergency items. And I will certainly have the city attorney correct me, because I probably will not have all the details. But from what I understand is that the item or the issue must have come up after the posting of the agenda, and the item requires immediate attention before our next meeting, which is scheduled now September 1st, a week from now. And then two-thirds majority vote is needed for us to decide the item is an emergency. Is that correct, city... or Mr. Jerrod? Yes, generally, yes. It's Government Code 54954.2 offers three ways things get on the agenda. You've just described way two, when an item has come up after the posting of the agenda requires immediate attention. Council Member Stone is referring to an emergency situation, and that's a different subsection there that requires a majority vote, but you must find that it actually is an emergency situation. The third had to do... has to do with an item from an agenda that was posted not five days ago. So that one does not clearly apply. The other two situations may, and it's up to the Council to make the determination whether an emergency exists. Here, an emergency is defined as a work stoppage, crippling activity, other activity that severely impairs public health, safety, or both, as determined by the majority of members of the legislative body. So Council Member Stone has cited for the cooling centers, the smoke and heat. It would be up to the Council to determine if that is, in this instance, an emergency situation by majority vote, and by majority vote then, vote to add the item to tonight's agenda to discuss. So there would be two separate actions? I think you could probably work those into one, that an emergency exists based on those facts, yes. Would the fact that the county has opened a cooling center influence an emergency? Are we debating it now? Oh, no, I guess not. I'm sorry. So the first question is to ask for a motion to say that this is an emergency, if that's what the Councilors would like to do. Correct. And to add the item pursuant to 54954.2 . And to add the item pursuant to 54954.2 . Do you need me to make that motion? Okay, that is my motion. Wait, can you repeat your motion? Under the section just previously stated that the emergency condition exists and will continue to exist and be persistent for the next several days given these fires surrounding us and the heat compounding it. That's not a whole question. What are we asking for? Sure, a motion to discuss the item tonight. I think that's... Yeah, that's the motion. Yeah, I think it's a threat to public safety. For the purpose of allowing the discussion, I'll second the motion based on the idea that for people with delicate health, this could definitely be considered an emergency. So we have a motion and a second. Is there any discussion? May we have a vote, Madam Clerk? Council Member Huber? Yes. Council Member Morgan? I'll vote yes for the purpose of discussion to follow up on what Mr. Huber said. The irony being that we're asking citizens to line up outside in said smoke and not letting them inside for our meeting is not lost on us. You made an excellent point, but I don't want to discuss that quite yet until we're ready to have the discussion. Council Member Horry? Aye. Council Member Reynolds? Aye. Council Member Stone? Aye. Vice Mayor Brown? Aye. Mayor Schwab? Aye. Carries 7-0. Okay. Thank you. Your second item? Based on the information the city attorney provided, I will defer the second item. You will not bring forth a second item? Correct. I'm deferring. Thank you. Mayor Schwab? So, we... Oh, I'm sorry. Council Member Horry? I have an item that I discussed earlier about changing the order of two agenda items. I'd like us to consider 5.3 first and then 5.2. I think it would be more effective if we used the right time, if we did get the larger policy that might resolve the issues in the other one. Okay. So, I'd like... He'd like to hear... His proposal is to hear 5.3 first and then 5.2, the currently ordered. So, in order to do that, I'd need to have a motion to reorder the agenda. So moved. Second. Okay. So, I have a motion and a second to reorder item 5.3. 5.2 and 5.3. Could you, Mr. Horry, could you repeat your reasoning for that? 5.3... Can you hear me okay? Yes. Yes. 5.3 is a general discussion of our policy with encampments. I believe that once that's resolved, whether we've had a discussion and new direction, that that might answer the question to 5.2. So, rather than take up... A small part of the overall policy, I think it would be more effective if we provide time if we take up 5.3 first. So, can we have a vote, please? Council Member Huber? No. Council Member Morgan? Yes. Council Member Horry? Aye. Aye. Council Member Reynolds? Aye. Aye. Council Member Stone? Aye. Aye. Vice Mayor Brown? Aye. And Mayor Schwab? Aye. Chairing 6-1. Item 4.1, hearing on resolution amending the city's fee schedule, has been pulled and will be re-noticed and brought back at a later date. Direction from the Council, the emergency item that was just added, I would presume goes under 5.4, items added after the posting of the agenda? Appropriate to me. Okay. And that's appropriate, City Attorney? Yes. Okay. Madam Mayor, I have a question. Yes. The gentleman in the front row, is he a member of the public or is he waiting to do something in the meeting? No, he... They asked me before they made a presentation, should they leave right afterwards? And I said that there may be some people who would address their questions about their presentation during business from the floor, and I invited them to stay. Not to... Just so that he could hear any comments that might be made. Well, this isn't personal, but I wasn't allowed to invite people to come in during comments from the public about things that might be said. I mean, the meeting's either public or private. It's public or it's not. Okay. Well, I'll take direction from the Council. It's a big deal on equity. Okay. Thank you. Right. Because I just wanted to make a statement that there isn't a place on the agenda for questions from the public or comments from the public on a presentation. The appropriate place would be... Okay. And just so the public knows, the appropriate place to address questions or comments from a presentation would be under business from the floor. Okay. We will start with the consent agenda. The consent agenda is for matters routine in nature and can be enacted on one motion. Are there any Councilmember disqualifications or no votes? Actually, item 2.1, I am done. I'm disqualified from. Are there any others? Okay. Are there any speakers? Or have we received any comments on either the Engage Chico platform or emails on this item? We have received seven comments, e-comments. Okay. So while we're reviewing those, could you please read the names of the people who submitted comments? And then we will see if there are any members of the public that are here with us tonight that would like to address the council. Okay. Comments from Claudette Ritter, Julie Threat, Karen Wellhoyt, Nicole Nava, and another one from Claudette Ritter. Those were all relatively short comments. Does anybody need an additional time? Yeah. Are there any speakers on the consent agenda that are with us tonight? No. Okay. So we will close public comment, and I'll entertain a motion. Move approval of consent. Okay. Can you say yes? And I'll just have it noted that I am disqualified from acting on 2.1. And that is because of? Yeah. Okay. Have to read the- Ordinance of the City Council of the City of Chico. Granting a franchise for the exclusive use of a portion of city street sidewalks and other city property municipal parking lot one to Chico Certified Farmers Market. All right. And who is the second? Clarification that disqualification is due to the business interest within 500 feet. Yes. Thank you. Okay. And who is the second? Ready for the vote. Who is the second? First vote. Thank you. Council Member Hughes? Yes. Council Member Hughes? Council Member Hubert? Yes. Council Member Morgan? Yes. Council Member Orry? Aye. Council Member Reynolds? Aye. Council Member Stone? Aye. Vice Mayor Brown? Aye. And Mayor Schwab? Aye. Now we will have business from the floor. Members of the public may address the council at this time on any matter not already listed on the agenda with comments being limited to three minutes or as determined by the mayor based on the number of minutes. The council cannot take any action at this meeting on requests made under this section of the agenda. And how many members of the public gave us comments on Engage Chico? Fifteen comments on Engage Chico. And how many emails? I didn't actually count the emails. They are in front of you. There are quite a few. Okay. And do we have any members of the public who have submitted speaker cards? Yes. We have 13 speakers. Okay. So members of the public will be permitted to speak for three minutes. That will bring us about 40 minutes' worth of time. And we will review the written comments as you read the comments. We will also review the person's names. Okay. I will call the first name and the following two speakers. The first speaker is Roxanne Eldridge. And then can you read the names of the people who have submitted written comments? Written comments from Paula Hare, Julie Threat, Susan Smead, Kim and Karen Wilhoyt, Michelle Rutlinger, Autumn Brock, Caroline L., Nancy Park, Ashley Jones, Nicole Nava, Deborah Jones, Andy Wilhoyt, Robin Engle, Claudette Ritter, and Jessica Montgomery. And following Roxanne Eldridge is Matthew York and then Rob Berry. I'm sorry. Are you here to use the computer? Yes. Not yet. We are going to go to the next speaker. But anyway, we are still reading the comments. DR. DR. DR. DR. DR. DR. DR. DR. DR. DR. DR. DR. DR. DR. DR. DR. Thank you. Has counsel had enough time to review the comments? Mr. Ori, have you had enough time? Yes, thank you. Okay. All right. So we will hear from the public that are with us tonight. And our first speaker again is? And I'll repeat the first three speakers. First is Roxanne Eldridge, followed by Matthew York, and then Rob Berry. Good evening. Hi. I just wanted to say, I guess we all know elections are coming up. I see everybody's foot popping their stance on the needle. That's cool. I would like for, you're planning to do that since the last year. That's a good one. Shout out to all the citizens that made that possible. Good job for them. That's awesome. I also see people's statements on the council that are up for reelection saying they were against needles. So I would like for you to push your mind toward not this and pass a ban on the ban ordinance to make a ban on needles for coming back into the city. So. That would be my request. Please make a ban using the land ordinance. I see a lot of people flip-flopping their, you know, which way their, what they stand for, you know, what they stand for, who they stand for. Because at this point, nobody knows who some of you stand for because it's one side or the other and keeps switching around. So I would like to say please pass a ban on the needles by using the land ordinance. Yeah. I guess that's it. And again, thanks to all the citizens that made it possible to actually shut the program down. Thank you. Next speaker. And Matthew York is actually not here. So it's Rob Berry followed by Robin Engle. Good evening. Well, the campaign season is apparently ripe. We have shown an over, a role to play. We have shown a lot of the people that are trying to get in front of the needle dumping program that is already dead. We have shown a lot of the people that are already trying to position themselves as friends of our parks and waterways. While none are standing up in direct opposition to the Brown and Deal invented by Brown and Huber. Encouraging the ongoing pollution of our water and the degradation of our parks and downtown. While Paris Burns, so to speak, you are. Fiddling with moving the deck chairs around on Titanic. By bringing cannabis and carbon to the agenda. Are you people paying attention at all? We want to, if you know what needs to be on the agenda. Ban needles once and for all. End illegal cannabis anywhere in our parks. Restore the water quality in our parks and make it more cool which are currently unsafe for recreational use. Work to end this economic shutdown before the vital small business is here, dry up and roll away forever. Drop everything else if necessary and get our police force fully funded and staffed up. Stop doing things that you have no business doing and focus on those things only you can do. Police, fire and roads. You are not the answer to homelessness but you can be the answer to crime. You can. You can be an answer to environmental pollution. You can be a force for safety, cleanliness and beauty. But no, you seem to have bigger fish to try. Well, we are watching you move out of the frying pan and into the fire. Is the reality of this situation dawning on you yet? I have been standing up here saying these things for four years. Safety, safety, safety. The lights are on but nobody's home. That is the reality that most of us see. Wake up Chico. These people are not working for you. Thank you. Next speaker. Robin Engle followed by Paula Hare and then Jessica Gianola. Good evening. The more truthful narrative. The absolute worst thing about Chico is that home is a place where you can live. We are homeowners. Five of you or 71% are homeowners. Even before the campfire and before COVID, 44% of our city compared to 64% of the nation were homeowners. This pandemic is expected to force 30 to 40 million U.S. citizens into homelessness. And bankruptcy. The homeowner is facing a rapid decline in its already minority population. The homeowner denies this along with science, math, climate change, racism, homophobia, police brutality, its own addictions, mental illnesses, laws, and mortality. The homeowner is above the law in their mind. The homeowner is above the law in their mind. The homeowner commits rape, incest, child molestation, sex trafficking, drug trafficking, drunk driving, driving while texting, fraud, nepotism, bribery, hostile takeovers of say, a mayorship and safe space with your shelter, etc. The homeowner rewards other homeowners versus implementing any consequences for their crimes or actions. The homeowner is above the law in their mind. The homeowner is above the law in their mind. The homeowner is above the law in their mind. The homeowner is above the law in their mind.

I'm Paula Hare. Last week I was tased from Chico. I called 911 after I got shot with a case of gun. I was shot, right out there. I grabbed the wires. I picked it out of a person's hands. It was 11. I tried to shoot the electricity, but it was on a shooting range. I got down in the sand and got scared as hell. I called 911, going to where I lost the building that sent the gun to Moody's Park. It cost 300, top of the building. And three club levels. They said the case was blank. Blank. Blank. Blank. I got in by me. Went by the guy that shot me. He went to the man. The guy that was awake. I got scared. I got to me. I couldn't get anywhere within 911. You've got a problem. There's no cheating. If there's a change in Chico, my wife's down. I'm like, I'm not cheating. I got down to the ground. I have very limited sight. I'm up at my 70. 70's 70's 70's 70's 70's 70's 70's 70's 70's 70's 70's 70's 70's 70's 70's 70's 70's 70's 70's 70's 70's 70's 70's 70's 70's 70's 70's 70's 70's 70's 70's 70's 70's The guards on this heroin, the bank, don't want to have this figure. So if they're going to take and try to kill someone in the 70s, the case of them is going to be on the hardback. Now I think that's on you people. You are not protecting me, the citizen. I'm not protecting you. I'm proud of Jesus' life for this country. I would like to see you untie the police's hands, get your 911 straightened out so they know Chico, so they know who somebody is, and then you can change this on a building, or something. So you can catch this with Bill versus Joe or your mom, Chico. You can make your 18 and 20. No, I wasn't supposed to tell you that. I thought I was supposed to tell you that. I thought you were going to tell me I'm getting in the park, but I don't see very good. I can't pull this in. I wish I could. I wish I had my arm. I have no sight in my eye. Just enough to get away with running a bike. I mean, you can have it everywhere. That's all I have to say. So I'll come to my end. Brown, we're ashamed of you. Thank you. We're proud of you. Thank you for your comments, Ms. Hare. Thank you. But since the pardon is out, I don't think there is a time. We have to identify what a common issue is and work towards it. When it comes to an emergency call, an emergency meeting, elections are right over the corner and we need to feel confident in who is representing us. I don't think that a special meeting should be called for something that is so obviously an emergency. An emergency could be that someone or multiple people is live. I don't think that's the case. I think that if I'm standing out here in the heat for one night, if I can help someone get off the street, then anyone who is breathing toxic smoke, whatever it is, I'm willing to do that because it's part of the community. Another issue that I talked about last night was supporting our small businesses. They are inclusive for the city and with COVID, we have lots of teams tossing and they've changed how we're doing things so that we're not exposing each other. to Governor 19 potentially, and people need to work. The small businesses have taken the biggest hit. I was a small business owner and didn't pull out my . So we have businesses willing to make changes, willing to make those tweaks that they can operate safely. It's totally different than what we've done, but they're doing it, they're trying. We should support them and not deny them a special permit or charge them a bunch of money or require extra rewards from something somewhere. They have this waiting, they have this benefit. We should be supporting them, working together, keeping our committee moving forward. I wasn't sure if we were talking about cooling or not. If we're not, if we are, we need it. It's heating. It cools every year. Every year we have seasonal issues that keep coming up. We need to plan a place. Always stand for it. They're coming. No matter who's out there. Thank you, guys. Thank you. Thank you. Before we call the next speaker, I don't have access to a timer. Do the members of the public, can they see how their time is? Okay. I've got, I turned on my alarm here on my phone. I can call out when there's 30 seconds left. Can you do that? I think that that would be helpful. Okay. Okay. So we have Jeff. Followed by Nicole and George. I want to talk about something here. We'll probably have three to us tonight. I just want to talk about the economic impact that policies are having on this community. I've been here about 18 years now. And I've seen it. And we've lost evidence. I've seen a steady decline in our public life. I've seen a steady decline in job growth. I've seen displacement. This is not the achievement of the wonderful panel that I believe was once the most important thing in our community. This is one of the best places to live in America. And the policies you guys are doing are very responsible for this. I actually went on to the GenPriority GenPriority Profile Plan. And number one and number two things are creating jobs and job and wage growth. This is number one and number two GenPriority GenPriority. And these are never discussed. This is never thought of. The policies that are being enacted are by the community, by allowing them. The homeless to basically, the trans-femines to occupy downtown. By allowing that, that basically destinates our local businesses. They have a hard enough time eating and the internet. As you know, it's becoming a small town of basically restaurants and bars. And retailers, this is getting closed up. People are not coming downtown anymore. And while we do not have a right to say where some should sit and where some should not sit, we do have a responsibility to enforce the laws and the rules. They should not be pushing in their traffic. They should not be catching downtown with smoking, or fangirling, or anything like that. Those are the rules we have to enforce. It is your job and responsibility to create jobs in this town. It is your job and responsibility to create them. We have to increase our global life. It is not, also the city council appears to be counseling, counseling, and that's a huge problem. And it has to be taken into consideration with the impact that it's going to take on the actual local economy. This is, it just has to change. Right now, on the agenda tonight, we're talking about mail-on. And while that's an important subject, that's how we're longing to see it on the agenda. It's not, there's so many more important things to look at in mail-on. And we're talking about, and unfortunately, all these, of course, we've had catastrophes over the past 15 years. But the trend has not been positive with quality by the GECA. So before my time is up, I spoke to the local executive at 515 tonight. His company, it's a private company in town that works with, that works statewide and dispenses . They're unable to 30 seconds. 30 seconds. They're unable to recruit talent because of public safety, what I call . The city is unwilling to provide a safe home for the tenants. The same general told me in other companies, the top 20 employers in this town is actively looking elsewhere to move their business at this time. Because the city is not protecting people. This has to be addressed. There are respective numbers of small policy issues that are in politics at all. We have to think about how to keep us alive. Time. Thank you. Nicole Navar followed by George Deeds and then Jacqueline Martin. Good evening. The citizens of Chico have had to speak because you have not acted. They have had to act in unimaginable circumstances. And do the work that you are unwilling to do to shut down the needle program. Citizens have a contract for independent water quality testing and the results indicated a high people content. The city is changing their testing protocols and updating their guidelines apparently to come commiserate with the state. It appears that the people were on point. Support your police department. So we heard a presentation where we were asked to speak. We were not allowed any comment. I'm offended that people were in here and we were not allowed to be in here to give support to our local Chico police department. They are well trained. And they are compassionate. They are up to standards at the state level with the laws that that group raised. They have an open door policy. And my expectation and that of this community that I spoke to has been that you need to stop freezing their positions and figure out a way to bring their ratio up to standards. One way you can support is to actually vote yes on a state proposition 20 that will help us locally. I have sent you two times an email with this attachment for the reducing crime and keeping California safe act. Asking you to sign a resolution as a city council body. One of you responded to me, Casey Reynolds, that she is willing to do so as an individual and the group does not do so. I would really like to see that get done. And there again is somewhere where your community is stepping up. I want you to enforce the illegal encampments. They are a huge fire risk due to Trans-Am House fires. This is a big concern for our community. My own home has been put in jeopardy multiple times. This last time it took the fire department three hours to get it completely under control and mopped up. The other time was over a fence near my home, yards from where my new baby nephew was. Thank you. This is unacceptable. We have noted this issue repeatedly to you only to get ignored. Citations rarely get issued. The fire department maintains its under the purview of Chico PD. I don't really care if it's PD or if it's the fire department. Our community's expectation is that all citizens, regardless of status, would get cited if you are starting an illegal fire. My expectation is that you ban eagles. Thirty seconds. Thirty seconds. Ban eagles. What do you need to understand? We're done. We shut down a program that was not capable and violated their permit repeatedly. They're shut down on eagles, but could pop back up and so could another. So you need to ban the eagles here, and you know you could do it. Attacks on citizens are happening, but by the crime on us, you're enthroned in innocent citizens, strong armed robberies, bycatches that are unsafe, parks are unsafe, and now having a pot ordinance will not help with the crime we're already experiencing. I think you guys all need to do well. But anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, I was listening to him and somebody started running in advance and he put the hat on. And there were about two, two of us in the goal line, two of us right there. And Vince said, you know, you're going to do a part. You're going to do it. At least you're going to do it. Mr. Dietz, can you get by the microphone? Sometimes we got right into the cage. August 1st, we got to stay out of the report. We were invited to our salon. We were taking a walk. We're in a big, tiny crunch right now. Before August 31st, these are the other three matches. I don't want to set you today, but when we see it, it's going to be more close. Next time, Sean O'Lantern. You know, Casey, I talked to Nicole. I said to Scott, you're wrong. Everybody, because you don't sign on the streets. You're wrong. And I said, you're wrong. And now, as a unit, you have to sit down and work out a very elegant, forcing part of the channel, down the barrel, down the time. I like that you sent me this script. It's really easy. Really easy. And that's what I see you through. I see people with their phones in their hand all the time. Come on. Let your phone in your hand. I let you, Vince, find the center, June Nelson, call him. I did this quick. I said, hey, you know what? I'm going to keep counting. You're going to understand right now. You've got to do it. You've got to do the anyway. You've got to do the anyway. You've got to do the anyway. You've got to do the anyway. You've got to do the anyway. You've got to do the anyway. You've got to do the anyway. You've got to do the anyway. You've got to do the anyway. You've got to do the anyway. You've got to do the anyway. You've got to do the anyway. You've got to do the anyway. You've got to do the anyway. You've got to do the anyway. You've got to do the anyway. You've got to do the anyway. 30 seconds got 30 seconds time thank you so much all right Jacqueline Martin followed by Cecil Hamilton and Patrick Newman good evening council I wanted to tell you that I'm here right now to remember today I was on a person and I just had to be so impressed with the guy smoking a joint on the car party town really just come on anyway I want to say I've been on Facebook watching your what you're saying okay what you're saying what you're saying what you're saying and what a bunch of talk what a bunch of talk come on up with the truth okay now so I'm just going to say it's you guys have been out this long enough to know about it you heard us and you disregarded our pleas now that you've remissed it and the majority council has left us you're a chance at compassion for the criminal trans men addicts by assisting and fueling the addiction with inexcusable inexcusable so I'm just going to say I personally beg you and on the phone to stop this and still continue to ignore it and use it now my family my family is personally personally affected by what we have done Ms. Martin we need to have your mask on thank you when you're when this council has allowed to happen in my family my kids is inexcusable inexcusable I can't even afford I couldn't order for my for my grocery that got addicted because of your decisions all I do you better restart your thinking about my grandkids you better start coming out and drinking I'm sick of it! By the way, I have still, my grandson is two now. Thank you, Randall Stone, for throwing me out that night and telling me personally that you take your kids to the park every day. La la la la. I have still not been able to take my grandson to the fountain, to One Mile, to Cape Robe Acres. But I've been on time! You have 15 seconds. I'm done! Thank you. Cecil Hamilton, followed by Patrick Newman and Jeff Creed. You might want to spray that down here. Okay. I'll speak it up. I'm not yelling. Please don't think that I am. Just so folks at home can hear me. I'm a new master. Sorry. Um, I'm a tough person. Um. I know you guys were following up in March last time about one person having a bad day. I think that made my point. Some of you might need some protection. Luckily I work with security, so give me a call. Um. The City Council, basically, the only reason I'm going to speak on this is just, I want to talk about legs. Some of you have no chance of being re-elected. None. Unless you're running against Hale and Hilo, perhaps. But! Case in point. You still can do the right thing on your way out. This city has fallen into transience. A six year old child was stabbed in the face the other day by a needle. Don't know if you saw that. But it happened. You can still do the right thing on the way out. I come from the military where if you have the power to do something and you do not, you are just as responsible as those that committed the crime or any other action. I'm just hoping, whether you're pandering for votes, which many people on here who are flip-flopping their positions are, Cheap boy. But! Still. I hope you do the right thing. Just do the right thing. Ban the needle program. Put the nail in the coffin. Walk away knowing that, hey, you may have helped contribute to the damage. You may have done the downfall of a lot of this town. But on the way out, you have cared. Leave a legacy that people actually care about. We're not asking you to do anything but just try and help save some lives. That's all we're asking. Orville's done it. Humboldt County has even... Hey, up in Eureka! Humboldt County has taken a stance on drugs stronger than Chico. That's... I don't know. Sorry. I don't know if I can help on that one, but... I'm just hoping you'll do the right thing. Please. Lastly, Mr. Stone, when someone's speaking, give them the respect when they are talking. Don't take your mask off, chew your food. That's rude. Have some respect. Thank you. Thank you. Patrick Newman, followed by Jeff Creed and Julie Threatt. Thank you. Um... The parks are pretty safe. Our town's pretty safe. But there are a lot of destitute people out there. And they're suffering greatly. As you can imagine, living without shelter in some of the most difficult weather of the year, they are visible. They're in our midst. And this is very painful for a lot of us. But... But it seems seemingly in different ways. And it seems like the pain for some of us is just seeing them at all and thinking that somehow we can criminalize and punish our way out of this by hiring more and more police and enforcing the law without compromise. And there are some of us who see this as structural and 40 years in the making. And the chickens coming home bruised from 40 years of bad public policy dumped on our streets. You are the ones who are not responsible for solving this problem. But it is in your hands. And you are responsible for treating it and addressing it in the most humane, least punishing way that you can. Because those are human beings that have real feelings. And I think one thing parenthetically to say is that if we spend more time with them where they live, in their element, that becomes more clear and humanity comes through more clearly. And they become less objects and more people. There is work that has to be done there all the time. So, anyway, the consolidation of charity is on its way and we are talking about Navigation Centers and all these things but it is transparent to me that what we are doing is closing down the Jesus Center which is the one contact people have for food and clothing and we are doing that to try to in addition to criminalization make containing people easier so that we don't have to send them as much. And that has been the design for a long time. Just an update, Chico Friends on the Street has not missed a Sunday. We have been out there, we were there last Sunday with about 10 of us. We have been distributing everything from toothpaste to food to clothing to socks to hats to tampons to combs everything that people need. This need will increase. I am seeing more and more people on the streets of Chico who appear to be starving to me. So we have a choice. We will be at a fork in the road every single time on these issues. Do we see these as human beings that have a place in our community? Or do we see them as people that we think we can punish into non-existence? We can't punish them into non-existence. All we can do is make them more and more miserable. So this winter I hope more people will join us with more stuff because we are going to need sleeping bags and all the other things we needed last year which has cost us to between $50,000 and $100,000. Thank you very much. Thank you. Jeff Creed followed by our last speaker Julie Threat. Good evening Council. I like others have said tonight I've been coming here for years. I wonder why I still do. And then I have today's work and I have a lot of work to do. I have a lot of work to do. The gentleman tracks me down, runs me down, tells me a story and the story in 30 seconds or less revolves around how the city hasn't done anything to help him with the illegal camp and the waterway behind his house he's been complaining about for months even though they cut his fence and steal his bike. They cut his fence, come under his property, harass him and his dogs and the city still doesn't know anything. So, you know, let's play a game. I'm going to tell you a story about a man who crosses Longfellow Bridge more than once a day who stopped at Longfellow Bridge looked at the traps in the camps under Longfellow Bridge and called, wait, what number do we call? Do we call the police? No. Do we call code enforcement? No. Let me think. Wait, there's parks. Because there's a whole number of calls as a citizen. You have to figure out which number to call. And we'll get you to the right person. So, if you're at home and you're wondering when is this ever going to end, I'll tell you right now. Not in the foreseeable future. Nothing Chico has done in the last five to six years I've been looking at Chico City has done, they haven't done anything to stop the decline. They've done many things to increase the decline. The rise of crime is planned. They intentionally push transients, homeless, criminals, and addicts into the neighborhoods where they will commit more crime on you, the citizen. And the City Council doesn't intentionally. We saw a perfect example of Mindyism happen online last night when the Mayor said, get them out of my area. And I go on this morning and he's going as clear. Camps that were legal under the guidance of the City Council before last week were removed. Camps that were illegal under the guidance of the City Council in Hatties Glen were still there this morning. Why is that? Is that because somebody called their friend who's on the Council and he decided to put it on the agenda and it got taken care of before he even discussed it on the agenda? Boy, it must be nice to have those friends. But if you're like the other 99,000 people in Chico and you don't have those friends or you don't have a City Council member who cares enough to go over a bridge and go, hey, maybe I should do something about this and some Council member, you're pretty much screwed. So, if you think this will change with those seven people or the next election, I've got to bridge this other. Thank you. And our last speaker is Julie Threat. I'm just going to start by saying that the Philosophy Philosophy Philosophy Philosophy Philosophy Philosophy Philosophy Philosophy Philosophy Philosophy Philosophy Philosophy Philosophy Philosophy Philosophy Philosophy care so much about the homeless and the addicts. And then you take in the homeless and you put them into Biddle Park. And you absolutely made us all completely against each other. So the unhoused in Biddle Park, and those responsible for the cleanup is my first issue. But really I hear about the meals. So obviously we've got another meal program. And we know so much more as a community because we are the ones that got rid of it. We spent money, we spent time. I got personally bossed, I got abused, I got assaulted. I got some person named Rose coming after me telling me I'm nasty and sad. I got some person named Angela who's writing letters to my, I'm a volunteer. I'm a volunteer for people that are addicted. And she's telling my supervisor to let me on the department. And I'm like, I don't know. I'm gonna stop volunteering. How about that? I'm gonna stop volunteering, so you think I'm gonna stop volunteering with the Chico Pee Project. But no, the last piece that pissed me off the most was the fact that she purposely put out and found out somehow that I'm a widow from a law enforcement officer that passed away on a job. Now that thought just rotted me to more. But still, the fact that I got some raw and hot off the press, Julie Friedle, my gosh, she's a volunteer. But she's telling the world. And then, in the end, I got a white letter to the mayor and to the Chief Madden, mostly for the Chief Madden telling him how to deal with this. I didn't even cite it, but it's all to me. But to tell his people how to work. Straight out of the FAA Playbook. And I'm calling you out on that. What? All you want me to do is say? You gotta tell us. You gotta tell us. Straight out. And this is not just going to pass. So what am I gonna say? I'm pissed. I'm tired. I'm angry. I'm a widow. I'm a volunteer. That's all I do. And I'm the number one given of this shit. So I'm tired of it. So this is the sort of thing that broke my life. It took a lot of life to get commies made, to hand out to people, to educate them up in this burglary. So this one is for you. This one's for you, Mila. This one's for you, Stone. This one's for you, Schwab. This one's for you, Brown. Thank you. And that was the end of our business from the floor speakers, correct? Correct. Let's take a ten minute break before we go on to item 4.2. We'll call our meeting back to order. You remember 4.1 is pulled and will be brought back at a later time. We'll call it a day. So item 4.2, commercial cannabis regulation, introduction and first reading of two ordinances and adoption of resolution to allow commercial cannabis business. We have a report by Andrew Jarrod, city attorney. Andrew, before you start, can I just confirm that Councilmember Ory is still with us? I'm still with. Thank you. Thank you. Wonderful. Thank you, Madam Mayor, members of the Council. Thank you. Before you tonight is the culmination of over a year's worth of work on regulating cannabis in the city of Chico. For your consideration, there are two ordinances and a resolution to allow certain cannabis uses. As you're aware, in 2016, Prop 64 was passed in California, the Adult Use of Marijuana Act, which legalized, the use and cultivation of marijuana in cannabis in certain circumstances. One of those circumstances is when it is allowed by a city to be used as a business use. This established several types of businesses which could be regulated, notably storefront retail, non-storefront retail, manufacturing, testing, distribution, cultivation, and micro-business. We have a number of different types of businesses. After Prop 64, there were regulations adopted in 2019. There's actually those regulations that established those previously stated business types. An ad hoc committee was established by the City Council and met from, I believe it was May 2019 through August of 2019. That culminated in a recommendation that was taken to the City Council. And in November of 2019, the Council directed that this recommendation be brought back in an ordinance form. That ordinance was completed in February of 2020 and taken to the Planning Commission. It was then presented to the City Council on March 17th of 2020. That Council meeting, of course, was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. That was a COVID-19 situation. And before you is that ordinance, those two ordinances and the resolution unchanged. There are, there is a staff report that has been presented for tonight's meeting, actually last week's meeting, that addresses 18 additional issues that were brought up by members of the public and or staff. Since the publication of that there are two additional items of data that are being presented to the City Council. of minor cleanup that I'm also going to recommend. The ordinances will establish which types of businesses would be allowed and which types of businesses would be disallowed and where they would be allowed in the city of Chico. Those types of allowed cannabis uses would be the storefront retail or what people often have called dispensaries that would be for medical and recreational uses. Non-storefront retail, which often are called delivery services, manufacturing, testing, and distribution. Prohibited would be cultivation within the city limits, except as otherwise allowed for personal use and micro businesses, which are a type of sort of vertical integration of several types of uses, typically cultivation, manufacturing, and storefront retail. The ordinances and have modified two parts of the city code, Title 542 and Title 1976. In general, there are, a couple of other land use tables that are addressed in the Title 19 or land use title of Chico Municipal Code. The 5R or 542 section deals with the type of business license for cannabis businesses that would be required. And it is this way that the city has an annual regulation permit that would be established and managed in that way. The 542R section actually establishes the processes and procedures for how to manage that cannabis business license program. And the Title 19 establishes the locations where different types of uses would be allowed. And for the retail establishment, storefront retail, would require a conditional use permit be awarded by the city council prior to opening. Per council prior direction, it would be limited to four of those types of permits issued. And that's after the ad hoc committee's recommendation of one permit per 25,000 residents. So as the city grows, an additional permit would be issued. And that would be allowed to be advertised for application. And the city could then award an additional permit at a later date. There is a, all the other uses would be allowed by right. So there would not be a conditional use or other type of land use approval process. However, there would still be an application process for the business license. Cannabis business license to ensure that all of the requirements established in the 542 section and the 1975 section have been met. That application process has several tiers to it for the different types and culminates in reviews by a staff member or consultant, then by the city manager and ultimately for the, for the, for the use permit by the planning commission and our city council. The recommendation on distance requirements from what are often called sensitive uses has been established here that for the testing labs, manufacturing, distribution and delivery, there would be a one, a 100 foot distance buffer from any school and grades K through 12 daycare or youth center. For retail establishments, the storefront retail for grades K through five, the recommendation was a 600 foot buffer and for grades six through 12, a thousand foot buffer. Since this was published, since the staff report and ordinances were published, a couple of things occurred. The planning department provided additional analysis on parking requirements and that has been included in the report dated 1820 as exhibit two. That analysis was done by planning staff in early August and concluded that the parking for each of the different types of cannabis uses, is consistent with the parking demand required for other types of uses in those land use categories and therefore would be sufficient. The changes that are being recommended as identified in the 1820 staff report begin on page three and have to do with the various aspects that some community members have put forward. And like I said, a couple of issues that staff has identified. Our recommendation on those 18 items is found at page seven and that is to adopt those listed here as two, three, four, six, seven, nine, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19. We can go through each of those or select versions of those. But there are two others that I would like to bring your attention to add to that list. The first would be to add as a number 19, but the word additional be added to the title of section 524315. That has to do with some regulation of one particular use, but that is the retail. That is also included already. There are already regulations in another section. And so this is to avoid any confusion that two sections are competing in some way of adding regulation. That indeed the intent with 315 is to add some additional regulation lists. And this would go to the issues concerning the essentially requirements on a business use that would allow it to either be, I believe in that case, that is a retail delivery. So that isn't allowed by right use. So at section 315, the title would simply read additional operating requirements for retail delivery businesses because there are indeed some existing requirements in another section. The other item 20 that I would recommend to add is there is language that is required to be recommended to be added to section 542.300. And 542.300 deals with, and 542.300B, that has to do with the issue of added artificial flavoring. The intent behind that section and as is identified in items 16 and 17 on pages 6 and 7 of the staff report has to do with adding artificial flavor. Initially the concept was as to smoked products. As written, it got essentially written in such a way that would have also potentially included any type of manufactured product including edibles. And so that was not the intent behind that section. So language has been added to identify in those three sections. And that would be section 1975-140I, 1975-160K, and now also 542.300 that, quote, such prohibition shall not apply to cannabis products which are manufactured as edible or topical products. Again, so the intent would not be to prohibit those types of products being produced or sold. Instead, the artificial flavoring issue would be in relation to inhaled products. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. With that, The first would be to consider and recommend amendments. That is just a general that you, we recommend that you consider this matter. The second would be to waive the full reading and introduce for first reading the ordinance regarding Chapter 542. And that would be as amended by the now 20 items. The third would be adopt a resolution amending Title 5R. And the fourth, waive the full reading and introduce as amended the Title 19 amendments. The fifth recommendation is an alternate that if you want to scrap the whole thing or provide some additional direction and tell staff to go back to the drawing board in some way, that would be covered under Recommendation 5. So with that, if there's any questions, I stand ready to answer. Are there any questions? Mr. Ori, do you have any questions? No, thank you. How many speakers do we have with us tonight? We have 13 speakers. Okay. So, they will each be given three minutes to speak. How many people sent us comments on the Engage Chico platform? We have 41 comments on Engage Chico. Okay. And how many emails? There were a few, not too many. Okay. I don't have the count. So, let's take quite a few comments. Okay. So, let's take about seven minutes to read the comments. While Danny, you read the names and get the members of the public queued up. And if we need more than seven minutes, we'll take more than seven minutes. Madam Mayor, at this time, I'd recommend that you open the public hearing. Okay. Thank you. We'll open the public hearing. Any comments? We're from Janet. Janet Bezarellos. Isabella Najera. David Welch. Julie Threat. Karen Wilhoyt. Justin Valenzuela. Demis Renteria. Estrella Contreras. Nancy Doherty. Adelia Ofraga. Sarah Wood. Carolyn E. Angela McLaughlin. Jessica Gianola. Jessica McKenzie. Judith Schrader. Elizabeth Kuyper. Ashley Hummer. Andy Greer. Crystal Kesey. Nicole Nava. George Harvey. Dakota Rice. Will Brady. Margaret Hicks. Brett Nelson. Alyssa Rincon. Deborah Jones. Sean Hummer. Carolyn Arpee. Andy Wilhoyt. Robin Engle. Amy Marie. Katie Maple. Claudette Ritter. Mark Christman. Norm Rosine. Rob Berry. Jessica Montgomery. Gary Viertel. And Susan Smead. Laura Watts All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. Has counsel had enough time to review the comments? Mr. Orry, have you had enough time to review the comments? Yes, thank you. Very good. Then let's hear from members of the public. As I said, there's 13 speakers, and so each one will be able to address the council for three minutes. Okay, first speaker is Rob Bay, followed by Jessica McKenzie and Robin Engle. Oh, Mr. Berry, just one second before you begin. We got comments from the people at home that it was difficult to hear the speakers at home. They've made some adjustments to the microphone, so we'll see if we get any additional comments on that. If the comments still can't be heard, we were going to suggest if council is okay with it to have people move to the microphone. I think we're going to move to the front podium. I asked city manager Orm if he was okay with that, and he said that was fine, because he's the closest one is the reason I asked him. So let's go ahead, and then Danny, if you get comments, will you please let me know, and we'll make that change. Okay. Now you may begin. I give up. When I try to talk about the health impacts of COVID-19, I'm not sure I'm going to be able to get that. But anyway, the young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young young close to the real cost of supporting this industry, you insist it will be a windfall. When I talk about the increased burdens that will be placed on staff and law enforcement at the worst possible time to do so, you ignore the experience of other cities and simply say, what can possibly go wrong? Well, quite a bit can go wrong, and it will, since absolutely nothing turns out as rosy as the plans you promised to Chico. Okay, you win. Pass your ordinance. I just have a couple of favors to ask. Number one, read the whole damn ordinance. No one fully understands what you are up to here. Don't insult us by waiving a full reading. Two, list all the benefits you claim we will enjoy. We will get back to you and see how you did. Number three, list the things you have considered as the most important things you have done. Number four, list the things you have considered as risks to the rosy projections you promoted as harmless and completely beneficial. We are interested to know if you even considered the risks at all. Four, tell us how you have planned to pull the plug up if this turns out to be a disaster. I'm sure you are familiar with the concept of establishing property rights through licensing and dealing with reverse combination claims when you want out. Explain that to us. You own this. Everyone on this council who votes for this ordinance, you will be held accountable in your quest to recreate Potterville here in Chico. Some of us have a different vision. You own yours and we'll own ours. Thank you. Jessica McKenzie followed by Robin Engel. And I will note that Ms. Preston is watching. She is not attending the meeting and she could not hear Rob Berry speaking. Okay. So is council okay with the speaker coming up front? Yes. Okay. Ms. McKenzie, come up front, please. Good evening, everybody. It's been a long slog. So, I am not going to share my opinion. I'm going to share my thoughts. I think that it's pretty pertinent. Over the past two years, I've attended at least eight council meetings where there was public comment. Ten. Oh, I'm so sorry. There you go. I hope I don't need to start over. No. Good. Ten committee meetings, planning commission meeting, IAC meeting, all of which were open to the public, all of which had public comment, all of which I spoke at. So, I think everybody knows how I feel. And think about this. I say that in part simply to set aside the notion that you may be hearing from some quarters that we are moving too quickly on this. No, we are not. We've been at this a very long time. I don't know how many things take two years from the time of inception to get to the point of actually making a vote. COVID, of course, helped us with adding a few months onto that. So, what am I here for tonight? Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for your tenacity, your perseverance, your tolerance, your patience, your willingness to slog through what has turned out to be an incredibly arduous process. I've said before and I will say one thing again, repeat one thing again. This ordinance, this set of ordinances is not the one that I would have written. That's a good thing. It shouldn't be the set of ordinances that any one person would have written. It is a set of compromises to the benefit of the community. So, it's not my perfect one. It's not your perfect one. It's a good one that has been well crafted. And I thank you from the bottom of my heart for seeing this through. I know it has not been simple. Bless you all. Ms. McKenzie, thank you for your efforts towards this. We would not be here without your support. Thank you. Robin Engle followed by Crystal Kesey. And then Nicole Nava. Good evening. Can you hear me okay? It's great to be here in support of moving forward with commercial cannabis industry and Chico ASAP. And as to all of the arguments that this is bad timing, this is bad timing, it is bad timing. It is bad timing. It should have happened years ago. It should have happened in 2016 when the vast majority of us voted in favor of commercial cannabis in Chico. But then Mayor Morgan decided he didn't want that vote to be realized and he silenced us. And our voices were undone. Democracy was undone. So, it's a shame that our Vice Mayor, Alex Brown, has been taking so much of a... verbal beating and condemnation for simply representing us, the people of Chico. Not only did we vote on this four years ago, but cannabis has been around for five or six thousand years. And since then we've known of the medicinal benefits of cannabis. Cannabis, it helps with trauma, it helps with PTSD, it helps with pain management for cancer survivors or patients. As I think you know, Councilor Huber, its benefits are astronomical and there have been zero deaths in the thousands of years since cannabis has been discovered. Zero deaths compared to millions of deaths due to alcohol. So, I'm just very happy to endorse this and say that I'm happy to say let's please move forward without any more obstructions or... um... people or... um... obstacles that want to kill this commercial cannabis. And thank you so much, Vice Mayor Alex Brown, for all of your thoughtful hard work on our behalf. On behalf of the citizens of Chico for making this a reality. Thank you. Crystal Kesey followed by Nicole Nava and Curtis Bartle. Good evening, Councilors. I'm just another person here to say thank you for seeing us all the way through. And I've sat in a lot of City Council meetings and other jurisdictions in California and Board of Supervisors meetings. And I have to say that this is probably the most comprehensive community stakeholder input ordinance that I've seen created in the state. And so, um, I appreciate that our community is so willing to listen to all the disparate voices in our community to craft something that is workable for those of us who are interested in pursuing a business in this city, in this industry. And provide enough protections for those who are afraid of what may come if we allow this industry in the city. I'd like to ask you to think about the city of Shasta Lake, which has successfully, um, had a cannabis industry in its community since 2016. Successfully, um, without incident, I believe. And so, I would... I think that we could model our activities on the success of, uh, jurisdictions that are our neighbor jurisdictions, um, that are similar to us in Northern California. So really, I just want to say to all of you, this Council and the Chico staff, can't imagine how many questions, emails, um, angry, irate people, uh, enthusiastic business people that we've had to deal with over the last two years. Thank you. And I think that we've been working on this, and I'm, uh, very proud of our community, of how we've crafted this, and I just really want to say thank you for bringing it to a vote tonight. Thank you. Thank you for your input and engagement, Ms. Kesey. Nicole Nava, followed by Curtis Bartle and Dana Wyman. . .! Oh, no mic. Oh, okay, there we go. Um, so, the way I feel about this topic is that, um, you're going to need this, which is Proposition 20 and vote yes, because where you have drugs and where you have a cash business, you have crime. And you are making it difficult for our Chico Police Department already to do their jobs. And this is going to add more layers to that. Ms. Brown, you have worked for this harder than the drug pushers in the tenderloin of San Francisco, and I'm ashamed. I'm ashamed of what is happening in this city. Um, you spoke for a whole bunch of college students who have their brains still forming. Um, those are the very people that will be impacted by marijuana. Um, by using that, they could be triggering some psychosis. Because there are studies that are evidence-based that support that. Um, you are bringing potential more blight to this city that already has more blight under your Brown New Deal than it can cope with. I get you think that this is timely because you started work on it way back when. And this community is in major trauma. Trauma after trauma. And so here we go, and we're supposed to be happy per the person who helped you craft all this. That it is good. It is great. It doesn't feel great to your community. It feels great to a lot of people who aren't necessarily medicinal pot smokers. Um, I have no issue with people who need it for medical needs, for cancer, seizures, grave pain because of accidents, things like that. But we all know that this is so much more than that. I, this is a runaway train. It is happening. Um, you know. So basically, um, the community was run over. You stacked the deck with who you had. You, you had it be what you wanted and you're going to get it. Um, bully for you. Um, but we will be riding this, um, to see what comes of this. And I hope it's everything you paint it to be. I hope it is. I hope it's pot utopia with, uh, minimal signage and no crime associated with a cash business. But you're operating against federal law. And you knew that. And you had people come. Uh, in, uh, legislative capacities to inform you of that. And be damned. You're just going to do what you do. You can't even enforce the sign that is on the door of this council chambers that talks about you shouldn't have alcohol in public. No, no drugs. No this. No that. I'm just at a loss. I, I don't understand how you can cripple a police department by freezing positions and then fully expect that you can keep throwing more and more and more at these people trying to do their jobs. And the city too. Uh, you know. I, I'm just, I'm offended. And I don't recognize my Chico anymore. Please sign this because it would be great. I think we're going to need it. Thank you. Curtis Bartle followed by Dana Wyman and Jeff Creed. All right. Can you guys hear me? Okay. Good evening. My name is Curtis Bartle. Uh, first I'd like to congratulate you guys. Um, for all the hard work you've done. I think it's a lot of hard work that you guys have done up to this point. It definitely sounds like, um, from all the conversations I've heard that have occurred in this chamber that certainly all of the council members and staff have worked very hard to provide the best product that they could possibly throw together for the city of Chico. So it's great that you guys have finally arrived here. Um, as I said, my name is Curtis. A little bit about my background is I'm a veteran. I certainly know that for 14 years. Um, I spent the majority of my time, uh, giving care and my product. And as the utilization moved through California, um, I became more and more supportive of it as I saw starting to draw correlations between the, uh, prohibition ending with alcohol and similar things happening with cannabis. And in my time working in counter narcotics and fighting narco terrorism, I noticed a significant decrease in cultivation, illegal cultivation that impacted our public lands. Um, which is one of the things that you guys all know is that. We have one of the most, we have an abundance here in California is our natural resources. And so moving towards legalization, I think is the right and correct thing to do. Um, not just from a public safety standpoint, but from an environmental standpoint. Um, I myself am a cannabis business owner myself. I own a retail storefront in Lassen County, which is in Susanville, California. Um, and we do deliveries and storefront operations. So a couple of reasons of why I believe that. Um, legalization of cannabis is beneficial is because it does provide a safer avenue for people that want to use cannabis, um, to pursue. Uh, cannabis use already exists throughout California and definitely exists in Chico. Um, and so the target of legalization of cannabis is to provide people who have a desire to use cannabis, a place where they can go to acquire knowledge, education, experience. And access to safe, tested products. So we're removing the power from the individuals on the streets. And what we're doing is we're providing people who want to use cannabis even for something as simple as joint pain. With a knowledgeable staff member like I provide at my store who can target what they would like cannabis to do for them and find an avenue to get them there. Whereas if they're seeking this approach on the street. They might not be able to find cannabis. They might not be able to find exactly the product that they're looking for to treat whatever condition they happen to be working with. Whether that's pain management, sleep management, recreation, etc. Overall legalization pushes us towards providing safety for the consumer. That's what rules and regulations and laws are supposed to do. And that now that cannabis is a legal industry. It's incumbent upon us to handle it like professionals. And make ourselves transparent, um, approachable. And, you know, fundamentally safe for the consumer. And professional. Thank you very much. Thank you guys. Dana Wyman followed by Jeff Creed and Tyler Swope. Hello members of the City Council. Smiling under this mask. I try to recognize each other's smiles these days. But I came with a thank you letter that I prepared for you. Um, before I read it I did want to address something I heard another gentleman comment about. I thought about making sure the ordinance was made clear to the public. Before reading this I read the ordinance because it is available to the public on the website. So if you want to take the time to read it. It seems like a lot of time wasted on something we all have access to already. Here we go. Thank you as a citizen. Thank you for upholding the will of the voter majority in 2016. And finally providing safe regulated access. As a son, thank you for giving my mother the ability to obtain regulated medicine for her multiple sclerosis. Without difficult and uncomfortable travel to other far away towns. As a Chico State graduate, thank you for continuing the progress we've been fighting for in this state for decades. As a father, thank you for giving my offspring a chance to grow up in a town where after turning 21. They have a safer alternative to the overwhelming majority of alcoholic options for adult recreational use. As a husband, thank you for enabling my wife who has struggled with anxiety and had to use Zoloft for years. To now have a safe option in our town. For CBD products and other natural alternatives previously unregulated. And finally as a member of the Chico Cannabis Advisory Committee. Thank you for considering the varied points of view from the community. For allowing Dr. Miller's concerns to be voiced and considering them. And for approving of a compromise. Or arriving, I'm sorry, at a compromise that wasn't the single goal of any one of the members of the committee. But rather a workable solution to the group as a whole. Thank you guys very much. Thank you very much for your work on this. Thank you. Jeff Creed followed by Tyler Swope and Charles Burton. Well here we go again. So last meeting I talked about, I don't know, half a dozen things you could do to, or could have done to make Chico safer, cleaner. More family friendly. More business friendly. And here we are with something else that you're going to do to basically opposite all of those. You're going to make downtown Chico less family friendly. I don't know if that's possible actually. But when you look at other cities where they put cannabis dispensaries downtown. The culture of the city doesn't change. Yeah crime may go up, may go down. That's not a fight to have. Dispensaries change the culture. The culture of the downtown. So all those downtown businesses that are silent. They need to realize or just go to Vegas and go to Fremont Street. And see if your customers currently enjoy that environment. Because when you go to that environment where they're smoking on the street. Which Chico fully doesn't enforce now. And won't in the future. That changes the people who come downtown. Those people are your customers. So how many people over 40 bring their children downtown now. If that's 1% of the Chico residents. There will probably be a thousand. So when I say defund downtown because they're silent. I mean defund downtown because they're silent. That's not my neighborhood. That's their neighborhood. Those businesses downtown that's their neighborhood. That's their problem. That's their business. If they want to add this that's fine. But they don't need me shopping there. I don't need to be sitting there at dinner. And have somebody. Pull a puff in my face. I don't need to have somebody puff in my face as I walk to my car. I don't have any problem with cannabis. Do the deliveries. Deliveries are a proven model. Despite what some of these other people say. The deliveries can offer actually a wider variety. And a better quality stream. The deliveries are cashless. So you track and capture all the sales tax. They're safer. Because there's no cash. The cars all have cameras, GPS. Anybody that goes near them is recorded. You know in HD. And it's very safe, discreet, quiet business. So do the deliveries. The dispensaries. You go forward with this. And you have a downtown business. I'm sorry for you. You know I just don't see the point. Chico is a small isolated community. And you shouldn't be making any decisions that you can't point to 20 other cities in California. Who've done it successfully. For an extended period of time. Successfully. For an extended period of time. There's 400 other cities. Chico should never lead the way on anything. Have a good day. Mr. Crete. Mr. Crete. Thank you for your comments. I just wanted to let you know that the ordinance as written by recommendation of the DCBA excludes businesses from being able to operate in the downtown area. Yeah. Thank you. Tyler Swope. Followed by John. Charles Burton. And Laurie Roeb. Hey Chico City Council members. If you can't tell I'm for the legalization of marijuana. And here in Chico for recreational use. It's obvious what's going on. Glen. Tahina. Butte. It's not allowed here. So where do the illegal operations set up? They set up here. That is why there are so many operations flowing up. Cannabis grows. You guys got to realize that. Now if we don't pass this they're going to keep setting shop up here. It's the perfect place for them. Why not? I mean it's illegal here. So there are people buying illegally. So let's get it done. It needs to be done already. But it needs to be done in a smart way. We're paying too much money to stop it right now. And if we allow it and allow it done the right way. We're actually going to be saving money and making money. So legal business equals tax revenue. But you got to maximize your tax revenue you guys. So you got to open it up for competitive. And you got to allow it for the city of Chico. Not outsiders with a lot of money to come in. And swoop up all the business. And take it from the people of Chico. Let the citizens of Chico have the license please. If you do this make sure it is allowed for the people of Chico. Not outsiders to come in. And there's all this argument about you know cash business. Well there are solutions for that. I am a cryptocurrency YouTuber. Bitcoin. Have you ever heard of that? Let's think of a stable coin. Chico coin. So all of the transactions are on the blockchain and verifiable. No money laundering. Nothing like that. Please think this through. And do it the right way. And subscribe to Chico Crypto on YouTube. Thank you. Charles Burton followed by Lori Roeb and Tara Karma. Good evening everyone. I'm not going to take too much of your time. I am simply here to say thank you. It has been a long time coming. I'm so happy to be almost past the finish round. I cannot wait to hear your guys' votes at the end of this evening. I have a lot of friends and family who are excited to see this. And I know you do have the overwhelming support of the community and all of Chico. We put together a small list of some business owners and some people that just didn't make it here tonight. That are also on the like-minded nights with us too. Maybe you guys want to take a chance to look at this at some point. But thank everybody for doing what you guys did. It was very important. And this is a big night for us. I want to applaud you guys all for taking the time. And energy that you guys put into this. Thank you. Can I leave this here? Thank you. Lori Roeb and then our last speaker is Tara Karma. Good evening Council. Thank you for hearing us talk tonight. And allowing us to give you our opinions of how this has been going. What we think about it being here. Number one, there has been a lot of work done by committees, community members. To put this ordinance together. And ready to be implemented in Chico. We had all summer last year in the meetings, sweating our butts off. Going through it time and time and time and time again. This isn't something that's been rushed. This isn't something that most of the town disagrees with. There's always going to be the few that come up here. Tell you the same thing. We're either rushing it. It's wrong. We shouldn't do it. You're just getting the votes. It's not the town that actually wants it. But that's wrong. Most of the town does want. We voted several times. We agree with it. I'm for passing this ordinance. The city wants it. That's asked for it. Chico's ready and waiting. Please pass this ordinance. I'm not part of a stacked card deck. I vote yes. Just like most of the people. I'm not part of a bunch of people in town. Please go ahead with this. Validate all the work that all of us have been doing. Thank you. Thank you. And our last speaker is Tara Karma. Hello. Do I just begin? Hello. My name is Tara Karma. And I'm so glad. Please wear your mask. Okay. You won't be able to hear me very clearly. We can hear you. We can hear you. They were saying that the people at home couldn't hear us. We can hear you better now. The location. It's better now. Okay. I want to thank you for finally letting the patients have local availability to medical cannabis. But I want to thank you for the fact that Butte County is so ready to buy locally. Thank you on behalf of the concerned citizens of Butte County. And search inside your heart and realize that you have made the right decision for our community. Thank you, City Council, for realizing how much that we need this medical marijuana. I just wanted to thank you and let you know that I don't want you to get off on any other tangents. I just want you to get the stores open. You need them open. That's all I have to say. Thank you guys so much for coming this far. Thank you. Thank you. So with that, we will close the public hearing. Okay. Mayor Schwartz. Yes. There were a couple of issues that were raised by speakers that I believe need to be addressed. Okay. The first was on the in regard to taxation and revenue, this ordinance does not do anything in relation to imposing a different or additional tax that will be addressed through sales tax and the excise tax as I believe they're called through the state. The state already has a taxing mechanism to address the different types of cannabis products. The other issue was in regard to the statement regarding this being allowed in downtown provided as exhibit or attachment D to your staff report from March 17th. There are a series of maps. These maps, there's a clarification I need to make about these maps. These maps show a buffer zones on here around established land uses for schools and daycare centers and so forth. D1 in your attachment is the list of known schools and I believe that was prepared at the time of February 12th, 2020. And so that shows known schools at that time. The buffer zones are shown on these maps as thousand foot barriers and as a result of that, there's a list of known schools that are not allowed in the state. So as indicated, some of those would be reduced. The thing about those buffer zones and those sensitive uses, school districts may add a school, they may remove a school, private school might come in. So this is really for reference only. It's not an indication of where uses are definitively allowed and disallowed. It should be used for your purposes and not for the purpose of the public's purposes of not where they could go in. What is controlling is the text of the ordinance. So the maps are just an aid to show generally where they are and it is accurate as of February 12th, 2020 to the best of our knowledge. But again, what's controlling is the text. And it's in that text that we need to turn to show that this is not in the downtown. And where it would be allowed, and it being specifically retail storefront, would be allowed in four zones. The CC zone, the CS zone, the CR zone, and what's called the TND, the portion of the TND called the core portion of that. All four of those zones, retail storefront would be allowed only after receiving a use permit as well as going through the process under 5.42 of getting a cannabis storefront. And that's the first commercial business license. If you have any additional questions of what constitutes the downtown for what staff calls it, Mr. Veague is in the room and can speak to those types of issues. As to the other uses, those are also articulated in the ordinance itself. And what is controlling are the tables indicated at page C28 and C29. Those tables articulate which zones different types of uses would be allowed in. And one of those 18 items that I talked about that need to be included in or were recommended to be included in a motion was the amendment to table 4.6 as it's presented here on page C28 to include cannabis manufacturing as a permitted use. And that would be in the CS zone. I believe that concludes the clarifications that, oh, there was one other, going back to the taxation .1. I think I'm going to go back to the taxation and revenue. There is not an articulation here in either staff report that there would be a windfall. In fact, it states that it would be through the general modest positive fiscal impact due to increased sales tax revenue. So that's all that's being articulated on that. Thank you. May I? Yes. Thank you. Thank you for the thorough report and documents. And I think it's probably no surprise I'm not exactly excited it's taken this long since the moment we started having this conversation. But I think the bright side to that and the thing that I'm sure of as a result of the amount of time that we've spent on this subject and on this package is that we've done our due diligence. We've crossed our T's. We've dotted our I's. We've taken public input. We've made compromises. I've been challenged through this process and I'm glad to have been because what we have in front of us is a sensible policy package that is very well done. So I just want to thank staff for your efforts on that and this council for contributing to that conversation. So with that, I'd actually like to move approval of the staff recommendations 2, 3, and 4. With those items, staff is recommended to be amended as stated on page 7 of the staff report. Okay. And as stated tonight. I believe that I have to read the title of the ordinance for each of those. So item 2, an ordinance of the City Council of the City of Chico amending Title 5, creating Chapter 5.42, Commercial Cannabis Businesses of the Chico Municipal Code to Regulate Commercial Cannabis Uses within the City of Chico. And 4, an ordinance of the City Council of the City of Chico amending Title 19 of the Chico Municipal Code, Chapters 19, 19, and 20. And 4, an ordinance of the City Council of the City of Chico to create VND for VND VND and abuse that this community can sometimes shell out and for your steadfast resolve to get this done and compromised. Congratulations to you, thank you. Can I just ask a clarifying point? Did you also include adopting the resolution? Yeah, item three. Okay. Item two, three and four. Okay, all right, very good. I wanted to clarify that. Mr. Morgan. Thank you, let me start by saying, I am relieved because I can finally stop carrying these papers around and repeating myself. The ordinance should be well done. Its foundations were written by the marijuana industry. So that I will give you. And for the last time, I'll just repeat these things. We keep talking about evidence-based decision-making and all those. We have a letter from the former police chief, November 25th, 2019, that disputes some of what's been talked about and he thought it was important to communicate his perspective on issues related to public safety and at this point in the process this is again November 2019, he had not been asked for the public safety perspective, which is troubling but it is what it is. He goes on to talk about from its vantage point the chief that actually legal cannabis activity opens the door to more black market commercial cannabis. I'm not going to debate any of these, just pointing out some the things that the police chief said. He goes on to talk about that the chief of police, the district attorney, and the sheriff of this area are all opposed to it based on safety reasons, but if that wasn't enough, and this is actually kind of out of date now, lessons learned after years of marijuana legalization, and I do not pretend to be an expert. I'm not taking an opinion in any way, shape, or form. I am just quoting the researchers from the somewhat notable universities of John Hopkins, Harvard Medical School, and Boston's Children's Hospital based on actual data from Colorado and Washington after they legalized marijuana. Number one, marijuana use in public increases illegal or not. Maybe that's a good thing or a bad thing. I'm just saying what they said. Rising rates of marijuana use by minors. After costs of increase in police enforcement are subtracted, revenue from pot tax is limited. Homelessness in Colorado has gone up post-legalization. One in three shelter residents in Denver said they were in Denver because of legal pot. They went on to say the downsides completely outweigh the upsides, and it's not very close. That's probably enough. There's a bunch of stuff here. I've read it before. I just am voicing my opinion for the same reasons I have before, my opposition, not to marijuana specifically, but to the commercial side, specifically the retail stores. It can be delivered. I don't argue with the people that say they have benefits from it. I wouldn't know. They know better than I do. You can get it now if you need it. I don't see why this is better for Chico, and that's why I'll be voting no. But I am relieved that I don't have to do it again. I had a couple of procedural questions. I don't know if we're just automatically going with what's proposed. I don't know if we're just automatically going with what's proposed. I don't know if we're just automatically going with what's proposed. I don't know if we're just automatically going here, but is there a reason there's, or can somebody explain to me what the reason is that we're doing different feet away from schools for varying the school, the type of school? I can explain. Yeah, so during the conversations of the Cannabis Citizens Advisory Committee meetings, we were discussing buffers from schools. It was recommended by Andy Miller, who was the public health doctor at that time. And by a representative of the Chico Police Department that from high schools and middle schools, the buffer be 1,000 feet rather than 600 feet, which is the state-required buffer from all schools. And so that was included per recommendation of public health and the Chico Police Department. Gotcha. I personally would be more comfortable if it was just 1,000 feet all the way across the board, but that's just my personal recommendation. Because I believe that there's part of this is a public safety risk. If there's an incident that happens, to me it doesn't seem like it would matter if it's an elementary school or a high school. There's still a risk to, you know, children. My other question is tax revenue. If there is any, will it be used to, what are we going to do for public safety? One of our officers went down, I believe it was Mr. Aldrich, went down to a convention where, the cops talked about, you know, issues that they've had. One of the issues is black market shops popping up. I'm not worried about the people that are going to come in, they're going to apply, they're going to pay their taxes and all that, but the black ones, there's an estimate that can cost anywhere from $40,000 to $50,000 to get any of these black market ones shut down. So have we thought about where that funds are going to come from and can we set some of this money to a side that we're, ensure that we're only having our four people that work really hard and pay a lot of fees and go through a lot of permitting process, like we want them to be taken care of, in my opinion. And then the application process, what is this going to look like? I don't know, maybe Mr. Veig or I'm not sure who's actually doing the permitting process, but we're doing COVID-19. We've got, we're trying to do a wraparound services for homeless solutions. I mean, I don't know what it works, looks like from a work standpoint. That would be another. And just to clarify, this is still illegal to consume in public. We have, having this ordinance does not allow public use. I'm just addressing something the speaker said, so we are not doing that. Other than that, I just, maybe Mr. Veig could answer or Mr. Orme, just how we're going to. Sure, Council Member Reynolds, that's obviously a concern that staff always has is juggling priorities, right? And so I think Mr. Veig can speak better that, but I always keep track of the items that are before us. And I think you made note of a couple of them, but Brendan, how will that be juggled? Sure. And maybe Andrew can help as well. So there's a permit process for the city. It doesn't start off in planning. It starts off as a city permit process. And so we have been working with a consultant HDL who has a lot of experience doing just this type of permitting activity. I believe they will be working with us to come up with the forms and the format. The initial part of the engagement with the city, again, is not planning per se. It would start city manager's office finance, but again, it's the city. And there's the competitive, which are the dispensaries, and then there's the noncompetitive process for all the other uses. And there will be a fee set, predetermined. And my sense at this point is that for the noncompetitive, it's pretty clear, it's pretty simple. There will be a set fee. However, my understanding, again, in preliminary conversations we've had with Andrew and Mr. Constantine and Wells HDL is that for the competitive one, there may be a deposit, a real-time account that someone would work off of to ensure that we don't, you know, it's cost neutral, that we don't have any losses in this process. And so, again, the initial process, again, is providing all the information that the ordinances requires. Right. So, we're going to be using the security plans, other things like that, that will then be vetted and viewed by all the different departments. And then that will then allow people to go to the next step, which is meeting planning's requirements and either getting a zoning verification and or going through the use permit process. So, to repeat, they would put down some sort of a deposit that would cover staff time because we can't really assign a fee of, oh, this is going to be a $10,000 fee because we have no idea what the staff time is. But anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway state law or federal law on this. It simply is a local ordinance to deal with permitting of what's already allowed under state law to regulate where different types of businesses are going to go. Currently, the where is nowhere in Chico. None of these businesses can operate in Chico, and if they are, they're doing illegally. If they were brought to our attention and the council directed us to do so, we would shut them down through injunctive process. I've personally been involved in at least 20 of those prior to 2016. The firm I was previously working with, we dealt with over 50 of those, shutting them down. You're correct, that is not a, at the time, from 2006 to 2016, when I was doing that type of work, it was not a cheap process. It was not a cheap process. In large part because courts were reluctant to close places down. Since that time, since the permitting has been regulated by the California Bureau of Cannabis Control, that is getting, that is changing. And in fact, the state is taking action, much like the state would take action against ABC licensees. And so much of the regulation is at the state level is predicated on that type of enforcement. As I am, I've been actually quite surprised in Chico that there haven't been more, to my attention, no dispensaries that would require taking action. In other cities I work for, they would pop up and you would attack one and another one would pop up. And it might have to do something with the courts, it might have to do something with the courts. It might have to do something with enforcement up here or other aspects or just the size of the population. And lastly, as to the real time billing and the, we have not put together the final version of the costs of the permitting in part because we don't know exactly what the council would be, would be a approval. And so it's at a form where we could bring that back. I don't know that we could bring it back next week or the week after when, or the next council meeting when this would be coming back. But it would then, as Mr. Biggs said, much of that would be on the real time billing process and also worked into their proposed to be cost recovery for all of the development of this ordinance. And so that is worked in so it truly is trying to get to cost neutral so the city is not paying from the general fund for the creation of the ordinance and for the adoption or permitting process for each individual business. Ms. Jorm? I never want to miss out on the opportunity because one of the things that I think that Council Member Reynolds, you're asking and I think it's a valid thing as I'm sitting here thinking through it and staff is always going to say we're going to get it done. You know, whatever the council's priorities are, we're going to do our best to get it done and we will. One of the things that is consistently going to be in my mind as the city manager, knowing the burden that my staff currently carries, is that there will be things that will have to be pushed aside a little bit in order to make things more of a priority. And that's just the reality of the resources that we have and resources that we have. And they have to adjust to the current resource constraints. And so I know they won't speak to that necessarily specifically, but obviously I will. And that is what they'll have to do is they'll have to juggle the balancing act. You know, we've got, I think you mentioned a couple of them, COVID-19 and a lot of the modifications that we're working with businesses with to get them going. We're working with the Climate Action Commission. It's a new commission. I know that Brendan is doing a fantastic job working with them. I mean, the list goes on and on and I don't want to burden you with a long oratory of that. But the bottom line is if this is item that needs to be gotten done we're going to make it get done and but there are impacts and that's true in any department wherever wherever there's priorities whether it's PD fire whatever it is that we're focused on we'll shift priorities and we'll make it happen so I just want to I want to actually answer that question to the to the best of my ability so I don't want to neglect the fact that this team is running hard and running fast and they'll continue to do it but there is give and take so whatever that's worth thank you mr. Huber thank you yeah so like councilmember Morgan I too am happy to be explaining my position on this for the last time in January of 2018 I created my campaign website on my positions page I clearly identified that I was in favor of creating a set of regulations that would allow for the commercial sale of medical and adult use cannabis like likewise vice mayor Brown was quite clear in her support of regulated cannabis sales the voter spoke in November 2018 and vice mayor Brown and myself were elected with full transparency on our positions it was clear to me the people who elected me to office supported the view that regulated cannabis sales is a far superior system to what's been happening since Chico became a town unregulated unsafe and untaxed use I publicly numerous times that I'm not personally a fan of cannabis that my support of regulating its sale is not about my personal choice but it's about my understanding and interpretation of what's best for health and safety while there are no lack of conflicting statistics I subscribe to the scientific research showing that regulating commercial cannabis sales leads to better enforcers of cannabis laws, reduces cannabis use in teens, reduces alcohol abuse and resultant traffic fatalities, disincentivizes the polluting of our public land for gardens, provides needed tax revenue, and reduces gang violence and crime. Over the past year, I've taken every opportunity to assure public input, insisting that a citizen advisory group was formed for input, voting for a community member or members who openly opposed cannabis to be a part of that panel, and requesting that additional limitations be added to how cannabis products can be marketed. I'm very proud of the amount of discourse and the level of transparency that we employed in this process, and I appreciate the incredible effort that Vice Mayor Brown put into making this ordinance as good as it can be. In the end, I have three obligations. To the community, to do what I believe is in the best interest of this town, to the people who voted for me, to honor their support of my well-publicized positions, and to myself, to do what I believe is right. I'm going to support this ordinance. Mr. Ori, do you have any comments? No, not at this time. Thank you. I want to make a couple of comments myself. Perhaps the most compelling, I have two really compelling reasons why I'm going to support this motion. First, 2016, 66% of Chico residents approved Proposition 64. This is something that our community wants. Maybe I'll, I've got three items. We've got, we're proposing four retail locations. One for every 25,000 people. That's a lot of people that live here. It's not going to be a dispensary on every corner. I think that that is reasonable. But the most compelling is kind of a more personal story for me. I have had a neighbor who was older, had dementia and had been using morphine. And he and his wife were, his wife was very concerned about that. and talked to the doctor and the doctor suggested using cannabis instead of the morphine. He was able to eliminate the use of the morphine. But where did he get that product? He and his wife would have had to go to the black market. They would have had to go to Sacramento. They would have driven out of town when they weren't able to drive out of town. I think about the disabled veteran. Same situation. They're homebound. They use the cannabis for medication. And this is going to allow them safe, regulated access with safe, tested products that they can get locally. They're not going to put themselves in danger by going into the black market to purchase it. They're not going to have to drive far away to get it. They're going to be able to use it. I think this ordinance makes sense and it will be a benefit to our community members. Are there any other comments? We'll call for the vote. Ms. Schwab? Yes. I just wanted to clarify, ask for clarification on the motion that it included. The amendments as recommended, as indicated on page 7 of tonight's staff report, to include items 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 as discussed therein. That is correct. And then also to include item 19 as I described as including the word additional into the title of section 542.315. That is correct. And then adding as item 20, such prohibition language as it is also articulated in those items 16 and 17. And adding that language to the end of 542.300. That's correct. And I concur. Okay. Very good. Thank you. Congratulations on a great ordinance. Green butt for it. I have one more quick question. Not that it changes anything. So we'll be getting back. The recommendation as to the application process fees and who can apply. Because I do think it's important that we put in their recommendations about letting it be local people and things like that. So that will be coming back. So some of those issues are already discussed in the 5R42s. Okay. And then as to the fees, that will be coming back as a separate resolution. Okay. Thank you. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. applications would be available for businesses to apply. If that answer is not available right now, can we have that answer at the second reading meeting? I don't have a definitive date, but the steps from here on forward would be, as you pass this tonight, the first reading. The second reading needs to happen. That will be brought back at the September 15th council meeting. We need to post a summary of this. Then 30 days thereafter, the ordinances become effective. It would then be some period of time after that when applications would be made available. There's typically a month or longer period in which applications are put out there before any are accepted back in. Then there's a review process, and that starts the multi- round process of review and analysis and so forth. We'll be looking sometime after the first of the year, practically. We will move to the regular agenda. Item 5.1, consideration of legal services agreement. Report from Jamie Cannon, Director of Human Resources and Risk Management. I'll give you a moment to come from the other room. There you are. One moment. Time for my . Thank you. My apologies. Good evening, Mayor, Vice Mayor. In front of you is the council's request to have the city attorney's office sign a legal services agreement brought forward. So what you have in front of you is the document in its entirety. I'm happy to answer any questions. I have a city manager, Orm, or myself. Does the council have any questions? Do we have any comments on this? No comments, but we have one speaker, Jeff Creed. Okay. So Mr. Creed? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Good morning, everybody. Good morning, everybody. Good morning, everybody. Good morning, everybody. Good morning, everybody. Good morning, everybody. Good morning, everybody. Good morning, everybody Good morning, everybody Good morning, everybody Good morning, everybody Good morning, everybody Good morning, everybody Good morning, everybody Good morning, everybody Good morning, everybody Good morning, everybody Good morning, everybody Good morning, everybody Good morning, everybody Good morning, everybody Good morning, everybody Good morning, everybody Good morning, everybody meetings online, I don't see the attorney just popping off and responding to, say, citizens' comments. So when the needle ban was up for discussion in the past, he said there was no way, no way, no how. We saw the lawsuit go forward, lawsuit won, lawsuit, you know, somebody from the state, I'm not a Rob Berry, somebody from the state said, yeah, the city needs to pass a ban in order for it to stick. But I thought the city attorney said we can't. So I have to ask, why this city attorney? It seems interesting to me. He seems to be trying very hard to interject his opinions in a very biased manner. So, you know, you go ahead and do what you want. You know, you always will. And you always will. You always do. So, you know, but, you know, just know that people are out there paying attention to not only what happens here, but I don't live in the bubble of Chico like many people. You know, I pay attention to what happens in other cities. I go look at other cities, see what they're doing correct, so maybe that idea can come back to Chico. But unfortunately, those ideas of what works in other cities aren't welcome in Chico, especially not here in this chamber. That's why, you know, I can stand here. And accurately say this chamber has, you know, brought Chico down. It's systematically driven crime up in Chico. And it's from things like this. Why do we have a city attorney pushing his opinion, pushing his agenda? And, you know, just a question. Have a good day. Mr. Freed. Just a quick question. Did you really say you watch other city council meetings? Yeah, you know, I tend not to ask questions unless I know the answer. Like the person that said what takes two years. You know what else takes over two years besides this thing? Hiring an officer. In Chico, by the time you go from budget to officer on the street, it's well over two years. Thank you. May I ask one question? Thank you. Okay. So council is being asked to approve. The agreement and authorize the city manager to execute the agreement. Move to approve. We have a motion by council member Stone and second by council member Huber. Mr. Ori, did you have any comments or questions? Mr. Ori? No comment. Thank you. Okay. Very good. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Council member Huber? Yes. Council member Morgan? No. Council member Ori? Aye. Council member Reynolds? Aye. Council member Stone? Aye. Vice mayor Brown? Aye. Mayor Schwab? Aye. Carry six one. Okay, let's take a five minute break. We're going to be hearing item 5.3 and then if necessary come back to 5.2. Thank you. Council member Orry's request Discussion regarding the council's policy directive on encampments. Mr. Orry? Thank you. Can you hear me okay? Yes . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . to focus the discussion. It's my intent to ask the council to retract the motion that we passed April 7th that's referred to in the city manager's memo as an emergency direction. I know there may be a lot of other actions that the council may or may not want to take, but I would hope that this specific proposal will be fairly clean, that we start fresh. I think it was necessary. I was one of the four that voted for it, and that it has served this law for four months. But as an emergency directive, I believe at this point in time, to... see with a new chief of police and with the particular excellence of the city manager, that staff will take the primary role of creating encampment policy, dealing with everything from weather and the lack of shelter beds to... carrying forward the policy of the council from here without this directive. I would imagine that much of what we're doing today will not change overnight, but that as we go forward, as we create more shelter beds, and as we get out of 100-degree weather every three or four days, that we will be... we will see an incremental and phased-in process of finding habitat for those without homes that would also take place in waterways in our city. That will be my... That's the initial discussion I'd like, is to retract that April 7th, 2020. And I really don't see a need at this point... Personally, I mean, this is part of the conversation, I think, to... We need a breather here to allow staff to come back and further discuss with us steps that they would see necessary. So, Mr. Ury, could I have you concisely repeat what your proposal is? Yes. Just so that everyone understands, I think people are saying, okay, okay, but I'd like to hear you say it just one more time. Well, I don't think at this point you can allow me a motion if you haven't gone through the preliminary feedback, but my motion would be to retract the motion of April 7th. That is listed on page two. I can read it. It was a motion made by Vice Mayor Brown and seconded by Council Member Gubin to provide direction to city managers to eliminate evictions from homeless encampments and to require an outreach and recreational approach to their homeless communities, driving them in force to deserve public health, encouraging distancing and keeping encampments clean, and barring the necessity, eliminating criminal activity in these parks, streamways, in these park streamways and waterways. Is it noted that encampments are defined as okay for temporary accommodations for city and country folks? So, in effect, you are saying that you'd like to return the discretion of the operation to the city manager, and receive the permission to do so. But the motion is rejected because the city manager rejected the motion that was prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared but yes, in essence that's what I'm asking. Okay. Okay. So questions or comments by council? I think it's a fantastic idea because I was on the opposing side of that initial vote. I do want to say that I think initially when that action was taken, council did not realize how long COVID-19 would be with us or what those implications of this action is. So I applaud you, Council Member Ori, for giving us the opportunity to readdress this directive. Thank you. Well, assuming that, so Anne, I'm responding to your comment. Assuming that you agreed that there was risk there of spreading the virus from vulnerable people who were moving from camp to camp, do you believe that anything has changed about the degree of risk, to those people, in moving around and in their potential to not only spread the virus among themselves, but to spread the virus among others? I'm sorry, was that a question for me or for Anne? That was for Anne. I think by providing the city manager the authority, and thereby the police, the authority, that they are able to manage the situation so much better. The risk is still there, but what I see is, I don't see that it's being managed. And so a second part of my question, and this would be for either Anne or Carl, is, what do you see as the option being if camps are now dispersed, what do you see the option being for where those people go from the dispersed camps? Council Member, I would say that my motion does not disperse camps. It puts the discretion on what we do with camps onto directly on the city manager, and to the staff as our emergency, I forget your title, our emergency director, if it's any. It's simply that. There's still obviously the risk of spreading disease. And this will always have to be handled cautiously with great discretion. I just don't think that our directive is necessary at this point. I think it could be more effective by putting the responsibility, the responsibility, directly on staff. So I guess then, really, my question should be to the city manager, is, you know, what does that look like? We know what the CDC guidelines are, and I don't believe they've changed. Correct me if I'm wrong. What options do we have that are safe based on those guidelines? Yeah, I mean, obviously one of the things that, that is extremely difficult here is, there really isn't an enemy to attack here with regard to COVID. If it's a fire disaster, we can attack that. If it's a criminal, we can attack that. If it's, if it's a, if it's an imminent threat, we have tactics to manage that. In this situation with COVID-19, it makes it extremely difficult to attack the issue. And so with the CDC guideline, which is really the primary item, that the council utilized in order to make this connection between this emergency action and the directive, allowing for non-enforcement of a, of a current ordinance that's in place, allowed for some space for people to go into. Obviously we've seen, there's a lot of advantage being taken of that. And I think it's, I think it was an approach that the council wanted to take to ensure that people were safe from a health perspective. But I think there are some others within those groups that have taken advantage of that. And I think that's, to be able to take advantage of the goodwill that this city has given. One of the things that I've done, and I'm coming around to trying to find an answer to your question because there's no simple answer, is I pulled together the team. I pulled together police, fire, public works, the whole gambit, planning, public works engineering, everybody, every mind that I could get to try to come up with some feasible fix. And we are, we are finishing up that process. And fortunately we're able to utilize the skill sets of one of our local service providers for a time in Miss Amaro as our homeless solutions coordinator. That was a tremendous asset when she was on board. Obviously she's now back conducting business and we have a tremendous asset now in place of that in Susie Calkins as our homeless solutions coordinator. We are finalizing and the hope is that come the 2020, 22nd of September, that's our goal, if the council's available, to have a specific meeting dedicated to helping to manage this, the entirety of this situation. The last thing that staff who want to do is come up with a solution that ends up blowing up in our face. And we could designate a piece of land and go, okay, this is for camping. It doesn't work that easily. You have to have the proper service provision there. You have to have the proper resources in place as it relates to facilities, you just, you have to, it has to be done right. Otherwise, if just open space, as we're witnessing in the parks, some aspects of that are going in the wrong direction. And we just had another example of that tonight with another incident. So one of the things that we are attempting to do, and we've gone through and we've looked at a tremendous number of properties throughout the city, and we continue to evaluate those. So it's our hope that we'll be able to come back with some real solid solutions. So to get to your point, is if this is handed back and the council's like, okay, city manager, here you go, you manage this. There are probably a number of locations that are not viable locations for people to be. For the simple fact that when I talk to my fire chief and he says, there's too much fire danger right here, we can't afford to let people in this location. I'm gonna go tackle those first and foremost, where there's an imminent threat to public safety. And- What's that? We're already assuming that we've tackled that. Yeah. Remove them from a dangerous spot where we're moving. That's the great question that I don't have an answer to yet. And that's why we're working on a holistic solution. So at this point in time, we don't have a perfect location and maybe there is no perfect location, but that's why we need to bring it into the public, allow the council to be able to dialogue in a public forum over this issue, allow the public to give their feedback on it because by doing it currently, if we were to do it somehow out of the public light, no matter what we did, it's gonna fail because there's gonna be some constituency that hasn't been able to give their input into it. There's gonna be a council member or two or three or seven that are gonna say, what is going on here? We haven't had an opportunity to engage with the public on this matter. And what I need to do is be able to have all of the professionals that we've hired at the city to give feedback in on each of these aspects because just because one works for the police department may not necessarily work. And there's gonna have to be something from the council that comes through as it relates to an ordinance modification or some sort of an emergency effort in order to enable a location to facilitate that type of use. Ultimately, and this is what I am hopeful for, we will come back with a solution. There's gonna be costs associated with it, and that's one of the other big issues. There's gonna be costs associated with it. We need to find a permanent solution. Temporary patches haven't worked, and they're not gonna work. All it's gonna create is more anxiety, fear, frustration in the community. So we need to come up with a single location that will facilitate a large area where people can have a cooling center, warming center, sufficient shelter space for our unhoused, et cetera, and you go down the list. But we need good partnerships in order to make that work. And so I have full faith and confidence that Ms. Calkins is putting that plan together, and I know that here this week there was some more pivotal information we were waiting on in order to get that, and then there's a few more weeks before we can actually get legs under it to bring it back. For council consumption, for public consumption, because we don't want to do anything behind closed doors that make people believe that we're doing things that haven't been vetted by the public. That's the last thing we want to do as well. So, yeah. Mr. Arm. I think one of the questions that's in there, forgive me if I'm putting words in your mouth, between now and that meeting, are you going to be arresting people? I mean, what's going to be happening? Our shelters are at capacity. How does that intersect with the state law around enforcing some of these laws? That's the question, I think. Okay, I didn't get, are we going to be arresting people? As far as I know, if they're conducting illegal activity, I'm hopeful we'll arrest them. If they're not conducting illegal activity, that's not our intention. Our intention is to get them shelter. And so it's my understanding that the shelters aren't necessarily full, and so we will help educate. Once again, there's opportunities here for people to find shelter, and so that'll be our objective. And if there is some life safety concern, we'll help. We're going to have to manage that situation. But I don't think the end goal is to arrest people by any means. That's not our end goal. And if there's any belief that that's what staff's intention is, then I apologize if that intention is there. Thank you for shaking your head no. Just a question. Yeah, absolutely. I mean, the tools at our disposal are limited, I think is what you're saying. Absolutely, we are an enforcement agency, and we are not a social services agency. And so it makes it extremely difficult when you're an enforcement agent to do that. And so I think that's what I'm trying to do. I'm trying to bring this agency to a large degree to create social services. And so it's making it very complex for staff to be able to work on this, but we're doing it and we're trying to bring a plan together and that's our goal. I do appreciate that because on March 25th that was the direction that we provided to staff that we wanted long-term solutions to this stuff. So I really am truly glad to see this come to fruition and looking forward to that plan. Thank you. Other questions or comments before we hear the public on this item? I'm sorry. Okay. So how many comments did we receive on the Engage Chico platform? Ten comments on Engage Chico and three in public comment emails. People are with us tonight. We have 11 speakers. Okay. We have 11 speakers. So let's just take a minute to read the comments that have come forward while we queue up the speakers. And each speaker will have three minutes. Okay. And I'll read the names. Comments received on Engage Chico, Shannon Hester, Margaret Hicks, Michelle Rutlinger, Gary Vertel, Angela McLaughlin, Carolyn E. Autumn Brock, Jamie Damon, Nicole Nava, and Andy Wilhite. And our first speaker is going to be Brock Winborn followed by Jessica Giannola and Kim Dietz. Good morning, everyone. Good morning, everyone. Good morning, everyone. Good morning, everyone. Good morning, everyone. Good morning, everyone. Good morning, everyone. Good morning, everyone. Good morning, everyone. Good morning, everyone. Has the council had enough time to review the comments? Mr. Ory, have you had enough time to review the comments? I have, thank you. Okay, very good. Thank you for joining us. All right, Brock Winborn. Good evening, Chico City Council. My name is Brock Winborn. I'm here today because I'm deeply concerned about the decisions made by this council. Before I get into it, I would like to introduce myself to anyone who may be listening. I work as a firefighter paramedic out of town and live in Chico with my wife and daughter. We chose to live in this town because of the beautiful Bidwell Park and the hopes of raising our daughter in a small town environment that is safe. With that being said, my hopes are now beginning to fade and I'm beginning to think it's time to leave Chico due to the decisions made by this city council. Approximately three weeks ago, I had a group of vehicles with multiple people living out of them parking. I parked directly in front of my house at the Valambroza-Madrone intersection. These people would park their car and stay all day and all night. I politely asked them to leave and received a poor response. After calling the non-emergent Chico Police Department line multiple times, I was told there was nothing they could do about it due to the policy passed by this city council to allow people to camp in the park. These people continually showed up every day and night in their vehicles for weeks and eventually illegally parked a run-down motorhome facing the wrong way on a busy Valambroza street directly across the street. I continued to call the police department to voice my concerns. I was continually told there was nothing they could do about it due to this policy. At night, I could see people going in and out of the motorhome at all hours of the night and could hear people making loud and obnoxious noises across the street in the park. It was brought to my attention that this motorhome and many of the other vehicles I had been parking there were seen multiple times every Sunday at the free needle distribution site at Windchime Park. I continually became more and more concerned and tried reasoning, but I was not able to do so. I was told that the police department had been working with these people to go somewhere else. They became irritated with me, began mocking me while I was in my front yard, and things became much worse. After countless phone calls to the Chico City Police Department, multiple emails sent to all of you, including the mayor and vice mayor, stating that I did not feel safe leaving for work with my family at home, I finally got a city employee to come out and talk with them. I went out and explained to the city employee the situation in front of the people who were living in the motorhome. The city employee did not appear to have cited them for being parked illegally, and I was told that they were not allowed to leave the park. Instead, she gave them my card and left. Luckily, the motorhome left the next day and has not been back. This went on for approximately three weeks with them being parked out in front of my house. I don't believe it is fair that my wife and I had to experience this. This should have been handled and dealt with right away, and I shouldn't have had to lose even more sleep at work due to being worried about my family's safety in my own home. I don't believe it is fair for any hardworking, tax-paying person in this community to have to constantly encounter the tents surrounded in garbage in Bidwell Park, be constantly worried about their own safety, and or the safety of their families in the overrun public areas of this city, or to be harassed every time they go downtown for money. Enough is enough. It is time for all of you to take action in camping in the park. It is time for you to end all the enabling that allows drug addicts to take over our city. And lastly, it is time for you to stop wasting taxpayers' money on court sentiments based on your poor decisions. Mr. Windburn? Yes, ma'am. I did want to... I just ask you, when you emailed me, I contacted the city manager, police chief, and code enforcement. And I'm sorry that you had to call the police department so many times prior to that, but I'm glad that we were able to help get those...that vehicle moved and the activity suspended. Thank you, Mayor. Those vehicles were all registered under the same person. They continually came back. I was informed on that. Also, on top of that, you guys have not re...taken this action away of allowing people to camp in the parks. You go to One Mile, you go to any public area, you go across the street right here to the city plaza, and it is just filled with homeless people who are enabled by the needles that they got, and they constantly do heroin and whatever. And guess who shows up? The fire department shows up. And you know what we do? We revive them. We make them better. You give them free meals. You give them the needles to go do the drugs. And they go sit in the waterways. They sit in the park all day long. And that's...they're never going to...they don't have any ambition to do anything different when you enable this to happen. You have to change this. This is ridiculous. Provide a place for them to go that's away from the waterways. Stop littering all the parks. This is ridiculous. You need to change it now. Thank you. Jessica Giannola followed by Kim Dietz and Rob Berry. Hi, Council. I'm trying really hard to come at you guys with a supportive partnership role instead of criticize, criticize. Because this problem with a lack of housing and the hundreds of reasons of why we have homeless people, it's not going away anytime soon. In fact, it's going to get worse as this pandemic has been going on. And as this outfall goes forward. So, Mark, you were...you said exactly what I said recently in social media and what we need. We need to have a permanent site. We do. We can't move people from park to park to park. Or throw our hands up and say we're not part of social services. We're enforcement. We're a city. And we do...we have to change with times. And times right now is we have a lot of homeless people that are living in our parks and on the street. Right? We can move them from one. They're not going away. The only way we can help them go away is by supporting them and getting them back into society. Giving us those tax dollars. Supporting them. That takes a site. We do know we need a site anyway for cooling. We need it for heating. We need it for the smoke. Pandemic. It doesn't matter what it is. We need a site. So, identifying a site here in Tugo is the best option. It's the most cost effective. It's showing compassion for people and understanding. We're resolving a lot of complaints from our residents. They are upset that they have loud people or people who are scaring them or they're feeling unsafe. That's normal. And to help resolve that is to help get people into a place where they're feeling more normal. Then their behavior can help stabilize as they have a future moving forward. They're not just left out on the street on their own. So, by finding those resolutions, whether we're partnering with the county, we're partnering with the state, if we're getting grants because there might be some more because of COVID, whatever we need to do to help fund this, this is the direction that we do need to head in so that we're getting our community healthier, less volatile, less angry at each other, and we can work on other projects. Improving our parks, whatever it might be. But the homeless situation and the lack of affordable housing is a huge one for us. And we really need to focus on finding that permanent site. So that when we're done, we can get it done. We're not bouncing around and work together. Thank you. Kim Deeds followed by Rob Berry and then Jeff Glatz. Hello. Ready? Okay. Hi. My name is Kim Deeds and I am a long-term resident of Chico since 1982. A graduate of Chico State University and owner of 11 single-family home rentals in the city of Chico. My personal home is located on Ballen Grosje Avenue near Madrone. Brock is my neighbor. We just met tonight. I work full-time for my home for a global company. And over the course of my professional career, I've served on boards for the state of California, United States Department of Agriculture, and today I'm president of a board of directors for a national trade association. For the past year, I have watched every city council meeting because of the issues facing our community. My concern tonight is about the council policy directive on encampments. Frankly, what I have witnessed of majority votes by this council on this issue are embarrassing and not in the best interest of the citizens of Chico. The city of Chico, the community, the city manager, the police chief, all of them are members of the community. All before this directive was passed, pleaded with you that the mismanagement of encampments would result in short and long-term community health, safety, and environmental impacts. I personally wrote to the city council on August 8th as a very frustrated citizen of this community due to the camping situation in Bidwell Park. I was fearful to get my own mail or walk in my own front yard because of this issue. We have created a free-for-all, and it is my opinion that the allowance of tent camping in the park has resulted in non-Chico residents coming to live in our parks just for that free-for-all, taking advantage of our beautiful community. So after four months of personally witnessing encampments and parks, I stand before you for the first time in my 38 years as a Chico resident, and ask each of you, my city council, to stand up for me. I am very grateful to the city council members to end the encampments in Bidwell Park, our city parks, and our waterways. Do not pick and choose which parks or waterways should be done now and which ones later. They are all at risk. Our community is at risk. Our citizens are at risk. Please take action to rescind all encampment actions passed by the A votes of Brown, Huber, Ory, and Stone on April 7th and April 21st. As a homeowner, citizen, and neighbor of Bidwell Park, I can assure you that none of the guidelines of the mandate of the city council are in line with the guidelines of the city council. The laws and regulations that were passed in the past are being followed. Today we have encampments of over 10 people. They are not being kept clean. There is an increase in criminal activity, and the enforcement of 50 feet from the waterline is a constant battle. The fires are being started by encampments are a danger to the public health and to our citizens. These constant violations give you cause to end the encampments. I know we don't have an answer on what to do with the population, and I'll end it. Thank you very much. Rob Berry, followed by Jeff Glatz and Nicole Nava. April, May, June, July, and August. Five months after enacting the Brown New Deal, as some of you are heading out the door, now you want to discuss this stupid decision that you supported as if you were suddenly really, really concerned. What happened? Did your hearing suddenly improve? Did you read the city manager's report from April? Did you just discover the environmental disaster that is occurring in our parks? Did you just realize that the environmental disaster is occurring in our parks? Did you just realize that after years on this council, that we have a serious problem in our parks? You can ban nuclear weapons, but you can't handle illegal campers who are actually and severely damaging our environment? When hundreds of citizens line up outside these chambers, demanding that you take action to improve the safety and quality of life from our nosedive into a third world status, that you cannot hear. But now you realize there might be a problem? By all means, clean it up. But in the process, don't just move people from one place to another. Just to ensure that the destruction is sure to reach every corner of our park system, if it hasn't already. You have been in complete control of this city council for two years. What have you done to address the loud and clear cries from your constituents? Okay, we will take whatever we can get. But don't think that this is a token gesture of any kind of redemption. We will not forget how you have treated us during your tenure on this council. That is your lasting legacy. I want to say one more thing as I was listening outside. Mark Orme made a comment that we are not, we are an enforcement agency, we are not a services, social services organization. Have you considered the implications of that statement? It is not necessary for you to come up with a solution that says what you have to do for the people that are breaking the laws. All that is necessary is for you to stop conduct that is destroying the quality of life in this town, that is destroying our environment and our parks. Destroying the water quality in this town. That's what's happening. Your job is to stop it. Your job is not to solve the problems of all society. That's what this citizenry expects of you and that's what your obligation is. Thank you very much. Jeff Glatz followed by Nicole Nava and Patrick Newman. Hello again. So this is going to sound really flippant and I'm going to take direction from an earlier speaker who is thanking you so much about what you've done for the marijuana ordinance in our town. I just want to thank you for basically Vice Mayor Alex Brown, Council Member Stone, Huber, and I'm sorry, and Ori for making the worst decision in the history of this Chico City Council. We want to keep our comments to the item at hand. Yeah, yeah, encampments. Okay, so the worst decision would be allowing the public encampments in our park. You were advised by many departments within the city that this was not a good idea. For those of you who have been on the City Council for many years, that's kind of disappointing. For those that were new to the City Council, I think you should have taken the guidance of the city, the city different city offices from police department to fire department to city managers, public works. They know a little bit about what's going on in this town. So I just want to address your reasoning behind stay in place and CDC guidelines. The CDC guidelines were not, the intent was not to endanger a community further. The CDC guidelines intent was to protect everybody within that community. Stay in place. Stay in place was the directive that you believed you were going to enact. However, stay in place did not work from the first week. Our one mile area, our park departments and waterways have been in flux, a huge influx. I would say ten times, tenfold increase in camping. So this was not stay in place. And when we had our park commission meeting, the city tried to defend the position of, well, if they came from Lindo Channel and moved to one mile, how can we say, but again, let's not stay in place. Okay, the stay in place directive was not enforced. And you allowed it not to be enforced. So while the intent might have been something that you were thinking, was positive, the execution of your execution, the city council's execution did not hold up to the state standards. And what I mean by that is the police department and the rangers were actually basically told to not engage with these people. They are doing illegal activities. I approached, and this is true, okay, I approached a group of younger people who were, they worked in the bars downtown during the pandemic. They were hanging out, getting high at the one mile. And I went up to them and said, man, you can't get high here. You can't smoke in the park. And they're like, there's a guy over at the horseshoe pitch shooting up that I just walked by. How are you going to enforce this on me? And you have to understand, he's kind of right. Okay, so I would ask you now to at least direct the police to, you allow the police to basically enforce the laws that we have on the books now. Irrespective of moving people out, if they're doing illegal activities in our parks, they need to be arrested, moved out, whatever. That is not okay for them to be there. You guys are all aware of fire damage, public safety, all that kind of stuff. We don't have to continually readdress that. We have to just address the fact that immediate action needs to be taken. And I appreciate what Mr. Orme is doing about trying to find a solution. However, you guys need to understand, I guess I got to go. Thank you. Thank you. Nicole Nava followed by Patrick Newman and Jeff Creed. Good evening again. So I'm here to talk to you about encampments. So I live along lower Bidwell Park, and I am treated to pretty much daily, nightly fires, screaming, and I mean screaming at the top of people's lungs like people are being raped. I deal with seeing open drug use. I deal with seeing open drug use. We try to ask nicely, as the firefighter gentleman indicated, and you get treated with disrespect. You just try to say, please, you know, we're trying to just go to work or go to whatever. And it's unacceptable. In the Nextdoor app and on Facebook, there's been neighbors that have had interaction with a transient that had a very aggressive dog, and the transient decided it was okay to punch the woman. And she was very aggressive when she went in to defend her dog. This has been somebody that has been brought to the attention of law enforcement before. This is the reality of us walking in our parks, not the foo-foo la-la that some people say and they accuse other people of cherry picking. This is the reality that you have brought to the citizens of Chico, and we're fed up, and it's unfair. We are taxpayers. We want a quality of life. It's very difficult under shelter-in-place conditions. The only nice thing you have is the outdoors. You've robbed everybody of that. And so when is it anybody else's turn? These are people who have made life choices, and some that are mentally ill may not. There are ways you need to help them, and guess what? It is the county's job to have shelter and care. We should not be in the business in the city of Chico in trying to take over and manage in that capacity. And I am thrilled. I am thrilled that they finally are partnering, and they're going to do a great job, it sounds like, in standing up some over by behavioral health. That is long overdue, highly needed. I also understand they're going to try to get the shelter going and everything. Again, not a fan of services, services, services with no accountability, but if this is done right, again, I don't want the city to pay for it. I think that's ridiculous. I think the county is getting millions of dollars that they can use creatively for the unhoused population. But we keep inserting ourselves, and I do not understand what you folks think you're doing. Decision after decision you make causes chaos. So we have people getting attacked, we have fires. While I came up here to talk to you about transient fires, two transient fires, one by SNS, one by ding, ding, ding, my house again. You are putting CFD out there and having to respond to that. What if someone's having a serious medical event and they're getting circumvented by illegal fires? As the prior gentleman said, please start enforcing the laws that are on our books right now. Yours was not. That was a council dictate, not a law. Patrick Newman followed by Jeff Creed and Grace Ayeda. We heard all these same horror stories six months ago. Okay. And there's a subculture that strings these horror stories together. Of course you can find horror stories when you dump 500,000 people onto the streets of our major cities on the West Coast and our smaller towns like ours are going to have horror stories, yes. Because you put people with brain injuries, you put people with PTSD, you put people that have been in 20 foster homes, you put people, did I say brain injuries? You go down this list of maladies, issues, disabilities. These are the least competitive people in our society. We dump them on the street. We haven't provided affordable housing and decent support for these people. It's called the housing first model. We're not even close to achieving that. And so we weave this tangled web of other reactions and responses. And we listen to the drama. And we try to take this drama and turn it into policy. And in many cases, it never works. Because if we go back six months, all we're doing is returning to the status quo, which I've seen up close and personal because I make a point of going out and watching it every week. I'm not a effing saint. I just make a little window in my life to see what these people are experiencing. It's not impossible to do. And what are they experiencing before COVID? They're being constantly aroused. They can't hang on to a sleeping bag. They can't sleep. They can't stay dry. They can't get under an eave without being banned from the civic center area. You're looking at a population that's being moved for the purpose of being the city without tents. And that's kind of how I think of Chico. And somehow that's been defined as success. When I go to any other city on the West Coast, I see tents all over the place. Why? Because we're in a period of collapse. We're experiencing crisis. And now we have this intersection of fires, and crisis, I mean, a housing crisis, and COVID all intersecting. So what's our response? Our response is to make room for these people. Instead of figuring out how to eliminate them all the time and make it more difficult and make it more disastrous, to figure out a creative way to make space before you start pushing people around so that you have something to offer them. So that instead of their autonomy and their agency being stripped, they have some choice. This is the last thing, excuse me, that's available to these people as human beings. Is that they have a choice about where they're gonna go. And the whole design we've been working on in this town is to take that away. If you want to explore that at a more deep level, it takes a while to unpack that. I'm happy to do that. But we are not looking at agency and humanity here. We're looking at responding to drama. Anyway, I'm out of time. Thank you. But anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway anyway anyway anyway!!! I'm going to, I'm going to swat him down here. So three months of hell is helping a firefighter, his wife, and their kids. There are three weeks of hell. Boy, that sure doesn't sound like help to me. I don't know what you all think at home, but that doesn't sound like help to me. So what was it, Mr. Orme? Three and a half, four years ago, I said you need a camp, and you still don't have one in the waiting. I've been saying for years at this council meeting you need a comprehensive plan. Not even an idea until this year. So here's what I have to say to you cowards who made this bed and refused to lie in it. Lie in it. You made the bed. You put the people in the parks. Embrace it. You made the horrible decision without looking forward to see what the ramifications were. You didn't look and find 20 other cities in California that said, this is a good idea and see how it came out. So embrace the decision. You want out of this? I got a plan. Everybody says, oh, nobody has a plan. Nobody has a plan. I've got a plan. Push every homeless person in Chico into Bidwell Park, into Devil's Triangle, where you still haven't put a restroom. There's been camps in Devil's Triangle since 2018. There's still no outhouse there. Why? Have Mr. Hoover go down to Longfellow Bridge and get those rock throwers and criminals, violent criminals, out from underneath that bridge? Because they're in his neighborhood every night committing crime. So embrace this. Push everybody in. If you're at home, you're going to think I'm crazy. But I am telling you, if you push all the homeless into Bidwell Park, down by one mile, this council will act. This council will act definitively for the first time in years, and they will be forced. Because they're... They're scared of what their neighbors have to say. That's about your only way out of this as a city. So if you're at home and you think I'm crazy, just think about what I'm saying. You push every transient out of the waterways. Go to my YouTube channel, and you'll see I've got video all over this city where you're driving transients into the neighborhoods so they can commit crime in those neighborhoods. Consolidate them all in one mile. Let them commit crime in their neighborhoods. This council's neighborhoods, not yours. Because maybe then, after three years, they'll start to listen to somebody who was homeless, somebody who was service-resistant, and somebody who isn't now. I know what a service-resistant person needs. And it's not a sandwich. They need motivation. You ever try to get a full donkey to chase a carrot? The stick won't work. If he's full, he ain't going to chase no carrot. Embrace your bad decision. Grace Aieta, followed by Jack Lee and Cecil Hamilton. Hi. I stand in awe and honor of every citizen who's all that they've gone through, all the hardship that they've gone through. I have a shelter. I have a shelter concept that's a copycat of the Catholic Charities model and the Iverson Center Code of Conduct and Policies. And it would meet all of Chico First's earmarks. Accountability, migration, cost, and location. Well, of course, assuming that we could find a location no one would object to. Migration, the simple solution for that would be a six-month mandate of residency here, as I've done. And I'm going to be there January 1, 2020. Because I'd like to target the long-time hometowners and give them a heavy intake process for what would be called the Chico Boot Camp to help let them build their own recovery plan. They'd get medical evaluation, financial, and psychological evaluation. So regardless of whether they're on drugs or not, they could fit that in. And I'm a long-time 12-stepper. I had PTSD. My older brother was a drug dealer. My father was a George Wallace Republican. I've been through a lot of hardship. And come out of it and had to face myself. I had to march myself into church, into 12-step meetings. That's what it's all about. It doesn't have to be 12-step. I have a stipend program. They could go to the Iverson Center. They could go to AOD, alcohol and other drugs. They could go to Bible study, the gym, acupuncture, acupressure. It's all about therapeutic measures for them. That's the ONTAP resource. The ONTAP resource here is the homeless themselves. And if they did six months, I'd take between 60 and 100 people every six months with a two-year exit plan for the family conscious people. It would also change the – it would be a game changer for the – excuse me, I had a bad fall. For the existing shelters and all of their dilemmas, they have no training. I would have my people trained in sensitivity training. I would have my people trained in civil rights. So it would be mutually beneficial for everyone. It would be realistic and viable for each staff, board, and volunteer to work there. The town – it could have transparency where the town could come in, visit, have a Q&A. People could have a discourse with each other and say, Hey, you really hurt my feelings when you broke into my backyard and stole some of my property. And the homeless could have – could say, Hey, you really hurt my feelings when you passed me by, and ignored me. This could start to depolarize this town. These people are ready. There's a small percentage that might not be the predators, you know, but it would change the conversation once the homeless got back on the street, if and when they didn't get housing. A lot of them have gotten housing. I'm sorry. Thank you very much for sharing with us. All right. Grace, could you say again the name of what – the name of the company you have or did, or what was the place? I would – I would call it the Chico Boot Camp. Okay. I'm looking for – And you did this somewhere else? Pardon me? You've done this somewhere else? No, but I'm from a different town, and it's a real Catholic Christian town. And, you know, it's the model that I grew up with. And the homeless there are still addicts. They still have mental illness. But there's a different standard of law and police enforcement. So the people have a different socialization, and they don't go there. And it's good for them. I mean, I'm against shock treatments and forced drugs. But I think – Okay. Thank you. Law enforcement needs to change. Thank you. Jack Lee, followed by the last speaker, Cecil Hamilton. Good evening. I'm Jack Lee, 12 Victoria Way, Chico. Third generation Chicoan. I've been here since – well, our family's been here since the turn of the century. I wanted to address the council about items you've probably heard many times. But I'll say it again, because this time it's coming from a retired narcotic officer. Retired law enforcement officers dealt with the people that we're having a problem with right now. Okay. And I'm going to go back to the first point. You have a serious heroin problem in Chico. You have a serious methamphetamine problem. You have a serious theft problem. I live close to Bidwell Park, for lack of a better description. I'll call it Three Mile. There's a little entryway there. And that's an ingress, egress point for thieves living in the park to come out and get a drink. And they're not at night and loot the neighborhoods. I know, because I've been a victim. I've been a victim six times. We don't lock our cars anymore, because it's cheaper to let them go through the cars to discover there's nothing in there than it is to replace broken windows. My son is a law enforcement officer, formerly of Stockton. And now he moved down to Atwater. And he hasn't been back to Chico for almost two years. And I've been telling him about this. He's got this problem with the homeless. When he came back, he said he was shocked. He couldn't believe what he was seeing. He says, this looks like streets in Stockton. He said, this is Chico. This is incredible. I said, yeah, it's incredible. I'm losing a lot of my friends. They're moving out of Chico. They're moving out of state. You're facing a big problem. You're lucky if you can just use law enforcement to control it without worrying about some sort of tiny house program or rehab program. If you can just hold the line with law enforcement, you'll be doing good. Because it's that acute here. I have investigated places in the park that were used as chop shops for bicycles. I have recovered literally tens of thousands of dollars worth of shopping carts across town. I went out with the group that loads them up onto trailers and brings them to the city courtyard. This is all indicative of this transient population. Now, you probably don't know exactly who is out there as a transient right now. Because we've never had an in-depth study. I can only tell you that about 85% of the population that I've seen have all the ear markings of hardcore drug addicts. And that's a problem. My time is almost up. I don't know if I can say more. But I thank you for the time that I had. And our last speaker is Cecil Hamilton. Last thing on this, I just want to thank city management. I like that you guys are actually going to get together and take some ideas from the community. I think that's what most people have just been wanting. With a lot of co-op. With COVID. We have not been heard. There's ways to reduce this problem. The gentleman mentioned previously there's nothing in place to track them. I actually have a transient personality profile system built. It was a safety tool that I designed for security guards. I got the idea from watching my older parents trying to get him to a nursing home for my dad. I liked how they would write on the board little traits about incoming seniors. So they would know and build rapport with that person. I was like, why can't we apply this to transients? Without keeping PII. Like addresses. Or social security numbers. Or anything that someone could steal their identity. But just the little things. Like Crazy Bob doesn't like being spoken to in a loud voice. So if Crazy Bob goes into a restaurant or something like that and starts harassing every other customer. They could look him up and say, hey, this guy's banned from the Jesus Center. This guy's banned from the Torch Shelter. Maybe we should just call the police. Little things like that can be implemented if you work with the community. I'll gladly give that to you guys to use for free. I don't care. I don't need to see the problem dealt with. The other alternative is do the Rudy Giuliani thing. I don't know if you remember, but when he was mayor of New York, he worked with the police to actually make it illegal. Being homeless. But it worked. I know that's not the popular thing we want to hear nowadays. But the people that legitimately needed help, that were picked up by the police, were taken to facilities where they got either mental health care or just services to get them actual life support. The people that were criminals that were just freeloading got out of Manhattan. It worked. There's nothing wrong with standing on the shoulders of others sometimes and looking back. Granted, New York has slipped as he's left, but it still was effective. Just hoping you guys will actually do something about this. Because it seems right now just trying to move this issue around and bringing it up is kind of like pandering for votes. I think Stevie Wonder could see that right about now. Anyways, folks, thank you for your time. I look forward to, in September, actually sitting down and talking and sharing some of these ideas to address the problem. Have a nice night. That will close the public comment period. Discussion or entertain a motion? I move that we...can you hear me? Yes. I move that we retract the motion. I vote no. April 7, 2020, referred to by the city manager as an emergency director. Can you just do that one more time, Carl? Sorry, it's fuzzy on our side. I move that we retract the motion of April 7, referred to by the city manager as the emergency director. I... If you're finished, I will second it. And thank you, Mr. Ory, for once again doing what I couldn't since I was in the minority on that vote. I thought it was pretty obvious where this was going to lead. It got worse than I even thought it would. There's not a simple solution to Councilmember Huber's point. There's a lot that needs to be done. There's a lot that we can't do. There's not enough beds. There's too many homeless. The COVID thing doesn't let us use all the beds that we have. No one's going to get arrested because the sheriff's not going to take them anyway. But one thing that I think this might help do is stop the flow of the migrant homeless that are coming here for a variety of reasons, knowing that they won't be asked not to camp here. The needle circus, some things that we're working on, I'd like to see those things reversed. So, Carl, thanks for bringing this up, and that's my second. Any other questions, comments before we take a vote? Mr. Huber. Yeah, I wanted to clarify a few statements that were made. One is, nowhere in the direction that was provided in April did we not make clear that illegal activity should still be prosecuted. Whether or not that has been done, I don't know. It sounds like there are examples where it has not been done, but that certainly was never the intention. The intention was that to comply with guidelines that camps not be moved, but that illegal activity still be prosecuted as illegal activity. Second point was that there was, according to some people, there was a lot of evidence that was being made that was not true. And while there was, we should have listened to other city manager, other people. But the city manager, very quickly after this was brought up, acknowledged that, yes, we were in conflict with CDC guidelines if we were moving camps around. So, it's not the case that we were at odds with the city manager on that item. Third item that I think is critical and I'm not quite sure how it's being dealt with or how it can be dealt with, but I don't think there's any disagreement among anyone on this council that fires should be forbidden and people should be fined who are starting fires. And that we should do everything within our power to assure that there are no fires being built in city limits in camps. And so, finally, what I would say is, what I'm hearing from the city manager is that, yeah, this would be, it would be great if we could start breaking up these encampments. And that he is working very hard and has been for quite a while to come up with an alternative. And that alternative looks like it may be. And that alternative may be presented to us on September 22nd. So, I would make a substitute motion that we table this until September 22nd and find out what that option is at that time. I don't hear a second. So, if there are any other comments, we will take a vote. Just one second. Council Member Hubber? Council Member Morgan? Yes Council Member Orrie? Aye Council Member Hubber? Council Member Reynolds? Aye. Council Member Stone? Aye. Vice Mayor Brown? Aye. Mayor Schwab? Aye. Carry 6-1. Thank you. Okay. We find ourselves after 10 o'clock. So I need some assistance from Council on moving forward. We have item 5.2, 5.4, the item added after the posting of the agenda, City Manager's Report, Council Member Requests, and Closed Session. I'm not supposed to hear new items out of the table. No, we're not supposed to hear new items after 10 o'clock. Want to get confirmation from Council on that? I'm looking at something I think is fairly super urgent. I would always like to hear the City Manager's Report. We'd always like to hear that and Council Member Requests. City Manager's Report? Due to the lateness of the evening, I would decline to give any reports unless there's any necessary need out of respect for the Council's rules. So with Council's team's currents, we will... I mean, I'm prepared to hear Council Member Requests. If we can have some level of agreement, that will be quick about it. They're here, and I just... I don't believe they're going to take an extended period of time. So I would move that we hear Council Member Requests. Okay, I'll second. Okay. Council Member Huber? No. Council Member Morgan? No. Council Member Ory? No. Council Member Reynolds? No. Council Member Stone? Aye. Vice Mayor Brown? Aye. Mayor Schwab? No. That fails 2-5. Well, we will adjourn to closed session. Kick that can down the road. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
