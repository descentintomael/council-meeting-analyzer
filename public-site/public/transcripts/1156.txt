Almighty God, we come before you tonight, and I ask that you would give this  council wisdom and understanding. Lord, help them as they investigate all the decisions that  need to be made. Give them the ability to do the things and decide on the things that are the best  for our community, for the citizens of our city.

I haven't been here in a while. For your last meeting in December I was at Penwell Hospital with my wife, watching a tumor, waiting for a tumor to be removed the size of a grapefruit.  Thanks, Steve.  Thanks, Steve.  Thanks, Steve.  Thanks, Steve.  Thanks, Steve.  Thanks, Steve.  Thanks, Steve.  Thanks, Steve.  last meeting you had  while you people were getting ready to come to this meeting  I was watching a body  being removed  from the place I told you about  where I was attacked  and waited two hours to have a police response  nobody apologized from the police department  that I had to wait for my house  there was no apology  you have a chief here  who says hey look  I just need more budget money  again and again and again  I need to change over to a drone  one of the two drones  was adequate for the job  the reviews say so  the other one wasn't  you sat there and said oh it's just a software thing  it wasn't it was a hardware thing  software wouldn't have corrected it  you were totally wrong once again  you were totally wrong on bridge load  I ask you not to be wrong on the police thing  to actually review what's being requested  what's being done out there  to review whether your chief is doing the job or not  we have too many people  out there getting injured  I was attacked this last Saturday  again by someone  simply for taking his picture  he was on our property  on a mountain of grass  sleeping in a sleeping bag out there  and he attacked me  because I took a picture of him  somehow I was a pervert  somehow I was a nigger  was the other word he used  he also said I will go to hell  because I took a picture of homeless person  go to hell  this is what's going on out there  I called the police  do you think they got him  do you really think they got him  the job's not getting done  it doesn't matter how much money you throw at it  if the job's not getting done  it's not getting done  you need to seriously start looking into this  and take it serious  my wife who's trying to recover  comes back on a bus  she comes to the bus stop  there's a guy who's laid out  on the entire bus stop  with a shopping cart full of stuff  remember your shopping cart law  civil police car law  when the shopping cart passed  and nobody said a word  bus driver fortunately  was a good man  he was smart  he stopped way in advance at the bus stop  and let my wife off  so she could cross  without him  she would have had to deal with a guy  who's already showing that he's aggressive  he's taking over a bus stop  this is Saturday  there's only one bus that runs in our route area  that's bus 5  that's the only bus out there  so it was obvious  and when he doesn't get on the bus  he's there to take over the bus stop  this is what's going on out here  and you're living in it  and you're not doing anything about it  you refuse to do anything about it  you said police is doing a great job  as far as we're concerned  but you're not out there  thank you Rain Share  two days ago March 17  on Sunday  March 7 years  since Desmond Phillip was murdered  in his own living room  by Chico police officers  in front of his father  when he was having a mental health crisis  two of those officers  the ones who were named the shooters  in the official report  were rapists  another officer  the first one  used a taser on Desmond  and arguably a taser is a non-deadly means  of subduing someone  and so this budget item asking for money  for buying a bus  was used by cameras and tasers  theoretically you'd think I might agree with  except that I don't appreciate the way that tasers  are often used regardless of whether they're deadly or not  however  none of these things matter  when multiple officers on the force  have not only participated in killing civilians  but have done so multiple times  and have never had any accountability  have never faced any consequences  and there have been no significant changes  in the last seven years  since Desmond was murdered  in front of his father  when he needed and deserved medical help  which had happened on multiple occasions prior  in the same fashion in his home  that he had been taken to medical help  when Desmond was killed  he was not an immediate threat to anyone  the physical evidence shows that  at the time  there were no body cameras in use  the only significant change that happened  since Desmond's murder  was the actual implementing of body cameras in Chicopee  however  we still do not have  comprehensive, transparent and accountable  processes  for the police to be accountable to civilians  including what happens  when a body camera is used  as always  I will say  yet again  not a single dime more  should go to the Chico Police Department  except to engage in specifically  addressing all of the issues  that we have talked about  for seven years  including comprehensive training  above and beyond the state minimum  which officers did not even have  at the time they killed Desmond  but above the state minimum  for critical incident training  de-escalation above all else  non-deadly means  to subdue or disarm  actual compassionate care for civilians  and more money should go to those services  rather than the police  just because of those  alright  okay  any no votes or disqualifications on consent?  seeing none  entertain a motion  second  motion from council member Morgan  second from vice mayor Reynolds  Madam Clerk when you're ready  council member Bennett  yes  council member Morgan  yes  council member Tandon  yes  council member Van Overbeck  yes  council member Winslow  yes  vice mayor Reynolds  aye  mayor Coolidge  aye  carries 7-0  alright public comment  members of the public may address the council  at this time on any matter not listed on the agenda  and within the jurisdiction's authority  the council cannot take any action at this meeting  on requests made under this section of the agenda  as always reminders signs in the back  thank you very much  no clapping no applauding no booing  etc  please be respectful of the clock  so  alright how many speakers do we have?  I believe we have eight  or nine I guess  I might not have one in  so  three minutes  three minutes?  and then I'll call two names  and if you could go ahead and line up in that middle aisle  that would be great  our first speaker is  Lee Marie Gonzalez  followed by Sharon Cardenas  hello my name is Lee Marie Gonzalez  I'm a Chico resident  and I'm the artisan vendor  I'm a little late to the game  but I have two points that I want to make  regarding the last city council meeting  one of my neighbors at the last meeting  shared a story that one of her cost-revenue clients  told her that they only shop there  when they can get a parking spot  right in front of her store  so my first point  to my neighbors who are worried  that not having a parking spot  will impact their business  parking is already negatively impacting your business  I'm sure you're all aware that gas, insurance, and maintenance  are all necessary, ongoing, expensive components  of owning a vehicle  this is our current model of transportation  it's a deficient and bad for the environment  particularly when we don't consolidate our trips  frankly driving also sucks  you get stuck in traffic  parking is obnoxious  you walk into a store  you have to stay hypervigilant  so you don't run over pedestrians, bikers, smaller vehicles, etc.  and if you're not sure where you're going  you're likely paying more attention to your GPS and the road  like I did on my way here  driving can be stressful  and we need more options  for maximum fuel efficiency  I consolidate my errands  which typically means going to one shopping center  like Target  they get my money  even though I'd rather give it to you  I'm fortunate because I no longer need my own vehicle  and that has opened up a lot of income  I have this money that I'd like to spend downtown  but I don't have it  because now I can't get to you  I would bike downtown  but I don't want to get run over by Councilmember Morgan's truck  since it's so important that he should be able to park it  I can take the bus  but it takes an inconveniently long time for it to come  so it's kind of a special trip  I do it sometimes but not often  I still want and need stuff  and it's inconvenient to go out  so I order it online instead  what I want to make sure that you all understand  is that in none of these scenarios  did I outright not have money to spend with you  but why would I  or someone who doesn't have money  let me boost your business  when big box stores can undercut you  and they offer shipping to my door  why would I shop with you  when you are making a strong argument  that if I don't want to drive to you  I shouldn't bother shopping with you  not even that I don't want to get there  just that I don't want to drive there  secondly  I have a question for City Councilmembers  Addison Winslow and Sean Morgan post opposing opinions  on whether the agreement should be called out  we don't call out individual Councilmembers  and pinpoint them during this time  I would like to reclaim my time please  that's great  I'm telling you that we don't do that  fair enough  and we'll give you 10 seconds extra  don't worry  thank you  so what I was going to say  is that one of you  at least I don't agree with you  but at least they had the to take an opinion on this thing  okay  City Council already ran a survey  to get public comment  got more public comment than last meeting  you couldn't give a clear answer to what the engineer should prioritize  and why do you  well I just want to know why you were right to work  unprepared to actually do the work  is it not prioritizing anything  you're wasting our time and tax dollars  and I just want to say  no  not everyone wants to ride a bike downtown  but not everyone wants to drive there either  so if you give us better options  so that we are not on the road  then you wouldn't be stuck behind us  when we're just trying to go the speed limit  thank you  thank you  Sharon Cardenas followed by Rain Share  and if you could go ahead and line up please  thank you  good day members of the council  I am here to represent the residents who live on East Eaton Road in Tallahassee  as you can see there is a big group of homeless people  where it's an eyesore  and it's not very sanitary  it's very unhygienic  and the main thing is that they are trashing the levee behind them  there is graffiti  I hear somebody got raped I don't know  um Channel 7 said that they are  they said an advocacy person  and it's one of the worst things that they've seen  I know that the city has been granted  I believe four million dollars a year  to help  help them  and I don't know if they're supposed to be by Costco or where  but it's really decreasing the um  value of our homes around the area  and I do have compassion for them  one person had a really good suggestion  and she said  with the homeless person you cannot help them at all  as a group you have to do it one to one  because everybody is so individual  so if I were in your shoes I would  and I know one person who has  history of working with the mentally ill and with drug abuse  so she said  do a case management do a one to one  see what they need  and then little by little maybe larger people will be helped  so thank you for hearing this and hopefully  they can move someplace where it's just a better spot  people visiting to the airport and stuff  and the bikers  one biker got attacked by their dog  and I know that um  oh yeah there's been theft around the area too  not really bad but still  and the bridges they're still filled with  people who are on drugs  and even though by burn app  the bridge by burn app says  no trash  they still come back  with their mattresses etc  I'm always picking up trash  but you can only do so much  and this is a separate issue  I don't know how I can do that but  there is so many cars  going 60 miles an hour on East Eaton Road  if we can get some sort of 30 miles per hour sign between  burn app and the bridge that would help a lot  my neighbors actually have to cross the street to get their mail  and it's really dangerous for them  and I know that the bikers are like freaking out  because yeah it's a little dangerous too  so thank you for your time  thank you  Rain Chair followed by Dea Ammar  I'm here in the spirit of our collective obligation to the greater good  and in honor of my own ancestors  and the traditional Jewish value of tikkun olam  which obligates us to do what we can  to fix what is wrong with the world  I'm here as a representative of both  Chico Palestinian Advocacy Network  as well as Chico Jews in solidarity with Palestine  to present you again with a draft proposal of a ceasefire resolution  which I have given to the staff  Mr. Sheriff again if you could keep your topic to local topics  we are not going to discuss ceasefires  we're not going to discuss wars in other countries  we're going to discuss Chico issues  so Chico issues only please  I have also presented to you a list that  a list of local faith groups, businesses, non-profits and grassroots organizations  who have signed on in support of this effort  a list of further individuals, supporters  and please note this list includes members of the Downtown Business Association  as well as former mayor Andy Holcomb  this list is incomplete  as of printing this a little while ago  at least three more local businesses have asked to be added to this list  again last time  you have said that this is not within the city's purview  however you have a lot of discretion in that  okay so at this point we're going to stop your comment  if you want to comment on a local topic  you're more than welcome to  this forum is not up for discussion  it's either one way or not  so this has been a warning  a second warning  this is the third and final  comply with the rules of the council  or we will end your speaking time  okay I will conclude my comment by saying that  elected representatives of every level of government  should be beholden to the people that they are supposed to represent  and the desires and wants and needs of those people  in all the ways that affect the people within their jurisdiction  which includes how their tax money is spent  and how they are silent on very serious issues  which includes things like  things that happen outside the city  like things that happen within the city  like the murder of Desmond Phillips  all of those things  all of the issues  that are pertinent to the people within the city  should matter to the city council  and when you stand in our  position to even hearing those things  when almost a hundred cities in the country  feel differently than you  feel that their constituents  and their constituents' tax money  and how that affects them  matters  and it matters how we are represented locally  and on the larger scale of our state and our nation  and regardless of  how we hem and haw  about the details of the legality  there are things like  you know  passing an ordinance against nuclear armament within the city  that is within the history and tradition of the city  that is not inherently directly actually within the city's purview  one could argue  so again  you choose not to  that's fine thanks  so Dea Amar followed by Julie Threatt  I don't think he made it  he didn't make it  oh okay  so Julie  let me pull you up  and then followed by  sorry  just  so Julie Threatt  and then let me call you back  go ahead Julie  thank you so much council  yeah Julie Threatt  I'm here as you know  to advocate for those in your community  that are injured by the COVID vaccine  it's really not a vaccine  it's a gene therapy  I'm asking each one of you to sign  the politicians against the shot  it's at americansforhealthfreedom.org  there's 163 elected officials  89 candidates  a surgeon general  one state political party  13 county political committees  and seven physician organizations  publicly stating that COVID shots must be pulled off the market  over 17,000 physicians stand behind us  you can sign that pledge  it's super simple  it's super easy  what I'd like to let you know is  now I'm going on national speaking tours  and last Friday I was in Florida  at the COVID vaccine injury summit  where I spoke out  with a number of injured  a number of lawyers  and a number of doctors  and Dr. Anna Mahalsey was there  at the very end of her presentation  she showed slides  of the contents that are in these vials  that again were injected into many of your children  and many of the important people in this community  out at the fairgrounds  they found nanotech  quantum dots  kevlar  polymers  cabling  chips  all sorts of garbage  it's really important that we get these products out there  but history has revealed  history has revealed I just left my house on a call with the military. 300 military officers were on that phone call under the declaration for military accountability.org. Those members are fired up pissed off and they're going after the sick death for all sorts of toxic exposure. So this is important to our veterans.  history has revealed  history has revealed  history has revealed  history has revealed  history has revealed  history has revealed  Thank you. Thank you. Sophie Paul followed by Chris Nelson.  Thank you for the honor of addressing you. I'm Sophie Paul, resident and business owner in District 4.  The reason I'm here is because I'm a member of the District 4 Board of Trustees.  The reason I'm coming here tonight is because, is Council aware we have no senior center in Chico?  And I can almost hear a couple of you say, but we have a senior resource center.  And I give you that that's basically the equivalent of equating going grocery shopping to receiving a donated food box.  So I, I'm only 46, but my mother is going to turn.  67 this year.  She has given 18 years of her life to the work training center of New County,  which is a vocational rehab for mentally and emotionally challenged adults.  I am talking about Terry Paul.  She has sat on the council of many businesses in this town and the council has helped so many people.  And there is no senior center for her.  She's currently going down to Vacaville to visit my grandmother.  She used to live in the city.  She's a very senior center.  I go on trips with them.  She deserves a safe space along with other people's grandmas, other people's mothers, myself when I get to that age.  And honestly, considering the average mayor of council, I mean, you guys too, right, may need this as well.  And it's really difficult for my mother to transition from being a community advocate.  And source of help to go into the community.  Chrome.  And if she could have a safe space, I would love that.  Now, I, being my mother's daughter, am no stranger to community activism and fundraising.  I have a couple of really great fundraisers already fully planned out in my head and putting for this.  I am going to be emailing you soon with those ideas.  I look forward to community.  I look forward to communicating with you and networking with each of you so that we can make a really phenomenal Chico for all ages.  And I'm so excited I was able to do this tonight.  Well, I know there's some people here who are also going to be talking about the senior rent.  And I want you to know from the depths of my heart, my mother makes $45,000 a year now.  She's only made that for the last five years because I fought for her.  That's the most money she's ever made in her life.  With no retirement plan.  I am her retirement plan.  I am her only child, and that is a lot of stress.  So if you could help me and my mother and everyone else and please hear out the seniors that are here to talk about that tonight, I'd appreciate it.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Chris Nelson, followed by James Hutchinson.  All right.  So, citizen.  Holidays all over the United States are completing ceasefire resolutions tonight in Sacramento and El Cerrito.  They'll be addressing this in wait just a moment.  I am here as grandmother and as a member of Chico Peace Alliance in order to support a ceasefire resolution.  No matter what you say, sir.  Just wait a minute.  Thank you.  Okay.  We are not going to discuss a ceasefire agreement.  This is.  I want to talk.  To you.  Give me a second.  $25 a piece.  Each taxpayer is paying since before October in taxes for what Israel is doing to Palestinian people.  Okay.  I will not abide you cutting me off because I want to speak.  I will be arrested and you will be in the juice.  We will adjourn this meeting for five minutes recess and have our Sergeant-at-Arms speak.  Thank you.  13,000 children.  Thank you.  Have a good one.  Thanks.  Thanks.  Thanks.  Thanks.  Thanks.  Thanks.  Thanks.  Thanks.  Thanks.  All right, folks.  We've done this more than a few times in the past, so I'd really prefer not to get there.  I think everybody, mostly everybody here would prefer not to get there.  But just to explain it to you, if we have that situation occur again, have the speakers speaking off topic in terms of local purview and I shut them down and they don't, we will take another five-minute recess, come back, we'll do it again.  At that time, we will have the chambers cleared.  So there will be no one here for public comment, unfortunately, on all the issues.  We will be speaking about tonight.  But that's our policy.  We give two warnings and then we go to having the public removed, keeping the media in the room, finish conducting the meeting, keep it online.  So obviously, we'd prefer that.  There's a lot of people here who are here to speak about business of the city who would prefer that as well.  So please keep that in mind and we'd appreciate it.  So, all right, let's continue, Mr. Hutchinson.  Followed by Yamo Aqua.  Difficult act to follow.  I hope that everybody here understands that Yamo is building a cancer center in Merriam Park with 15 acres that was donated to him.  And yeah, I have a personal reason to say, hey, back up, help him, get it done.  If you've ever been in a cancer center, it is overcrowded.  It's filled.  I've sat in there so many times, so many hours now.  I've felt the pain.  And it's difficult to deal with it, especially when it's your own pain.  But I'm talking to other people out there.  It is difficult.  It's extremely difficult.  There's people in that hospital who are giving up.  Literally, I'd rather die than continue going through this.  That's what they're saying.  One woman didn't leave saying she was not going to continue with the treatments.  It happens.  Second victim.  Last time, when my wife went into the hospital,  you people passed a resolution here for Humboldt Road property locations,  for putting in a dog park and putting in a bike path.  Where did you put it?  It's right next to where I live.  I've talked about where I live before, how close we were to it.  Our district representative didn't support us.  Didn't talk to us.  Didn't ask the peer what we had to say about it.  It was just done.  You did it overwhelmingly.  You said, hey, it's a no-brainer, right?  Right?  It's a no-brainer.  That's what we said.  The brainer here is that bicycle thing is right next to a senior development that you  active senior.  It's low income.  Section 8, 30 to 60% rounds.  You're putting a group of seniors who are already next to a junior high of sixth and  seventh graders next to a bicycle park will be on the other side.  You're putting Murphy Commons on the other side.  Already in there.  You have another development that's a home-low-income thing.  You have three low-income places, and then you jam-in this bicycle park and a dog park.  The dog park's down by us.  It's across the creek, literally, across the creek.  Anybody who knows Little Chickle Creek area, Forest and Humboldt, knows that Little Chickle Creek dries up in the summer.  It's an easy access.  Two-thirds of the time, you can cross Little Chickle Creek.  Even during flood stage, I have crossed Little Chickle Creek.  There's an old joke that I've got to tell.  I don't have time.  It's about knowing where the rocks are.  It comes down to knowing how to cross.  And these people are going to be there.  If you're having them there in an area where there's been bicycle thefts,  get over a slew of garbage under it.  He went there last week before the bicycle race.  It was coated with garbage down one side.  It's full of garbage.  We have bicycle thieves down there.  I find them regular friends.  I've watched a couple of people.  This man there.  That's what's going on there.  I'm asking him to consider it.  Our last speaker is Yamo Aqua.  Okay.  I've got about 30, 40 stitches in my mouth right now.  I'm not supposed to be doing stuff like this.  Somebody's got to talk to you guys about your rules of purview.  Because what you've effectively done is come in here and you've taken part of your job  that you're supposed to be doing for us off the table.  Nobody elected you to come in here and say,  we're not going to do this for our constituents.  We're not going to do that.  Power, please.  It's hard for us to hear.  We just have outbursts.  Okay.  First, no outbursts from the public.  Second, the man already said he had stitches in his mouth.  So he's trying to speak as loudly as possible.  I'm sorry to get in here, but we don't have public outbursts.  Thank you.  So what you've done with these rules of purview,  you've come in and you've set rules saying that you're not going to represent  your constituents on matters that hundreds of city councils,  do regularly across the country.  You are one of the last lines of defense for us to tell the higher forms of government,  because they don't take us seriously.  The senators and Gallagher, LaMalfa, they don't take us seriously.  I've been in Gallagher's office.  He doesn't care about these kind of issues that are affecting us.  It's affecting our money, our taxes.  $7 billion.  You know, the McDonald's has lost.  McDonald's is going to get shut down if things keep coming this way.  It's like, it affects us.  So what you've done with the purview is you said that we're not going to do our job and represent you.  When we tell you, because you've got this thing upside down and backwards,  we're the ones supposed to be telling you how to represent us.  It's not the other way around.  You're public service.  That's what you're supposed to be doing is listening to us  or should be able to address you individually.  Okay.  And tell you what to do.  And you should be listening.  Okay.  So when we're telling you, we want you to go to the president of the United States  and put a document on his office to stop doing things that are affecting us here locally,  affecting our families, killing people we know and love.  You should be listening.  Okay.  And your rules that you've set aside for yourself,  you've got one person that won't listen to us,  but you've got other rules that won't even allow him to bring this thing to the table.  Or anybody.  You have very special rules that are very undemocratic.  And it just silences our voice.  So hundreds of cities have done this, what we're asking you to do.  And it's your special rules.  You're unique in this regard that you won't do your job on this topic  and put this document on the president's table to stop,  because there's going to be backlash that's going to hit us financially.  And we won't stand by what innocent children are murdered.  We're about the thousands, 15,000.  So please say it with me, everybody.  Free, free Palestine.  Free, free Palestine.  Free, free Palestine.  Free, free Palestine.  Free, free Palestine.  Free, free Palestine.  It's the dark times, we're going to waste yours, all right?  Free, free Palestine.  Free, free Palestine.  Free, free Palestine.  Thank you.  Thank you. All right.  Thank you.  All right.  At this point, we'll move on to the next agenda item, which is public hearings, of which we have none.  And then five is our regular agenda item, 5.1, consideration of downtown Chico Business Association's annual progress report.  And we have a report from Deputy City Manager Jennifer McCarthy.  All right.  Good evening, Mayor Coolidge, Vice Mayor Reynolds, members of the council.  I'm Jennifer McCarthy, Deputy City Manager.  Before you tonight is consideration of the Downtown Chico Business Association's 12-month progress report.  As background, the DCBA, or Downtown Chico Business Association,  came to the council in 2023 with a request for financial assistance.  At the time, due to a number of issues, including COVID and reduced event sponsorships,  they were in financial need and requested the council provide assistance  as they worked to revitalize their organization in terms of both operational functions and financial stability.  In March of 2023, the council approved an agreement with the DCBA to provide $140,800,  annually for a three-year period to enable the organization to stabilize themselves financially  and develop a functional plan for moving forward.  As a stipulation of approval, the council requires the DCBA to bring forward a progress report  at 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months from the date of contract execution.  Before you today is consideration of the DCBA's 12-month report.  So at this point, I'm going to turn it over to the council.  I'm going to turn it over to the DCBA's president, Greg Scott,  who's going to give a very brief overview of their progress to date.  And then at the end, both Greg and I are available for questions.  Thank you, Jen.  Mr. Mayor, council members, thank you very much.  My time flies when you're having fun.  It just seems like it was just yesterday where I was sitting here asking for money  and going through this.  As Jen just said, I'm not a money-maker.  And I want to thank each one of you for your support.  I know I've talked to almost every one of you many, many, many times.  And without your support, we wouldn't be where we are.  If you remember, we talked about focusing on four areas,  the reorganization, marketing, communications, our event promotion and promotions,  and then finally, placemaking.  What I can say is right now on the history,  I forgot that part.  There you go.  Just press right there to go forward.  So on the reorganization, a few things have happened.  We've fully staffed our team.  And for the first time since I've been involved with downtown,  for the first time we actually had more candidates seeking board seats  than we had board seats open, which was, in my mind,  kind of served us as an indicator of how much our other pillars are working,  communications indeed.  So far we've achieved our goal of, first-year goal of reaching 65% of our budget,  earning 65% of our budget, not being gifted.  And in Area 2, notice I have somebody that does this for me.  Jen's a great assistant.  She is.  Marketing, communications, phenomenal.  I know all of you have probably seen the Love Chico ads on television,  if you watch television at all.  We reached 13 million impressions on our billboards,  10.7 million impressions on TV.  It just keeps getting better and better.  We've had more success in our social media,  and advertising than we anticipated.  And a lot of that's due to a lot of sponsors who stepped up  and became title sponsors or major event sponsors for our events.  Speaking of those events, I want to give a special thanks to Chief Aldridge,  Chief Nicodemus at Chico State, the VIPs.  Oh, I did it again.  Because we see, I'm learning, Sean, I'm learning.  I'm learning.  We basically put on all eight events.  The Thursday night market was by far and away the best Thursday night market season that we've had.  We had 65% or, excuse me, 46% increase in vendor participation.  And I think retention is going to happen.  I'm excited about April 11th this year.  We started again.  Friday night concerts, again, with the police presence.  The safety aspect.  The ability to move the beer garden into the center of the plaza.  And everything worked perfectly.  And was really well attended.  We're bringing back a hybrid version of Taste of Chico.  It's not going to be called the Taste of Chico, but it'll be a hybrid version of that.  That's going to be a pretty exciting thing that will culminate with a free concert in the park,  or in the plaza.  And more to come.  We'll come on that.  Our, watch this.  Oh, went too far.  Oh.  Ah.  You guys have seen this.  I want to talk a little bit about our partnerships, I guess I'm going to call it.  Partnerships or coordination with CARD.  With Chico State.  With Explore Butte County.  Chamber of Commerce.  We've all got, they all have advisory positions on our board now.  And I'm extremely excited about working with President Perez at Chico State.  The man's bringing things to Chico that I just, it's amazing.  And, you know, downtown, we are at the footsteps of Chico State.  So whatever we do downtown, if actually we can, we're going to be doing that.  But history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history  and that's something that downtown needs to really work on.  The last area is placemaking,  and unfortunately we're still struggling  with the safety in downtown.  Everybody knows the issues.  We're working with Council on their initiatives.  We're trying to coordinate.  We've done some of the things.  We've done some physical enhancements.  Working with Monica on smarts and culture.  I spend more time, I think, with DCBA and PBID  than I do at my own business,  but our partnership with PBID is working.  We're trying to assist with the assistance  of Eric's group and Public Works.  It's starting to work, but we just need more effort  and more, hopefully, drive some positive changes  for downtown.  And that's pretty much what I have to talk about.  So, well, we should go on this.  We did do beyond, I guess, what you'd call  our normal scope of business.  When the Complete Streets survey came out,  or Complete Streets project came up,  we did a survey of our own.  We've surveyed the ABC license issue  that's coming up in a few weeks, I think.  Not the one tonight.  We set up the kiosk concierge program  when we had issues with the kiosk.  All those things we kind of turned in a heartbeat.  And we had, literally, massive participation  from the local businesses, which is, again,  is, I think, testament to what is happening in downtown.  We opened our new office.  They can blame it on me.  It was a couple months late, but we opened the new office.  I'm looking forward to April 1st.  We're gonna start our welcome center.  It's a downtown-only welcome center.  Be fully functional, hopefully middle of summer.  Gonna have business maps, restaurant maps,  walking tours of Chico State, Chico State memorabilia.  All of those things will be right  in the epicenter of downtown.  I'm really excited, because it's open now  before the Thursday night market starts.  So that will be the place where people will come  and actually see it.  And I would invite all of you to come and take a look,  and everybody in the audience as well.  It's really a nice place, and I think it showcases our town.  And that's pretty much it for me.  I just want to say thank you again.  Hopefully, we're meeting the expectations  that you all had for us.  I think we are.  I think we're exceeding some of them.  And I think we can do better.  So, any questions, I'm more than happy to answer.  All right, questions for either?  I've got, so I wanted to thank you for taking this on,  because you have brought this thing back to life.  And it's really critical for the future of downtown  that we have a functioning DCBA.  So, thank you.  I know you're working really hard.  Thank you.  It's not just me, it's a whole bunch of folks.  Anyone else?  Mr. Winslow.  Yeah.  I do want to say, Mr. Mayor, that I think, you know, I'm a big fan of the DCBA.  And history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history  How are we going to turn that around?  I mean, is it even in a better financial situation now than it was a year ago, the DCBA?  Yeah, let me answer the first part of your question.  The first loss was we took a flyer on an event that we thought was going to be really good.  And quite frankly, it wasn't.  Some of us personally lost finances on it, and that's just the way it is.  We thought it was going to work out.  It was acceptable, but it wasn't what we thought.  And hence the bringing back of kind of a hybrid taste of Chico, which I think is going to make a big difference.  We did not, and I'll use the word, monetize the Chico Art and Wine Mock, which we coordinated with Chico State in the Wildcat weekend.  I don't know if you guys were down here that weekend, but there were probably 5,000 people downtown.  It was shoulder to shoulder in the streets that were closed.  You couldn't hardly walk around.  We missed an opportunity.  We missed an opportunity there.  We're going to fix that this year.  The other thing we're doing is we've got a new sponsorship package, and that's going to help.  To the assessment piece, I would welcome help on the assessments, because we've met with the city, and it's not a fault of their own.  The system is old.  It's querying a database that, depending on how you ask the question, you get many answers.  For example, one of the meetings we went to, the very first page, the second or third line said the Diamond Hotel and Diamond Steakhouse hadn't paid their business license.  I know for a fact I wrote the check, and I had the business license on my wall.  So those assessments are geared to business license.  We have a committee right now, representatives from PG&E and a couple of banks, and we're basically sitting down saying, all right, how do we come up with an assessment process that makes sense?  It's not okay for somebody to pay $10 a year for an assessment, and it's just ridiculous.  So we're coming up with that.  So that's where that's going to come from.  So I understand the event you're talking about that lost a lot of money, that's Chico Live.  Right.  But this is, I mean, it's a much larger budget.  How much money was lost on just that event?  On Chico Live?  Yeah.  $30,000.  $26,000.  Mm-hmm.  I think we're going to hear a public comment on this.  Yeah, happy to hear any other questions.  I have a question, if no one else has.  No?  All right.  It was my understanding you guys were going to hire an executive director, and I think that was one thing that we said, you've got to do that.  You've got to have a forward-facing representative.  It's got to be someone you pay and pay well.  And we have an interim right now.  But you haven't.  Yeah.  I mean, but you haven't hired someone, have you?  Yeah.  We have an interim executive director, Debbie Mosley.  Okay.  Debbie DePlante Mosley is our interim executive director.  Okay.  I didn't want to go out.  Year one, it's like, okay, you just said pay them and pay them well.  It's very difficult when you don't know, you know, are you going to take a job that you may not have next year?  I don't know that.  Certainly, I understand that.  Yeah.  I'm in business.  I get how it goes.  I know.  I understand.  Yeah.  And in the event business.  But beyond that, it's kind of essential to have that key person in place to make sure all the financial stuff falls into place.  And I think that's why we said it as a council, like, look, get that person in place right away.  Correct.  So, and I know you've had before her, somebody else doing it, but on a volunteer basis.  Well, we have a coordinator right now, Vincent Planet coordinator.  Okay.  And she's a full-time permanent.  Well, I say permanent.  I don't know how permanent it is.  But Debbie came on two months ago, two and a half months ago, I believe.  And she's basically, right now it's a six-month deal.  And if we're going to move it on forward, we're going to see how it goes.  Okay.  But I agree with you.  We have to have somebody other than me up here.  Yeah.  I mean, you've got something else to do.  And I think that's why it was one of our main concerns.  And then I think the other main concern that you heard back from us back then was the assessment side of it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, I'm not necessarily thrilled where we are on that.  But, you know, I mean, I'm willing to give you guys the benefit of the doubt to a certain respect.  But at the same time, you know, this is some pretty hefty cash the city's doling out here, too.  So, you know, we want you guys to be able to do this and do it well.  But I don't want to interrupt you, but it is hefty cash.  But I think the return on the investment is going to be more than worth it.  Okay.  All right.  Anyone else?  For my comment?  No.  All right.  Madam Clerk, how many speakers we got?  We don't have any.  No speakers.  Thank you very much.  Okay.  Council discussion.  I was just going to add, if we looked at anything staff-wise to better, a better way to track those fees as they're coming in so we can.  Because I notice it says I haven't paid you yet.  And I know I got a valid business license up on the wall right now.  So.  Yeah.  I don't know the specifics to that.  I don't know the specifics to that particular item.  But we have a third party that processes them.  Honestly, business licenses as a whole are pretty low on the totem pole in terms of administrative time and effort from staff just because the fees are so low.  It just doesn't pay for itself to do much there.  So we do the best we can.  Like I said, the third party reports to us what people pay.  If there are discrepancies, we'll have to go back to them and see.  What the deal is.  So I'm not sure.  Further comment.  I will say as long as we have that outstanding issue with the assessments, as long as it looks like there's an ongoing loss of funds in here, I'm not comfortable committing recommitting these funds that can go to anything.  I mean, we see like some success with like event planning.  It's like we could focus our funds on that.  And what's what's definitely working with it.  But while especially while there is a source of revenue that should help them be sustainable and we're not really taking advantage of that, I don't feel comfortable just adopting a report and continuing to like see what happens next year.  I think that we can table with a report and then see if staff can help resolve some of these issues.  Come back with something a little a little bit different or updated.  I wouldn't mind a staff review of their finances.  But I know that.  That's out of cough.  Other thoughts.  So I would suggest that.  Mr. Scott is vastly more experienced than anybody that's sitting on this council about managing financial matters.  And that's the first point.  Second point is the $30,000 loss from the concert.  These things rarely make money the first year.  They build momentum over time.  And the fact that the DCBA had the courage to try something new instead of being stuck in the same rut that wasn't working.  We should commend them.  Ice rink is a great example.  I don't think we have the final numbers yet.  But this third year was a was a terrific success.  So I think we need to stay the course.  We have an extraordinarily competent person running it.  And the people behind them are competent.  I don't agree with them on a lot of things.  But I'm confident that they're going to get us there and that we need to continue to support them.  Mr.  Martin, I will agree with Councilmember over back as much as it pains me to do so.  I'm glad you finished your sentence about that.  Mr.  Scott was far more qualified than a bunch of us.  And then he said, why?  Because I was like, what's he getting at?  I was like, what thing exactly?  Nothing at all against our staff.  But I trust the downtown business owners and the people running it to come up with the right options far more than I do government.  I realize it was painful for them to come to their local government to ask for help.  I think we're doing the right part.  And all we can do to get in the way is to start to micromanage it.  So I'm willing to keep watching, especially knowing Mr.  Scott and some others that I won't name put their own personal funds into doing everything they could to make that concert a success.  And they're good at it.  And I think that's what we need to do.  And it will be a success, just like the ice rink, to your point, wasn't in the beginning.  So I'm happy to move on the way we have been.  And I will support that.  I've been associated with the DCBA since 2006, I think.  It was a treasurer at one time and I supported them extensively back then.  I still support you.  I think you're doing a great job.  And all of this takes time.  There's been some rough spots.  The  COVID situation really hurt a lot of businesses, including downtown, obviously.  So it's just going to take some time to bounce back.  And I, for one, fully support allowing you to have the time and the resources to build downtown Chico back to where it needs to be and should be.  So I thank you for your efforts.  Council Member Tan.  I'm just curious if you could please let us know about the assessment process.  Is there an estimated time that we could have approximately like in the next six months it will be completed or?  Because that would really help, too, because that is, I think, one of the other big things we see in here.  Yes, we put a committee together, as a matter of fact, today, in our board meeting, specifically to come up with alternative solutions.  So we're going to have to do a lot of work.  But either thing, either thing, either thing, either thing, either thing, either thing, either thing, either thing, either thing, either thing, either thing, either thing, either thing, either thing, either thing, either thing, either thing, either thing, either thing, either thing, either thing, either thing, either thing, either thing, either thing, either thing, either thing, either thing, either thing, either thing, either thing, either thing, either thing, either thing, either thing, either thing, either thing, either thing, either thing, either thing, either thing, either thing, either thing, either thing, either thing, either thing, either thing, either thing, either thing, either thing, either thing, either thing, either thing, either thing, either thing, either thing, either thing, either thing, either thing, either thing, either thing, either thing, either thing, either thing, either thing, either thing, either thing, either thing, either thing, either thing, either thing, either thing, either thing, either  To answer your question, we are working on it to come up with an alternative solution to the, I'll call it,  our case system that we currently use.  It's just the juiciest isn't worth the squeeze as far as getting that done, I mean, as far as getting the assessments done.  Do you think in the next six months it will have something more concrete on that?  I'm hoping that it will.  I'm hoping it will.  We're going to have a solution.  It'll be some type of a member solution based on number of employees or based on business size or one of those things.  But my bigger hope is that we've also got a sponsorship program coming out to where we're doing different levels of sponsorship  and different benefits for whatever the sponsors do.  We've got some pretty good ideas.  But people on the line, I guess I would say.  Sure.  Thank you.  Yep.  Any other?  Mr. Scott, actually, if you could come back.  Sorry.  So I want to get to this fundamental issue because I think it's a fundamental issue here.  So in terms of the assessments, obviously it seems like that system is broken.  I'm curious about what we're going to do to fix the assessment process.  I don't know.  Excuse me.  My hope is that we're going to come up with some type of solution that's based, a fee-based organization rather than assessments by business license.  A fee-based organization.  We have to show that there's something worth the fee.  And I think that's what we're doing with the advertising and marketing and all of the things that are happening.  And this stuff keeps rolling.  I can go to you.  I can go to someone in a business and say, hey, I want.  No, no, no.  I completely understand that.  It's just obviously if you do assessments, it's much easier.  You put out a bill.  People have to pay it.  You know, they have to stick to it.  It's built into their, you know.  I'll defer to the city staff on what that's going to take because it's.  And it sounds like there's no increases built in your assessments either.  No.  So how do we redo that entire assessment process and get a new assessment is what I'm asking.  Approve a new computer system that would do the business license.  And raise the fees and raise our percentage.  If I may, Mayor Coolidge.  Yeah, please.  Back in 2018, the city council did work with the downtown Chico Business Association on just this fact.  And there were modifications to the Chico Municipal Code that do allow for a change in assessment.  That assessment change process is very similar to what you went through with the property business improvement district,  where those that are paying the assessment have to agree to move forward.  The majority have to agree to move forward with that.  That change in assessment.  So while the tools are in place for both the changing of the assessment level and also having DCBA take the lead on the collection,  they have chosen not to move forward with that option at this point.  Can I?  Go ahead.  So to Mr. McCarthy's point, the tools being placed is the first part.  But to Mr. Scott's point, you have to show the business owners it's worth it.  And prior to you doing what you've done,  Yeah.  it wasn't.  And so the things that you've done, including your survey of the downtown streets, which I know we, some of our staff hadn't looked at,  just being the voice of the downtown business owners.  I know that you're going to come and you're going to speak about the alcohol licensing, all those things.  When we hear it piecemeal, it's not terribly helpful.  So you're making that difference.  I, for one, understand your strategy and agree with it.  And I'm glad that you have Jen on your side to help move forward when that happens.  But you had to prove the value before you could raise the assessment.  You have to take her to dinner before you kiss her.  You probably know.  All right.  When's our next assessment?  Or when's our next review?  Six months from now?  The 18-month assessment will be the next time.  So we can ask the DCBA to come back with a status on their financial model, as well as any updates on their executive director position.  All right.  Madam Clerk, what do you need from us here?  Do you need anything specific to your registration?  I still have comments.  I've been...  Okay.  I'm sorry.  You just...  I don't know if you need a formal motion.  This would be acceptance of the report this year.  Mr. Winslet.  So all experience aside, when there's an event you cite as the primary reason for a much larger budget shortfall, and you describe it in a report to your funder as well received by attendees, praised for its excellent preparation and management, setting a strong foundation for future improvements and iterations, I'm concerned that there's problems and we don't have the right to do that.  I'm concerned that there's a lot of other solutions to them, and that the point of us supervising the public funds going out is to make sure that there are solutions to the problems that are being faced.  Like, there are challenges.  I get it.  Things fail.  I understand that.  And I think that our responsibility is to make sure that we're going somewhere in the right direction.  And I don't really feel comfortable saying, in six months, let's see if then we're going the right direction.  Yeah.  I would like to see that staff works to find some solution to some of these issues that are being focused on.  face and we come back and see this again so it would just be tabling the report  really sorry tabling acceptance of the report mean to sound disrespectful this  is a clarifying question tabling as opposed to accepting yes because we're  expecting them to come back not in six months but but with some answers to some  of the the problem so that we see that we are going in the right direction  won't they be coming back either way in six months I'm saying table it for like  two weeks four weeks oh okay I understand thank you so just a  question on point order so mr. city attorney could we what could we do at  this point what thinner so the recommendation is to receive an file  right so if the council wants to provide additional direction for the next update  the council can vote on the direction and and request for additional  information  you're welcome  whatever it may be and you can decide on the duration and when you want that  brought back it could be at the next update in six months could be any other  time as well I'd make a motion that we that we table the report and come back  in two weeks with the understanding that's that staff will work with the  DCBA to try to come up with some idea for resolving these problems so the only  reason I won't second your motion is because then what we do to the DCBA and  this happens a lot in government because we end up  doing so much reporting and committee meeting and all these other things  nothing never happens so Greg will work for the next two weeks to try to give us  something we want so he go do what we need him to do to begin with as opposed  to actually go do what we need him to do well he did kind of just spitball a  response to how we can resolve the assessment issue I just want to see that  on paper not a whole new report but know that confidently we are going to move  forward with some kind of way to address that those funds from businesses who are  benefiting from this but are not paying into it  yeah I'd be willing to support it if we gave him a little longer than two weeks  how long to two months two months I think that's reasonable just because I  don't want to get to the end and go oh yeah we shouldn't have done that  what can I can I get opinions from staff one of one of you two please on how long  it would take and that's not a I don't support the downtown this is we've got a  substantial amount of taxpayer money going out to a particular project we need to get that done.  to make sure that it's on track and that money's being spent responsibly so  understand and we're happy of course to work with the DCBA on that it would take  more than two weeks because again that would be all all Greg would be doing over  the next two weeks would be working working with us on this so if it's a if  it's a couple of months we can we can certainly make that happen I'm happy to  work with you in any way I can to  make it happen make it happen with a game plan  yeah  you can give me two years and I can't make the current set that work  yeah  well no but I think that's yeah that's part of my issue and concern is I want  to make sure that we make it work  looking for some type of a fiscal plan yeah I am uncomfortable with us micro  managing the DCBA we we have a President Scott's articulated a strategy that  makes sense he's a highly capable experienced executive has given a lot  of his time  but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but  but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but  but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but  but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but  the city is supporting is  not something we should  be in the business of doing. You do understand that we  collect those fees, right?  The city collects  the fees or is not collecting the fees is what we're hearing.  We are collecting them, but we don't  have a way to put out a report.  They don't have a system yet, but they have every  motivation to do that.  And us creating  a reporting requirement is going to make  it better. It's going to make it worse.  So if you made that motion, Mr.  Van Olbeck, I would second it.  We have a motion already. I accepted your  friendly amendment. Two months. That's what I heard. That's good.  Yeah.  So you can do a substitute motion if you want.  Or we can just move forward  with the original motion.  Okay. And that motion was to table the  filing of the annual progress report  for information in order to allow time for  staff to find some solutions  on the assessment issue with working with  TCBA representatives  and bringing back a report in two months.  I have a clarifying question.  I did not hear in your  motion that it was staff that was supposed to come up  with that plan.  Was there not a substitute motion?  Sorry.  There was not a substitute motion.  No, it wasn't staff. Staff would work with them to come  back with a solution.  Right. And that's what I  staff to work with DCBA.  So that is staff working with  Okay.  So is that the correct  motion? And are we voting on that?  You say it one more time, though.  So to table, it was a motion by...  Council Member Winslow, seconded by Mayor  Coolidge to table the filing of the annual  progress report for...  in order to allow time for staff to work  with DCBA representatives to find  some solutions on the assessment issue  and to bring back a report in two months.  I'll make a  substitute motion that we just accept  the report in its  current form.  Second.  Thank you.  All right.  Substitute motion. Madam Clerk?  Okay.  Okay.  Council Member Bennett? Yes.  Council Member Morgan? Yes.  Council Member Tandon? Yes.  Council Member Van Overbeck? I'm sorry.  Which motion are we voting on?  This is the motion to accept the annual...  To approve. Yes.  Okay. Council Member Winslow? No.  Vice Mayor Reynolds? Yes.  Mayor Coolidge? No.  It carries 5-2.  I just want to have one more comment on this.  I didn't want to add in with that whole conversation.  There is, on the Friday Night Concerts,  in this report,  it says the challenge is that the Plaza Fountain  is being disrupted due to children splashing.  And there's a solution to  put, like, post rules for the fountain.  And I just want to say,  please let the children splash in the fountain.  That's what it's designed for.  .  All right.  .  All right.  Mr. Morgan, you're up next. So, be ready.  Winslow. Winslow.  Sorry. I was working on Addison's next campaign slogan.  Yeah. Yeah.  All right. 5.2, Finance Committee recommendation,  Fire Victims Trust Fund Policy.  Mr. Morgan.  Winslow for the children.  I can't...  It's hard for me to switch gears.  The Finance Committee heard staff's recommendation  on the Fire Victims Trust Funds.  There was not a lot of discussion,  and I think for this reason.  The one question I think that Skipper was asked was,  would it be wise to hold on to any of this  until we knew it was happening with Measure H?  And his answer was something along the lines  of they're not going to overlap that much.  It takes a while was number one.  And then number two,  when you get into the staff report  and see the recommendations,  there are a lot.  And the committee knew that probably all seven of us  would probably divvy this money up in some different way.  And that...  But probably the best thing was to go with the staff recommendations  on what was best for the city and the roads  and the original intention of the...  And then the other thing is,  So we moved to send that report here to Council.  And that's my side of the report.  And then I can turn it over to Barbara or Mark, whoever is...  Yeah, I would just add that the primary goal of the policy  was to protect our disaster recovery funds.  We've heard from other jurisdictions  where they received Fire Victims Trust Funds  or other settlement funds.  And it puts those disaster recovery funds  in the same place.  And that's because HCD could view that  as a duplicate funding of the same loss.  So that's the main purpose of the policy  is to clearly delineate those two different funding sources  and clearly delineate the entirely different projects  that they are funding.  So the objective is to protect the funds  so that the government, California,  doesn't come back in some way,  and then they can't enter.  However, they manipulate some of these activities  and start picking apart and taking back funds  that were contributed to the City of Chico.  Correct.  Is that correct?  That is correct.  Thank you.  And when we made our claim to the Fire Victims Trust  as it relates to disaster recovery funds,  we specifically removed those projects from our claim.  So we don't want to again lose them.  So that's the whole purpose of the policy.  All right.  Further questions?  All right.  Public comment?  Entertain a motion.  I do want to say a couple things.  All right.  Council Member Kim.  I'm actually really excited to see  the Commerce Code connection on this  because that is one of the best uses.  I think that is fun because that is like a whole business.  There are more than 100 businesses on that street  that have only one exit.  So this will probably provide another exit  because we saw in Paradise how bad that is  when you don't have more than one exit  in case of an emergency.  And I am, you know, I'm all for the design of the project  for the next 10 years.  And I know that this is contingent on the base  on our major edge success.  But I'm just curious, you know, our roads are like  in a really, really, really,  roads are not really good in our city.  And I'm sure we all hear about it all the time.  And I would like to propose to use some of these funds  to repair our residential roads.  I would like to check with Mr. Gautam, you know,  how much do we spend per year on doing any,  doing the road repairs where we do not require any engineering?  Specific to Public Works O&M, that's, you know,  that does do some work on arterials and collectors.  And residential streets, it's about $500,000  that's dedicated just for asphalt and roadway  maintenance functions.  So does that mainly include filling up the potholes  or maybe striping or things like that?  Correct.  Do you think that is sufficient funding  for the city of our size?  Do you think we are doing enough for our citizens?  If I could though, you know, this year,  it's interesting.  We would normally do, what, 4 or 5 million annual road work.  This year, we'll be starting somewhere between 55, 65 million.  And I understand that.  You know, we did receive a 10-year plan approximately  to fix major roads in the next 10 years with our major edge funds.  But I do know we have other funds.  You know, we, in the report,  we talked about CDBG disaster relief.  We talked about the CDBG disaster relief funds,  which are going to go to Fair Street  and another project in there.  All I'm trying to do is maybe just keep 10 million in here,  but 3,430,000, give it to O&M in the next couple of years  to seriously work on the residential streets  because they don't get attention.  When we get the pothole requests,  we get the little things that can actually serve more people  and I would like to propose that.  And I'm not against doing a long-term design,  which is a great thing to have,  because if we don't have a design,  we cannot build new roads  or properly repair them where we need engineering involved.  So that's the motion I would like to make on this.  Well, what's before you is the Fire Victims Trust Fund Policy.  Yeah.  The allocations, we just gave you a concept of,  that's not before you tonight.  Right, but we are saying to design for the projects  that money to go there.  All I'm saying is to make...  No.  No, that's just a conceptual illustration  of how these funds might be allocated.  That's yet to be decided.  That'll come before you during the budget process.  Potentially, some of them could come a little bit earlier than that.  Okay.  But that's not...  The detail that we're...  The only thing we're talking about tonight is the policy.  It's the fund policy, not the allocations.  Yeah.  Okay.  So just to your point,  I think it might be best brought up during the budgeting cycle.  Sure.  Well, and there may be an opportunity a little bit earlier,  just because some of these projects  are advancing faster than the budget policy.  Well...  Bottom line, we're not talking about the allocations yet.  Okay.  Yeah, as are some of those potholes in my district.  So...  Right.  I mean, is it possible for to direct right now  to when the budget policy comes in as to allocate it like that,  or does this still be done at that time?  It would be done at that time.  Okay.  Thank you.  All right.  Is that no speakers?  Correct?  No.  Correct.  I just have a quick question or comment.  I'm glad we are doing a policy to protect those funds.  And I'm even more glad to see that in the conceptual of where the money could...  It's not a policy.  It's a policy that would go that all of its streets and roads.  So I look forward to further conversation on that in June, May, whenever we get there.  So...  But I think the public will be super happy to see that the commitment is towards fixing  the roads, which is what took the majority of the heat, for lack of a better word, during  while we have a lot of extra people in our community.  So thank you.  All right.  Further comment, motion?  There's something I want to add.  There's something I just want to get out.  And I agree that I think this is great.  It's great that we're putting it towards streets and roads.  Great that we're protecting the funds and that we have this policy.  It was a responsible decision.  And I'm glad we have it before us.  I also just want to comment on something I've heard from some folks that they see it as  controversial that we have this settlement at all, that the city is receiving any funds  out of the Camp Fire Victim's Trust Settlement.  And just to say while people are listening that it's...  The reason the rationale is that trucks are on our roads.  And this impacted our roads.  But also there's so many people from Paradise have resettled into Chico.  And now they are part of our community.  This is a way that we can benefit them and other people who have suffered in the fire  in a whole variety of ways.  And just to let it be known that we're making do with what we get.  We're not getting the full settlement that we were allocated because PG&E does not have  the money.  They did this thing where they tied the allocation in the trust fund to PG&E stocks.  And then stocks are just not where they thought they might be.  And so we just get less money.  And this has the unfortunate impact too of applying political pressure to the California  Public Utilities Commission to not turn down rate increases.  Because if the stocks were to fall further, then the campfire victims would get even less  money out of it.  And we've just really been ripped off all around.  And this is the best that we're getting out of it.  But the whole situation has us...  Is something we should seek to get out of.  Okay.  So while I agree with you conceptually, it's already sold all the stock.  So all the stock was sold into last year.  So it's already gone.  Yeah.  So the two recent rate increases don't really matter.  Mr. Mayor, may I make a motion?  Please.  I would like to move that the council accept the recommendation of the finance committee.  All right.  Second.  Motion to second.  Motion from Council Member Van Orbeck.  Second.  From Council Member Bennett.  Okay.  Council Member Bennett.  Yes.  Council Member Morgan.  Yes.  Council Member Tandon.  Yes.  Council Member Van Overbeck.  Yes.  Council Member Winslow.  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds.  Aye.  Mayor Coolidge.  Aye.  Carry 7-0.  Aye.  And with that, we will take a short break.  All right.  Item 5.3, Internal Affairs Recommendation,  Alcohol at Private Events in City Plaza.  Council Member Van Overbeek.  Beck.  Wow, I can't believe I did that.  Chair of the Internal Affairs Committee, Mr. Van Overbeck.  At the February 5th Internal Affairs Committee meeting,  the Internal Affairs Committee heard the motion regarding  allowing alcohol to be served at private events  in the city.  And we voted 3-0 to recommend that the council modify  the Chico Municipal Code to allow alcohol to be served  at private events in the city plaza.  And even Mr. Winslow agreed with the Vice Mayor and myself.  And that's my report.  All right.  Questions?  Seeing none from us, do we have any speakers?  We have two.  All right.  Three minutes.  Greg Scott, followed by Megan Sheehan.  So I'm going to take a minute.  I'd really be silly to sit up here and say I'm against this.  What I would really like you to look at is the verbiage  and the thing that says provision, sales or provision of alcohol.  I think it needs to be.  I'm fully in favor.  This is me as a person, not a DCBA president.  Fully in favor of sales of alcohol with an ABC permit  and follow all the guidelines that we all do every Friday night  that we have is the provision, you know, Group A,  family reunion, bring out a Yeti full of beer in the plaza  doesn't make sense to me.  And I think that we'd be asking for trouble.  That's it.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Megan Sheehan.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Hi, everybody.  My name is Megan Sheehan, and I'm the public relations manager  at Tri-Counties Bank.  And this is up because of me, so I apologize in advance.  And I know that Mr. Winslow wants to go,  and that's the reason he didn't deny it.  So we are celebrating our 50th anniversary.  And we, if you didn't know, we were founded in Chico,  California in 1975.  And we're now the largest community bank in California.  And for the culmination of our 50th anniversary,  we would love to host a private, elegant gala, no Yeti coolers,  I promise, in our city plaza.  We think that our roots are in Chico.  We love Chico, and we want to celebrate our 50th anniversary  in Chico.  Our goal is only to increase business in Chico.  It will be a farm to fork event.  We plan to work with local businesses  to serve a multi-course meal.  The event will be ticketed and fenced in.  We will have a lot of fun.  We have hired an event manager, and we will ensure  this event is staffed and safe.  We will obtain an ABC license and ensure  that alcohol remains within the event space.  We will work with local police to ensure  the safety of all attendees.  We expect approximately 500 individuals, more than half  of whom will stay in local Chico hotels  and shop at local Chico businesses.  And these individuals will include employees,  such as executives and senior leadership,  many of our shareholders, top clients, and prominent leaders  throughout California.  We would love city council to approve modifying the municipal  code to allow alcohol for select private events.  Do you have any questions I can answer?  Thank you.  All right.  So discussion?  So a good question kind of came up.  You know, I generally think that it's  like we should let adults be adults, and so that's why I  think that we can have a rule.  But history history history history history history history  history history history history history history history  history history history history history history history  history history history history history history history history history What sort of leeway is there in approving these permits for these parties to to say like, hey, what they're talking about doing, like too many beer pong tables or something like that, like beyond our standard and Chico.  history history history history history history history history history history history history history  history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history  pong tables or something like that like beyond our standard in Chico well I  think the PD requirements the staff requirements and more importantly the  ABC requirements I don't think would support what you've just described yeah  we have a hard limit somewhere the ABC requirements are by far the strictest  okay okay all right further questions I just passed the question to the city  attorney is there a does the word provision open us up to something and  does that need to be changed or is that wording protect us no I think the  wording is okay as the city manager indicated there's various regulations  that ultimately the city has to comply with the applicant has to comply with so  the provision is provision in a manner that's legal  I think  maybe there's a concern of passing out beers from a cooler but you know that's  not legal to do that publicly so I think the provision is is doable provide its  provision legally yeah which is complying with all of the things that  are laid out in that okay perfect thank you mr. Bennett so could someone provide  me with a definition of private events there are of course there's going to be  little restrictions on the public transport and the public transport  limitations but some kind of guidelines on that I'm happy to handle that  councilmember Bennett a private event is as an example what tri counties Bank is  is proposing where they are hosting the event and the attendees are up to them it  is not an event like Chico live where anybody from the public could have  purchased a ticket to participate in that event so that was considered a  public event a private event is when it is limited to a guest list that is  determined by the host of the event so I think that's something that we need to consider as well.  history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history  eliminate or minimize risk of both public nuisance and public safety issues.  And that's exactly where I was going.  Thank you.  You knew exactly where I was going.  Mr. Mann, over and above.  I've got a question for Mr. Scott.  Greg, I want to make sure that I understood your comments.  You're asking that we not just be able to provide alcohol at private events,  but also be able to sell alcohol at private events?  No, it says.  It says, allow for the sale or provision.  Right, that's what it says.  For example, Friday night concerts, we get a one-day ABC license.  We get the permit signed up by the city manager.  And we have a fenced-in area.  We sell tickets.  I get that.  What I'm trying to understand is,  do you want something that's different than what's in the proposal?  I don't want someone to be able to go in a family reunion  in a Yeti full house.  A beer, booze, or whatever, in one corner and in the other corner.  If it's an event, a permitted event,  a permitted event with alcohol available and fenced in,  like we all have to do.  Right.  I'm absolutely for that.  I think that's what we're talking about.  Okay.  Well, that's just not how I read it.  I'm not sure.  I provide it versus sell it.  It's different.  Okay.  Well, we want to make sure we clearly understand what the DCBA wants.  That's me.  Okay.  Okay.  Thank you.  All right.  Further discussion?  Entertain a motion.  Move to approve.  Motion from Vice Mayor Rohn.  Second from Council Member Winslow.  Madam Clerk, when you're ready.  Council Member Bennett.  Yes.  Council Member Morgan.  Yes.  Council Member Tandon.  Yes.  Council Member Van Overbeck.  Yes.  Council Member Winslow.  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds.  Aye.  Mayor Coolidge.  Aye.  Vice Mayor Reynolds.  Carries 7-0.  All right.  Item 5.4.  Thank you for your patience, folks.  Internal Affairs Committee Recommendation, Mobile Home Space Rent Stabilization.  And we have a report from Council Member Van Overbeck, Chair of Internal Affairs.  So at our March 4th meeting of Internal Affairs, we had a discussion about rent stabilization,  rent control for mobile home parks.  This started because the people of Pleasant Valley Estates were served, some of them with  a 30%.  The history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history  the city isn't doing anything to help.  We got that cut by two-thirds, the max thing, the max increase.  The courts in California have established, and around the country,  that landlords have the right to a fair return,  and they have a right to recover costs.  So the major problem here is that when the current owners bought the mobile home park,  their property taxes were reassessed and increased by $140,000,  which translates to $98 a space at Pleasant Valley, which is what you're seeing.  If a rent control measure had been in place, let's say, three years ago,  when these people bought it, it wouldn't have changed a thing.  Nothing would be different.  You can't make them retroactive.  In addition to that, these things are very expensive to administer.  The city of Santa Monica has a population of 100,000, which is roughly Chico's.  They spend $5 million.  That's about $5,000 a year administering their rent control commission,  whatever they call it.  These things are also magnets for litigation.  The cities get sued, and they have adverse long-term consequences  because investors in various, whatever class of property,  stop investing whenever there's rent control.  So the long-term consequences are not favorable.  As a result, the Internal Affairs voted 2-1 not to take action on this matter.  And that's my report.  All right.  Questions for Mr. Randolph?  Well, just for one, there was no vote taken.  I made a motion.  There was no second.  It died without a second.  Yeah.  Just to clarify.  Again, report.  No public comment.  We did that.  Yeah.  No action was taken.  Just wait.  Yeah.  Do you have a question relevant to the conversation?  So we voted 6-1 to refer this to committee.  I'll say when it went to committee, I thought that the point of it going to committee  was for us to work out some of the fine details of an ordinance,  which we had.  And I think that's what we decided to adopt.  And that wasn't the case, it turned out.  You know, Council Member Van Overbeek said at that previous meeting of the whole council  that putting it to internal affairs, we were kicking the can down the road.  The road, the can evidently fell off the road over the shoulder into the ditch.  And I was thinking about climbing down there to go pick it up.  So my question is, since we have this report from internal affairs,  what sort of action could we take as a full council,  given the six of us voted to send it to internal affairs?  So I'd ask that.  So the city attorney.  Good evening, Mayor of City Council.  To respond to that question, per the city's administrative procedures and policies for the city council,  when a committee report is submitted to the committee,  but there's unable to reach a consensus on it,  that item can be brought back to the council for further discussion and direction.  So basically tonight, that's kind of what we're here for,  is further discussion and direction.  The direction could be to do nothing.  The direction could be to...  If we can't direct it back to the internal affairs committee,  the direction could be to provide staff direction to do something in return at a later date.  All right.  Further questions?  Thank you.  All right.  How many speakers?  We have 13.  All right.  What do we do?  We do three for under 15.  So three.  Okay.  Janet Olsen followed by Julie Three.  Hello, Mayor and Council.  Thank you.  So I want to be clear.  I don't live at Pleasant Valley Mobile Home Estates.  I live at the Chico Mobile Country Club, which is out actually in the county.  But the thing I appreciate, I'm glad, Mr. Olverich, that you mentioned about the property tax when the Pleasant Valley was sold.  Because, I mean, if you think about it, in my park, for instance, we have 178 homes.  And an average rent of $700 a month.  So for the year, just in rents, that's $1,495,200 just for a year.  So at my house, and I'm just talking about me, I have to pay not only my rent, which  is, listen, what I do right now for myself is I'm completely happy.  I'm really worried about the people that have lived there 40 years prior to me, which I said  last time I was here.  So for me, though, and for all of us, we have to pay.  We pay our rent.  Our sewer, trash, and water are all separate.  So that's another $80 or so a month for those things.  PG&E, of course, is separate.  So that's going to be kind of a variable to whoever, how, whatever kind of PG&E people use.  And then you also have, I have property taxes, just like the green bill, just like everybody else.  So I pay property taxes.  I also have to pay homeowners insurance.  All of us pay those things.  So our, the, what do you want to call it?  Our parks, all of our parks are age specific.  So they're 55 and older, which you can then assume that a lot of the people are on a fixed  income, a lot of them.  And even including myself, which I have a higher fixed income than the people that moved  to my park 40 years ago, clearly.  But I'm thinking to myself, if I'm 68 years old and I live to be 98 and 30 years pass,  and the parks are, there's no rent stabilization at all.  And they're just allowed to continue to raise the rent on your space.  Then I'm going to be one of those people 30 years from now that can't live in my home anymore.  So I just don't, I really feel like we really need to consider those items and those things  and help the seniors that live in those parks, because it's a great community.  It's a great place to live.  I mean, I don't have to live in a mobile home park.  I can buy a house somewhere, but I like it there.  So I'm just hoping that you guys will reconsider and maybe think about it.  And hopefully be able to do something.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you, Julie.  Three followed by Bill Webster.  Yeah, Julie three.  Thank you.  I'm here to advocate for these seniors and these veterans behind me.  As I told you last time, I was at the county for two years and I saw this go before them  three times.  County council brought forth a number of proposals that were easily doable.  They asked Shelby Boston to do a survey of all mobile home park owners in the county.  And there was a huge need for this.  I saw dozens of your community members.  Down there at the county.  It's not just one mobile home park.  Todd Kimmel shoot and that board of supervisor kicked the can to Sal and Donna.  For the record is was the Republican chair of this new county GOP.  And he now is the president of the Western Manufactured Housing Community Association.  But let's not draw somebody.  This is a fact I'm going to put on public record.  Mrs.  Street.  I hear you.  $500 for Todd Kimmel Shoes campaign.  We are not.  I think there's a lot of.  I'm going on.  I'm going past.  There's a lot of.  I'm going to go.  Then we're going to take a reason.  Either apply to the policy.  I didn't say anything wrong, but okay.  Yes, we are not allowed to call out individuals while you're speaking in terms of making accusations  or anything negative about them.  Okay.  So I won't say the name.  There's just a lot of conflict of interest here.  Thank you.  So it's the Western Manufactured Housing Community Association that's causing all this conflict.  You all received a letter from Hillary Moser.  Now she's on the opposite side.  She's with the Mobile Home Owners League, who's a nonprofit associate organization.  And she's a member of the  Association that represents the parks.  You're doing it again.  Oh, I can't say a person's name?  Who's a person?  Yes.  We're not here to attack individuals.  We're here to talk about the attack.  I heard she's someone advocating that you received a letter from.  She's an advocate.  This was a public comment we received she's referencing.  We all have it in our email.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  Anyway.  Again.  So what she said is in terms of her experience in Humboldt County, they had a voters initiative  to pass an SRSO in 2016.  And what she said is that this Western Manufactured Association is telling lies all across the  city.  And they're telling lies all across the state because obviously they don't want to have  these in their communities.  They modeled theirs up to the city of Marinas SRSO and they included a monthly fee of $5  for all park residents to offset the expenses.  So other than that, a staff member in the planning department sends out once a letter  a year saying, hey, it's cost of living plus 3%.  And then they send a notice to the park residents.  The administrative fund has been in the black the whole time.  So you know, you guys have an army of code enforcement officers that make sure that you're  homeless are in shelters.  And now you can't have just black people in the park.  You have to have one code enforcement officer once a year make sure that these seniors  and these veterans behind me are kept in their homes and not put out on the street.  It's absurd.  It's not rocket science.  It's a simple calculation.  And once a year, you make sure that they're adhered to it.  She also wanted to say, as city council members, you're mandated to uphold the elements of  Chico's general plan, which requires a good faith effort to address local housing needs  and conserve and improve the existing affordable housing stock.  She said that you're leaving yourselves open for a civil grand jury complaint at this point  for failing to abide by the general plan requirements.  It urges you to reconsider your decision to support unlimited enrichment of wealthy park owners  at the expense of low income park residents while holding yourselves out for liability  for allowing the erosion of affordable housing.  Thank you.  Bill Webster, followed by Mary Carlisle.  Mayor and city council, I'm here to represent Pleasant Valley Mobile Home Park.  My mom has lived there for 49 years.  She has lost some of her income due to my dad passing 10 years ago, 13 years ago.  When they first, this company bought Pleasant Valley Mobile Home Park, they come out and  just start increasing rent.  This last time it was 30%.  I appreciate what the city council did to talk to them about dropping it down to 10%.  But if this continues, I'm going to be in trouble.  There could be more rent increases over the years.  These people are on fixed income.  Some people in this council, probably not.  I know I'm on fixed income, but I've been fortunate enough to make some investments  where I can afford things.  But these people here are on fixed incomes.  They can barely make some of their payments.  I would like for you guys to take into consideration of looking at this for a moment.  I'm going to talk to you about a couple of things.  One is rent stabilization, not only for mobile home parks, but also for other things in the  city of Chico.  I went online the other day to look at rent for Chico.  A one-bedroom apartment in Chico, minimum is $1,200 to $1,400 a month.  There's a lot of people out there that can't afford that.  And it just keeps going up and up.  And it's not only Chico, it's across the entire country.  So we are not going to be able to afford that.  So we are asking that you would please take more consideration to try to help these folks  out.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Mary Carlisle, followed by Kathy Vlach.  Hello.  My name is Mary, and I moved down from Paradise into Chico.  And I bought a mobile home so that I could live comfortably and with dignity.  And when I moved here, that really was the case.  I was a little bit more comfortable.  I was working.  I had a small mortgage, which I paid off in three years.  I thought, oh, goody.  I'll be able to retire.  Well, as time goes on, and the rent problems, the price increases, is not unique to Pleasant  Valley.  Take the number of, I don't know how many mobile home parks there are in the city of  Chico.  Take that and multiply that times the number of people that live there.  I know that in our park, I live in Casa de Flores.  There's 400 spaces.  So I think what we're doing is we're saying, well, when property is sold, the property  assessed value then goes up.  Maybe that's where we need to start, is thinking about these, when things sell, could there  not be something done to limit those kinds of tax increases to the new buyers?  Maybe that's where we need to start.  But I'm telling you that as those, one of these days, I'd like to retire.  I'm 75 years old.  I shouldn't be having to work full time.  I have Social Security and a small pension.  That's not going to change.  And yet, 10% and 10% and 10%.  My utilities, when I moved down here, was between $50 and $70 a month.  Now, I know y'all are not responsible for PGE increases.  I'm not here to assess a blank.  I'm just here telling you that my PGE, while I was frugal, used to be $50 to $75 a month.  It was $260 a month last month.  And I'm not home during the day.  I work.  So I turn everything off.  It's going up again next month.  It's probably going to go up $50, $75 a month.  My insurance, when I first moved in, was $550 a year.  My insurance bill came.  It's $1,250 a year now.  So what I'm saying is these costs increase.  Y'all sitting there have a unique opportunity to protect not hundreds but thousands of people that live in the city of Chico.  It's important you stand between my being able to live comfortably and with dignity and me becoming one of the homeless people.  I don't think that's a very attractive thing.  I think that's a very attractive, viable option.  I've worked for all these years.  I deserve to live comfortably and with dignity in a city that I love.  Thank you.  Kathy Blatch followed by Al Johnson.  Hi, City Council.  My name is Kathy Blatch of the Plaza Valley Mobile Estates.  I just have a couple of questions based on what the agenda.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I just have a couple of questions based on what the Internal Affairs Committee came up with.  So November 2023, the City Council negotiated a 30% rent increase down to 10%.  Legacy offered direct rental assistance to 96 homeowners in our park.  There's been no assistance or even communication regarding this promise from Legacy.  Do you guys have any updates?  Anybody reach out to you because they don't talk to us.  We don't interact with them.  We don't talk with speakers in terms of answering questions.  Okay.  And the City of Chico Annual Action General Plan requires you to preserve existing affordable housing as a qualification for state and federal funds and grants.  We represent low-income populations, and we're seniors, disabled, veterans on fixed incomes, and we pay taxes and we vote.  Mobile homeowners, we are a community, and we're a neighborhood also.  Why are we not included in the plan?  The history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history  to that one area.  As elected officials, you are tasked  with creating ordinances and enforcing them.  You would create and enforce this ordinance  just like any other ordinance you have already enacted.  The city has competent support staff, I am sure.  There's over 100 SRSOs that are active  and working successfully.  We have provided probably eight examples.  The City of Marina and Humboldt County  are two of the ones that we kind of recommended  when we handed out those binders.  And the City of Marina and Humboldt County,  the ones that we recommended to you,  they were written to include a $5 monthly fee,  $60 a year per mobile home owner  that offsets the expenses related to its administration.  So we kind of pay for the own basic administration of that.  A staff member from the planning department  sends out one letter per year informing park owners  the allowable annual rent increase  and notifies the park resident representatives once a year.  The fair return petition can be filed by park owners.  Usually park owners do not want to open their books  to justify space rent increases above the SRSO  because they also have to provide you with their income.  I have an example and we've got another speaker here  that has some more details,  but you used the hypothetical example of repaving  and striping the roads in our park.  They were done in 2018 by PG&E  because we had a gas leak in the park,  and they had to tear it down.  They had to tear down all the roads and put in new gas lines.  And they were done again two years later.  That's time. Thank you.  Oh, okay. Thank you.  Thank you.  Al Johnson followed by Celeste Macklin.  Hi, I'm Al. I'm Johnson.  I live in Pleasant Valley, Oklahoma State.  I've lived there since 2004, so I'm not a newbie.  I'm a newbie.  When I moved there, my rent was 350 bucks a month.  I just paid 635 last month.  That was a 10 to 10 and a 10.  A lady that I know is looking to buy a mobile home in the park,  and she really liked it.  But she went to the office and they told her,  your rent will be $900 a month.  Online, a mobile home across the street from me,  selling for 69,000.  And it says right in the ad online, $840 a month rent.  I can see where my rent's going to go real quick.  This bothers me because I'm an 81-year-old senior  with fixed income.  I'd like to move my mobile home, but it's 40 years old.  And no county will give me a permit to move to another county.  My mobile home is no longer mobile.  I am stuck living at Pleasant Valley Mobile Home Estates.  I can do nothing about it now because I have everything I own  is in that mobile home.  Legacy has now made me a captive homeowner.  Chico City Council, please, please, please, please, please,  please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please  and I also live at Pleasant Valley.  And I want to say that we do appreciate what you did  about lowering that raise, because it was pretty traumatic  for virtually everybody that lives there.  And we know that, and you won't forget  that you did go fight for us.  You all have chosen a profession, public service.  And this is an auspicious profession.  This is like caring for the sick, caring for, well,  everything around us, you know.  It's very important.  And it's helpful.  It's helpful.  And it's all about helping, for you, your fellow citizens,  your constituents.  And we are some of those constituents.  And I know it's not an easy thing to do, because there's a lot  of factors that come into it.  There's a lot of factors that come into our point of view.  And, well, let me just go on to say that in hoping  that you will show compassion to your constituents, to us,  to seniors, to vets, to those people of us  that has been said before that are on a fixed income,  and we just want to live a life that we can feel good  about ourselves and feel, well,  I just hope that you will consider these things  and how important it is to us.  Because it's all that we have.  I'll end it there.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Sherry Marshall followed by Ann DeBeau.  Hi.  My name is Sherry Marshall.  I also live at Pleasant Valley Manor.  I moved there two years ago.  And the hopes of being able to live in my home and just finish  out the rest of my life.  We as seniors, we paid our dues, and we just want  to do what we want to do until the end.  Because for us, this is the end.  And a lot of us, again, I want to regurgitate everything,  but we're on fixed incomes.  I still work.  I don't want to, but I have to if I want to survive and buy dog food.  I really, really hope that you guys will reconsider the space rent  stabilization ordinance.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Excuse me.  Ann DeBeau followed by Larry Wall.  Hi.  I want to say thank you for what you've done in the past. I want to say thank you for what you have done in the past to get the increase reduced. According to Legacy's website, they have a portfolio of three hundred million dollars. Their owners and operators of more than 25 years with 70 plus parts nationwide and plus it was one of three in California. Their owners and operators of more than 25 years with 70 plus parts nationwide and plus it was one of three in California. They purchased Pleasant Valley for approximately 13 million in 2022. They assumed a fanning a loan of four point six million at 10 years interest rate of two point seven eight percent.  loan of $4.6 million at 10 years interest rate of 2.78%. There is a letter dated from a previous  owner, John Holder, back in 2020. He bought it in 2020 for $3 million, and he was referring to  upcoming maintenance, including resealing the roads, the pool and deck fencing, repairs, and  painting the clubhouse. The estimated income for Mark Park is approximately $1 million per year.  Average space rent, $840 a month, and utilities, about 50, which is the sewer, water, and trash.  The onsite manager home was recently sold for approximately $75,000, and the space rent was  up to $850 for the new owner. Their business plan included the 10%. They did the 30, and then you  guys got it back. But they also took away amenities.

They took away a laundry room without any  notice. They took away a laundry room without any  notice. They took away a laundry  So they took away important things for the residents.  Besides limiting outrageous space rent increase, the SRSO holds unethical greedy park owners accountable.  They have to open their books and provide income and expense reports to substantiate capital gain expenditures.  Please consider this ordinance.  Chico's in trouble, and this is just the tip of the iceberg.  Land's being purchased in Chico and Paradise by greedy out-of-state corporations.  Let the shameless, corrupt, and greedy corporations know Chico will not tolerate this behavior,  but will stand up for justice and protect its vulnerable senior citizens.  Thank you for considering this.  Thank you. Larry Wall, followed by James Hutchinson.  Good evening, Your Honor, Council, staff.  Free markets are the American way.  Very simple, right?  However, gouging is not part of the free market.  That doesn't belong.  It doesn't belong here or anywhere.  Predatory pricing is not part of the free market.  What we need is accountability.  We need profitability for the owner.  And we need affordability for those who live there.  And I think this council can help make that happen.  You know, 10% per year is high.  30%, which almost happened, is outrageous.  It should never have been approached in the first place.  It's a shame these kind of people are here to do what they're doing.  And if we don't cut them off now, they'll go back to it next year, the year after.  That's not sustainable.  That's not doable over the long haul.  And we have to do something about it.  Immobile home parks are composed primarily of seniors,  many of them with physical challenges.  Many of them are veterans.  They need our help.  They need your help.  They need the community's help to stop what's going on now.  They are your constituents.  They need your help.  So I would ask you to agendize this to consider a stabilization ordinance  or a similar mechanism to prevent these outrageous prices.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  James Hutchinson, followed by Salo Landano.  I mentioned this before this council.  I worked on a brick project in the city I grew up in, in which we looked at apartment  rents, trailer rents, a number of other things.  It was right there in the middle of Proposition 13.  Proposition 13 settled.  It was a bomb of rent control questions.  A number of cities went into rent control.  San Francisco, East Stairs, Alameda, a number of other places.  It's a broader issue than what you're talking about here, although they are giving you the  essentials.  Everyone who's spoken here has given you some essentials.  One of the essentials, let's talk about it really simple.  Industry rule of thumb, for every $10 per month space rent increase, you have approximately  1,000.  You lose approximately 1,000 in mobile home equity.  That's the person telling you that when they move in, when the person moves into that trailer,  they want to buy in.  If you want to sell your trailer, for instance, because the rent's gotten too high, guess  what?  They consider the rent.  That reduces what you're going to get for that trailer.  The value of your trailer goes down with each increase rather than goes up.  It's not like your house.  A trailer goes up.  The value of your rent is not like your house or an apartment even.  The cost to move, you've heard people telling you here.  One gentleman pointed out he can't move his.  That's not unusual.  What's the cost to move?  The average is figured around $5,000 to $10,000 just to move that trailer out.  That's not including any other repairs that need to be made.  You have to move somewhere else.  Here's the deal.  We're not talking about just one place, one complex, one mobile home place.  If you focus on that, you're ignoring what's going on out in the field here.  You're ignoring all the other people who are paying rent and don't have the gumption to  stand up like these people have.  These people are bold.  They're good.  They're saying what happened to you.  Other people aren't here today.  They can't.  They're afraid of it.  I don't blame them.  If you get evicted, you're not going to get evicted.  You're going to get evicted.  If you get evicted from a trailer park, where are you going to go?  Where's that $5,000 to $10,000 to move your trailer?  Where are you going to find a cheaper place?  That's what they're asking you today is to take a broader stance in controlling this.  Look at Petaluma, for instance.  Petaluma put out a project where they put districts for 55-plus trailers, for people  who live in those manufactured home trailers, those 55-plus districts.  There's a number of those.  There's also buying your place.  The renters get together and purchase it and form a thing.  You can be involved in that.  Thank you.  Salo Lundano followed by Bryce Goldstein.  Good evening, Council.  Thank you.  Salo Lundano with WMA.  I'm going to remind the Council.  The Council that has been brought up here already before, the owners in question immediately  lowered the rent when they were contacted.  They lowered it to match the statewide rent control law here in California, which doesn't  actually apply to mobile home parks.  They did so in good faith.  An increase above that level of what is allowed through the rent control law at the state  level is very rare, and the state legislature is currently working on their own mobile home  rent control bill as we speak.  The owners of Pleasant Valley offered rental assistance to the residents in need, and  that's not something that a rent control ordinance can accomplish, and that's something  that needs to be understood, that there's a lot that cannot be accomplished by a rent  control ordinance.  As Councilman Overbeck has mentioned earlier, what happened in this case is actually a perfect  example of one of those situations that would not be covered or in the situation actually  would have been much worse had there been a rent control ordinance.  In that situation, owners would still get their increase, but at a high cost both to  the owners and to the city, and at that point, the owners no longer have any incentive to  negotiate with the city.  These owners have also made assurances that their next increase, because I know that that's  been a concern of many residents here, that they made assurances that their next increase  that they're looking for next year will mirror a lot of what the other owners in town have  done, which usually tops around 4 to 5 percent.  So, that's a good example.  That's what residents can rest assured and look forward to.  Rent control ordinances that have been brought up by this Council are expensive, and most  importantly, they're toxic to the community in which they're enacted.  They also don't work.  What does work is maintaining a positive and productive relationship with your housing  providers.  The City Council is to be commended for doing so so far.  The City of Chico is fortunate to have a caring and experienced park owners providing much-needed  housing here in our community.  We strongly urge the City to reject rent control and instead work directly with the industry  and with these park owners to resolve these issues as they come up.  We know that this is an emotional issue, but it's also a very complicated issue, and taking a vote  today that may feel good is something that can very easily send the City down a path that you can't  come back from.  So, thank you for your time.  Appreciate it.  Thank you.  Bryce Goldstein is our last speaker.  Good evening, Council.  I'm just here to speak in favor of rent stabilization for mobile home parks.  When I was growing up, my grandmother lived in a 55-plus mobile community in Redding on  a fixed income.  She was a widow, and I can't imagine if she had to deal in her ailing health and old age  on a fixed income with the uncertainty that her rent might keep going up by astronomical  amounts every year.  And I really feel for the people of Pleasant Valley Mobile Home Park and other parks in town  for having that uncertainty in their lives, especially when they are homeowners of these  mobile homes, but having to deal with astronomical rent increases.  And I do appreciate the work put in to negotiate the rent increase lower, and I think we just  really need to ensure that there's stabilization so that people can retire in stability in  these parks.  And as somebody, one of the speakers, I think that's a really important thing.  One of the speakers pointed out, you can't move most of the mobile homes in Chico despite  their name.  I feel that mobile home residents are kind of in this unique spot where, in a way, they're  trapped there.  If the rent increases, they can't really move, and the value of their home goes down as the  rent increases.  So they're losing money on their investment with these increases.  So I really hope that Council will take action towards stabilizing mobile home space rent.  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right.  Discussion from Council.  May I?  Mr. Winslow.  I don't like that we're here to debate this, but we hear that the City Council persuaded  the landlords to increase the rent by only 10 percent.  But it was the threat of taking urgent action that persuaded them to lower the rent increase.  So here we are, able to take thoughtful action now.  We hear that rent stabilization will discourage investment, but we don't want this kind of  investment.  This is a business model based on extracting our grandparents' disposal income and then  some.  We're hearing our elders are going without heat in the winter.  We hear that the landlords are paying property tax.  These landlords knew that they were going to pay more in property tax.  And what message does it send?  If we say that justifies any amount of rent increase, that their blood is yours for the  sucking.  So sometimes I feel very alone up here on the Council.  But I think this is one of those cases where you can tell that I'm not alone in the community,  and we've seen that.  Some of these people have said publicly that they're prepared to run a ballot initiative,  just like happened in Humboldt County and other places in order to approve this.  Chico is a majority renter city, and that's when we count all the folks here as homeowners.  So I think there's a really good chance that what we get by saying no to this is something  that we don't determine the content of.  So here we are, able to take thoughtful action, determine what's best for our community, exercise  our job as policymakers to solve the issue that we're presented with.  We can get something different.  And that's where I think we're at.  I think we should go forward with drafting our own ordinance and not just take what is  thrust upon us.  And I'll tell you that I'm good for several hundred signatures at least for that.  And we know you need about 5,800 to get it on the ballot.  All right.  So you understand, Mr. Winslow, maybe you don't understand that when a property owner  has an increase in cost, whether they knew it was coming or not, they're going to have  to pay for it or not.  So for example, at Pleasant Valley Mobile Home Park, that sewer system is 50 years old.  At some point, they're on septic.  At some point, that's going to need to be connected to the sewer.  The hookup fees are $180,000.  Just the hookup fees, much less the work.  So the courts have ruled that the property owners who have rights to have the right to  be reimbursed for their costs.  That's point number one.  And so the rent increases that happened over the last three years, if there had been rent  control in place, it would have happened anyway.  So I mean, rent stabilization is a misnomer.  It doesn't mean that your rent's going to stop at where it is and never go up again.  That's not how it works.  Again, no comment from the public at this time.  We had public comment.  We're now having council comment.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I'm done.  Okay.  All right.  I have something to say too.  Go ahead.  As we are all aware, we do have rent increase limits on apartments, which is 5% plus CPI  up to 10%.  And I totally understand where, when it comes to buying a property, I know there are two  two different asset classes, apartments and mobile homes.  When an investor is buying any asset,  they're going to look at how they can  recoup their investment back.  So that doesn't mean that since California passed  that rent control, is not the right word,  but limited rent increase,  the sale of the apartments didn't stop.  But the investors became more careful  on how much they are going to pay to acquire a property.  And I think that could be applied to the home,  mobile home parts as well.  These people, unlike the apartment owner,  people who rent apartments have an ability to leave,  they don't.  And they have made considerable investments  in the mobile home parks in which they are living,  in these mobile home parks.  And I believe that they should have a little  but more peace-of-mind than an apartment-owner  who can just get up and move any day they want.  And I totally understand, you know,  everybody makes improvements to their property as they go,  but property-owners usually get to write them  as a depreciation down-the-line.  But on the other hand,  it all comes back to you, you know, you pay it, history,  and all that stuff, but my thinking,  I would like to actually see, you know,  that what options do we have legally?  You know, most of the times when an issue like this comes up,  it's between a tenant, if,  I see that in the staff report,  it talked about significant cost and staff  and this and that, but I'm,  and this is my understanding,  and you can please address on that.  So if there is an issue, let's say we pass an ordinance,  and a park owner does not  comply with it and makes an interest increase more than  what is, what happens in that case?  What is the city's role?  Or is it just that that particular homeowners  can go to the court and file a case against them?  What is our role in that situation?  Well, council under that scenario,  the city would have a code enforcement role  to either either either either either  either either either either either either either either  either either either either either either either either  either either either either either either either either  either either either either either either either either  either either either either either either either either  either either either either either either either  either either either either either either  either either either either either either  either either either either either either  either either either either either either  either either either either either either either  either either either either either either either either either  either either either either either either either either either  rights once the city adopts an ordinance there's various options to decide from  each case will be different but typically the City Council their city  will implement the ordinance the ordinance will have various remedies  such as court action fines penalties things like that so that there's just  different ways of addressing it depending on what we end up drafting so  I would like to probably make I don't know if anybody has had something to say  but I would like to make a motion to see what our options are what are the risks  to the city to do an ordinance or not do an ordinance and to see the lot of  cities who have done what are their experiences after passing the ordinances  just to do some research on that just to get clarification when you say what are  those the risks  the ordinance is is legal depending on how you draft it and it is a viable type  of regulation which many cities throughout the state have so from a  legal standpoint I think it depends on what we put in there I believe you said  there are different options so maybe you can explain those options well the  options I thought I was responding to was relating to what kind of remedies in  case someone violates the ordinance so there are  various options for that yes okay so does that motion stand are you I think it  does yeah so if there are no risks we could do it but I would like to see that  and I'm not sure if that's something will happen who will need to do that  research on the you know legally we could draft an ordinance if we choose to  is that correct correct so I guess I would like to know what are the  experiences of the other cities for the city to do that so I would like to know  history history history history history history history history history history history Because I think cost is one of the bigger things that we are hearing in the staff report, that it's going to be really costly to do it. Do you want staff to bring that back? Yes.  or me, so.  Council Member Bennett. Yes.  So.  Well, hold on a second.  So officially, so that was a motion, correct?  Yes. Okay.  So we have a motion, do we have a second?  Did you second it, Addison?  No, I definitely would, trust me.  But I think, just wanna be sure,  like exactly what you're asking,  we're gonna come back with a staff report  that's going to have some research  into what options we have  and a little bit of experiences with others.  Because here it looks like the biggest concern  I see in the staff report is about costs and liabilities.  Upfront staff costs, study,  I just wanna know how much does it actually cost  and what other cities have actually costed them  moving forward to implement that ordinance.  Yeah, okay.  I just wanna be clear that what the direction  we're giving for staff report,  is gonna be the most useful for us moving forward.  Right.  We're looking for-  If you wanna make an amendment,  I'm happy to listen to that too.  Yeah, I could say just more generally for staff  to bring back a staff report with some research to aid us  in moving forward with an ordinance,  as well as a survey of options of what specific elements  of an ordinance we would have to have in place.  Things like the amount of rent increase allowable,  vacancy control, the appeals process for an increase  in excess of what's normally allowable.  I mean, if we are going to do a...  If we are going to set, most likely set up a percentage-  Okay, so motion, second.  Let's get this down.  So you made a motion, are you seconding?  So it was like an amendment to kind of refine the-  He gave you an amendment, do you accept the amendment?  Okay, so we have a motion and a second.  Madam Clerk, unless there's further discussion,  Mr. Bennett, sorry.  Yeah.  Let's do Mr. Bennett's discussion,  and then move forward.  We'll move to motion.  So, I believe that the path which Councilmember Tandon  is going down is exactly where I was going to recommend,  which is we need more information.  We have this excellent report, thank you, City Manager,  on a lot of information about how this might play out.  And there's some very expensive city obligations,  and I think that's something that we need to take  into consideration.  There's a lot of information here.  I, for one, need more information.  We've listened to Commissioner Wall, thank you for showing up,  thank you for speaking, I hear you.  And Mr. Landano, I hear you as well.  And I keep coming back to the same box of,  we need more information, we don't have enough information  to really move forward.  For me, and I'll speak for myself,  I do not have enough information to move forward.  I don't have enough information to make any kind of decision  about rent control.  You can label it whatever you want, but it is rent control.  There will be an entity determining how, when,  and to what extent rent is changing.  So that is rent control.  I support all of you.  I can't imagine what it would be like to be in a position  where you're worried about next year, next month,  as far as your living situation.  So I've listened, I attended the first meeting  at Pleasant Valley.  I still remember everything that was discussed at that time.  So I want to be able to assist you,  but I need to be able to make a decision that is right  for the City of Chico and for all the citizens,  as well as you.  So we need, I'm gonna go back and repeat myself,  which I hate to do, I hate, but we need more information.  And I do support Councilor Tandon's motion  to gain more information from city staff  and from our legal adviser.  That is all I have to say.  All right, Mr. Morgan.  Thank you, Mayor.  I'm gonna support that motion for more information,  but I also, Dale, want to tell you that in every economy,  since the beginning of time,  price controls lead to rationing, every single time.  The best way to allow for more affordable housing is to allow the building of more housing  Price controls in the rental market will guarantee less rentals are built not more  Price controls are a short-term solution that will create far greater  consequences and a council that is not us is gonna sit here and try to decide who gets to live in spaces and not and  That's what we'll end up being doing, but I'm all for getting more information  All right further comments madam clerk  I apologize. So I have the original motion from councilmember Tandon to  Asking for what are the options risk what other cities and including the associated cost?  For implementation and their experiences and have staff come back with that information councilmember Winslow seconded the motion  Indicating bring with an amendment bring back a staff report to that would include information help council move forward  Including there were two items and appeals process and I didn't get those two  I  was wondering if you could give us a little bit more detail on the two items that you had vacancy control and the  allowable rent increases to usually some CPI or some proportion thereof, okay and  appeals process was  Anything else on that that I might have missed  Appeals process they can see control. No, I got that and then the allowable rent allowable rent increase  Okay, so there is a motion in a second  And  Do you want me to call for the vote?  And so I type this in I apologize  Council member Bennett, yes  Council member Morgan council member Tandon council member Van Overbeck. Yes  Council member Winslow. Yes, vice mayor Reynolds  mayor Coolidge  Carry 7-0  All right  Thank you. No applause, please  Again that I said been getting in the meeting. We don't applaud  All right moving on to item 5.5 consideration of mayor Coolidge's request. That would be me  report so  The report  So  We will  the idea here is  every other meeting three or four councilors  Members get to make a report about what's going on in their district about what they are  Attending what their committees limited the three minutes they could certainly do it under their right to go  in front of us under as a member of the public, I think we  Should and give each other three minutes. I think it should absolutely be limited to three minutes with the timer rolling  Other boards and commissions and councils and boards  Supervisors do this with some success. I do think the rules are important so questions  Speakers  We have one James Hutchinson  Three minutes ! That's a wonderful proposal, Mr. Chair, except for one thing. I don't have a district representative. And the reason I don't have a district representative, as you all know, is that I haven't been able to vote for a district representative in the last two elections.  history And you did it in such a way that it's a total distortion of the districts should be.  history  history  history  of the districts should be.  Even the person that's supposed to be  our district representative  didn't support us.  Didn't say, hey, this isn't right.  You didn't say this isn't right.  So you're going to have  somebody out there speaking, claiming to be  of my district. It's not.  Because I didn't have a chance to vote.  If I don't have a chance to vote,  they're not of my district.  Mr. Mayor, does this relate to the item?  Does this relate to what I'm saying here?  Yes, it does, if you allow me to complete  my comments instead of rudely  interrupting me.  And you did rudely  interrupt me.  I'm talking about, you're having  discussions talking about a district.  I'm talking about a black district  representative. It is  totally relevant to what you're talking  about. To have a person talking  about a district  doesn't exist because we don't have one.  We didn't have the choice to have one.  We didn't have a choice of district.  And you are rudely, once again,  interrupting me. And I'm asking you  to dismiss this man. Get him off the table.  He's obviously not rational.  He doesn't want to deal with facts.  I've made it clear.  Okay. We're not doing personal attacks.  Thank you.  Yeah, he just did. He just attacked.  He just attacked what I was saying.  We're also doing conversation back and forth.  Thank you.  If you'd like the rest of your time, you can have it.  If not...  Let's use it.  You're talking about  a political year  when we're having an election.  And you're talking about these people  talking about what's going  to the council's report for future  agenda. They haven't talked to us  about it.  In the past, suddenly, during  the election year, you want to put  that on the table, which is  nothing more than promoting their election.  Each of these people up here  would be promoting their own  agenda. What they want,  on the table. That's not a meeting  but us to choose an agenda.  That's your agenda.  You know,  as a representative for a government,  some people here in this council  believe that they're elected because  their view  is the view that their constituents  want, not  that it's the constituents' view.  I'm a believer that it's  the constituents' view that's important  here, and it's not happening.  Thank you.  That was our last only speaker.  All right. Discussion.  Ms. Morgan.  Okay.  A little historical perspective.  Much like when we talked about rent control,  what happens to the economy,  it takes a long time to figure out  the repercussions. So I appreciate  Andrew's request. I believe his heart  is in the right place. That said,  there's a number of problems with this proposal.  First and foremost, it allows and encourages political  grants to be made. It's not a  history thing either.  Every other meeting, a council member will get three minutes to talk about how good they are.  It risks becoming an endless game of look at me, look what I did, I'm busy, I'm better.  That's what campaigning is for, and this dais is not the place for everyone to try and out-talk everyone else.  We have enough political theater already.  That's what newsletters, social media, and outreach are for, and if someone isn't good at that, that's a different problem.  The dais shouldn't be used to stroke our egos or create sound bites for the media.  In addition, who's going to hold a council member to three minutes?  We can't even seem to address normal agenda items in any kind of orderly fashion.  What happens when we're attempting to outperform one another?  Furthermore, we're elected to districts but serve and make policy for the entire city.  Creating district updates creates confusion and drives division.  We just witnessed this on the President's State of the Union Address,  which is designed to educate the public on the actual state of the union,  but most recently was used to disparage not only a political opponent but an entire faction of Americans.  You think that can't happen on the dais?  District 1 has no homeless encampments, zero cannabis dispensaries, and some of Chico's best roads.  See what I just did there?  Henry David Thoreau said government governs best that governs least.  He didn't mention self-indulgence.  This proposal adds talking but no solutions to anything.  If the government is needed to solve a problem, something must be seriously wrong,  as we heard earlier on rent control.  A mechanism for council solutions already exists.  It's called council member requests.  I would venture to say it's already overused.  31 requests in 2023 alone.  How is staff supposed to get anything done when we keep reprioritizing their priorities?  More talking will do little but add to the length of our meetings.  This is bad, ego-driven, look-at-me policy, and the public will know better.  A more progressive council will try this once and stop doing it after exactly one meeting.  We make enough mistakes on our own without repeating those of the past.  I will vote no on this proposition.  All right.  It doesn't seem to me that there are any lack of opportunities for council members to express their views  as we currently run the meetings, and so I too will vote no on this.  I think it's a waste of time.  Vice Mayor?  I'd just like to clarify that if we are serving on a committee and want to give a report on that,  currently as our APMP stand, or is it only committee things that we can talk about under that,  or if we want to make a statement, and then could you also review?  Because I do find it frustrating sometimes when there is an accusation made,  or what was the number of deaths that were quoted,  all of a sudden 143 incidents turned into 143 deaths, but it is actually only three deaths.  That's a big number.  You want to correct that, but you don't want to ban it.  So, Ms. Preston?  Could you remind us of kind of what our roles are and what we're allowed to do and not allowed to do?  So, under reports and communications, a section was added to indicate council member committee and agency reports.  This section is included on the second meeting of the month's agenda  and is to be used by council members for the reporting out of their assigned committee or agency actions,  which were more related at that time that this was created,  was to the mayor's appointments, to the committee's appointments,  to the agencies that you serve on, to the agencies that you report out on.  In case something was happening at BCAG, you would be able to bring that back until the full council.  That was what it started out as.  It didn't end up being that, and so it was not, I was asked to not include that anymore.  Gotcha.  But it still exists.  By the time I'm 90, I think we're going to have a train that gets from Chico to Sacramento, by the way.  I'm not sure about that.  Anyways.  I used to serve on BCAG.  Okay.  Thank you for that, and I appreciate the update.  So a certain newspaper said that I would be the one most to benefit from this,  but I agree with council member Morgan.  See, I run a social media.  I run a social media.  I got the, I got people from the TV news calling me.  I mean, like, I actually,  I mean, I, I, generally, I might have more opportunity than anybody else to share the kind of things that I got going on.  I do.  I think that's part of my job.  We are getting paid, you recall now, like, kind of actual money.  So I think we do have work to do.  We got paid before.  Yeah.  Well, not that much, but now it allows, it allows me to commit more time.  So, like, just this weekend, last weekend, I went to, I went to a conference with an organization called Civic Well.  The city of Chico hosts a Civic Spark fellow in the planning division from this.  And, and I got to interact.  I got to interact with all kinds of great elected officials.  I learned a whole lot.  There were technical things.  A lot of it had to do with community choice aggregates.  And I'm thinking, like, who even is on our community choice aggregate board?  There's like a, I think it might be like the second alternate or something on that, if that exists.  Dale.  I, I don't know what goes on in these committees.  I got to be honest to you.  I got to dig it up.  Sometimes I sit in on, on BCAG meetings.  But, like, the rest of you probably didn't even know.  I'm the vice chair of the Butte County Air Quality Management District Board.  Did any of you know that?  Okay, two.  So.  This is all your fault for that error.  So.  I chaired, I chaired that for four years.  I saw that warning you again.  What you're seeing right now.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  It's, I think within three minutes.  There are valuable things that we have to share.  We're, we're doing important jobs.  And I think that Chico deserves representatives who are proactive.  And it allows us to just, just share those things.  Because it is meaningful.  If, if it's grandstanding to say, like, hey, I'm doing this work on behalf of my community.  Then, like, let there be grandstanding.  Because I think we should be encouraged to be.  And, and we also can hold each other to times if that's really necessary.  I think it's kind of juvenile.  You can always vote two-thirds to shut up anybody at any time.  That's within our rules.  Call a question.  So moved.  And, and, you know, it's, yeah, it would be embarrassing if somebody were to go on so long that five of the other council members decide to shut them up.  I think that's a checks and balances we have.  And it's valuable for us to be able to share information.  It's once every two weeks.  All right.  Yeah, you just made my point.  Thank you.  Okay.  Further comment before I comment?  Go ahead.  I really wanted to support the mayor's, I thought this was a good idea until I listened to Council Member Morgan.  But you haven't listened to everybody yet.  So I think it probably be best to perhaps share.  I think we can try to get some of the comments shy away from this at this time.  Although, again, I would like to support the mayor.  But this doesn't feel right right now.  That's my only comment.  Okay.  Now I'm going to take my turn.  That's okay.  I did this because I felt it was a suggestion that someone in the back of the room over there, he knows who he is, actually talked about with me.  And it actually made a lot of sense.  It makes so much sense that almost every single governing body in the entire country, city councils, boards, supervisors, allow for it.  Mr. Morgan?  Yes.  Thank you.  So the other thing is in terms of commenting on VCAC, I served on that committee for four years because I don't watch it and I can't.  I have no idea what's happening.  This council has no idea what's happening or what we need to do to move it forward.  You have no idea how much money they're taking from us.  And trust me, it's a lot.  You have no idea how much percentage of funds that we're paying, which happen to be more than every single other city, including the county.  You don't know that because we don't have reports.  Because when I served on it, I couldn't tell my council.  VCAC, in that particular instance, was not necessarily treating the city of Chico fairly.  Or that if you look at it, there's something that we need to look into.  So unless you agendize that, and hopefully get the support of three other people, there's nowhere to talk about it.  So I agree with Mr. Morgan.  There's social media, which is a mess.  And I'd prefer not to be on.  And I think it serves our community better not to be on it.  The other thing is that we do have individual districts now, like it or not.  I will say this because I can't at this time.  The reason why some people are left out of districts happens to do with the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of the United States.  And not necessarily what this council has done.  We have to redistrict every ten years.  But we really, you know, we could go down and talk for three minutes if we wanted in public comment.  It's certainly allowed.  I don't see what the harm is in having us talk.  Anyway.  I'll make the motion.  I'll make the motion.  You made the motion.  I did.  Yeah.  I have three minutes.  I'll make the motion.  I didn't hear exactly what it was.  But I'll second it.  All right.  So would that be just to add, to open up the item that already exists in the policy to talk about your districts or anything else that you would like to bring forward?  Or do you want to leave it as Councilmember Committee agency reports?  Yes.  Because it is on there.  Well, the original idea was three minutes as a district or committee.  Okay.  And that's why I was saying do you want to add districts to the policy?  Or do you want to even mess with AP and P-1010?  I am bringing it back at the next meeting for some minor modifications.  But if you want me to throw that in there.  It's easier when we have new Councilmembers to go over the process and to tell them their avenues of speaking or doing whatever.  If it's contained in this policy.  So, but I'll leave it up to the Council to decide.  I'm amenable in either way.  I mean, I'll do that.  I'll make a substitute motion that we just don't do this.  Okay.  So then it'll be really clear.  I don't know who's laughing out there, but let's not.  Okay.  So.  Someone's laughing every 10 seconds.  Yeah.  Okay.  So was there.  So the motion to the mayor.  Did you second the motion?  No, you didn't.  Okay.  So there wasn't.  You did.  Okay.  Thank you.  I mean, that was a substitute.  Can the clerk please restate the motion?  Well, I'm still on the very first one that was then a substitute motion.  I think we're about to amend the original motion.  So if did the original motion get a second because it.  Yes.  Okay.  And it was Councilmember Winslow.  Yes.  Okay.  But now there's a substitute motion.  Right.  Okay.  I think it's a little .  I just have to get that one in.  I think we're about to amend the original motion.  Yeah.  Let's amend it if in fact we need to.  Okay.  So we have a substitute motion.  Yes.  That was made by.  That was made by Mr. Warren.  And what is the substitute motion?  To leave the policy to wait in.  To just not move forward.  To leave the policy to wait in.  Yeah.  But.  I'm sorry.  I didn't catch you made the motion when.  I'm sorry.  Mr. Morgan made the motion.  Okay.  Thank you.  And Vice Mayor Reynolds.  I apologize not being able to catch that.  Councilmember Bennett.  Yes.  This is on the substitute motion to not move forward.  Councilmember Morgan.  Yes.  Councilmember Tandon.  Yes.  Councilmember Van Overbeck.  Yes.  Councilmember Winslow.  No.  Vice Mayor Reynolds.  Yes.  Mayor Coolidge.  No.  It carries 5-2.  So there would be no action to take.  Okay.  All right.  So with that, we'll go to Councilmember.  Oh, sorry.  Reports and communications.  Not from Councilmembers.  City Manager report.  No report.  All right.  6.2.  Internal Affairs Committee.  We'll go on for 20 minutes.  Report regarding downtown Chico Complete Streets Improvement Project consideration.  We received and filed that.  So Councilmember requests for number 24.  Okay.  No.  That was 23.  23 and 23.  That's pretty impressive.  No.  I called the Master Chief to go through it.  All right.  That will do it.  No Councilmember requests.  We will adjourn.  Thank you.  Sorry, Evan.  Thanks, guys.
