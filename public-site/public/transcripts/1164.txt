I think you summed it up quite nicely. I will add a couple things. one is this will be a school that they may have a small dome tent but generally it' s a year-round school just like brian key hose. also they will have liability insurance so it will just be a continuation and mr. key hose is staying on as an instructor. he plans to retire sooner or later but this is a transition. we will have to wait and see. thank you. thank you. would you like to come up and say anything? have anything to add? you don' t have to. thank you guys and thank you linda for speaking with us. brian is absolutely signed on he is going to be our first teacher and so is tracy and kaya who have been working for him. they know the lay of the land and they know the respect that is offered and they will be teaching us so as we go forward in the years we will treat it well. thank you for considering this. do commissioners have questions or comments? with the 1230 end time it wasn' t clear if lunch was included did the students eat lunch out there? yes. actually no this is no lunch so there will be a lunch break and then we will have snacks if families have snacks brought with the children but it will not be lunch included. no foods. any other questions? commissioner blatchley. how many children are in each class would there be and I' m not familiar with your classroom or your school so is this a public or charter school? it is it' s a charter school. s a state funded public charter school. we' re very small right now but there' s going to be 14 hopefully right now we have 12 kids signed up. we' re looking to add two more so 14 max on any day. so 14 total every day. thank you. this is a question directed at being that the application in the description here it just notes that the school takes place at the five mile and various other places in the park is there some attention given to our maintenance people doing a pre-check to make sure the area is safe and conducive to the children? yes. we do have a five mile park and they do primarily stay there but they may take some excursions a little further away and I don' t know if they have the same ideas but I wanted to make it inclusive in case they did want to do any activities in other parts of the billboard park but we always check it it would be just like a reservation that we check also. actually Mr. Keough is really good about picking up trash and doing stuff himself too. just kind of a thought for you guys at one mile just last week there was a class going on and it was close to the bathrooms which are now kind of there's an encampment there and there was a lot of screaming and they had to move on so I would just suggest you kind of keep you know the park office knowledgeable every place you are so they can kind of scout it out first because especially with young young young children seems to make sense otherwise that was great so thank you. thank you. any other questions or concerns? no? are we open to a motion? yes I' ll make a motion to approve item 6.1. I second. thank you. thank you. commissioner blashly? yes. commissioner glatz? yes. commissioner scherer? yes. vice chair naba? yes. we' re now at item 6.3 on the agenda reconsideration of a request. actually we have another one. did I miss it? 6.2 sorry. 6.2 special use permit to hold a mighty oak nature to hold mighty oak nature classes at cedar grove area and other bidwell park locations from august 2024 to may 2025. daniel hawk from mighty oak nature classes is the applicant and requests a special use permit to hold nature classes for children ages 3 to 5 in the cedar grove area and various other locations in bidwell park. the classes will be held monday through friday from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. during the academic school year from august 2024 through may 2025. we have a report from linda herman our park and natural resources manager. yes this is going to be a very similar program to the one we had in the past. state of california that is targeting children from 3 to 5. it is targeting children a little younger from 3 to 5. it is more of an open classroom i believe and mr. hawk is here and he can explain that a little better. it is in cedar grove and not 5 mile. we also had the tinker garden if you remember some years ago in that same area and there didn't seem different experience and also very similar to what the wildflower open classroom is doing but again he is trying to hit a couple of younger level kids and also just being a little different style in a classroom teaching environment. did i say that right? okay. would you like to come up and address the commission? sure. hello thank you for having me here. this is going to sound quite similar to what bethany just presented. it is my daughter right now is in bryan's happy acres forest school. so this is kind of continuing with that tradition but it is filling a different niche than what wildflower is doing. as linda mentioned it is open to younger kids and it is also open for excuse me 2 to 5 days per school year. coming in for a week which their school is monday to friday. so for our school especially with some of the younger kids just 2 or 3 days makes a lot more sense. has more flexibility. we have been working together quite a bit. some kids are ready to roll to the wildflower school and commit to that. some families aren't ready for that so it is more just kind of flexibility or there is different we have a full enrollment because I have been waiting for your all approval but I have been doing preliminary signups and have a full program. I think that shows there is a need in the community. happy to answer any questions you guys might have. if I may add it would be a similar class size 12 to 14 also. similar class size as the other one. classroom size and a good classroom size and a good teacher to student ratio which will help us keep a monitor of safety of the kids which is our top priority. as brian does I have been working closely with brian to learn his style as well. he has been mentoring me throughout the year. I would plan on I live actually right next to cedar grove I just moved there so it would be pretty every day doing a full sweep of the area making sure there is any dangers alerting park officials police anybody I need to as well as establishing a presence there and being good stewards of the area and teaching the kids the same hopefully. any questions or comments? commissioner blatchley. I apologize I don' t know much about these schools. there or do you have a location that you go and then you' re going to bring the children out to this site? the proposal is to meet in the cedar grove area so like three mile in the park and it would be open classroom so no set indoor facility or anything like that. it' s in the german forest school philosophy. the idea is just very child led getting kids it' s simple and complex at the same time but it' s really just getting kids out in nature as much as possible and to develop their own relationship to nature social skills all of that at their own pace and really setting them up in a safe and monitored environment where they can take risks and just kind of be comfortable and be able to develop confidence and I could talk for quite a while but I' ll keep it brief. would parents bring these children out to you for this classes and then the parents would take them back is that? yeah parents are welcome to stay and hang out but generally the concept is to drop them with us we' ll have three teachers there for the 12 kids and then yeah it' s kind of an open preschool. thank you. yeah of course. is yours also rain or shine? yes yes and similar to wildflower we would probably put up some kind of temporary shelter in case of heavy rain but yeah that' s part of the beauty of it is just really getting the kids used to what brian often says and some people in this field say is there' s no such thing as bad weather there' s only bad clothing. so really getting the kids prepared and offering a dry space and space but my daughter' s never gone in the dry space she' s just always in her wool layer her rain gear and she' s just happy as can be splashing around. yeah I was also wondering I know you have a leave no trace philosophy and I' m sure that' s something you drill into the children but I asked about lunch before because there can be a lot of small pieces of trash with young children and so it seems like yours probably includes lunch and a snack so just kind of reiterating that point. to keep the area clean. absolutely yeah thank you for that one thing that again brian did that I will look to carry on is encouraging not bringing packaged food like not high sugar stuff but also just not packaged food so really like reusable containers homemade stuff just really kind of getting kids in that culture early so I think we do the same but we definitely put a big emphasis on keeping that place you know spick and span oh I think that' ideally better than it is now. great well I looked into the happy acre school for one of my kids and it didn' t work out but I' m glad to see two of them happening with different family focuses. good luck. thank you I appreciate it. commissioner glatz. I have a couple questions for linda. I guess you can hang there for a second I think the charter school is not being charged I guess that' s the state thing. it seems are we opening up the park to free daycare centers and teaching? it seems like it' s sounding negative but like a free rent kind of situation shouldn' t there be some sort of a permit fee or something involved to help the park? that' s certainly the commission' s prerogative they' re not asking for exclusive use of the area I think I forgot to mention that so we use the only charge if they want exclusive use we have many many classes and people who use the park for various different things so it is a hard one to where do you draw that line as far as and where we it' s easiest is when they' re asking for exclusive use of a facility and they' re asking for our services whether it' s electricity or water or other services is kind of where we have to go. when people come back from experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience are they asking for exclusive use and are they asking for any type of city services or electricity or water etc well this sounds like a two to three days a week four days a week for six months so it's a little different than yes but it was not any different than tinker garden they were charging as well if you recall tinker garden was charging as well if you recall it just happens that and and i think keyhole charge is also correct this just happens to be the first time we've had a public school offering this for free all everybody else has had these programs has charged some sort of fee for these programs and you will carry some type of insurance i see that um it's required but that no one from the city has received your certificate of insurance we wanted to get this approved approval first before we do that that's part of the process as it goes forward okay if it goes forward yeah i'd be sure to be yeah amply covered that would be a huge focus of mine to make sure yeah okay so the other well just to beat a dead horse so where do we draw a line between having free daycare space in the park if you don't reserve a space or am i just overthinking it i mean providing experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience community is a great thing for the community and I think this is a great thing for the community and I think they' re low impact on the area and they' re not requesting exclusive use. I don' t think fees are necessary. I will just add that we do have code sections and I think I should have said this before we' ve used the rationale also that if it' s a card or another government agency or someone who' s of a benefit to the park we have also weighed fees for the park and we have fees for the stewards of the park and so I think that was a decision that was made in the past is that it' s helping us keep the park and keep the right type of activities in the park and teaching children how to appreciate the park in the future. I' m not saying no at all here I' m just having a conversation about where does it go. I' m just providing additional information. I' m going to suggest we do a s going on. s my point. we talk a lot about precedent and it' s not just this group but there' re lots of different groups that use the park so maybe someone will come and say this park is there every day why aren' t they be charged a fee they' re there for hours. I understand commissioner glatz' s point that he' s making. That' s the beauty of this park it' s used by so many different people but some of these people are showing up every day they have their walking groups that meet their running club their. mountain biking. yes and so I think you' re placing this group in that category it seems more of an informal meeting group it doesn' t quite seem to fit in my opinion although I wish I' d put my two children in the park but I think it' s a great opportunity for them to appreciate nature and not just to appreciate it but to dive in and to be our stewards of the future. But I do see commissioner glatz' s point. And so what if someone does want to come and share that cedar grove space with you? I mean these are small children you can' t point to the fact that hey we' ve got this reserve we' re paying for the reservation of this spot that maybe is also a concern you can' t necessarily ask other people to leave under this kind of a use permit could you? no not under the idea that it' s not exclusive use. but if they were being disruptive I think they could ask them to do but they didn' t have to leave but if they were being really destructive they could just say hey we' re trying to have a class here and we' t mind if we move or they move because they can go to another part of the bibble park. well that' s easy enough to say but 12 three-year-olds that' s hurting cats a little bit. Adorable little cats but it' s nice for them to have that safe space every day. I mean that' s part of it too. It' s nature but this is your space in nature. So I don' t know. yeah if I may. I think that' I think part of the vision here and the way that brian has successfully done this for seven years has just been really to establish a good relationship in the area and a presence there. And it' s not that people don' t come through the area while he' s holding class. I' m sure they would do the same in cedar grove. But our main focus is keeping the kids safe and having a good relationship with the community. So if we needed to if other people wanted to share the space we could be flexible and It' s a large area. It is like herding cats but that is what we' re signing up for. So yeah I mean I definitely I mean a lot of this discussion sounds like it' s you know amongst you all and I' l respect anything you guys come up with or I' m happy to give input. But from my perspective at least at this point in time I think it' s quite workable. You know I' m in that area all the time with my kids. From what I' ve seen I think it' s quite workable. And we could share the space however needed. That' s what I' d say. No I wasn' t even suggesting any changes right now. It was just more about me having an open conversation about thoughts that may happen never happen but all of a sudden if you have 20 groups and each you know it' s 200 people 10 people you know it just becomes a bigger a bigger thing that' s something we can address in the future. So I' m going to be quiet right now and see if anybody wants to make a motion or have any further comments. Okay. I' I just want to say that I admire what you' re doing. I used to do have a daycare and we had a huge nature component and it was a very popular and large part of the day. And honestly being a park neighbor I appreciate what you' re doing about the stewardship. That' s really important to me and our family. And I believe my kids are very excellent stewards of the park as well because they did spend so much time in it and can appreciate it. So I think this will actually offset any fees we would charge I totally do understand the point as well but I mean honestly it' ll pay dividends and I appreciated how you added you' ll probably actually end up leaving it cleaner than what you find it. Thank you for that. Absolutely. And this comes from my 30 years experience in law enforcement working parks. You' re going to have 14 3 to 5 year olds in this area and it' s not going to be exclusive to you so just know that there are some undesirable people that will be in that same area and that' s just something for you to notice and have enough staff to just monitor the perimeters of those children. Yeah I appreciate that point it' s taken it' s definitely a big focus of mine the main focus honestly starting up would be safety of the kids and awareness of the surroundings. Any other comments or questions? I move that we approve the conditional permit. I second. So we have a first commissioner shear and a second by vice chair nava. Commissioner blashly. Yes. Commissioner glatz. Yes. Commissioner shear. Yes. Vice chair nava. Yes. And chair thomas petty. Yes. Thank you. Thank you for being here and thank you for putting forth this cool program and good luck. Thank you all so much I appreciate it. Item 6.3 reconsideration of a request from the chico rod and gun club to close parking lot d and upper bidwell park to public vehicles. At its january 29th 2024 meeting the bidwell park and playground commission approved a request from the chico rod and gun club to install gates at the club' s leased parking lot area lot d and upper bidwell park to limit public nonmember vehicle parking except during the required public use periods and events. The park and natural resources manager is proposing a possible alternative to closing the lot to vehicles for the commission' s consideration. And we have a report from linda herman. thank you chair. I' ve been working with the group the club which has been very helpful and we' ve been talking about different alternatives to as we talked at the january meeting the loss of parking is a concern for us for the public because we already have a lot of public using it with very little parking as it is. We' ve been discussing it and james is here with the club as well and we' ve been trying to come up with a solution. As you recall part of the reason they wanted to gate the lot d was because of the damages they were receiving from vehicles and the amount of gravel being kicked up and the amount of parking and damaging their building etc. That was one of their concerns and also having available parking for their members at times and that was the two concerns I recall. So we had to talk and I said what if we paid the lot because then you wouldn' t have the problem with the gravel being in constant maintenance which would help us as well because we' re constantly going in and having to regrade those parking lots. My field supervisor wants all of them paid one day and maybe s probably going to happen. We just paid lot A. So I got to talking about that and I said what if we were able to provide designated parking for your members only, sign it so that it' s enforceable, it' s up against the building, it provides you enough to have that constant parking available to whenever you were having your classes because I know their schedule changes and things come up and events come up. But it also would give them the opportunity to close the lot if they were having a large event we would be able to get them to So we would be open to that as well like we do with hooked on fishing and some of these other groups that bring in. We could if they had a special event for a certain time we could allow them to close it off for that one large event. And then also for consideration of my request is they would also like to protect and I believe that' s your leach field right where the bollards. They would like to put bollards in that little section next to the building there. That' s where their leach, their septic area is. And we would like to keep, they like to keep vehicles out of there but sometimes they would come back when they come back back when they come back back back when they come back back back when they come back back back when they come back back back when they come back back back when they come back back back when they come back back back when they come back back back when they come back back back when they come back back back when they come back back back when they come back back back when they come back back back when they come back back back when they come back back back when they come back back back when they come back back lot of parking on the flat we looked at just the proper in the lease area but I think if we were up there paving we might as well pave the other section that was going to be our parking anyway that corner that is closest to lot e. I' m sorry we should have had the flat up I apologize. Forget about the granite because no packets we are learning. That' s what they' re proposing they do would like to see it done particularly so they are wanting to try to put some sort of timelines on this to move it along so they would like it to be paid by January 2025 and if not they would like to at least put in a temporary fence and if it still wasn' t paid by June or July of 2025 then they would ask that it be permanent they would request that it be permanent but we talked to the city of And he' s here too. Mike slattery our public works manager and I think we can make that timeline but I understand they want to make sure this doesn' t get lost and put away and other things become a higher priority for our department so I completely understand the need to request that in the future if needed. That' s pretty much my report unless james has anything you want to add? that I think we could narrow it down and I said working talking to staff and realizing that the exclusive loose use area we could narrow it down and if we did have a bigger event we would just put a request in for an event request to use our area the whole thing. But I think with the public realizing that we' re coming along in the future to start charging for use of the park and stuff like this and then all of a sudden we have this fence that' we have this fence that we have to make it a guest area and it would be better for I think park, the community, the gun club and stuff like that to show that of course they will still have a place to go and it' s not to be charged for a place to go see gates. Linda did mention that's actually where our septic tank is so it would be the southeast corner of the building and you can see where that little gravel area heads back to Horseshoe Lake. That would be paved because that is our septic tank and we found it the other day and realized that waste management parks their 20 ton truck on top of our septic tank every day to eat lunch. So yeah, it's just we've got law of averages. Someone's going to fall on something. Sorry, he can come back to come come back to come back to come back come back come back come back come come back come back come back come back come back come back come back come back come back come back come back come back come back come back come back come back come back come back public were staged in that area they'd be protected behind those bollards too. One statement about staff mentioned that it would be signed and endorsed we would like to sign it but we'll go there if people are parking there and maybe start off with some notes hey just to let you know we plan on having an open house I think it's you know see the club again do the history and just get the word out there that these are parking spaces for the club. We don't plan on cars on date though. So we want to inform people first. And I think did we, that was going to be all the time because I know originally you were talking about just during when you're not having your events this is the difference is this would be all the time no parking but we're only talking 12. We're talking about 13 spaces one ADA and one in 12 regular. Where before I think we were looking at much more parking taken away. And I think. Welcome back. If that ADA isn't allowed to be used outside we would provide another ADA space. Do we have any questions? I know vice chair not on the call. I think we have a question. Go ahead. Thank you. First I will direct to city staff do we have a fiscal impact analysis yet that we could at least have a ballpark on what we're looking at here? I anticipated that would be asked. We just paid lot A and I think the estimated cost was about less than 30,000. But that's materials primarily and that's because we're doing the work too. If we were to hire it out it would be more. Of course, we would come back with experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience Yeah. Not a question, just a comment. I just want to say thank you, Linda, for going back with the Rod and Gun Club and working through this. You know, at our last meeting, we really felt like there's a solution here we haven't hit on yet, and this is not the best way to kind of negotiate back and forth and say, what if we did this? You know, how important to you, how important is this to you? Can you give a little bit here and take a little bit there? And so I really appreciate you doing that with the Rod and Gun Club and reaching what sounds like a good solution. Yeah, I really appreciate the cooperation, too. They've been great. So, yeah. Really, I think this, I wish we thought of this, you know, because it is a great alternative. It's the alternative, I think, you know, that we do. This is true. But you can come anytime you want, you know. Any other questions, concerns? I do have one question. You said that instead of, you know, after this gets paved and you have your designated spots, you don't want to just start towing people that you would start leaving notes on cars. Well, I want to maybe suggest that you have a standardized printed up something. Yeah. And not just the person that is there that day goes and, you know, and fires off. We all have our different level of tolerance when it comes to people who aren't parking where they should. So as long as you had a standard note that you had to make, that would be great. I think you're going to just put right on the car that is official looking and it's... Oh, yeah. Okay. It would be like starting, I'm just going to throw a red thing. Starting July 30th, this enforcement will come back. Oh, good. We'll have the proper penal code for the vehicle code and the tow authority, the name of the tow company, and we have to resort to that. There'll be a sign on the entrance coming in from the parking lot and then the exit out will be another sign. Oh, my gosh. I love that. And we would also issue a press release, you know, and give a date, a 30-day date or something. As of this date, there will be no available parking against the building. Okay. Yeah, I just needed a little elaboration of the note situation. So, okay, that sounds like proper notice and... Handicap spot is off, so there's no notice on that. Oh, right. So that'll be available to the public all the time? That would be. Okay, thank you. I don't think there's someone in their parks that is not handicapped. Handicap spot or anything. There won't be a note. I hope our park rangers would just tow. Yes. Yes. Thank you very much. That's news. And, again, thank you for that. That'll help us a lot with having the ADA available. Thank you. Any other questions or comments? No? Okay. Okay. We're open to motion if anyone has one. I'll make a motion to approve 6.3. I'll second. And could I just clarify before we vote? I neglected to say, and I also was asking if we could just forward the lease directly to the City Council and not have to come back to you guys. Are you okay with that? I shouldn't mention that. I read that and I forgot that, so yes. I just want to make sure. I just want to make sure that that gets added to the motion. Thank you. So we have Glatz as the motion and Nava as the second? Perfect. Commissioner Blashley? Yes. Commissioner Glatz? Yes. Commissioner Shearer? Yes. Vice Chair Nava? Yes. And Chair Thomas Petty? Yes. Thank you. Thank you. Again, thanks, everybody, for coming up with this compromise. And I do have in my notes that I do think that the closed-off private parking lot would have created some animosity and would not have been great PR for you guys either. And this is, nothing's perfect, but this is great. So thank you again. Nice to see you. Yes. Thanks, Commissioner. Thanks, staff. Mr. Slattery, for making it happen. Oh, yeah. Yes, thank you. I put him on the spot. Thank you, staff. Yeah. Let's get it paid on time or else we're reverting. Back to the other options. So, yeah. Thank you. Okay. We're at item 6.4, consideration of a proposal to submit an urban stream restoration program grant application to develop a rehabilitation plan for Sycamore Pool in Lower Bidwell Park. The commission will receive a presentation from Eric Guinea with, I hope I pronounced that right, with Environmental Science Associates regarding a proposal to submit a grant application to California Department of Water Resources Urban Stream Restoration Program to develop a comprehensive plan to enhance, repair, and rehabilitate Sycamore Pool in the One Mile Recreation Area in Lower Bidwell Park. And a report from Lynn Herman. Yes. I just wanted to say that I would introduce Mr. Guinea, and Mr. Guinea's been involved with the park quite a bit. You've done lots of projects with us. Verbena Fields, one of them also, as well. Yes. So he's been... So I did want to say that the group on their own, he's going to mention their partners. There's a few listed here on the screen here. They submitted a concept proposal with the Urban Streams grant with DWR, and that's a new process that a lot of grantees are doing. They're saying, let's look at what your ideas are, and then let's see if it's worthy and meets the goals and criteria of the grant. And then they get asked to come forward with a full application if they feel that's something that they might... ...can do. So they did submit a proposal, and it was accepted. And so now he's here to talk a little bit about doing the next step. And it does require that they have two partners and a local agency or a tribe is hopefully one of the partners, and then your group would be the second partners as well. So I'll let him say it more grandly than I am. So go ahead. Thanks, Linda. Thanks for letting me take... ...a few minutes to explain the project. As Linda said, Eric Kinney, a park laborer at the Lombard Rosa, I've been here since the early 90s, representing some friends and partners at American Rivers and American White Water who can't be here today, but... ...as you'll see a little bit later, there's quite a group... ...excuse me, quite a group of us, fighting allergies here, fighting with us thinking about the Singapore goal for a long time. So with that, we'll dive in. You all can see on the monitors, yes? Yes. A little bit of visuals and such. Great. So I apologize if I slip up and call it a one-mile pool. We don't get clarity in our language, so let's take more of a one-mile location. Yes. So the pool itself, it's this legacy of Chico, and I know there's even some hazard in even talking about changing one mile, but, you know, one mile, this is a great old photo from somewhere in the United States. It's in the 1940s, probably, somewhere back there. The pool's pretty old. It's got some issues. And while there's some of our values, as it says on the screen, that are unchanged, there's a lot of things that have changed over 100 plus years. And we want to just talk to you a little bit about what we think the pool could be in the future. And we'll give a little context around just who we are, which is up on the screen now, and then a little bit about some of the problems that are at the pool. And tell you a little bit about the funding source and the project as well. So I mentioned some of the folks involved. Those are the organizations up there. A lot of local folks. Some who we've worked with on projects like . I forgot about that one. And other projects over at , and then projects across the western United States. We brought it down to the two, actually, national conservation and advocacy organizations, American Rivers and American Whitewater. But the folks we're working with. They either live in Chico or Sacramento or actually have family from here or what have you. But it's quite a NorCal effort. So as Linda said, we proposed a concept proposal, which is really nice. It's a rather light lift. I believe you have a copy of what we submitted to that program in your packet. The goals are on screen. It's essentially to create a participatory planning process with the community. So understand what's going on at the pool. What people think about the pool. Wish the pool had and it doesn't. Talk about what they love about the pool. What's really great about the program, and I'll tell you a little bit more about the urban streams restoration program. But I'll use the word river education or river safety and ecology. Yes, this is a creek. But the program's a great opportunity to bring together a lot of the elements that are in the community right now, like Chico State, for some staff to do surveys, for example. And ultimately, we're going to be able to do a lot of the work that we're doing in the community. And ultimately, one of the things as a whitewater boater I've noticed is we have a creek running through our town. And thankfully, we don't have the drownings that happen, say, in the San Joaquin Valley, but it's going to be a hot summer and the flows are up. And sadly, I anticipate that we're going to hear about fatalities because there's not a lot of especially multilingual river education around just whitewater safety or swimming in something other than a swimming pool. And it is Big Chico Creek. It's not a swimming pool. It looks like one, but it's not. So those are some of our goals in bringing the water to the people. And that's a big part of what we're doing, bringing this project forward. Just a little bit about the problems. I know you, as Chicoans, are more aware of the park and the pool than others, but it has some annual maintenance that takes place. I'll have a photo in a moment of what happens when trees fall down around the pool. I like to think we've been lucky so far that none of those trees have been the ones that are close enough that'll take the walls down when it falls down. Working in the water resources world, we saw what happened at Oro. Oroville Dam. This is quite a bit of an older place and we could have just the sunny day failure of concrete could give out somewhere on the pool at some point. So I mentioned a little bit about safety. There are some things at the pool that are maybe not as we would build them today. Just say it that way. The zero depth entry is a really interesting thing. So that's just where you can walk right into the water or you could say roll an alter abled human in a chair of sorts, a wheelchair into it. And there's only one spot. It's in that you're looking downstream the back left corner, which is a vehicle ramp. But if you go out there almost on any day, that's where all the kids will be because the little, the little toddlers, right? It's a very small part of the pool. And so there's a few opportunities that we can take to increase what's there. And then the last bullet is just that we've had a plan to rehab the pool for a long time. It's kind of on the books. So just a photo of. Okay. One of the topples there during a high water event, you can see the water up on the sidewalk. So the project just a little bit. The good news is that there's funding available as we've been talking about. These are a few bullets just to go through quickly. The idea is to hear from the community, right? Study it, provide opportunity for people to tell us about the pool, to bring that all in. Have some social science colleagues that that's their business. Um, experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience And you could choose to take that plan after the environmental work is done. And you could choose to implement it if you found funding. You could also just hang out and keep that plan on the shelf. But it would be shovel ready. So that's an important thing for funding in the state of California. Say if you got fish and wildlife funding, California Department of Fish and Wildlife funding, or really any state entity. They can't grant you money that would change the environment unless you completed CEQA. So this project would get everything ready. And then if you found implementation funding, they can grant you that funding because you're shovel ready. You've completed your environmental work. Just a little bit about some of the objectives that we brainstormed about. We did a fun ride around the pool and then went to Burgers and Brew and wrote down the notes that you're seeing here. So it's a nice Chico afternoon for some of our colleagues that don't live here. And I want to just finish with a little bit about the funding source. I'll kind of go through this quickly. It's a lot of grant language, so it is just kind of flashed up there, but there's four buckets that I'll go through. The funding application period is quarterly. We're shooting for the August time period. We've talked to the staff and they believe if we were to apply in August that they could get us rolling in January, which would be great to do an entire year of surveys and monitoring, et cetera. So just a bit about the... This is the... Screenshot of the grant guidelines for the program. And it's really neat how they just talk instantly about bringing people together for projects that foster community relationships, et cetera, et cetera. We just... This project really checks all the boxes. So we are... I'll go through a couple of slides. The pool is actually ending up right in what DWR has mapped for their grant programs as a disadvantaged community. And community input's very foundational. It's what I've been describing to you as the project. And then partnerships and ecological viability are the two other kind of foundational elements of their grant guidelines. And the pool is a little bit hard to see depending on where you're standing, but it's just tucked in there in the dark red near some severely disadvantaged communities. So it's clearly in this area where they have some funding reserved. They have... They've indicated that they're going to be doing some funding. They've indicated that they have more than sufficient funding to fund this project. They don't ever tell you exactly how much is remaining, but that's a really good sign. And this would be applicable. They could use their designated funds in the $2 million bucket toward the total project cost, which is great. The community input, as I mentioned, is just like at the crux of what we want to do here. It's not a project to come in and show people a plan. It's to create a plan with the community. And that's a really big... Big part of it. On the partnership side, I don't know how many of you know of American Rivers or American Whitewater, but in the conservation and planning community, they've been working on things like Klamath Dam removal. And then more quietly on a lot of projects, and I'll show you some of those projects here in a moment, in communities across the country. And lastly is the ecological portion of this. And this is just a picture of one of our spring-run Chinook salmon. And this is just a picture of one of our spring-run Chinook salmon that has failed to survive. It failed to make an attempt at jumping up, not the fish ladder, but the Bladder Dam, which Bladder Dam was a great, great addition to the pool some time ago, but we can do better, and that's a key part in this, that's a lot of what I work on, day to day, these days. Lastly, just a little timeline here before I show you a few photos. It just indicates where we are in the process in terms of that, not color challenge, but the second one down the line. The partnership side of having you all potentially recommend to Council to sign an MOU and have a resolution and then on through grant development to the submittal in hopefully August. We have a couple of precedent projects that we wanted to just put in front of you visually. These are not to say anything other than they are places where communities have turned toward the river and said, we want to focus on the river in terms of community revitalization. We know we're not starting from scratch here, but this is in Reno. It's a facility that in the wintertime is a whitewater park, but I love this shot because there's much lower flow. Of course, no one's wearing a dress. I'm wearing a dry suit over there in the high desert. They're out there in their bathing suits enjoying this and tubing. This is in Colorado where it happens to be a bit higher flow, so there's a few people in rafts, but then you see that again in later summer. And sure, there's some, I guess those are inner tubes. They're not whitewater boats, but there's lots of folks in the community just right there in the core part of their town. This is an example in Bend, Oregon that I think is probably the most popular. I think it's probably the least applicable, but it was a big community effort and some of our partners worked on this and actually our firm as well doing some rehabilitation work here this next year. And then lastly in Texas, and what's great about this one is it literally has like the lifeguard tower that we have at the pool now, but just a little bit of eye candy and inspiration toward what communities have done. And with that, I'll let you all ask any questions. And Linda and I will wrap up. We'll do our best to answer them for you. Do we have questions or comments? Okay, I have a couple of questions. The first is, you know, you look at American rivers and American whitewater, and I'm very familiar with the Reno project. We've done some kayaking there. But the thing is, are you looking to change the surface? Are you looking to change some of the portions of Sycamore Pool into a whitewater rafting experience? I'm not looking to do anything in particular, but if the community wanted to include something like that, I think we would be open to looking at it. One of the things that's interesting about the pool, I'm a geomorphologist. I do river hydraulics and sediment transport and all that good stuff. There would be ways to move sediment through the pool a bit better potentially. And I think that's a good question. And also, get rid of that fish barrier and maybe even make the pool a bit safer. And looking to see who might have shown up this evening, there are people who go out and, well, it sounds like you're a boater, so use the pool in the wintertime when there's a small wave at the top. There could be ways to create multiple benefits, and that's one of the things I was pointing out, say, in the Salida example, where, sure, in the wintertime, it might provide one use, and then this is a big part of why we think it's important. So, I think it's important to look at all the seasons and hear what people are looking for and see if there would maybe be opportunity to provide more amenities. So, it's not an objective. I will say that clearly. So, there's enough, you think there's enough spring runoff in Big Chico Creek at that level to give that opportunity for whitewater? I don't know if it would be in the spring necessarily, but it depends on the water year. We're having a pretty good one. We're literally average for once, right? So, kind of look for the creek. It picks up right now, just because it's not a dry year. I think in dry years, it's probably not going to be so great after the winter, for any kind of flu season. And I can add to that, we actually do allow kayaks in whitewater up until April, I think is the time, in the winter. So, they're already using it. It just would be probably a little more enhanced and a little more exciting than what's there now, but we already have a code section that allows that to happen during a certain time of the year, in the winter. And then, one other question. And, yeah? I'm kind of confused you use this term, environmental justice concern and disadvantaged communities. I know from my experience, there is a huge diversity of community that's using that pool. There's a lot of great access, different family events all around the pool. So I don't know when you say in here, environmental justice concerns, other than you gave a, you know, little emphasis on the different communities. But what are environmental concerns do you think there would be? I think, and I have a colleague who's, that's his work, is in social science beyond, I think what he was alluding to, and maybe Linda has thoughts on this as well, but number one, it's absolutely what you said. It's a very important place. I've lived two different places with children. I know that the pool was filled in over by the junior high. Where else do you go to swim? Right. And so I think it's alluding to the importance, actually. It's not to say that there's something missing. It's something needs to be preserved in terms of access. The other, I think, environmental justice aspect might be considering native peoples and how they believe that creek ultimately may look in the future. Or if there were to be a rehabilitation project, how they might value being a part of that and providing their input. So like I said, it's a creek, not a swimming pool. Yes, it's a pool. There's a pool, yes, there's a pool, yes, there's a pool, yes, there's a pool, yes, there's a pool, yes, there's a pool, yes, there's a pool, yes, there's a pool, yes, yes, there's a pool, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, the permits. And that's true. I mean, we would not be able to build that type of pool in the future. I think what he's trying to say, and I don't want to put, is that two things. One is the disadvantaged community and environmental concerns are also helps. What he's trying to explain is that there's more money available if we address those issues. And I think their idea is that we want to make it more accessible for those community members and more accessible for, and also address some of the environmental concerns. And so I think that was the kind of the idea is that he's right. We don't, the only place you can walk into the pool was down by the ramp, you know, and then you have steps and you have, you know, diving concerns and can, and I really liked this Austin, Texas. I think this is the best example of what we could possibly have, where you have a sloping, you know, accessible area that you can walk down and, you know, sit down and just slide into the pool. Right now, we don't have that. So I think that's the best example of what he's trying to say. We can make it accessible to a greater number of people with different needs. And then one more question. So is your project area just the pool itself, or are you going upstream down Big Chico Creek through all of Lower Park? No, I, the actual footprint, some, you know, nominal, distance downstream and upstream, if there were to be anything that would change in terms of like the profile, but no, it's, it's that one mile area for sure. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. I do have questions. I do have comments. You are right. This is a real gem of Chico. This is actually my favorite spot in the park and one of my favorite spots in town. And I, you as a Chicoan will know that people will be territorial about it, but I am glad to see this effort happen. I'm a big fan of the water and the water is running and I just want to, you know, request, I work in water, I work in grants and some of those things too. And I see a lot of terribly done public outreach. So please don't do that. And I, I love that when I go there, there are so many languages spoken that you do not, I do not hear in my day-to-day life around Chico. I'll probably hear like six to eight languages every time I go swim. And so, you know, multilingual outreach I think is important. And I think it's a great way to get people to know about Chico. Um, when people come back, when people come back, when people come back, when people come back, when people come back, when people come back, when people come back, when people come back, when people come back, when people come back, when people come back, when people come back, the governor is pulling back a lot of those funds to address budget shortfalls. There's also a ton of money coming out of the federal government, but it sounds like we're going to miss that window probably if it's going to take 30 months, well, really three years from now to get started. So just wanted to kind of ask about the timeline. And then I don't know if it's possible to kind of work in, you mentioned pool safety, and I don't think it's as big of a concern here at Sycamore Pool, but obviously all the swimming pools in Upper Park, that is a concern, and there isn't multilingual signage. I don't know if it's possible to include that as urban, even though it's upstream and kind of out in the rural area. It's very much part of the Chico community. And then lastly, to just say that I do appreciate this from a social justice standpoint because it's absurd how few public pools there are in a city of over 100,000 people with as many days over 100 degrees as Chico has. So this is a real resource that I'm glad to see. It's a resource that we improved access for. But be careful because we're going to be watching you. So when we met with the two women who we work with on other projects as well and spoke about the funding, they actually emphasized, they said, hey, we saw your concept. We'd really like you to be sure to emphasize outreach and design. We have too many projects coming back asking for more money. And we said, so could you accommodate an increase? And they said, yes. So we plan to lean in. And I took down the note around the multilingual, which we will need to get some specialty services if we want to do that. Just briefly about the outreach. We're not planning to go to the farmer's market. We're planning to be at the pool, full stop. Like that's almost the only relevant place for outreach. I mean, there could be other, but we really want to have people identifying what they like about the place and they can point to it, et cetera. You just touched on one of my other ones. Can I add to your list? Yes, go, please. Water quality. Obviously there's like a, you know, environmental type of water quality. And then there's a human safety water quality. And my three and six year old have not been to the pool much as I would love for them to go to the pool, but they still ingest a fair bit of water when they swim. And I don't want to take them to the pool. I myself have picked something up that was from the pool. So I don't know if there's anything we can do about that without, you know, altering the ecological benefits of it. But that's another water quality aspect to be thinking about. And I would say that there are people, outside of current users of the pool, who are relevant to include in the discussion. And I think that's kind of the idea is that part of the problem with the pool, and I think he says it in his report, it's a big pool, deep pool, stagnant water, right? It doesn't have a lot of flow going through it. And I think that's kind of one of the goals is to make this so it is a lively, healthy stream that has, you know, aeration and water. And I think that's kind of the, I think the idea is one of the goals. Yeah, the ecological health and human health. Yeah, there's been a water quality problem in the pool for a long time, unfortunately. It's probably not getting better either. Commissioner Inaba. Thank you. Bear with me. I have a few. I'll try to go in a flow-based order here. Okay, just for clarity's sake on the funding picture of this grant, I just want to make sure, it sounds like it's more in the D&D part and not implementation. So the design and a little bit of conceptual development of what this could be, right? So the outreach and everything you described, but it's not going into the implementation piece. It would just cover that, the user-centered design piece, all of that? Correct. I just want to make sure I understood that. There's no funding available for the project. Okay. So, I mean, this is a kind of a different pool. I mean, we're very unique here in Chico. I mean, yes, the Austin one looks, you know, it has a similar vibe. So hopefully when you come back, things we can expect to see, okay, like what is implementation of something like this going to be? I understand that would be folded into the study, but also a very, as good as we can get, a picture of what maintenance and operations would look like ongoing. Is it, would it be, you know, in excess of what we're doing now? These are all concerns as we know budgets are tight and we're already, you know, we're already in the middle of a pandemic. We have a lot of things going on with our parks. We can't even get enough rangers and lifeguards. So that's going to be an important picture. So thank you for clarifying the funding piece. So is it refers to like a potential partnership with an MPO? Do we know what that might look like here? Are we just talking because tribal, you have tech, and I think they're the folks, of course, that we use out in Verbena fields who are, are experts and knowledgeable and that's wonderful. I think that's important to plug into that. Is there something else you had in mind when that's thrown in there? Is that just template language you lifted and shifted? Well, so I worked on the Verbena fields project, but I think the folks that were a part of the design process are not the same folks who are using it that you might be alluding to. I'm not working with any of those folks. It's still the Machupto tribe. The tribe, but like the individuals. Some, Sandra's still there. And I think some others, but yeah, definitely. No, but as far as a design process, we do a lot of work with tribes for tribes for the state of California. It's not just template language. It's an important part of what we do. And it's, there's not tribal science and Western science. There's science and there's viewpoints and they're going to be included. And those could include folks who are not necessarily Machupto as well. And we haven't set anything out as yes or no. It's, it's a conceptual proposal. So now's the time when we, if you all decide to move forward, we have a lot of hard work to do to actually scope all of that and find out if those folks need compensation. There's a lot to it. So it's not determined at this point who exactly. Who might plug in. Okay. I just do have concerns because there are some entities, I think in town that have established a trust rapport and others who I'd be concerned and want to make sure that it would come back here or at council for sure for discussion before. Yeah. If I may, they, this, this, the first thing is to do, we want to even move forward at all. And then if we do, we submit the application. If we're awarded, then that's going to start that whole process. But again, this is just the plan and conceptual and it does not. I, cause I asked the question, it does not obligate the city to implement the program in the future. There's no strings to tie and there isn't any local match on this. Cause I think that's very important. So it's really going to come out. And like I was saying, you know, if we have to do, we have to do sequel on this and maybe the sequel won't pan out right for this, then that's just what, how it's going to be. Right. But at least we went through that process and that if we did have the opportunity and there was a desire from the community, it is shovel ready, literally sitting on the shelf. That's what I'm trying to do before I leave is have these shovel ready things on the shelf. So my successor can, can move on if in the future with those projects. So I think it's a great opportunity. They came to us. They're going to be the grantee grantee grantor grantee grantee. We're just here as a partner because it requires a, we're the landowner and B requires a second partner. So it's going to be primarily them carrying the ball and doing all this for us. So I do see like the opportunities like Jenny raised as well. And, you know, having been someone who's used that area heavily, I totally concur about like the access part and the safety piece to that. And the sheer, you know, vertical walls are not fun when you get tired kids, they can get kind of freaked out. And that has worried me with the lack of consistent lifeguards and things like that, that just because we haven't had something doesn't mean we're not going to. So I think it would be prudent to, you know, look into things and how can it fit naturally. I'm a fan of things like that too. So, so I appreciate those opportunities. And as to the inclusivity piece to it, I think I appreciate what you're saying. About, okay, we were just going to look at like people coming to the pool. I would caution against solely focusing your efforts there. And I will tell you why, because recently we have had issues such as commissioner glass has referred to before with, you know, just some safety concerns. So some people who used to use it heavily have way backed off. And so I'm worried then with the inclusivity piece that you get some with young children that maybe weren't going because of the water quality concern, not that there isn't the concern. And safety issues for personal safety. So maybe we could do some plussing in of boys and girls club, parents go to pick up, maybe you could hold something at the library and you invite people, it's free there, so people can get around, there's public transportation, keep that in mind, you know, make it accessible. I think it's important if you really are heavy on the outreach, which the literature really leans that way, then you need to have the proof in the pudding for that, so that we get, all different Chico ends with their voices being raised with that. Um, so thank you for that piece. Um, as to the water testing, I, I just for Jenny, um, we had done some of that, uh, individually in another, um, life that I hold. Um, I just want to mention that I was, uh, give kudos to the city because they did evolve their water testing protocols based on that feedback of some of the testing that independent residents here brought to their attention about what the water quality concerns. Um, Um, Um, Um, Um, Um, Um, Um, Um, Um, educate people in that regard as well. We can maybe get people back. Maybe the plans will make it such that with the sediment issue, it will raise the water quality, and when we start being able to address encampments, hopefully that will improve water quality. So, I've talked a lot, and thank you. I appreciate your time. Commissioner Glass. It says we're going long. I'll just be real short. I'm just going to kind of piggyback. Even the farmer's market may not be actually a terrible place to go, because people are pulling away from the park. So, some of the people who go to the farmer's market may be some of the crowd that's pulling away. So, I would just get the entire community involved, from top to bottom. I think you'll find they'll get more resources. And then I'm an aesthetic guy, but showing from the pictures you're showing, I don't think we have to worry about that. I just hope, personal thing, that we don't do another city plaza in that area. Sorry, but that's just my personal opinion on city plaza. Go ahead. That's it, but thank you. Just one quick thing. I just wanted to say, and you would want to plus in card, in my opinion, to this conversation. Annabelle and her staff are doing fabulous things, and I hear they have mad plans for that area, too. So, it would be important to collaborate on visioning. Thanks. I thought our CD reached out, and they've had a meeting. Carl's here. Okay. Eric, I just have a couple of things. You started out your conversation about couching it in terms of changing Sycamore Pool. I suggest you say improving from the get-go. Changing will raise people's hackles. Improving, maybe not. And this question is for city staff. I just wondered when the last structural inspection of the pool, the concrete, he had me thinking about the concrete walls and theскийскийскийскийскийскийскийскийскийскийскийскийскийскийскийскийскийскийскийскийскийскийскийскийскийскийскийскийскийскийскийскийскийскийскийскийскийскийскийскийскийскийскийскийскийскийскийскийскийскийскийскийскийскийскийскийскийскийский!скийский! them and we did get and I'm we're hoping to maybe do some of those repairs this after the swim season this year um we're after we have to go through the budget process but that that's what we've done and looked at the and saw it had some solutions on how to shore it back up to give us more years than what it is now so um but that would be part of this discussion as well that would be part of this um study is what is the structural integrity of the pool and you know what do we have to do to make it more safe right is that correct right because this might turn into instead of an optional project a mandatory one right if we find I mean I didn't realize it was almost 100 years old um and you know we are in California things shift uh and uh just because of our tectonics and you know we're an earthquake prone area even though we don't get very many um just all sorts of issues and we do have big trees and roots around that area so um um yeah I would be interested at it seems like it should be inspected on a regular basis but again if we decide to uh recommend it uh when it goes in front of council if it's sort of this isn't really optional it's we're leaning towards this is uh starting to become mandatory because of its age uh then I think that that's the way we should and I will say we inspect it of course every time we clean it right so we are it is every other week we're in there and we're looking at a concrete engineer but we did bring somebody out last summer yes um and one of my brothers lives in Reno I was just down downtown uh last October it's just so fabulous it's transformed their downtown and um you know it's great so you know we don't need a transformation but an improvement would would sounds really great um so those are my only comments Um I think this experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience! experience experience the city council has been worked quite a bit on this. Do we want to put a motion up? thank you. I make a recommendation that the bidwell park and playground commission recommend the city council approve of submitting an urban street restoration program planning ramp application for sycamore pool. thank you for the opportunity to enhance something that' s very special to chico. okay commissioner blashly. yes. commissioner glas. yes. commissioner scherer. yes. vice chair nava. yes. and chair thomas petty. yes. thank you. we will move to item 7 on the agenda 7.1 parks division report linda herman. thank you chair. again this is just our division report for the kind of a little bit of two months in this because we didn' t meet last time. it' s just again to provide you information and if you have any questions I' d be happy to answer any questions you have. thank you. any other questions or comments from the commission? commissioner glas. I got a couple of questions linda. I just found out I guess I missed the meeting when you announced that you were retiring. congratulations. I didn' t really announce it. it' s leaking out. okay. sorry. it was just like a shock. I'm like huh? but anyway. I just became a grandparent. my grandson was born on the 11th. congratulations. congratulations. so just a couple of quick questions because it' s been a couple of months. do we have an update on the seven-day ranger program? I asked Eric and I didn' t hear back. we asked that question this morning. I texted Eric last week and he didn' t so there' s no answer yet. because I' ve seen there is a ranger out Saturday mornings going to the events if there' s an event. yes. they' re working overtime to do that. it' s not a regular schedule. so I' d be a little bit more so they' d leave at noon or whatever probably? sometimes they' ll stay longer if there' s a lot of events. but yes. it' s having to pay overtime to have them there on the weekends. okay. so when you asked, you asked Mark Sorenson or you asked Billy? there was other questions I had for Eric and within those questions that question arose. and then I found out today that Target did add another officer to their team and that was the team. so they' re better staffed. so we' re optimistic that there' e some schedule changes soon. optimistic. I like that. from January 1st to May 1st. signage. this political signage that's going on. I didn' t even know about it and someone made me aware there' e some stuff going on in the children's park or something like that. some signs going on? oh yes. that was taken down immediately. immediately that we as soon as we heard about it it was taken down. so. yeah. it' s just on their own doing it. but the rules are in a public space there' e no political advertising is that kind of. correct. correct. like I said as soon as we found it we removed it. okay cool. because there' e stuff that' s up in one mile now that I' ve called about. there' e stickers go up and there' e things on a post right now asking for money to free somebody. you know. it just seems like. as soon as we tear it down it' s back up. just to keep an eye out for it to remove it from the public. come back with experience with this experience with this Is that on the agenda, Danny, for next time? June 18th. June 18th, it's on the agenda. So we would certainly keep you informed with that, and you as citizens can say, but if you're going to do anything as a commission, you'll have to do it as part of a motion on the commission meeting. So I don't know where that discussion's going and what they're even asking, because, again, as you know, the process is a council member has to ask for it to be agendized first, and then that's the next step, is it was okay to be agendized, but they have not talked about it and took any action on it that I know of. No, but it's not coming to your office anymore, is it? I don't know, and that's the question I don't know. They could send it back to you for discussion, but I don't know what the council's thinking, the council member's thinking about doing that or not. But that could come out of the action that they could take, is they could say, well, let's have the commission look at this a little more. Okay, because I guess my, so to simplify the question, it's going to, because it is going to go on their agenda in June, and there's going to be a, is it not going to be, there's no, who's going to do the research for council on this decision? Is it your department, probably, or? It all depends on what the council member who asked it to be discussed wants. So if they want us to do research, then they can ask us to do that research for them. I have, I do not know what, or he's doing his own research, but yeah, it just depends on what, but it's their decision to move forward on this, and what they want and need will come from that discussion as a council. As a group, we're not allowed to comment, but individually, we can comment on that. We have to go to city council. As individuals, yes. Okay. Well, just again to piggyback, you do have the traffic study that we had done last year. Hopefully, we can make that available to them. It was available to them before, but we could remind them about it and have those discussions. We have the benefit of, having that presented to us and they don't. And we had a meeting in Lower Park where we discussed these issues. I suppose they could look at our minutes, but I'm actually very upset that hopefully they will send it back to us. I mean, this is just a much more hospitable place for members of the community to come and voice their concerns and their support, their questions, posit their questions here than at a city council meeting. And for this to, I understand they have the right to originate anything they want if they decide to vote with a majority to agendize it, but I feel like this is an issue that needs to come through this commission, and I'm going to voice my concern as a private individual to our city council about this fact. So. It feels like it's something that should be here at some point. And if it's not, it'll just reemphasize my belief that they're trying to circumnavigate around us. So, and, you know, and that's an aside, and now I'm going to ask myself to stop talking off agenda topics. Yeah, I was just going to remind you that's not on the agenda. No, but we're allowed to ask a question. So, yes. So, one more question. I had a conversation this morning with some of the members of the council and someone who's working in the park, and I'm kind of like almost embarrassed sometimes to be on the park commission, and I guess the group, I thought it was like 60 days, but there's been a group at the bathrooms in the one-mile area for over 60 days, and 90 days is what I'm told by one of the people who work in the park and has to deal with them on a daily basis. It's not okay. You know, I mean, and I know notices went out. Yes. And for next Thursday, but the comment from the council is, from me to you, when you guys have your meetings, is within an area where elderly and children are playing, we shouldn't be waiting so long to notice people. It should become a daily kind of thing if somebody moves in. And I'm not talking to this. This is just my comment to you based upon your report to get around the legal stuff. But anyways, that's all. I think the only question is that. Question for Linda or comment? Yeah. The target team added, added an officer, but did they add a sergeant? They're in the process. Okay. So one sergeant is changing into a different department, and they've interviewed other candidates to fill those shoes. And from what I've heard, they're very close to making that transition. I think it's going to happen here in June is what I've heard last. Because the hang-up for the weekend is because there's not, not a sergeant on the target team that oversees the weekends. I can probably answer that. I think that's what you were told by the chief of police when they came in January. But I think that that's no longer the case, and they're not getting a second sergeant. So I don't know if that means that they already, they always have a sergeant on, on the weekend. So maybe that sergeant would be the person that'd be in charge. So things have changed from January from when the chief was here and spoke to the group. But it was a good question because that's exactly what he said. So, yeah, that's a good question. Any other questions or comments? So, I was glad to hear Councilmember Glatz, Councilmember, Commissioner, I just promoted you, bring up the item about the, like, faux memorials, if you will, going up in the park. I will put on record, I want to say this, that I have been contacted by varying members of the community, including some Jewish members of the community who are extremely upset because it keeps popping up. And so I would just reiterate that I'm grateful when we see it, we pull it down. But if we do have people there daily, like, it's, sometimes it was their weeks, is what I've been told. And the people are apprehensive. They want to be able to take it down, but then they worry about their safety and whether that's lawful. They asked, okay, does that need a permit? Because wouldn't it need a permit? It's a park. And the fact that people are, they're confused over something, like you said, the political nature, you know, no. And we would have seen the permit come through. So anyway, I would just like us to be proactive that when the maintenance sweep is coming through, if they could be attentive to things like that, especially since it is the children's playground area. And like, we tend to hear about it a lot. I heard from six different community members in a very short space of time about it. Thank you. And then the other piece, I wanted to ask, about actually refers, so you had a lot of reports of different areas of the park. And since we had those two applicants earlier with, you know, a footprint, I know at Five Mile we have restrooms and we have some near Cedar Grove, but I was just curious as commissioner, it's been a while since I walked in there because I didn't feel safe, frankly, at the one near Cedar Grove. Is it appropriate and like ready to have a lot of little kids in there? I just, I kind of flashed on that. Are you asking about the restrooms? Did I miss? Yeah, like are they okay? They get cleaned every day. Yeah. So, and they get used a lot too. So, and I don't think that we're having the same problems there as we are at One Mile. Okay. Okay, great. I just want to make sure that the students are protected. Thank you. Great. Any other questions or comments? Thank you, Linda, very much for your report and your hard work. We go to 7.2, our street. Tree division report from Richie Bamlett, urban forest manager. Thank you, Chair Thomas Petty. And again, this report is for informational only. It actually covers three months. So, I'll be happy to take any questions you might have. Just overall thought, is it going to be a heavy limb dropping tree things because of all the rain? What is the general thought? Just curious. Well, every summer we do get, limb drop, but the frequency of it, who can say? You know, it's very much weather dependent. And if we get a hot summer, well, we always get a hot summer, but if we get a super hot summer with lots of calm days where there is no wind, yeah, we can anticipate limb drop. Yeah, but time will tell. Right. Okay. Okay. You know, I've had a lot of people, not a lot, but I've had people approach me about trees in Chico. And they want to know, when you have picked out the trees because of asthma, everybody's choking. I know that the ER is full of people with asthma. Do we look at trees that mitigate, you know, asthma? Asthmatic conditions or because of the pollen? Everybody's getting the pollen right now. Right. It is something we consider, but I mean, basically what it points to is trying to stay away from trees that produce massive amounts of pollen. And we do that, but does it make a difference in Chico? I don't know. I know that everyone has allergies. I mean, right now I have them and it's, you know, coughing all the time, it seems throughout the summer. But we do try and minimize the impact of tree pollen. But, you know, if it reduces the incidence of people's, you know, allergies, I don't know. But I know there are specific trees, for example, a lot of, you know, the coniferous trees that, you know, will produce massive amounts. You can almost see clouds of yellow come, you know, so we avoid those. But still, you know, the regular shade trees, that we plant, they do produce pollen because, you know, we try and stay away from some of the female trees, you know, when there is a male and female type to avoid the issues of, you know, messy fruit falling into the sidewalk. So we do, we do tend to favor the male variety, which produces pollen. So, you know, it's a difficult one to call. We, so, you know, we, we try and avoid the high pollen producers, but yeah, we still plant trees that produce pollen. But, you know, given, you know, you know, we're surrounded by so much agriculture, you know, does it move the dial significantly? I don't know. Probably not actually, you know, so, yeah. Any other questions or comments for Richie? Vice Chair Nava. Yeah. So one, just want to roll back to that tree that had the peel go through and then it was overturned and they were given, you know, permission to remove. Has that removal happened yet? And have the other trees been planted? If, if you're referring to the, the, the willow tree there on the preservation, as far as I know, there has been no forward action. I know Director Gustafson has reached out to the applicants a number of times to try and establish what mitigation will happen, because City Council did add that to the condition that they will plant three or four replacement trees. We settled on three. Okay. But there seems to be a few barriers to getting that part of the conditional permit in place. So, yeah, the, nothing has happened. The tree is still there. No mitigation has been planted. And that's where we are. Thanks, Richie. Two, I wanted to say, thank you so much for the fruit tree program. We have not killed ours yet. Give me time. And it was easy. We appreciated that. And I encourage community members to definitely avail themselves of your programs. They're a great thing. And thirdly, thank you so much for allowing me the extreme pleasure of attending the National Arbor Day, little tree planting that you had at Parkview Elementary School. It was so much fun seeing the kids' faces. And seeing them have a footprint in something where they can go back and revisit and remember. And they all did have the camaraderie. And kudos to the staff. They were very good with the children in interactive. You do a good job, Richie. Thank you for all that. Thank you so much for coming along. I know the kids really enjoyed having a parks commissioner there. So, kudos to you. And you'll be invited every year now. I suppose all of you will. You know, we have so much fun with those kiddos. And, you know, you may know that the principal at Parkview is now being promoted to director of all elementary schools. So, I've got my eye on the entire elementary system of Chico that we really need to, you know, plant trees with every campus, you know, especially when the teachers are open to that. But specifically that program, we do target the fifth graders because the trees that they plant becomes a graduation tree. So, it makes it just extra special that it's their legacy, if you like, once they graduate to go to, you know, junior high. So, the kids just, they just love that. So, I know that Heather Sufuentes is very much keen to see that program roll out across all elementary schools. So, that means there'll be lots of invites from, for commissioners to come along. Because we may have many, many schools all in one week. So, that's what we're trying to get, get to. Thank you. Thank you for attending and representing the commission. I appreciate that. Or we all, we all do, I'm sure. But I just had an idea. I'm glad the urban forest management plan, master plan is done and we'll all have a copy. But I do remember being a part of it there, you know, of course, we have places in Chico where we need trees. And so, it might be good or fun or relevant to target, some of the schools that are in those areas. And as part of, I mean, you could fulfill some of the goals of the master plan too. And we need trees in these areas. We have schools in these areas. So, once you and Heather get your partnership going, just an idea. For sure. Yeah. So, and thank you for all your outreach. It's so great. And your partnership with the NLO. And I just, it's really fun reading all the events and all the tree planting. And I think it's really, involved with the project and the experience and the experience with the meetings and the seniors that were it seems like you're getting it everyone of all from birth to, you know, so it's really great. Thank you for your report. Hard work. Any other questions or comments for Richie? No? Okay. We will move to item 8, adjournment. Adjourn to the next regular meeting on June 24, 2024 at 6 p.m. in the council chamber of the Chico Municipal Center building right here. Thank you everybody for being here and your hard work and we'll see you next month. Thank you.
