Anyone wishing to address an item on the agenda, which, well, you can address closed session as well as the public hearing, should first complete a speaker card, which are available at the back of the chamber, and then once completed, turn in the clerk's room right over here. Ooooh Ooooh Ooooh Ooooh!! Ooooh Ooooh Ooooh Ooooh Ooooh Ooooh Ooooh Ooooh!! Ooooh! Ooooh City Council Districts in the City of Chico. And I believe we're starting to wait. There we go. Come on now. Thank you very much. Good to be back here. Let's again have a short presentation to kind of bring everyone up to speed of where we're at. Last meeting, five maps were elevated, Demographer Maps 4 and 5, as well as Public Submissions 2, 6, and 7. Based on requests from the City Council, Demographer Maps 4 and 5 and Public Submission 2 were adjusted to include the Wildfire Risk Zone. In addition, the public was also allowed to submit adjusted maps to the five elevated maps and received a total of four new maps. Two were adjustments to Public Submission 2, and two were adjustments to Public Submission 6. Briefly, I'll go over to Communities of Interest before I go over to different districts. This was received prior to the previous meeting. Unfortunately, it didn't make it into the presentation. So just wanted to enter this into the record here. The red is what they put as the Kena area. The bluish-teal area is what was called the Severe Disadvantaged Area. The green area here is Student Area, and then the Wildfire Risk Zone is the area that's in purple. And this data was... was... taken from the Cal State Chico website. It was a vulnerability assessment regarding wildfire and climate change risk. And actually, that's getting ahead there. We're going to go ahead and head to the... go over briefly the various maps. So we also, at the request of the Council, included Communities of Interest that were received by the public, as well as the ones that I created previously to last meeting with the change in the Highway 32 corridor to move it to the Student Area. The Chico-Navacoa that was received also is overlaid. And Goldstein-Coy 1. And Goldstein-Coy 2, which is a focus on the Student Area, and they break it down into various areas. I'm going to go, though, into the maps. So, demarc for Map 4. The change to 4B is adding the fire area. Because there's a low population, in this area, we're able to limit the... the change was minimal, mainly on to the districts on the west end. 5, said solved last time. 5B, once again, it's a change with adding the entire fire zone. So, the change is only one area. Goldstein-1000, which was another one elevated, that I've previously presented. And the author of Goldstein-1000 submitted two variations. The first one, and then also the one that I created. So, the one that I changed is this one. And what I did was take district 1, and I changed it to 1. And then I changed it to district 3. So, the other two changes was district 6 in the fire zone. This one was to get an idea of how district 3 would look if this contained the entire fire zone. And this is the change that was... or these two versions were submitted by Bryce Goldstein, in which this one, they've added, made district 6, the... area that had the fire zone, similar to demographer map 4 and 5B. And this one, it's just a slight change where they didn't include the airport area in that fire zone. So, now the public submission 6 was also another one elevated. This is the original version. And this one is the one that was submitted by the original author, who has chosen to stay anonymous. This was submitted by the original author, Is that maps... or actually this, map B. This was submitted... Can you explain that? Excuse me? Can you explain the author choosing to stay anonymous bit? They created an email called helptepeoplevote at gmail.com. We don't have it here. We don't have a name for them. I don't even know who they are. Okay. Thank you very much. You're welcome. And so this one is... they kept the fire zone together. Just a couple of minor changes on the western or eastern side of the city. They kept the more or less the eastern side or east of 99 the same. C, a local resident, and then they changed it to a map. This is their version of Chico Help People Vote Map. One notable change from this one is they did slightly change each district and brought the deviation down below 5%. Previously, map Help People Vote Map, A, original version, and B, had some of the highest deviation. This one is one of the lowest deviation, along with Goldstein 1000. So, those two, the Goldstein, and Help People Vote Map, C, have the lowest deviation of... Claudia, did that person request to remain anonymous, as well? They did, and we'll leave it up to them if they want... Looks like somebody in the audience raised their hand, so... Okay, well... Thank you. They had mentioned to me they wanted to remain anonymous, so, in the meantime, I... And then the last one was the Heart of Chico map. And this was also moved along and already had much of the fire area in District 6. So this one had no change. Do we know who created that map? Yes, we do. Is that something that you'd be willing to share? I think I've gotten a lot of emails from people who are concerned that there's no names attached to these. Thank you. And as I mentioned before, what this tool allows you to do is review the various communities of interest to see which ones are divided, which ones are united into various plans. And also, Resident created communities of interest to get their ideas of how the various communities of interest are divided or united. And so back to the presentation. So the next steps. So today, we hold the public hearing, take testimony, and receive comment. Choose a final map. And on April 15, 2022, hold a public hearing. Take testimony and receive comment. Adopt the final map by resolution. Second reading and adoption of redistricting ordinance. And April 17, the California state law deadline for submission of final map to Butte County. And with that, I will, we can either take public comment or I will entertain any questions. I have a question. Yes. Just for the good of the public, Claudio, can you, Can you Can you Can you Can you Can you Can you Can you Can you Can you Can you Can you Can you Can you Can you meaning taking into consideration topography, creeks, rivers, certain natural boundaries. Thank you. You're welcome. And a question, if you can go back to your timeline real quick. Sure. So we could advance final maps, like we could choose three and advance them to April 5th, right? To a regular scheduled meeting on the council? Yes, you could. Or five or three or two or one or whatever. Correct. The encouragement is to choose one tonight, but yes, you can choose. Okay. Why is that the encouragement? Since the deadline is getting close, it's to try and get it whittled down. But again, if you want to choose three, four, you're able to. All right, questions from council on that? Well, I guess I'd just push that a little bit forward. You said you were encouraged to do one. What's the difference between doing one or doing two and coming back? There's nothing to stop us. No, there's nothing to stop you. Okay. So. Excuse me, I might have missed this, but what is the range of the deviation as far as the, I don't have it in front of me. So. So actually I can pull them up right now. Let's see, here we go. What are the parameters for the deviation? Is it? Excuse me? Not to exceed X? Oh, 10%. Thank you, that's right. Thank you very much. You're welcome. So if it exceeded 10% between the largest and the smallest populated, it wouldn't even make it to consideration tonight. So that's one of the main things is that when we, when we look at submissions is like baseball, is it within the foul lines? We don't judge how, if it barely stayed in at first base, or if it was in center field, if it's in those lines, it can be considered. Okay. And just real quick, we received several maps that have been obviously on our docket before. There've been some edits to those maps. Are all of the existing maps that you presented to us tonight, are all of the existing maps that you presented to us tonight, are they all legal in your opinion? Yes. Thank you. What would make an illegal map? So say outside the 10% deviation, and the basic one we're, that as a demographer, we're able to determine, is it outside that 10% deviation? So if there's not- Is there intentional targeting of an incumbent, which is hot, you know, again, you have to get something, you have to get something in writing, which I have seen nothing of the sort, or, but it doesn't really apply to Chico, whether section two C, whether minority group is being intentionally diluted, and which really isn't considered. And in fact, I mean, the encouragement was to do a map that has at least one district where the C map for Hispanics is 20% or more, and all but one that are being considered, and all but one that are being considered tonight, have that, meet that criteria. Just out of curiosity, which one doesn't, just for my curiosity. It's the map public submission seven, but all the rest do meet that criteria. So heart of Chico doesn't. So the other things that you noted, the clear boundaries, natural boundaries, compact districts, those things are not, to not do those things isn't illegal, it's just not recommended by the- It's recommended and, I mean, there are times to stay within certain deviation. You can go down even smaller streets as a, if it's a legal block by the census, you can use it. But it's when you, so what they determine is if you go way out of your way to try and reach a certain community, that's way across town, that's when you may get deemed. Legally. Legally. Right. So if it almost gets there, that's not illegal. Is that what I'm hearing? As I mentioned, you know, it's like, here's the baselines. If it crosses the foul line just after first base, it may look sloppy, still an umpire's gonna call it a fair ball. Thank you. Thank you. Very good. More questions? From council? All right, I had a quick question just about, about annexation, because we're gonna be facing that over the next several years. Correct. And Mr. B, we might need your help a little bit. But if you go down to West Sacramento Avenue, right where your cursor is, that area is gonna be coming in. Yeah, right there. Right, correct? Or am I looking at the wrong spot? A portion of that area. Yeah, a portion, a portion. So yeah, if you put the cursor just down where it says Bidwell Avenue in there, some of those homes, is that just the one in Big Chico Creek? No, I don't have the exact boundary, but yeah. Okay. More or less. Yeah, a small portion. So my question is, so what district does that get put in? Because like on this map, let's say we accepted this map, and then this gets annexed in, who decides or how is that decided? Which district that ends up in? That would ultimately be the decision of the city council to adjust the boundaries. At the same time, it's recommended you obviously have to do a district that's continued. Yeah, yeah, obviously it couldn't be. Yeah, just, you know, four or something or five. Correct. Well, no, it was four and five, but you know, seven. So, okay. Yeah, I was just wondering about that, because we have a couple of those areas throughout the city. So I was wondering how that was determined. Thank you. You're welcome. Another question. Just to follow up on that, you're saying that would be a council decision. Does the council then vote on that when that's annexed? Or do we just take that into consideration now, knowing that it's, I don't know how many homes are in there, 100 homes, that it's going to adjust that? Or how does that happen? You would do that, I don't know, for the next time? At the, yes, when the, well, on the next redistricting is when you put it into war, but for election purposes, if it happens mid-decade, you would have to make a decision when the annexation happens. Great, thank you. That makes sense. Okay, further questions from council? No. All right. All right. We'll see you after public comment. All right. All right, so we'll open the public hearing. Madam Clerk, how many speakers? We have 13. Okay, three minutes. All right, and so I'm going to call two names, and if you can line up, Bill Monroe followed by David Welch. Yeah, and if you just wouldn't mind waiting in the aisle behind the person as their time ticks down, we'd appreciate that so we could just save everybody's time as we transition from one to another, and then recognize when the clock turns red, your time is up. Thank you. Hello, council, I'm Bill Monroe. I live at 234 West 4th Avenue. I live about four or five blocks from the old Machuptah Cemetery, so I'm definitely on Machuptah land where I live. It's kind of a transitional area between the avenues and student housing. I am definitely, I'm kind of looking at the, I had an email about this, it's published. I'm very concerned about Heart of Chico and help Chico help people vote maps, because, you know, I think that's a very kind of bizarre way that they're shaped. They are not compact, and that leads me to believe that there is an agenda of some kind of political agenda involved in the creation of those maps. I am in support of the consultants maps and of the Goldstein maps, which are much more compact, much more natural, following streams, following major roads, and I think that's a very good way to kind of make it easier for people to understand what district they're in. If you have districts that kind of go cattywampus this way and that, shifting around on blocks, it doesn't make any sense, then people are gonna be confused as to who their council person is and how they should vote. So, thank you. Thank you. David Welch, followed by Bryce Goldstein. Hello. As the previous speaker said, I think that when I first saw maps six and seven, and I saw the way they wander strangely across the city and some of the boundaries that were, you know, extremely jagged and irregular in that, my supposition was, along with especially their exceedingly cute names, my supposition was that they were drawn to meet somebody's political agenda. When Council Member Morgan said he liked them, that pretty much confirmed that supposition for me. And they're clearly just, you know, aside from any partisan considerations about them, they are just bizarre maps, they make it difficult, both map six and its various variations really make it difficult, as Mr. Monroe said, they make it difficult to figure out what district people are in, wandering boundaries, things like that, they're just exceedingly, poorly drawn from a basic map making kind of consideration. But maybe the most troubling thing about them is the secrecy around those, it just seems like, it would be very nice to know who actually did those original maps. And the fact that they've chosen to remain anonymous is kind of troublesome. It appears to me that Council Member Morgan knows who drew them, since he knew that there were only maps submitted by two members of the public at an earlier meeting. It seems likely that he knew who that other member of the public was. But apparently we're not allowed to know. And I think that that degree of secrecy, that lack of transparency in this process is really troubling. I certainly, I think my favorite maps are probably the original Goldstein 1000. Its variants are okay, and even the demographer maps are okay. 6 and 7 and the various variations thereof just seem like entirely bizarre maps from any standpoint. Thank you. Mr. Mayor? Yes. I'd just like to point out, I don't know if this was on everybody's agenda, but when I originally read that, the maps literally said from the demographer or public submission. I just counted. I know that's harder for some people than others, but that's how I knew there were two. So Bryce Goldstein followed by Kirk Mumford. Good evening, City Council. I submitted two variants of my Goldstein 1000 map. Hopefully you saw it. They're labeled 2C and 2D. They take into account the eastern wildfire prone areas that Council recommended at the last meeting, while preserving neighborhoods and communities of interest. I also think that the latest demographer maps, 4B and 5B, are looking pretty good. The other maps being considered are sketchy. Public submission 7 splits up the avenues four ways. As Councilmember Morgan said at a previous meeting, that should be avoided. Unlike last time, redistricting two years ago. And at the last meeting, I was dismayed to see public submission 6 get a lot of attention, move forward without any real opposition. And it's gotten a lot of attention since. So it seems kind of favored. But I believe that map 6 and its variants are just plain bad. Anyone can see it. They split up communities of interest, and they seemingly put together random neighborhoods instead of ones that make sense. As communities that would vote together. My neighborhood might be represented by somebody who lives across town, across the park. Defeating the entire purpose of districts, honestly. The name Help People Vote is a joke. Help People Vote for whom? Incumbent city council members and their friends? I should try to assume good faith, but it's very difficult when I see this type of map move forward. It seems it does not comply with the Fair Maps Act, the Fair Maps Act criteria that we heard from the demographer earlier. Look at how it splits up the avenues by slicing lines along West First Ave, Oleander Ave, the East Streets neighborhood just south of Little, eh, Lower Bidwell Park is cut up with a block extending downward. And this should be easy to draw a line here. But somebody drew it jagged. So I guess some people are better at drawing maps than others. To, you know, roll off of Sean's jokes. So, map six, three, six, and seven in that map would be indescribable if somebody asked which district they live in. They reach out in strange shapes, grab chunks of random communities. And that's also true of map six's derivatives. Okay, so, I'm a little offended that council moved forward that map. It seems as though there must be some intention behind it. I don't know if this is it. But I do know that two city council members live just north of Bidwell Park in a largely Democratic area. And their residences are in peninsulas attached to redder areas at the end of the street. And they're located at the east and north edges of town. So that could be why. So, if people were complaining about the crappy maps drawn by the liberal city council majority two years ago, they better be out here telling city council how bad this looks. Unless you want to repeat the folly of the council two years ago by drawing districts around incumbents and turning public sentiment against you, I urge you to scrap Public Submission 6, 7, and any fruit of those poison trees and adopt good, sensible maps. Thank you. Kirk Mumford follows up. This is a proposal by Angela McLaughlin. Hello. Kirk Mumford. I live at 227 West 3rd Avenue. I think it was, I was trying to find the maps that, he had them up there earlier. But I looked yesterday and the day before and I couldn't find them except, I mean, I thought I'd get a handout tonight that worked. I didn't get the new submissions. They were shown when he did his presentation. But I think it's, I think the ones I settled on, looking at the maps I had, were Demographer Map 5, I think it was, and Goldstein 1000. They both preserved the Canaan neighborhoods. And that was the picture. That's the picture I had at the last meeting, which was an argument in favor of preserving communities of interest. And I think that those two maps do. They both run from basically the channel in the north to the creek in the south, the one that runs through Chico Campus. And they carve out the student neighborhoods. So the student neighborhoods, basically, on those two maps, I think it's Demographer 5 and Goldstein 1000. There's a student area. There's a Canaan neighborhood. And it looked to me like the Barber neighborhood was also preserved. I didn't know enough about the eastern part of the town to comment. So I couldn't sort out. But my main interest was preserving the Canaan neighborhood and the Barber neighborhood and the student areas. And it looks to me like those two maps did it. Okay. So I would urge you to pick one of those two or three maps. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Ms. Michelle McLaughlin, followed by Nicole Nava. Good evening. I agree with many folks who have already spoken this evening, the lack of transparency and anonymous submissions are extremely concerning. The Demographer has suggested that these maps were submitted by local folks, but we don't have any reason to believe that that's actually true. given what occurred with county redistricting where we witnessed Republican Brian Dahl's staff members attempting to subvert the interests of Butte County which he doesn't even represent. There's no reason to think that something similar hasn't occurred here that these maps weren't submitted by for instance his chief of staff Josh Cook or some other Republican operative or development interests. Public submission map 6 and its variants are awful. They shouldn't even be considered. Those districts stretching out looks like a squid. The help people vote map has major issues carving up the carving up the neighborhoods has has previously been noted. The two demographer maps 4 and 5 certainly certainly seem acceptable but but they are nowhere near as good as planning commissioner Bryce Goldstein's maps. There's just no substitute for her deep local knowledge and that's evident in the way she's preserved communities of interest in these maps. The actions of the council have been egregiously partisan prior to this. Your willingness to pander to special interests and the angry mob have cost the city millions of dollars. We're now having to be supervised by a federal judge to ensure that we don't violate people's civil rights going forward. You have another chance here an opportunity to act in actual community interests instead of pandering to special interests. We're watching. Nicole Nava followed by Jessica Giannola. Good evening council. Last I checked I was a local citizen just up the street just be on the record so I'm asking the city to council to adopt public submission map 6c AKA Nicole Nava's submission. I believe that map 6c best reflects the communities of interest in Chico. This map captures almost all the feedback provided during public committee committee committee committee committee committee committee committee committee committee committee committee committee committee committee committee committee committee committee committee by Chico State staff in 2018, and further, I posted open opportunities to provide feedback far and wide on social media, including City of Chico's Engage Chico Forum. I also put out an open call for a bus tour of our city's neighborhoods, which we conducted, and a meeting was held afterward. I also held several other meetings with community members in all different areas of Chico to solicit their feedback. All of what I described was taken into account for Map 6C to the greatest extent possible while staying within the acceptable population deviations, and I was told this map had one, if not the lowest population deviation was acceptable via the Fair Maps Act. So I'm going to part from that for one second, and I am concerned also about partisan behavior. So some of the maps submitted by Bryce Goldstein, and you heard some of the comments here today, in a different map exercise with the Chico University, I'm going to talk a little bit about the map exercise with the Chico University, and I am going to talk a little bit about the map exercise with the Chico University, I am going to talk a little bit about the map exercise with the Chico University, and am going to a little about the map exercise exercise exercise exercise exercise! and I'm excited to provide input on yours. I support the orange map options. By the way, those were submitted very last minute and were very oddly drawn. I ordinarily do not support drawing districts around incumbents. However, after reading the analysis of demographics and neighborhoods, the proposed districts in orange do a great job of equitably drawing the community into sensible districts. So I see no reason to choose another map over the orange and deny people the chance to reelect the candidates of their choice. So that to me doesn't sound like someone who's not real interested in keeping things clean and tidy on a map. It's not all about colors. It is about people. And so I spent hours and hours and hours on my maps. My name was attached to the email. Y'all are very well versed at PRAs. I've seen it. I know it. And I did it to protect and preserve my intact house. And things that have happened previously and to not draw exactly the connotations that were drawn here by having my name associated with it. I live here. I'm passionate. I come here all the time. You know that. I also held those communities intact. Sorry if people have questions about the community interest. I do have them. Thank you. Jessica Giannola followed by Addison Winslow. Hi, Council. It's like Chico's turn for the districts here. I just want to start with the last time that we did our district mapping, there was a map that was suggested that would have excluded Shawn Morgan from rerunning if he chose to. And I publicly objected to that one just because I think fair maps are important. And if we can make a map that is going to allow communities to stay together and not purposely shut anyone out, then we should go for that. We've had a lot of examples lately of redistricting. We had the county. We had the county that was we had the school district. And now we have us here. And we should have cued in to what the public is saying when it comes to favoring maps. And it's communities staying together, neighborhoods staying together, and not making a map that's going to push anyone out or make it possible for a incumbent or a potential partisan party to come in and try and take that district, that territory over. And yet we keep seeing these instances. And we had with the county, we had Josh Cook, who is a Republican strategist, design the map that was chosen. And that's caused a lot of problems. We've got litigation and a lot of upset people because it just isn't fair. We can clearly see what's happening. And I'd hate for us to end up in another lawsuit if that is proven. But I think we're getting better at hiding that, right? Because it's prove it. And if we have a map that we can't see who made it, then we're going to have to do it. And I think that's a lot of problems. And I think we should take time to take time to take time to take time to take time to take time to take time It's looking really funky. It's not holding clear boundaries and lines. Why was it drawn that way? And what is the benefit? And the benefit is allowing more conservative votes per district to kind of clues us into why it was built that way. I do support, of course, Goldstein's 1,000. She's got 2C and 2D. And she's very knowledgeable. She shouldn't be discounted because she's not a conservative. She's very knowledgeable about maps in our city and language language language language language things considerations here and it just because a map does allow for incumbents to rerun it doesn't mean that the other considerations aren't there if the communities are together then it makes sense to go with that one that is what I believe that that statement would have meant is let's not discount it because y'all can run again because it's satisfying all these other areas that are important to the people just a lot of stuff of this here one last note it's just I feel like every time we see an attempt at partisan influence when it comes to these redistricting we're just basing this all off of like fear and control the fear of losing out on the control the situation is too tempting that when it comes to this point we're selecting that final map are we selecting it based off of the most important things first say! and not who's gonna win next time that's all thanks Addison Winslow followed by Katie Posey I just have a couple things I agree with most of the commenters that are here tonight I live in the West Ave and like a lot of people I think the avenues is a really good neighborhood to keep intact but I'm also in sort of a transition area so some of it can go towards a student area and as long as those areas are kept like somewhat defined and compact I think that's that's good and the majority of maps are going to be in the West Ave and the majority of maps are just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just being able to walk and bike comfortably and having parks nearby and mixed use. Also, the amount of tax revenue that they get out of those areas is distinct from a lot of suburbs where they lose a lot in comparison to the infrastructure that it takes to maintain it. So they have a distinct interest in the way that our public dollars are spent and the way that their infrastructure priorities go about. There's very few maps that don't split Dome Hill from Marion Park. It seems like it was taken, especially in the Help Chico Vote map. They pinch off Marion Park into southwest Chico, which seems very, very deliberate. And I don't know if that's thinking that Marion Park might be more like people out there, but I don't see a good explanation for that. And it shares a lot of characteristics with that area. Along the bike path, there's a lot of affordable housing there that should all be kept in a district. But I see the effect of splitting up that area is that you have... suburban, of a distinct style of suburban development, making a majority of two different districts rather than one of those districts that would have a greater share of people who have values that you might find in the center of Chico. People who intentionally live in the center of the area because they don't want to have to drive everywhere. They don't want all of our infrastructure dollars to be oriented towards helping people drive everywhere. I think Goldstein 1000 is the only map that I think really, really does a good job of that. The original one, creating this fire district. Especially the one that pinches up into... the north end of town has discontinuous areas of districts, I think does the worst job of that. And certainly makes it... will make it difficult in the future for people to understand who they're voting for. And it has a negative impact upon public participation. This should be a chance to... to really create some local identity for people, a neighborhood identity. And the last time, some of the Goldstein maps really focused on those creek lines. And you'd think that it would be a lot easier to do good maps. Because we do have... we have these creeks that really define where people live in town. But I'm not seeing a lot of it in the maps that are chosen. Sites that demographers in Goldstein. Thanks. Thank you. Katie Posey followed by Nick Hart. Hi everyone. Great to see the plexiglass gone. Okay. So... I live in the Barber neighborhood and I'm going to mention that I like map 6C. Because it does have Merriam Park connected to Barber. And the reason that I like that connection is because we know that the old diamond match property is going to have this large development. That's going to take... It's going to be spread over many years. So it's the same developer working on that that worked on Merriam Park. So I think that that's a great connection because there are similar elements and advocacy that can go forward because of that connection. So that's the reason why I like those two. Two neighborhoods being unified. So I know it's a challenge to keep communities of interest together. I do think 6C does that. But I also appreciate the efforts of all the members of the public and the demographer at the maps that they've given us. But I do want to just put my support behind map 6C. Thanks so much. Thank you. Nick Hart followed by Ruth Sarnoff. Good evening, Mr. Mayor, members of council. I would just like to raise a few comments about several maps tonight. I'll start with some concerns I have about maps 6 and the derivatives. Specifically, some folks have already spoken to the districts that contain Barber as well as sort of Cal Park, Merriam Park as the primary neighborhoods. So I will defer to the experiences of folks who live there. But what I do have concerns about is the wildfires. So just a quick summary of the boundaries. So just a quick summary of the boundaries. So just a quick summary of the boundaries. So just a quick summary of the boundaries. So just a quick summary of the boundaries So just a quick summary So just a quick summary So just a quick summary So just a quick summary So just a quick summary So just a quick summary So just a quick summary So just a quick summary So just a quick summary So just a quick summary So just a quick summary So just a quick summary So just a quick summary of folks in that area to feel connected with folks in the primary core of the district. I would like to speak in favor of maps 2B, C, and demographer map 4B because their wildfire districts do not have the same effect of slicing off portions of the population in very disparate parts of town. And they're generally, in my opinion, much more compact in keeping the primary neighborhoods of Chico together. Thank you. Thank you. Rustarna, followed by Austin Barron. Thank you. I was, today I just read a piece by Rick Silva. No more Greenvilles, Paradises, Concours, Concouse, or Berry Creeks. And it kind of brought to mind to me the fact that the whole purpose of the redistricting was to guarantee equal voting rights and the purpose of that. Also, there are other issues because the way districts are set up will determine how what's left of our water is used. So there's a water issue. I am in the midst of putting together the weather maps for, about three years, of here in Chico from the enterprise record, that is, they link together. And I, through that, I can show, and I'm putting it in a big, big book right now, and you'll see it soon, and you will see that we have been in extreme weather on the planet, and in California, And it's very important that these broader issues be considered. The other thing that I wanted to mention is the issue, it's an immediate issue. And that is the fluorescent lighting and that new lead lighting is very, very poisonous. And it's got all the elements, different colors in it, the new. And I haven't had time to research it all. But I can tell you those need to come out of the gyms and different places. And they need to be wrapped because at the point that we don't have energy anymore and that we have to move into living naturally in the world, and I think that I've spoken to that before, it will be important that those not be up there because there's a lot of volcanic action taking place on the planet right now. And that extreme weather is affecting all that. That should be handled. Thank you. Okay, Austin Barron, followed by Adam Fedele. Good afternoon, Council. Thank you. I'll just give it relatively short because I don't have too much to say. I do support MAP 6C simply because the ALUC, the Airport Land Use Compatibility Plan, does seem to be kept together in these districts and cut up in the other ones. And I think that's kind of a unique issue when developing in that area. And there's a lot of new apartments, new housing developments going out there. And to split up those districts seems kind of... You probably want to avoid that. I did hear a lot of the public comment, a lot of friends comment about the bar being connected to Merion Park as well. And that may be a good idea to keep those two together simply because it is the same developer. It may not be. But in my opinion, the MAP 6C should be the way to go. Thank you. Thank you. Adam Fedele. Good evening, Council. Mayor Coolidge, Vice Mayor Reynolds. Thank you all for serving. I want to take a little bit different take on this. I would strongly suggest that you adopt a MAP, whichever one it is, that really takes into account neighborhood planning boundaries. There's three distinct neighborhood plans in Chico. The Southwest Chico Neighborhood Improvement Plan. I live in that district. The KCAP. The KCAP plan, which was adopted right before ours was. And then Chapman Mulberry that we've recently annexed. In my opinion, having been a big participant in the Southwest Chico Neighborhood plan and the creation of that, neighborhood plans represent hundreds of hours of community input, effort, and work, and city tax dollars. So these things really should be considered strongly, in my opinion. I believe that the Goldstein maps and the demographer maps largely take that into account. But six and its derivatives and seven do not take that into account very well. So I would use that criteria if I were you all. And just a note on Merriam Park and Southwest Chico, they should not be connected. They are very distinctly different neighborhoods. Just because they have the same developer doesn't make any difference. Because his vision for Merriam Park is completely different from his vision for Barber Yard. I have that from the horse's mouth. So thank you all very much. Thank you. He was our last speaker. All right. Council comment? Let me start. So I have a couple of things. One, I have our original plan right here that we got the very first time. And it's listed on here. Demarco proposals one, two, and three. And public submissions number one through seven. So I don't know where the public, only two public submissions came from. But there's one through seven right here. And that's our original thing that came through. So just kind of clear that up. Census tracts. Last time I checked, none of them are all completely contiguous. And not nice, neat little lines. And while we're... While we're drawing these, I think we have to do the best... We have to keep census tracts together. So sometimes they're going to be neat and sometimes they're not. I heard a lot of things about different boundaries and creeks and things like that. But we also have things like Highway 99 and Esplanade, which are very clear natural boundaries. I think can be used as well. The fire district. Putting land in a fire district doesn't make it a fire district. But the people that are next to the land are the people that are in that district. So I would just... I think we need to think about the people that are affected by what's next to the land. And what else? I think that was just a few things that I wanted to mention that I heard that I just wanted to point out that I heard some just misinformation or some things that I want to get clarification on. Thanks. All right. Further comment? Okay. I've heard comments from the citizens concerned about some of the maps being drawn by certain individuals. And maybe that's valid. Maybe it is not valid. I don't know. But I'm leaning towards the demographer's maps since they're not... They're not... He's hired to do a job, period. And I think you've done a very good job. And the rest of this chatter about who did what and maybe something happened. It could be easily eliminated. I think. And I'm suggesting that we all give some thought to that and stay with the demographer who's a neutral... That's what I'm looking for. I was trying to find it. Neutral party. And I've heard... I've been marking on my notes comments from people about what they like, what they don't like. And I'm leaning very strongly towards demographer 4B and demographer 5B. The numbers. The numbers are pretty good. They... The maps seem reasonable. So those are my comments. Maybe just stay away from... I'm getting back... I'm repeating myself now. Maybe stay away from or look closely at the rest of them. And maybe put them aside at least for our conversation. We're just having a discussion. And those are some of my thoughts. I might have some more thoughts. But right now, that's it. Thank you. Council Member Bennett, thank you for those notes. I think they're appropriate and honorable. I concur with that as well. If I can ask the demographer to come back up real quick. I should have you sitting up front. It's a long walk. Can you... Well, you might need your computer. I was just wondering if there's any way you could bring up the current maps. Sure. You have a computer. Never mind. I just can't see it. Yeah. There we go. All right. Let me get the zoom out a little on that. And then... Sorry. Which ones would you like to see? The current. Oh, the current map? Yeah. Oh. Hold on. Our current district. That's on a... Yeah, a little more. Something you haven't been doing. I mean, you know. Oh, this is... Oh, this is... I figured it'd take you minutes if I... Actually, here. It's on the second public hearing. There we go. And let me put it into a slideshow format. Yeah. Definitely not the cleanest map I've ever seen. Oops. You almost had it. There you go. All right. I think it's just a good point. I think it's just a good reference point as to what was created versus what we're looking at now with a lot of the, you know, coys, as we call them, completely obliterated. And anyway, just some thought there. But I think it's worthwhile to just look at. Did anyone else have comments? Yeah. I'll make some comments. I think it's going to sound a little redundant. When I look at these maps, I'm looking for maps with clean lines that follow natural boundaries that are compact, where it would be as effortless as possible for residents to understand which district they live in. Community submitted maps don't do that, aside from, frankly, Goldstein 1000 and its variations, which shouldn't be a surprise given Ms. Goldstein's history in drawing maps. The other community submitted maps draw jagged districts with many dips and rope around communities. The optics are bad. They look like they're tailored to interest beyond the ones that have been expressed or that are outlined in the Fair Maps Act. They're not logical, and that's why I think people are questioning them. It doesn't make sense. I've scoured them, trying to figure it out. These two were submitted by some anonymous folks, only one of which identified themselves as Nicole Naba tonight. That those would be the ones that have been championed at the last meeting is a little bit befuddling to me. I think it's incredibly valuable for the community to participate in the map submission process. It does strike me as odd that people can maintain anonymity and not be here to be questioned about the process that led them to the maps that they've created. Okay. Thank you. As it relates to the demographer submitted maps, I think 4B and 5B are adequate in addressing neighborhoods, communities of interest, easily identifiable districts, residents, easily identifiable boundaries. To Councilmember Bennett's point, I'd be happy to move forward with either of those. I think the Goldstein maps do the same. I think the other maps do an incredible disservice to Chico, to our voters, to our constituents, and just don't make actual logical sense. So if we're following the Fair Maps Act and its guidelines, which were just outlined by our demographer, we should be looking at the demographer 4B and 5B and the Goldstein maps, period. Anything other than that appears to prioritize things far outside the Fair Maps Act, and I and the public can only really speculate about what that means. Just because it's legal doesn't mean it's fair, doesn't mean it's ethical, doesn't mean it's appropriate for the people of Chico, and I hope you will all remember that. Go ahead. You have a comment? No. Anyone else? I would just say last time, and, you know, I'm looking at this, I mean, the student area is broken in three parts, so I don't think we did a great job last time around, and hopefully we can do a better job this time. But I would concur. You know, everybody speculates that, you know, everybody's got negative and terrible intentions, and I think that's a good thing. I don't know where at least two of my council members live, so I have no idea. But yeah, just when I look at the old map, and having run for election with the old map, it was a mess. I was located on a peninsula, in fact. But yeah, I think we can do better than that. That's not going to be very hard. Okay. I'd be willing to make a motion to move us forward, since it sounds like we want to move forward to the next and minimize the maps, taking into consideration everybody's consideration, the demographer, Goldstein, NAVA. Then my next cursor to that would be the lowest deviation. So if you take one from each of those with the lowest deviations, that would be maps 5B, 6C, and 2C. With the deviations of 6.86, 3.13, and 4.37, I would make a motion that we move those three forward and continue public input deliberation and come back at a regular scheduled meeting on the 5th and make a decision. Okay. Could you say those again? So 5B, 6C, and 2C. And I chose those because those are the three from the three different groups with the lowest deviation of... 5B, 6C. And 2C. 2C. I think we all have to glance at those real quick. Can you pull those up? Yeah. Sure. Thank you. Council Member Brown, sorry. All right. So... I know this might not capture all the communities of interest, but if you could also highlight the communities of interest as you've defined them. Yes. No. Okay. So... Yours and the... Yes. I'll go through each one. So this is the one, you know, the demographer-defined communities of interest based on input from council and various public testimony. Which map is highlighted over that? Oh, I'm sorry. It's 5B. Okay. Thank you. So I'm going to start with demographer at 5B and then go to the other two. Sounds good. Thank you. So in here, that was a major factor was trying to keep Kena whole based on information received from the city planning department as well as local resident of the avenues. This is the Nava Koi. I see Kena is also in the... I see Kena is also in the... Yes. Intact. Yes. Thank you. And Goldstein Koi. One. Same thing. All the neighborhoods they put, Dough Mill, Marion Park, Barber, Chapman Mulberry, East... They divided Kena. They divided Kena into East and West and then the student area. A portion of that northern part is in a separate district due to population issues. Now, we'll go to... Let's see. Let's see. There we go. Okay. So, Goldstein, our public submission 2C. Virtually, for the most part, many of them are of the... The mark for defined communities of interest are in one district. The Avenue 32 corridor slightly... The avenue 32 corridor slightly goes into District 5 and... All right. Let's see, actually, is this District... As well as a portion of the student area goes into District 7. Just to be clear, your definition of the Kena neighborhood is based on something from the Kena Association, as well as planning, right? Yes. Okay, just making sure. Thank you. Thank you, Kona. This is from the Navaco. Fire area in one district. Southwest portion in District 7. Student and K-9 neighborhoods kind of straddle between 4 and 5, but for the most part, majority are in one district. Goldstein Koi 1 keeps them together. As I mentioned too with Kena, there seems to be debate on the boundaries. And the student area, pretty much the district here is a, District 4 is a student district. So that's a little bit of a difference. But that's how they create it. Now we'll go to the final one. Public submission 6C. Demographer defined communities of interest. As I mentioned, Kena does go between three different districts in District 7. So we'll take a look at this version. Although Barber and Chapman Town stayed together in one district. Student area and Avenue 32 corridor stays in one district. The NavacoFort has a mixed collection of is um split a little bit um the student area is um more or less is in one district except for one tiny block here um and the kena one is mostly in kena is mostly in one district on the northern side is split into district one fire area hole goldstein one for the most part most are actually in one district doe mill marion park um and um chapman mulberry and barber are in one district um their kena um neighborhood boundaries is mostly in one district with slight um dip into district five down here um um and goldstein koi two the student areas um mostly in um one one district um with a slight um the top similar to demarc for map five going into um a separate district and that completes the review of all the the three maps so vice mayor you said 5b 6c and 2c correct correct 5b demographer 6c public and 2c public that's my motion to move forward i'll second your motion that seems to be what we're waiting for i'll uh i'll make a substitute motion in line with council member bennett's comments um to move forward for b and five the two demographer maps here we have a motion and we have a substitute motion which is move forward five b and four what yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah sorry that's okay so substitute motion have a second dies for lack of a second discussion you know i i would definitely be and maybe i can ask you this too is i'd definitely be more apt to look at 6c if we could get rid of that square of broken down and then move forward to the next one so just take a second just take a second just take a second just take a second just take a second just take a second just take a second just take a second just take a second just take a second just take a second just take a second just take a second just take a second just take a second just take a second just take a second just take a second just take a second just take a second just take a second just take a second just take a second just take purple. I'm going to put the legend up. Okay. That'd be helpful. There we go. Okay. So the purple part, so if you go into D4, District 6, and the purple part that goes into the mustard colored part down further, yeah, right there. So this right here, right there, yes, just doesn't look natural to me, but if it was migrated over here, it would seem to make more sense to me. Then these start looking like maps that maybe would work, and keep in mind that this doesn't put me in my dish, or puts me in Sean's dish, which is fine. I am. Anyway, so no self-interest in that respect, but I'd be much more comfortable if it was changed, but if we move forward this map, we can make that, we could say that we want that change, correct? Here's the, so I could make the change, but it has to be posted a week prior, based on Fair Maps Act. There has to be a week posting, and the meeting is one week away. Oh, okay. Bummer. Yeah, I mentioned it last time, but I think it just got, there were a lot of comments, so. All right. Further comment from Council? Call the question. Call it. Yep. There we go. Okay. Council Member Bennett? Could you repeat the motion? So the motion is to move maps 5B, 6C, 2C from the three different groups. With the lowest deviation, forward for consideration at next week's meeting. Yes. Okay. All right. Council Member Brown? This map should never be considered, but for the sake of moving forward the other two, aye. Council Member Morgan? Yes. Council Member O'Brien? Yes. Council Member Tandon? Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds? Aye. Mayor Coolidge? Aye. Carries 7-0. All right. Thank you, everybody. And with that, we will take public comment on closed session. Okay. We have two speakers. All right. Three minutes. And the first speaker is Nicole Nava, followed by Ruth Starnoff. And this is on closed session, Warren versus the City of Chico. Good evening again. So my comment is, I'm directed on, as it always is, in closed session for Warren v. Chico. And sorry for those of you that hear some of this regurgitated time and again, but I will keep this in front of you, that it is distressing that this is always happening under closed session, that we have no information on the homeless update as far as the, what I deem the pallet palace, and enforcement. I'm living across in an area where directly I have an impact. There was a stabbing on my street. I think sometimes people think because I am who I am and I come here frequently, I get things ascribed to me that are not necessarily true, right? And I have facts to back up my positions. And so I do feel unsafe. Other people in my area feel unsafe. Other people all across Chico feel unsafe. We'd like to understand when are we going to start hearing about enforcement and plans to get our community back to a good and healthy place? It is not healthy for the humans that are out front right now to be living as they are. It is not right that people who are not cottage industry food providers are allowed to come and deliver food here and leave chaos and trash everywhere for the rest of us. So when you are discussing these things, I hope we're wrapping up the rules that have to apply at this pallet palace that I found it laughable at an earlier comment about transparency. And little things that might be going on with certain people, because I would remind a specific council member, Brown, that it is the Brown New Deal, in fact, that brought all of this to our community. And that I am actually someone who for five years have stood up here asking for mental health treatment, drug abuse treatment, tried to ask you all to get on a page and bring something forward to that, which we're finally getting that. But meanwhile, this is allowed to remain. Enforcement doesn't happen. Who told you? Who told originally people to stand down? Hmm, I wonder who that would be. So this is what we're left with. We're left with stabbings on our streets. We're left with screaming all night, by the way, till 2.30 the other night. I had to call security to come and get all my stuff retuned to keep an eye on what's going on because it's gotten ridiculous. Today a man came. I was on a work call. I had to literally put myself on a pause during work hours because of someone screaming and running by with all their stuff and having a mental health issue. It is they need to be engaged. They need to be cared for. They need to be prioritized. And I would hope we're not cherry picking people who are perceived would be easier to be there and make good press and good optics. You need to be addressing the ones that are the repeat offender types that are always in social media pages, getting interaction with police. Those are the people that actually should probably be at the pallet palace being prioritized first so that we can get some relief at the public at large. Thank you. Great. Ruth Sarnoff is our last speaker. And Ruth, just make sure your comments are on Warren versus Chico, please. I am very concerned about the fact that there's been so little information about the court orders and around the homeless population here. I want to also bring to your attention the fact that we have all these um, um, the, um, um, um, the things that the, the, uh, I spoke about it before. I'm very tired, but the, the fluorescence and the CDs. And I, um, I also, uh, have seen what, um, has happened with the homeless community in terms of not really being, it's not really being portrayed adequately. In the press or anywhere else. And this is a real, um, problem of transparency. And, um, I think it too. Um, I think the whole issue of segregation and we lived in California and around the world with, uh, lots of things that restricted people of color and people of color. So just the maps that I have put together and so the maps cover about a three-year period and in three years it's been heavily extreme weather and I would say that's climate change and I think that to disregard that and because your own kids play ball in those big arenas and they're full of lead lights and in many of the buildings here in Chico there are still fluorescents and those are very dangerous at a time. Thank you Mrs. Larner. Have a good evening. All right we will take a 10-minute recess and join into closed session. Thank you. Thank you.
