 Don't worry we've played this game before. All right we'll call the regular meeting of Thursday May 16th of the City of Chico Planning Commission to order and I'll start with the pledge. So salute and pledge. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands one nation under God indivisible with liberty and justice for all. And roll call please. Commissioner Scarpa. Aye. Or here. Commissioner Wolfe. Present. Commissioner Poulin. Here. Commissioner Laffin. Here. Commissioner Cooper is absent. Vice Chair Scott. Present. Chair Wall is absent. Okay before we move on to the consent agenda just an announcement on the speaker cards. Anyone wishing to attend? I'm going to ask the commission to address the commission on any matter. You can grab a speaker card from the back and bring it up to Nicole and those are taken in the order the cards are received. So consent agenda. Are there any speaker cards for the consent agenda? No. Is there anybody wishing to speak on the consent agenda? All right. These are considered routine and can be approved by one motion. Do I have a motion to approve the consent agenda? I'll make a motion to approve. Thank you. So we have a motion from Commissioner Poulin. Is there a second? Second. I'll take Commissioner Wolfe second. All in favor of approving the consent agenda signify by saying aye. Aye. Any opposed? So that motion carries 5-0 with two absent. We'll move on to public comments. Members of the public may address the commission at this time. On any matter not already listed on the agenda. So is there anybody here to speak on an item that's not on the agenda for tonight? Do you have any cards? No. All right. We will move on to public hearings. And why don't we do our ex parte communication for item 4.1, 4.2, and 4.3 all at the same time. So is there any? Sorry, can I come back to this, come back to this, come back to this, come back to this, come back to this, come back to this, come back to this, come back to this, come back to this, come back to this, come back to this, come back to this, come back to this, come back to this, come back to this, come back to this, come back to this, come back to this, come back to this, come back to this, come back to this, come back to this, come back to this, come back to this, come back to this, come back to this, come back to this, come back to this, come back to this, come back to this, come back to this, come back to this, come back to this, come back to this, come back to this, come back to this, come back to this, come back to this, come back to this, come back to this, come back to this, come back to this, come back to this, come back The proposal would subdivide the 20-acre site into four different parcels. Parcel 1 would be 11, almost 12 acres, and would comprise half R3 zoning and half R4 zoning, which is very high-density residential. And then parcel 2 would be 2.2 acres. It's some community commercial. Parcel 3 is also some community commercial, and it would be a little over half an acre. In addition, the parcel would be created for Lot A, which would encompass the Dead Horse Slough and two zoning districts there. We have Open Space 1, Open Space 2 there for the channel and right-carrying zone. The project would be accessed by a new street connection at Sierra Sunrise Terrace that would come off to the west here and over a bridge, a new clear-span bridge over Dead Horse Slough that would provide access to all the parcels. This is showing the direction of flow for Dead Horse Slough. There was a project approved here years ago, and it was called the Town Home Project. It was approved for 200-some-odd town homes on the site, and that was right in 2007 when it was a markedly difficult time to develop, and that entitlement expired. So now the applicant is back to resubdivide the site in a very similar way. The second page of this parcel map shows the initial. improvements. We do have conditions that would require these initial improvements to go in before the map is recorded so that we know we have legal access to all the parcels. And that would create a fourth leg on that intersection, and it would become a signalized intersection either with this project or with the hotel project, or perhaps with the Bruce Road widening project, whoever shows up first to build it. As well as conditions to require access, shared access on the private road, and a condition that required that they be able to access the private road. And that would be to maintain the private road and bridge as approved so that it remains in good condition. There is some tree removal associated with this new private road. There's probably going to be additional tree removal with the development of the lots, especially parcel three. But right now that's not necessary for the map to move forward. We would deal with that subsequent tree removal later. They're all really kind of small trees. There's a lot of cottonwoods in there. There are oaks in there, but most of them are small. All of them are small, actually. So, we're going to be looking at that. The site does have many wetland features. And this is a map showing you. In blue, those are vernal pool features. And the little orange one down here. Those are vernal pools, and that creates this very special habitat type that's habitat for all kinds of critters that I'll talk about in a minute. And then over here, closer to Bruce Road, there's just seasonal wetlands. And those are different types of habitat that don't provide a suitable place for Butte County meadow foam and other vernal critters. So, we're going to be looking at that. and other vernal pool type species. So, we did an initial study. We looked at the biology. There's a lot of biological resources out there. We have lots and lots of reports on those. They even went through the trouble of getting some permits from agencies, fish and wildlife, California Fish and Wildlife, U.S. Fish and Wildlife. And so, they set themselves up. And we have some idea of what those agencies will be wanting. So, we have mitigation for all these different things. I won't read them all. But of note, after the first one, we're going to be looking at the! So, we're going to be looking at the different habitat number to be used. And we're not so sure about exactly how that's going to shake out. And we purposely wrote the mitigation to be flexible based on whatever is eventually decided. Because this is the trustee agency in charge of the resource and regulating it. So, it's flexible based on future surveys and what Fish and Wildlife requires. That's what that mitigation will also require. So, we're not creating a discontinuity between the two. Okay. Thank you. I do want to thank Commissioner Wolf for giving us some heads up today on some questions that he had. I will address a couple of them now. One was the noticing. If you notice on the notification map that we provide with the project, there are some parcels that don't have a dot on the notification parcel. And the way we do that is we notify all the property owners. And if there's a dot, that means there's an address on the site to also notify. So, we would provide additional notification to that address. So, those are just parcels that are undeveloped and no site address to send one to. Just send it to the owners. And we did do that. We did send it to the owners in that case. I'm trying to remember the other stuff. But I guess I'll let Commissioner Wolf ask the questions when we get there. Staff is recommending that the map is consistent with the zoning and general plan. That all the mitigation measures do reduce the environmental impacts to a less than significant level. And we are recommending approval of the parcel map tonight. Thank you. Thank you, Mike. With that, I'll answer any questions you have. Thank you. Any questions? Maybe we'll start with Commissioner Wolf. Yeah, thanks, Mike. This is a site that's been, you know, waiting for development for a long time. And I think resolving the Meadow Foam situation is a great move forward. This is the part of Chico that's really happening right now and will be in the foreseeable future. With respect to the comments from CDFW. It's a great move forward. I think they indicated, I think that they wanted to see the whole site surveyed again for the resources. And the way the conditions are right now, I think it just speaks to parcel one. Do we need to change anything there or will it just be that whatever CDFW requires as part of their permitting is what's going to happen? The latter. Whatever CDFW is going to require will be part of the permitting. There's a good reason, though, why we didn't include it. It's because there's a little bit of a grade break between the vernal pool species, the wetland species, and the wetland species over on the other side. And as I was saying, the belief of the biologists, for the applicant at least, is that it's not suitable habitat for a Bucown and Meadow Foam. But they might have to prove that to CDFW. Got it. Thanks. Oh, I did recall the other one. It was there is an error in exhibit two of the resolution regarding the numbering of the conditions. Microsoft Word is so smart. It started the numbers over in the middle of the stack again. But I fixed that on the, you know, the, you know, the, you know, the, you know, the, you know, the, you know, the, you know, the, you know, the, you know, the, you know, the, you know, the, you know, the, you know, the, you know, the, you know, the, you know, the, you know, the, you know, the, you know, the, you know, the, you know, the, you know, the, you know, the, you know, the, you know, the, you know, the, you know, the, you know, the, you know, the, you know, the, you know, the, you know, the, you know, the, you know, the, you know, the, you know, the, you know, the, you know, the, you know, the, you know, the, you should be permanently protected and managed. I have concerns about the credits to this nebulous mitigation bank. The use of mitigation banks also don't precisely match the ecological functions of the impacted wetlands most of the time. Also, they only occur in Butte County. What mitigation banks will the credits be credited to? Will they include propagation of new vernal pools for habitat? Mitigation banks should be used to be identified in order to reasonably consider off-site mitigation. Long-term successes of the creation of vernal pools and Metaphone are not well documented to be successful and cannot be guaranteed. On CDFW's website, there was only one available that I saw that could potentially work, which was the Westervelt Ecological Services, and they don't include mention of Butte County Metaphone. I don't really see it as a demonstration of feasibility. I would like to see some on-site preservation, and I do know that the vernal pools and the Butte County Metaphone do take up a lot of parcel 1. From at least one map that I saw for the biological opinion for the Metaphone, most of it I at least saw was closer to Highway 32 and the left edge of the site. And I think that the experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience the! could you describe how the mitigation bank program works insofar as mitigation of impacts is concerned? creating a mitigation bank is very difficult the only one that is hoped to come online soon and all the agencies hope for it the writing permits for them to mitigate at this bank it' s called sycamore creek bank up by the airport it takes a long time to generate the proof to the agencies that this is a viable site and so over I think over the past decade plus they've been trying to do that and they are seem to be very close permanently but at some point it will become an established bank and they will issue credits based on adopted measurement tech measurement methodologies for figuring out how much you need to mitigate and then they're mitigating at 19 to 1 so if you destroy one acre you have to protect 19 over there so that would be a very s to offset the fact that you might not have as much success at an off site mitigation bank. The developer has to they will issue a permit it' s okay to grade this site but first you have to go buy credits at the bank and then they go there and they buy the approved amount or required amount of credits and those are very expensive and then once they prove to the agency they have acquired those credits then they will get permission to enter thank you Mr. Skarp I raised an important point and that was the matter of feasibility in order for a mitigation measure to be effective and appropriate it needs to be feasible. It sounds like there' s a bank that' s very nearly ready but maybe isn' t quite there is there an issue with feasibility? so far as implementing this mitigation measure? local community and also a lot of biological opinions from the fish and wildlife service that said we will mitigate you at three to one out there using a different measurement methodology. so the agencies involved in the actual permitting are anticipating that bank coming on and they' re okay with that mitigation approach? yes and based on that interactions and documents that' s been made with the agency and the agency is going to be I heard from the applicant that there are some grant funds to purchase parcel one from the applicant and that' s something the applicant can speak more to than me it was something I heard from him and fish and wildlife when I had them on the phone it sounds like that might happen and this might become a preserve all by itself. I did have another in general question is parcel one the best site for development for high density residential along the highway out of town especially with no residential willingness and then I did see that cdfw was interested in purchasing it so I just yeah that' s great information I just don' t know if that' s the best for residential but I do know we may have to deal with no net loss law if you take. we left this out of the question. s the best for the housing element because it had the resources on there. just one quick question would you mind going back to the Galloway photo with? I really appreciated the letter from the central valley flood protection board I think one of the things that we have up here is the kind of insight of what some major climate impacts have been as far as the atmospheric rivers and things that we' ve had since this was first approved. I' m just wondering what does that process look like from central valley flood protection board process of making sure that this is safe for the residents that are surrounding because we do see some if there' s any development on this I guess. they have a permitting process and a role to play and it' s very long and difficult to get through their process but I don' t know what to say about that other than they will want to issue a permit on this project. I think that' s just what I was looking for so this would go through their own permitting process as well. yes. thanks. any questions to the left? anything before mike sits down? thank you. we will open the public hearing. if you wish to speak on this item please get in a speaker card to nicole and we' ll limit our speakers to three minutes. I guess I can reframe that. you have the opportunity to speak to us for three minutes if you would like. we will start with the applicant if there' s a representative from the applicant and then move on to the public hearing portion. the applicant is george eshoo. thank you. thank you. thank you. he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he I probably spent 400,000 on studies over the years. I'm not going to build anything on this property myself. I'll be 87 years old in a few months, and I think time out for me to do anything else. But with respect to the property, interesting, back in 2002, after a five-year study, there was no BCM on the property, zero. Then this last time around when we went through a study where they again went, they walked it and checked it for three years, we had 2,047 square feet of BCM on the property. I mean, just environmentally, there wasn't that much, but I had to spend the money with the consultants. My plan right now with respect to the property is I have the state wants to buy at least the residential. Portion and they want to buy around the creek and that all that would be left would be the commercial. I wouldn't be developing it. I'll just I'll be selling it. The state comes up with enough money. Of course, we have budget problems with the state right now. They come up with enough money. I'll sell it to him at a discount. I just want to make sure that everything is done properly. And with respect to this project, anyone has any questions. I know the project. Not. Not. Mike has done a good job. He knows very well, but any questions you have, you can ask me. I think I can answer. I have one for you. What is splitting this property up into parcels? Does that better facilitate a sale of this to an agency like Fish and Wildlife for preservation? What's that? If you if you split this property, if we approve a parcel split, does that better facilitate? Does that better facilitate a sale to an agency like Fish and Wildlife? Yeah. We'll see what we're doing here now today. All we're doing is conforming the lot split to the general plan. At the time the general plan was passed for this property, and I was involved in it at the time, it took about four years. The big question was they wanted less residential and they wanted a bigger commercial. And we ended up with a lot of residential. I think the biggest issue with getting the commercial for the neighborhood commercial for that corner, the reason was there's been a demand for putting a supermarket out there for years. And that was what it was there. As far as the residential, I think the residential will be sold to the state. I don't think that's going to ever be developed. That's where we are right now. They haven't hired their lawyer to start negotiating with me. But they have already given me verbal and also email. Okay. that they are interested in going forward. Price is a little low, but I'll still work something out with them. And I'm a lawyer myself, so I don't have any problems negotiating the transaction. So basically that's it. But the commercial, and this goes back many years when the general plan was being discussed, the then council was insistent that they needed a neighborhood commercial on that corner. That was the real purpose, and that's why it took so long to get that general plan that worked out. And I don't think that there is one little indentation there where when Mo West, the previous owner of that who did California Park, when he did that, he actually did. He dug a hole there because he used some of that land someplace else. Another thing that wasn't mentioned in any of this, years ago the sewer district required to put a sewer line across a property. Instead of paying the then property owner for the right to put the sewer line along the creek, the sewer line now comes from Bruce Road, goes along the creek, it goes to the end of the creek, it goes to the end of the property, and takes a left and goes out to Highway 32. Instead of paying the then owner, the agreement was that in the future if there's a development there, the sewer hookup fee is going to be waived. That sewer hookup fee, about three or four years ago, one of the developers I was looking at buying the property told me that sewer hookup fee was $4,200 per unit. So I mean, and I'd be, we'd be giving that up also if we went ahead and sold it to the state. So those are all the little things that I can say. I've enjoyed being in Chico. I was born and raised in Central Valley myself, but I think that all we're doing now is just conforming to what the general plan is. Because you cannot find either the state or individual buyers. You can't find anyone that's going to buy both the commercial and residential, the different buyers completely. So that's where we are. Great. Any other questions for the applicant? Thank you. Thank you. Nicole, any other public speakers? We have two. First, Lori Carr, and then it will be Austin Barron. I don't know how to do this, so bear with me, okay? I thought I needed to say something. I've had a difficult time putting pen to paper regarding this project, realizing that my feelings are getting in the way. Let me try to give you my thoughts regarding this parcel of land. First off, I have lived at Sterling Oaks for 11 years, and my patio faces Dead Horse Slough, beyond which I can plainly see the parcel and Highway 32. Between my lawn and the slough is a nice trail, which is used heavily. If you can see it, it's a nice trail. If you go at night, you'll need to bring a flashlight, because fortunately, it's dark and not subjected to unwelcome lighting. I cried when I was first shown this apartment, and you may ask why. Well, I consider myself to be an outdoor girl, and I saw myself spending more time outside on my patio than in. I can't tell you if that has happened, only that my routine has me starting my day on the patio, riding my exercise bike on the patio, finishing up my day with a drink on the patio, and I'm not even sure if I'm going to be able to do it. It's where I entertain, pay bills, iron, and yes, I sleep on the patio some summer nights. During the holidays, you can see my patio decorations from the highway. Over the years, there have been fires and floods that are uncomfortably close to my patio. I've been visited by ducks, wild turkeys, and seen all manner of wildlife, including bald eagles and hawks, and have laid in bed listening to the coyotes. Two weeks ago, there were five deer that I recorded through my living room window, knowing that they were not my pet. I was wondering if I went on the patio, I might spook them. About a week ago, traffic on Bruce Road stopped briefly, myself included, to wait for two Canadian honkers with five chicks to cross on their way to the slough. Yes, my cat even had occasions to chase garter snakes off my patio. Needless to say, I believe this parcel, as it's come to be known, is a vital anchor and support to the tremendous wildlife in us residents who live there. While reading the draft and information, I come back with experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience As a mapped floodplain any development would require extensive grading which includes raising floor Elevations above the hundred-year flood level as stated this grading would eliminate all the wetland and vernal pool features I believe these features help mitigate the absorption of flow of waters away from my apartment And I shudder to think what will happen when they are destroyed Traffic is already too heavy and the poor conditions of the road point to that Can you imagine what a hotel two gas stations apartments and a drive-thru will do in a nutshell? There will be a widespread destruction of habitat and a way of life that we've come to cherish and thank you for listening to me Thank you so much And then you said Austin Austin Baron Good evening commissioners Austin Baron local commercial real estate broker former architecture review board member So I came to speak in support of this project, you know, I've known mr. Eshoo for about four or five years now working with this parcel on what we can do with this Neapolitan ice cream zoned parcel of land that we can't sell to anybody because nobody can build Residential multifamily and commercial nobody can Get financing for those two things at the same time Tried just isn't happening So, you know, mr Eshoo's plan to create three parcels out of this really just gives us the opportunity to develop the parts we can and you know If mr. Eshoo can sell the parcel one to the state great and we can develop parcel two and get something out of this That's good for the city. But as it sits, you know, there's really not an opportunity to to develop this You know, obviously we need housing and you know, if parcel one could be sold to a multifamily developer Which there has been you know interest but again The multiple zoning has been such an issue So just to summarize I support this project. I think it needs to be split into multiple Parcels to comply with the general plan and to make the zoning make sense I don't think we ever should have zoned this parcel. Like like I said a Neapolitan ice cream You know one one? Zoning designation per parcel seems seems okay to me So again, I urge you to you know pass this plan So we can get something done on this parcel. Thank you very much Thank you That's all I have okay, is there anybody else wishing to speak on this item Does the applicant have any additional comments to rebut any of the speakers I just want to give you the opportunity if you want to come back The public hearing and bring it back to the Commission any discussion questions Yes, madam chair. I'm wondering if We might ask staff just to describe The process that would be involved Were there to be a future development proposal for this site? You know this this proposal is strictly to parcel eyes the Lot so they're available for individual sale But there's there's a lot more involved before we get to something actually happening on the property and what would that look like? Well after the applicant obtains all the permits and does the initial access And bridge to throw all the parcels as we discussed then they could record the map and once they record the map they could sell the parcels separate from one another and if one of them were to transfer to a developer of Commercial for one of the commercial Lots They would come in for a site design and architecture review application and we would take that to the board for its consideration and some and actually it would probably if it was a gas station it would also require a use permit so we would have site design architecture of you and a Use permit going to the Planning Commission so Any of any of those scenarios could play out and if it was an apartment project and that apartment project would go to the Architecture review board as well. So the same kind of process then? Yeah, there was there's a experience with this experience experience with this experience with this experience with this experience with this experience with this experience with this experience with this experience with this experience experience with this experience experience with this experience experience with this experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience parcel 1 and I understand the need to split I have concerns with just approving the parcel map I think there should be a rezone for parcel 1 with how many issues there are with how incongruent the land use is with the biological resources. I would support the project if there was a rezone of parcel 1 maybe in next year' s code amendment or rezone for the city. I just have issues. when you say rezone what are you intending? open space or do resource constraint overlay something to constrain the development because I don' t think this is an appropriate place for development of that kind. I would support the my 2 cents. anything else? any motions? I make a motion to adopt resolution number 2407 adopting the mitigated negative declaration and approving parcel I move to approve the resolution. we have a motion to adopt resolution number 24-07 from commissioner Laffins. is there a second? second. we have a second from commissioner wolf. any further comment or discussion? all in favor of the planning commission adopting resolution number 24-07 adopting the mitigated negative declaration andскийскийскийскийскийскийскийскийскийскийскийскийскийскийскийскийскийскийскийскийскийский! map division will keep that retained to be a great patio space that you enjoy. All right. We will move on to our next item which is 4.2 residential readiness title 19 code amendments. And senior planner Kelly Murphy. I like the alliteration there. I think it's a great item. I think it's a great item. Good evening to the members of the planning commission. I will be presenting items 4.2 and 4.3 this evening which are covered in a single staff report that have been broken out on to this agenda as they were noticed separately. I will first cover the proposed code amendments and corresponding general plan text amendments and then I will resume my presentation discussion on the general plan amendment and the re-zone. The proposed amendments represent phase one of a planned multi-phase code amendment program and are referred to as the residential readiness program as the majority of amendments are intended to streamline existing processes, reduce barriers for residential development and facilitate housing production. The proposed code amendments are broken up into three main housing element actions, response to council direction, and cleanups for consistency with state law. Last September, the City Council adopted the 2022 housing element. Shortly thereafter, HCD certified that the housing element is in compliance with state housing law and directed the City to continue its timely and effective implementation. The first phase of Title 19 amendments focuses on residential readiness and implements actions under housing element goals 3, 4, 5, and 8. I'm going to briefly touch on the actions implemented under each goal and provide the relevant state legislative context. So three actions under goal 3 as well as three actions under goal 4 have been implemented as described in the staff report. The legislative background is the California's density bonus law, which allows developers to request density bonuses and concessions based on the percentage of the state's affordable units proposed. Recent legislation amended the density bonus law stipulating that projects meeting specific affordability thresholds shall be entitled to a maximum density bonus of up to 50%, which is increased from 35, one or more incentives or concessions, such as exceptions to building standards or building coverage ratios, and reduced parking ratios for qualifying projects. The City of Chico's density bonus provision is established in 2021. The government has updated the policy to the state of the state to implement the housing element actions 3, 3, 1 and 3, 3, 6. Under housing element goal 5, we have two actions relating to fair housing access for persons with disabilities. Per state housing law, housing element must analyze constraints placed upon the development, maintenance and improvement of housing for persons with disabilities. and the city's reasonable accommodations procedure for persons with disabilities. The city's reasonable accommodations procedures are established in section 1960 130 and have been amended as described in housing element action 516. This code revision does provide greater transparency and objectivity for reasonable accommodation requests through a ministerial process. And then finally we have two actions implemented under housing element goal 8. And these relate to emergency shelters. State housing element law as amended by AB 2339 requires local governments to determine whether there is an adequate capacity of zoning districts in which emergency shelters are allowed by right. Emergency shelters must be permitted in a zone that is also permits residential development and has sites located near services and amenities. The second action not a zoning district. During the housing element update it was determined an additional zoning district allowing emergency shelters by right is needed for compliance with this law. And the industrial office mixed use or IOMU zone was selected based on its ample acreage to accommodate emergency shelters. Residential uses are permitted in the IOMU zone and areas zoned IOMU are located near the housing element corridor as well as park avenue. State law also requires governments to ensure that emergency shelter parking standards do not require more spaces than what is necessary for staff. So amendments to the parking table in chapter 1970 are proposed for consistency with this law and implement housing element action 811. Okay. So that was our housing element implementation. We're going to move on to the council directives next. Thank you. Let's start with the directives of the city council to identify opportunities to streamline the review process for projects requiring architectural review. We also receive direction to eliminate parking requirements for residential development in Chico's downtown as well as adopt special restrictions on the sale and service of alcohol by council resolution and make some minor changes to the regulations for commercial cannabis uses. So projects requiring site plan and architectural review are defined in chapter 18 as either major or minor. And this was one of the first efficiencies directed by city council was to consider additional project types that may be identified as minor projects and do not require review and approval by the architectural historic reservation board and may be approved at the staff level. So we're going to move on to the second directive. The second directive was to develop separate design review findings for residential versus non-residential projects. A little bit more on major and minor projects as defined in chapter 1918. Minor projects are those which because of their limited size and scope have reduced aesthetic implications and amendments to section 1918-03-0 are proposed to include the following projects as minor. Duplexes and trusses are proposed to include projects that meet all applicable development standards, commercial projects not located on an arterial or within 300 feet of a residential use, and residential projects within a master plan area which have adopted design guidelines. As I mentioned, staff also prepared objective design review standards for residential projects which will allow projects that meet specific standards to be approved ministerially. And as I mentioned, ministerial projects are not subject to environmental review. The review pursuant to CEQA. The council direction to streamline architectural review for certain residential projects is supported by the enactment of AB 2011 and SB 6, which are intended to permit residential development ministerially on sites currently zoned and designated for office or retail use. For consistency with the state law, amendments to section 1944-020 have been made to remove the use of residential land for single family and multi-family housing land uses in the office residential or OR zoning district. As well as an amendment to section 1946-020 to allow multi-family housing by right in the industrial office mixed use zone up to 35 dwelling units per acre. All right. The council directed amendments to chapter 19-6 of the! to section 14-7 of the Is to provide more flexibility for residential uses in the downtown parking area. As proposed, no new uses would be required for residential projects creating fewer than 20 new units. No new parking or reduced parking benefits would also be extended to residential projects proposing greater than 20 units and parking would be provided at a rate consistent with what is required for multi-family housing within a corridor opportunity site which does represent our lowest parking requirement. And these actions are consistent with the downtown element of the general plan. Specifically we have action 721 which calls for eliminating and reducing parking requirements in downtown zoning districts. And housing element action 4.2.3 to support higher density residential development in downtown as well as housing element action 4.2.3 to support housing construction by reducing and allowing flexibility with parking minimums. The other council direction including or having to do with special restrictions on the sale and service of alcohol. The council directed staff to remove the restrictions established in section 1976 from title 19 and have those special regulations established by council resolution. And the other council direction in order to make future changes a bit easier. And then finally the council did direct staff to conduct some minor clean up amendments mostly for consistency with the state definitions for the different commercial license types. As for the final component of the code amendments this slide summarizes the four official planning director interpretations Corresponding text amendments to table LU-2 of the general plan are proposed for consistency with changes made to the code. Specifically to clarify that all residential and commercial projects within the COS or corridor opportunity site overlay may benefit from higher densities not just sites designated for mixed use. These amendments do not propose any construction demolition or other activity that has a potential impact. On the environment therefore exempt from CEQA pursuant to section 15061 any future development projects would be reviewed on an individual basis for compliance with CEQA. That will bring us to our staff recommendation on the code amendments and the related general plan text amendments to table LU-2. Staff would recommend you open the public hearing and adopt resolution 2404 and 2405. the city council approval of the things we just discussed. Any questions? that was a lot. sorry. it' s okay. how about we start to my left any questions? no? okay to my right? no? commissioner wolf? yes. the staff report suggests the projects which are located on arterial streets would continue to require board approval. I didn' t see that actually carried forward in the resolution. thank you that was an oversight and what we have agreed with our chico builders association was to have it reflected as written in the staff report. it would be revised to the staff report. that' s subsection j read commercial projects not located on an arterial or within. I want to say thank you because the review you gave us is getting it right the way we wanted it. appreciate that. you' re welcome brendan. honestly this is a lot and having additional eyes on it. I had to go through this a couple three times to get my head around all the stuff that' s being done here. I' I was actually a little concerned about the change in noticing requirements for public hearings. traditionally it' s been 300 foot notification and a few years ago we expanded it to 500. in this number in this bunch of changes looks like we' re going back to 300. the reason that was stated in the staff report was we need to do that we need to do that in the state law and then to be consistent with the recently adopted subdivision ordinance. I' m wondering about that. it seems like the 500 feet is consistent with the state law. I don' t think we need to change it. we' re covered there. then I looked at the subdivision ordinance and the subdivision ordinance actually has the 500 foot thank you Mr. Chair. if you don' t mind I' d be happy to add. once this was brought to our attention we found out we had a mistake in the adopting ordinance. the intent in chapter 18 was to make it 300. I' m working with the clerk' s office now to clean that up and we' ll go through that process with the city council to clarify that the intent was make it 300. in some cases less for minor land you' re correct and we found that out there was a mistake. we' re trying to sort through what happened but we will bring a corrective ordinance forward on title 18. as it relates to title 19 we don' t feel strongly about that. we' re okay leaving title 19 alone with the noticing procedures as they 500, 300, 100 and sometimes 1000 communication facilities. the short answer of saying we don' t have any problem if you want to change the noticing procedures in chapter 19. thank you for that explanation. I' m just wondering if title 19 were to remain as it is would that be consistent with the to be corrected we have a conflict there. title 19 would need to be corrected for vesting tentative maps. those would be set notices at 300 feet for vesting tentative maps. other things with a planned development permit would be 500 but if there was a vesting tentative map it would be 300 feet. under title 19 requirements? yes for a vesting map or just a straight tentative map. if it were to remain the same all other applications would be subject most other applications would be subject to the 500 radius. there is some cost savings for reduced mailing but again we' re kind of neither here nor there on the recommendation. this pendulum has kind of gone back and forth. occasionally hey I didn' t hear about this very important project. oh okay that was a mis-oversight let' s move it to 500. then we use the 500 for five or six years don' t have much rumbling so anyway it has moved so we' re happy to keep it where it is or move it again. also looking at section 1918 024 a the addition of the language that references the government code section 65583.2i. I think that section of the code is the state code just refers to residential projects is that correct or that was my understanding of it? I believe that' s what we' re intending to say but I think we do share the sentiment that we try to reduce references to the government code as those are evolving and we would propose striking just the first bit of that sentence pursuant to government code section and just keeping developments that are subject to design review do not just require a reference to the state code but thank you. that' s a little dicey to incorporate a reference to a state code because that stuff changes and then you end up with something nobody knows what it really means. as long as we can get that change to reflect just residential. I' ve got it noted thank you. that was it thanks. any other comments questions? I have a stack. I think my first question if I can under council direction and it' s the minor projects versus major projects kind of that number one. and thinking about kind of the commercial projects mostly and kind of working this through scenarios what is considered I guess what does this look like new construction projects and construction on existing or alterations repairs and remodels so if I have a let' s say a 10,000 square foot commercial property how much would I be able to renovate that would be of that square footage that would be considered minor versus major like what are the triggers there? I' m not sure we have it quantified. Do you have? I think I would say I think it' s a number. there' s a variety of factors we look at for that where it is how visible it is the magnitude of the change and at some level they' re investing enough in this remodel and changing it enough or it' s visible enough that we say this has got to go to the board and we just over time have kind of landed in a place that' s hard to define but we have staff kind of know where it is and a lot of people we work with know where it is. there' s a little disclaimer at the end of this otherwise minor project may have greater implications the director may refer the project to the arhpb or the committee or commission and that is something that usually reveals itself early in the process. let' s say I had a project on second street downtown and I was adding a patio to the back and I have an awning and a hanging an awning and then some patio space but I think it'! if that came to you guys what would that be? would that be a minor project or a major project? if it' s in the back of the building it would be a minor project if it' s in the front of any building downtown we would probably want you to go to the board we would have a reduced fee for that but things on the fronts of buildings typically go to the board downtown. again if it' s a minor and then they come forward and don' t put their best foot forward and bring us something that we think is supportable we' re happy to kick it and make it more involved and get the arhpb or the commission involved. I kind of refer to this section as the paint color section I feel like that' s really where this is being driven by but I think there' s other things that are in here that I just want to be careful about downtown especially when we think about alterations repairs and remodels and new construction on a building like this, when we come back from this when we come back from this when we come back from this when we come back from this when we come back from this when we come back from this experience, when we come back from this when we come back from this when we come back from this experience, when we come back from this experience, when we come back from this when we come back from this experience, when we come back from this experience, when we come back from this experience, for that pendulum to swing but i'm hoping that's not what we get in this case okay um and then my other question and i'll save my comments for later um is on the uh alcohol and i think you had on there was it like labor day but there's also caesar chavez day uh st patrick's day i think we're getting rid of two so what does that look like in practice what does it look like for those who might not be aware of that what has what has this look like the last five years and then what would it look like with these changes i'm happy to start and let brendan jump in but there was um an initial council directive uh regarding alcoholic beverage establishments and um eliminating the moratorium on new bars downtown we had some established bar operators then come out during the public event and we had some established bar operators then come out during the public event and we had some established bar operators then come out during the public experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience regulation on the day before labor day and I think the discussion of the council was with pd verifying there' s been reduced activity on the weekends that we can delete this out of title 19 and establish it by council resolution which would make it easier to amend in the future. that' s a great response and s a great response and the genesis of these regulations was a darker time for the city for businesses which sell alcohol and that' s what generated the regulations and restrictions and concerns about these time periods but a lot of this has subsided. What we have learned is we have a great relationship with abc we have been applying suggesting that with the city and the people who have gotten licenses so by making the change in some cases the people who have the license with abc are still settled with the conditions with abc but now they can go and request those conditions be removed. to give you more than you asked for. I appreciate taking this out of a land use decision. I very much appreciate that aspect of it. council resolution part to me is what would that process look like? What is the let' s say we have a council in three years from now that wants to have some sort of restrictions what would be the public noticing process of that? What is the timeline there? They couldn' t just do that on a special meeting on a Friday for the following Saturday. What does that look like? planning commission so that it would be extracted from title 19 so if they wanted to be more nimble and make some adjustments which to me seems to be more rolling them back it wouldn' t have to come to the planning commission for a recommendation before going back to them but that was their decision and that' s what' s being carried forward. It means they can notice a meeting and I think that was it. Any other questions? I' m still confused on the 300 versus 500 and what' s being proposed? we' re fine without any changes to title 19 relative to the noticing distance. which is currently 500? yes. what does state require? it requires there' s different numbers for 1,000 some permits are 500 some are 300 some are 100 it varies on the entitlement. where you may recall as it relates to subdivisions we agreed the last time we presented title 18 to make all subdivisions whether they' re parcel maps tentative maps we have all major subdivisions 300 feet but there' s still minor subdivisions like minor land divisions lot line adjustments mergers that only require noticing of 100 feet and sometimes of 100 feet for the minor permits and that' s consistent with state law. we' re not recommending at this juncture any changes to title 19 for noticing. it would stay at 500 which is not consistent with state law? the state has my understanding the state has a minimum of 300 we' re okay to have 400 500 to go beyond that. I believe that' s accurate. we' re not at odds with the state we just have a more robust noticing because we have a very active community. thank you. thank you. thank you. thank you. any other questions? we will open the public hearing there' s no applicant on this. we will start just with our general public. do we have any comments? we have no speakers. would anybody like to speak on 4.2? all right. I will close the public hearing and bring it back to the commission. I will ask the first question am I allowed to say a few things before we vote? I know maybe there' s more people watching at home but I know that this probably seems very arcane and boring but title 19 I think is one of the most important documents that we have in the city of chico that really guides where we think we're going to build. And really, when I think about Title 19, I think of how we're going to build. What does that look like? This is really, Title 19 is that document that breathes character and life into projects in Chico. And so anything that we make a decision on on Title 19 comes with the weight of that. A couple observations. I really appreciate staff putting this together. It's very comprehensive. And this is just my personal opinion, and it won't weigh into my vote, but since my time on the Planning Commission, which I think started 12 years ago, the loss of local control has been a very stark reality of how we are able to weigh into what our community looks like. And I think there are a lot of things that we can do to help the community. And I think that's one of the things definitely policies that come from the state that are very much important and needed, but it's constantly that tension. And I feel that more and more when we get Title 19 updates of conforming with the state is we are losing that ability to direct how we want Chico to look. Whether that's good or bad, I think it depends on kind of who the developers are, but it's a reality that I think we should all recognize. I do want to call out, and again, really no opinion on this, but looking at that buy right for emergency shelters, that's a pretty significant chunk of the city of Chico. And we used, what is it, a IOMU, but industrial office mixed use. So if you think about those areas when you're driving through Chico, that's going to be a significant impact for those areas that currently don't have that. Again, not weighing in on whether that's good or bad, but I think it's something that the public should know so that when people kind of storm city council chambers about what did Brendan do, which has happened. Um, this is the reality of what that looks like, Um, and then I think, kind of, just, uh, the last piece, I appreciate, Um, that council, Um, can bringing these, Um, fixes, or, Um, I guess, areas to address in, in, the code, Um, I'm, I'm not in love with all of them, but I also recognize, Um, being, Um, pragmatic that they're going to pass, whether I love them or not, Um, Um, Um, Um, Um, Um, Um, Um, Um, Um, Um, Um, Um, Um, Um, Um, Um, Um, Um, But I do think they're worth kind of having discussions on, you know, signs seem very innocuous. But when we start not looking at designs of signs, what does that mean? What is that tension that we hold of how much do we want developers to spend going through the city process, but also how good do we want Chico to look? And so that's kind of what I look at when I look at Title 19. I don't just see crossing out numbers or adding in different letters of where this will apply, but really what are the decisions that we're making here tonight that are going to impact 10 years from now what a project looks like or what a street looks like in the city of Chico? Sorry, I took a long time. No, that was fine, and I couldn't agree more with you with respect to your comments on the state. One size fits all. Approach doesn't fit all. It doesn't fit Chico. So I share your concerns on that. It looks like there's some headway being made pushing back on the state, and hopefully that'll continue. I do have one thing to comment, and it's I'm a housing element reviewer for the state of California. A lot of jurisdictions are doing what we have to do, what we're doing, and it's important that we're doing it to ensure compliance with housing element law. Noncompliance can mean loss of funding, as well as litigation from the Attorney General. It may not be fun that we're doing this, but it's definitely necessary to ensure we can continue to have some local control. Just another comment, too, that we're doing this so we can comply with some of the other policies in place, and I'm still hung up on the 300 versus 500, and I'd really like it to say something to the effect of, the city can make the distinction between what' s a minor project versus major it would seem that maybe those major projects need the 500 but some of these other projects don' t. It can be I don' t know waste isn' t the right word but it can be a waste of resources of time and resources. So I think that' m not comfortable with the 500 the way that it reads. anything else? Madam Chair if it will help clarify things if there are references to a tentative track tentative map that is 500 feet we will delete those references to 500 feet for tentative maps or vesting maps. That means they will remain the same for general plan amendments zone changes plan development permits use permits and the like. Those are more which you might categorize as major. I think the subdivision ones that are more in the neighborhood of ministerial if you will is in so much as if the subdivision complies with the subdivision regulations then they' re entitled to build out the subdivision in compliance with the subdivision standards and that' s the way the subdivision code works. If the streets are divided accordingly and with the right development standards then our job is to approve them. So the subdivision! I think we will reach into title 19 and clarify that if tentative track maps are included in 500 feet we will strike that. But it will still remain for its own changes general plan amendments use permits etc. I appreciate having the extra 200 feet. I think that' s why we have to have a very active public and I think we should respect what that looks like with having a very active public and the more voices that are heard and in there and feel heard even if the decisions don' t go their way at least it brings them in here and has them part of the public process. I' m in support of that. I' m a big fan of transparency and disclosure so if someone wants to show up and they' re do we have any proposed motions there are two that I would say are on page 2 of 18 of the staff report that we would start with correct? is that right kelly? sorry 1918. section 1918 code section? yes and then we will save the attachment c1. thank you.radas, amendment, he will come back with an he will come back with an amendment, he will come back with an he will come back with an he will come back with an amendment, he will come back with an he will come back with an amendment, he will come back with an he will come back with an amendment, he will come back with an amendment, he will come back with an amendment, he will come back with an amendment, he will come back with an amendment, he will come back with an amendment, thank you. residential developments. I would move adoption of resolution 2404 recommending city council adoption of amendments to title 19 of the chico municipal code. as set forth in the resolution as I just summarized a couple of changes by staff. we have a motion from commissioner wolf to adopt resolution 24-04. is there a second? if I may. Madam chair. my motion would also have us retain the title 19 requirements with respect to noticing at this time. my apologies. thank you. is there a second? second. commissioner scarpa any other discussion? any further discussion? all in favor signify by saying aye. aye. any opposed? aye. that motion passes 5-1 with two absent. we have one more motion before we can move on. can you clarify the vote real quick? yes. we have a motion number 24-04 recommending city council adoption of amendments to title 19 of the chico municipal code as set forth there in retaining the title 19 noticing. that passed 4-1 with two absent. did I say 5-1? sorry. 4-1. you said? I thought you said no. it took you a second. it is 5-1. I think it is 5-0 with two absent. thank you. I recommend adoption of resolution 24-05 recommending the general plan tax balance. second? second. okay. so that is commissioner wolf and commissioner scarpa again. all in favor of adopting resolution number 24-05? aye. any opposed? that passes 5-0 with two absent. all right. you are back kelly. okay. part two. this one will be a bit more brief. we are going to be taking a look at a general plan amendment and rezone. staff identified this opportunity involving five parcels historically owned and operated by the chico net site. it has approximately 10 acres and represents an opportunity for the adaptive reuse of a large industrial site. pretty much in the center of town. the proposed amendment is consistent with the avenue's neighborhood plan to leverage economic opportunities and development within the chico net site. the chico net site represents a large commercial area. re-designating the properties as commercial mixed use would encourage the integration of retail and service commercial uses with office and or residential. we would be changing from the designation of manufacturing and warehousing to commercial mixed use and the proposed rezone of the site to community commercial or cc from light industrial would allow for a variety of uses to be implemented including residential retail trade commercial services office uses and some processing and manufacturing uses. the plan development overlay will require any future development proposal to be considered by the planning commission and obtain a plan development permit. and re-designating or re-designing the plan development overlay will also allow for some flexibility from development standards such as building height or setbacks which may come in very handy when trying to readapt some of the existing structures that are existing on site and though that would be consistent with many goals and policies of the general plan so we don't really have any more information and no development proposals at this time so with that we're going to move on to the next item which is we're going to move on to the next item which is the project at this moment is exempt from cqa pursuant to section 15061 and staff would recommend a full public hearing and ultimately adopt resolution 2406 recommending city council approval of the general plan amendment and reason that's it. thank you any questions for kelly? oh commissioner wolf do you have questions? yes one of the comments we got from the public one of the written comments questioned whether or not there should be a community commercial or neighborhood commercial zoning and i was wondering if you could maybe elaborate on the distinctions between those two and community commercials pretty comprehensive in laws for some pretty intense commercial activities is maybe neighborhood commercial a better typically you'll find neighborhood commercial applied to much smaller sites maybe one acre this is a very large site 10 acres so i think we'd want to allow for a cool new use that may fall under one of the land use categories allowed in the cc to be developed on site as opposed to zoning it with a more restrictive zone especially because we're proposing the pd overlay which will require a case-by-case review by the planning commission and that actually makes sense to me because i think that as we go forward in the future should somebody come in and say hey we're come in here and want to do something that community commercial would allow a lot of flexibility but we could also get more specific about through the pd process there were some uses we were concerned about or the neighborhood was concerned about kind of given that the site is so large exactly kind of moving them farther away from the neighborhood to reduce those impacts things like that yes that's correct thank you any other questions we will open the public hearing on this item 4.3 so we will start with the applicant or a representative from the applicant do we have anybody here to speak on this no i have one speaker and then do we have any yeah public speakers i have one speaker one okay susan tashuti i love it i really think it's the kind of growth and the kind of development that chico needs mixed use downtown lots of possibilities for a variety of commercial for housing i love it and i just want to add to that that i think that there are other sites at chico that we can do the same thing with the kmart site has been there forever now empty lots of factories and warehouses not back warehouses and pallets and stuff on on park afternoon that thrive for some sort of new development the same kind of mixed-use development that will take care of a lot of our housing needs and provide services for the people who are who will live in those places so yeah i love it thank you any other public comments that is it okay would you like to speak okay um and after you're done if you'd mind putting in a speaker card too we can do that but why don't you provide us your name right now so we roger cole okay my partner and i own um 25th and 35th generation um so i sent some comments in that sounds like some comments um i started architecture planning in college and one of our main concerns of course is how is the project going to interface with the neighborhood and of course the intensity of the of the project as i say in my my comments it certainly would be a and also the goal for the site to be more of a traffic reduction site than a traffic generating site i mean we already have a lot of commercial areas in chico that serves specific uses and we have a mall a mall and a half i guess with north valley and so the majority of the avenues is residential and you can see it's gradually improving and actually our part of the neighborhood has we've improved because we fixed up our houses and we've got some properties that are undervalued properly you know at this point um so the interface between the neighborhood itself that's one to two stories and we've seen some large apartment complexes and residential things go in three and four stories north avenue um near a rental we used to own over on north avenue i mean it's just like towering over so of course we want to avoid that kind of thing and have a one to two story interface and perhaps some plantings and things like that um would be you know desirable um the other thing would is lindo channel is right there and that's a major you know green space in the city and it's been you know mostly ignored but um over there i mean it's an opportunity to have your residences that face the green space and that doesn't exist in the middle of chico very much so that's a really valuable um thing that should be respected and the green greenway should permit public access along the top of the bank um which was you can see that um policy in place over on forest avenue when hignal built their huge complex over there right next to forest and i'm sorry little chico creek um they allowed public access along the back and that's much easier to do before you build the project than it is after um and um so how will um the concern about you know the large chains and things like that possibly locating in this area how will that be handled by the commission how do you look at those kinds of uses that might be traffic attractors that's just part of your process as you go further along yeah if you um i'm keeping track of your questions and then once your comments are done we'll have staff address those okay thank you um and you know mark already brought up the neighborhood commercial versus um cc community commercial so that's all my comments great thank you thank you or is there cards in the back cards are in the back yeah thank you all right anybody else so oh come on sorry my name is suzanne hermanson i'm wondering what the most onerous commercial uses that could be proposed for that project are you know like dry cleaners or gas stations i'm wondering you know when you were talking about neighborhood commercial versus what is this community i'm just wondering how how worse it could be what the what what's the worst that we could expect in that neighborhood which is the gateway to the avenues basically which is a pretty cherished and important part of chico and so i would hate to see it be um you know something really disgusting so i would like to like to hear what you say the difference of the uses for neighborhood versus the other development thank you thank you any other public comment okay with that we will close the public hearing um mike do you want to talk about or brendan what the so we're um we're considering a rezone tonight but what would this look like especially with that overlay of a project coming forward so i i've long considered this site the one that got away so when we kelly alluded to the fact that it was part of the neighborhood planning process as a real impetus a real kind of catalyst site within that neighborhood and people mentioned the gateway to the north of the esplanade we had it plated up as we were doing the general plan update back in 2009 10 11 as a opportunity site a special area and we had meetings with the owner at the time pete peterson who was quite visionary and also believes it's a critical site and celebrates its location and its history um he got a little cold feet for lack of a better term because he wanted to make sure that we didn't put on a reasonable amount of money to make sure that we were able to get the potential for expanding his use and i explained that if we did do the gpa rezone at that time it possibly could restrict that since that time he hasn't increased the use quite the opposite it continues to sunset or be less utilized it was a conversation with him more recently that got me excited again again i mentioned it as the one that got away because i think it's a real opportunity and i think community to have a community in our community uh mr peterson wants to leave a legacy and he wants to do something he wants he hopes to have something special and unique happen there my understanding in my conversations with him and why i was willing to help bring this forward as this kind of a city sponsored effort is that the cc provides the most flexibility as we've discussed a little bit and he is looking for a buyer that is going to do something community and i won't say there won't be any change i can't i can't make any guaranteed plans but this isn't about gas stations this isn't about drive-throughs this is about doing something that will be mixed use that will respect the creek that will acknowledge the residences to the rear and that will serve as a gateway that is his vision at this point he likely won't be the individual developing but he is the person selling the property and to help that process and i think that is something special happened here i still think the cc which does provide a lot of uses some which might not be consistent with that area but with that pd overlay the fact that it will come back to this planning commission and that you as a commission recognize the uniqueness the fact that you recognize that it is in that neighborhood plan i think will ensure that we will get something special here i don't know exactly what that will be the reuse of those older buildings is a challenge and so any development on the site will be done in phases there won't be this wholesale here is what is happening and we will see it later this year that is not how it will play out there i can't guarantee anything except for the fact that we know we will be back here in front of this planning commission or a planning commission and that we have an owner that is looking to do something and leave a legacy so just for those in the audience anything that would be developed on this somebody would have to apply to the city to do that and that would have to come before the planning commission the planning commission would have to offer recommendation that would then potentially go to the city council could be appealed unlike if we didn't have the pd certain uses could be done by right there might be an architectural review in this case no it will come back to this planning commission for a more major commercial big box kind of applicants they would have to go through that process if that is what would happen with that property and then what would you think would be the most intensive use that could be within the zoning? i can see mixed use i can see there being some something that we would be on the esplanade this is something we said we want again when we get folks that want to do it then we have people then we kind of sometimes say is that really what we want but i could see that i could see commercial uses on the front end maybe even mixed use with residential but i do believe that through the pd there would be an understanding of good planning principles of tapering it as it moves back into that residential neighborhood. i think that the the plan development review process component of this this action is is critical to really making it work so i hope that addressed everybody's questions any further comment or claire yes i do i've been mulling around the corridor opportunity site would that be beneficial to tack on would it be a hindrance to development because you you did mention you know we have focus the city's focus to all the plan on the esplanade in the general plan in our code and it is an overlay to promote increased residential density i i just i'm not like would it be beneficial for this site um well i will say the pd will allow some deviations deviations makes it sound sinister but you know flexibility within the code and then um as part of our commitment to the housing element we are looking at other places to apply the cos overlay that's what i was and i would think this would be we by the way this is the first phase of code amendments coming to the planning commission there will be subsequent phases coming in one of those we'll be looking at expanding the cos overlay in other places throughout the city yeah i just added my notes action 4.2.5 which states as a future um part of the municipal code update to investigate opportunities and so i just wanted to we gotta let we gotta let kelly get a little breathing room and then we'll we'll get her back yeah put her back in the salt mine cool! um before we get a motion on this just a couple of things that i i wanted to highlight one um i i just really appreciate that overlay and i appreciate um i don't know who gets the credit for that but really that um uh staff guidance on that i i recognize this is a a really special property um and a really amazing opportunity and um if that in itself is the legacy of this property um i think that means a lot to me um that even if it's not in my lifetime that we know that this will come before for real robust community engagement on what that piece of property could look like so thank you for that um i also really appreciate the process of doing this sometimes we see um general plan amendments or uh reasons that come at the same time as a project um and i feel like that doesn't give as much community um awareness or the opportunity to kind of really respond and really think about the best use for that property so having if it's six months or five years but just having the opportunity to really get excited about what could be there and to plan and dream and um really get potential developers excited i i love the opportunity that we have to kind of think about it pause and then look at what other projects could be so thank you for bringing this forward um as part of a city sponsored effort um i think that's a terrific use of city resources and city funds to do that to make that possible i have a question that's that was it's not as as exciting as what you just said but this is this is only specific to these parcel numbers correct the general plan amendment and rezone okay so the parcel two i think it's maybe the north of it but there was a letter regarding their concern in the future that would could change for uh you know at some point those individuals might see greater value of getting that same zoning but they might have to pursue that on their own but at this point no there's nothing that impacts their current use uh their zoning hasn't changed and their access and will be unchanged okay thank you all righty um any motions i'll move adoption of resolution 2406 seconds i'll second it okay so we have a motion from commissioner wolf and a second from commissioner pullen to adopt resolution number 24-06 recommending city council approval of gpa rezone 24-01 which would amend land use designations and rezone five properties within the chico nut site area um any further comment okay all in favor signify by saying aye aye any opposed so that motion carries for the five zero two all right um go to my agenda bruce i think i kick it to you right yeah we have nothing on the regular agenda reports no madam chair the only thing is i wanted to thank the planning commissioner for confirming their attendance when nicole checks with you thank you for doing that those words are encouragement and i want to make sure that everyone in the room knows that you'll be able to be here so that we can confirm we've got everybody coming and so on and so forth and but other than that i don't have any other announcements we will have a meeting in june we will okay and how many items are you expecting on that at least one or two okay uh any questions for bruce all right thank you we are adjourned thank you
