That's for you to argue with me and then you know. That's why you pick the left. It's a different song this week. It's a different song this week. It's a different song. I have to remember to keep the mic on for city class. I think they're just talking back there. So, it's moving, Grandma. Let's go! Let's walk! Let's walk! Up, up, up, up, up! Sorry, guys. Sorry, sorry, sorry. Alright. So, we'll call this regular city council meeting into session. We will start with item 1.3, our invocation by police Chaplain Berkin. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Council. Heavenly Father, Son, Holy Spirit. Heavenly Father, Son, Holy Spirit. Dear Heavenly Father, You number the hairs on our head to determine our days. You hang the stars and feed the sparrows. You open doors no one can shut and shut doors that no one can open. Surely, we can trust you when time comes for making big decisions. Or for the matter of any decisions. We are in just the season again. Father, that we know that you are always with us. We trust you for the generous wisdom, straight path, and peaceful heart. So, Lord, we just ask you to be with these council members as they make decisions for our city and our community and for all those that come through it and live within it. So, Lord, we give you all the praise and all the glory. These things we pray in your most precious and glorious name. Amen. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Thank you. All right, if you please stand and join me in the Pledge of Allegiance. Pledge. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. All right. Madam Clerk, could you do the roll call, please? Council Member Brown? Here. Council Member Denley? Here. Council Member Huber? Here. Council Member Morgan? Here. Council Member Tandon? Here. Thank you very much. So at this point in time, we're going to have a report out from our closed special session at 5 o'clock, but we're going to re-adjourn into closed session following the consent agenda and public comment or business from the floor, rather. So just a note for that. If you're speaking on an item a little later, we will resource back into closed session after business from the floor. But at this point in time, we're going to have our city attorney do a report out on closed session to this point. Thank you. And I would like to acknowledge the city attorney met with the council and the city clerk on the public employee evaluation special closed session this evening. In that session, two actions took place. One was a motion by Council Member Morgan to update the city of clerk's job description. That motion was seconded by Council Member Casey Reynolds. Council Member Reynolds. And the vote was 7 to 0 to I'm sorry, to undertake that action. A second motion was made by Mayor Coolidge to amend the city clerk's contract to add a fringe benefit. That motion was seconded by Council Member Alex Brown. The vote was 7 to 0 on that action. That concludes my closed session report. I'll make a comment. Yes, Mr. Mayor. While we can't discuss personnel items specifically, in this last special session, the council met to do the evaluation of the city clerk. It had been a number of years since that had been done. The city clerk was evaluated on individual characteristics, professional skills and status, reporting and records, fiscal management, staffing supervision, running of meetings, and elections. And I suffice it to say that it is going to be very hard for her to pass the bar that she has set for herself. And we're very happy with her performance as a group and as a council, and we feel that we are one of the luckiest cities in California to have a clerk with her institutional knowledge and professionalism. Hear, hear. Alright. So, public participation. This meeting is being conducted in accordance with Executive Order N-29-20, public participation and attendance at the meeting. Masses are required. The public may attend the meeting in person at 421 Main Street. Speakers must sign up to speak by checking out one of the speaker card tables located outside the council chamber. All speakers will be given instructions to queue in the speaker line. Only one speaker will be allowed in the chamber at a time. Please follow instructions accordingly. Zoom participation will also be allowed. This information for how to access Zoom platform will be available on the city's website. Raise your hand within Zoom only for those items you wish to speak on. Public participation prior to the meeting, the Engage Chico Civic Engagement Program was available for citizen input on individual agenda items, prior to the meeting, and remote public participation during the meeting. The public may view the meeting on Comcast Channel 11 or via streaming video, which can be found on the city's website. I would like to ask that individuals wishing to speak on the consent agenda at this time in Zoom, please raise their hand so we can identify who you are. And the next item, the consent agenda is for routine items in nature and can be acted on in one motion. Please note that item 2.5 has been discontinued at the request of staff, and I'd actually like to pull item 2.4 for discussion. So, and then again, please raise your hand if you have any if you wish to comment on closed session, and then I'd like to pull 2.2, please. 2.2 as well, okay. Any disqualifications on any closed session item? Mayor Kulich? Yes. Which item did you say had been pulled by staff? 2.5. Okay, thank you. Alright, so we're pulling 2.4 and 2.2. So, how many speakers do we have wishing to make comment on Senate? So, in Zoom, I believe we have two speakers that were wishing to speak on consent, and I did not receive any speaker cards for consent. So it would be just the first two. And it would be, Jeff? So... So, and that's speaking either on item 2.3 or 2.1. Or 2.2 or 2.4. So, go ahead. Go ahead, Jeff. Hello, can you hear me? Yes. Alright, so I just wanted to say you know, my decision was asking for you to maintain your American class when you go ahead and years and you know, I just thought it would be nice if you would try to make an appropriate class in the service of a class and how the car will be maintained. And maybe on a flat you know, Point of order, Mr. Mayor. Mr. Craig, can we have you hold on a minute? It's time for a recess. Yeah. We're going to recess our meeting for a minute here. So Jeff, just hang tight and we'll reconvene. Okay. Okay. Okay. We're going to be in charge of bus bus bus bus bus bus bus bus bus bus bus bus bus bus bus bus Do you believe any of this reference?

We're gonna pass the court rules in this case. It's like 45 in there. We're gonna clear it all wrong. We're gonna have to do this. You're distracting us from meeting with the pilots. Now, we have a lot of work to do. We can't hear. We have foreign rules. We didn't sign up. We have to be able to sign up. And, don't you come in here. You're not going to ask us to step up and hold you. Listen, call me. Debbie. I'm the flight attendant. You're gonna have to do this. I'm gonna tell you. You're gonna be that component of your arrest. We need to look at the call of your ambulance. We don't have a consent. We're a patient. We're a person who acts as a follow-up. I'm not interested in asking you. I'm just saying, we cannot stand out. We're not gonna do it. We're gonna have to do it. We're gonna have to do it. That is why we're addressing it. It's fast knowledge. We're gonna see the person here. If you guys are gonna run into a public meeting, the pilot is gone. We're gonna get you a new way. You're gonna get him into a five-man flight. He's gonna be out in a minute. And, that's the answer to the question. We're gonna do it after he's gone. There is a law. What? There is a law. There's a law. There's a law. There's a law.

I'm going to tell you one more time, he's last on the task. I'm going to get to the meeting right now and he's interrupting me. You're going to get arrested. I'm going to get arrested. I'm going to get arrested. I'm going to get arrested. I'm going to get arrested. I'm going to get arrested. I'm going to get arrested. I'm going to get arrested. I'm going to get arrested.

Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Thank you. Do we need a quorum in order for the mayor to make that comment? No, not in these circumstances. Thank you, sir. All right. So a quick announcement here, if we can. We're going to end up going to closed session. Unfortunately, what's happening is we have certain rules that we have to adhere to. If, in fact, we don't, we could be in violation. So we are moving to an open forum with public speaking this time. At our next meeting, we're looking at 50% capacity inside. So we are moving to exactly where I'm guessing some of these folks who are here today. We're doing it as quickly as we can within the means of what the city has. But if, in fact, we still have you in here violating the rules that we currently have established, we will have to actually come back from closed session and cancel the meeting and not do the work of the city based upon this. So, unfortunately, that's the thing we have. And at this time, we're not taking public comment. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

All right, we'll come back from our closed session meeting. Unfortunately, at this point in time, the council has certain rules and guidelines which have been set forward. We did have, for those in the public who are watching online, we do appreciate your patience. We understand that we were obviously gone for quite a while while we worked through this issue. We were doing a performance evaluation of the city manager during that time, which was scheduled. And then also we took up as an emergency closed session regarding the issue of people coming into the council chambers and not adhering to the rules that the public, or that the council had passed agreed upon. So moving forward with that, I will turn it over at this time to the city attorney to report out from closed session. Thank you, Mayor Coolidge. See, the council. The council met in closed session with the city manager, city clerk, and city attorney. And regarding the city manager's evaluation, no action was taken. And with that, I will turn it over to Council Member Morgan. Thank you, Mr. City Attorney. Following up in the same way we did with our evaluation of city clerk Presson, the city manager staff evaluation was done by the council. This is the first time in two years. Since that has been done, the city manager was evaluated in the following categories. Elected body relationships, organizational, community relations, physical, intergovernmental, communication, and personal. It is certainly my belief and overall belief of the council that we again have an excellent city manager. It was shared with him quite openly that we are proud of the work that he is doing and the way he communicates with the council. We discussed a variety of different things. As the city attorney mentioned, no action was taken. One thing that specifically did come up was it was unfortunate. Soon after the campfire, the city manager should have been evaluated in 2018? The year is right? 2019. Whenever that might have been. And we expected that evaluation that he probably would have been given that year would have been probably scored in such a way he never could have hit it again. Because he led this city strongly. He led this city patiently through turmoil that most cities never have had to deal with. Most staffs have never had to deal with. And we are honored to continue his employment and look forward to his employment for many more years to come. Thank you, Mr. Orme. All right. Thank you, Mr. Orme. We appreciate your service. So having decided, obviously, to adjourn this meeting because, unfortunately, we have people who are unwilling to. I'd hear to the rules that the council has set forward. We need to reschedule our next meeting, which will be conducted via Zoom. And then in the beginning of May, like many people in the general public, we are pushing to get things as back as open as possible, as quickly as possible. So we are looking at that May meeting to have 50% capacity at that time. If you would like to speak with a mask, you may come forward and speak at the podium. If you're wanting to speak without a mask, you would be given. You would be given a microphone and asked to stand in a different location. We believe, I believe, I'll say, that this is a fair compromise and can move us forward towards reopening the council meetings to the general public. So if we still have folks here at this time who are willing to not leave, we are forced to adjourn the meeting and schedule it for a different date. Mayor Coolidge, the only thing I would add was that that was a motion by. Council Member Morgan, seconded by you. And it carried 5-2 with Council Member Brown and Denlay opposed. All right. And Mr. Ewing, did you have anything further to add? No, you captured it along with Madam Clerk. So Madam Clerk captured the motions and also the status of the vote. So 5-2 with the nays being Council Member Denlay and Council Member Brown. All right. And the time for that next meeting, Madam Clerk, is? So the Monday adjournment. We're going to adjourn this meeting to a Monday complete virtual Zoom meeting. I believe that meeting starts at 6 o'clock this Monday night and participants can attend via Zoom. We'll get all that information out tomorrow. And then our next meeting where we are going to the 50% capacity with a mask requirement. And for those not wishing to wear a mask, there will be a podium at the back of the room or in the lobby or outside. We're going to work on the legislation. We're going to work on the logistics. We will have audio outside so people can hear. That will occur at the first meeting in May. And that is actually May 4th, I believe, at 6 o'clock. All right. Thank you. And I know we're all kind of struggling with this. Trust me, my business has been shut down for about a year and a couple of months now. So I know it all too well because I operate on a public facility as well where certain guidelines are having to be adhered to. So thank you. We will adjourn at this time. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
