 Start with an invocation from Amy Avonen. Thank you. Welcome.  Welcome.  For the many freedoms that we enjoy, we're thankful for the leadership of our country  and those that protect and serve here.  And we pray that thou will please bless them and watch over and protect them as they serve us.  We're thankful for this beautiful Chico community that we live in,  and we are grateful also for the leaders and the people that serve here.  We pray now as we begin this meeting that thy spirit will be here  and that the members of the council will be able to be guided and directed in the things that they decide  and that they will make decisions that will be helpful  and supportive.  And strengthen our community.  We pray that there will be a spirit of peace and unity, compromise, and kindness here tonight.  And we thank thee and say these things in the name of Jesus Christ.  Amen.  Amen.  Thank you very much.  Appreciate it. Amen. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. If you please stand and join me in the Pledge of Allegiance.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you. All right, Madam Clerk, could you do the roll call, please? Council Member Bennett? Here. Council Member Morgan? Here. Council Member Tanden? Here. Council Member Van Overbeek? Here.  Councilmember Winslow? Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds? Here. And Mayor Coolidge? Further.  All right, speaker card announcement. Anyone wishing to address the council on any of the items listed on the agenda should first complete the speaker card found in the back of the room.  And then once completed, turn it in to the city clerk to your right, to my left. Speakers are taken in the order the cards are received.  And once the first speaker begins their comments, no additional cards are being accepted. We'd ask you to not applaud or boo or anything like that, as it will make anyone with a different opinion feel uncomfortable.  So we just ask you to simply let each speaker speak and speak their whatever they would like to and not join in any kind of celebration or booing of them.  We will start with the speaker.  Thank you, Mayor Coolidge.  The City Attorney, City Manager, City Clerk and staff met in closed session on the listed agenda items.  No action was taken and direction was given. That concludes my closed session report.  All right. And I believe we have a presentation of the NorCal Cyber Mayor's Cup. Is that correct? Yes.  And I'm going to ask this question to the City of NorCal.  I'd like to invite the Vice Mayor to come down with me because I was not able to attend this year and she was. So, if you'd join me.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Okay.  So, we have our proclamation.  So, we'll start with that.  So, this is the NorCal Cyber Mayor's Cup.  I did not name this award just for the record.  So, this was not my doing.  And I didn't create it either.  But whereas the Sacramento County Office of Education hosted the NorCal Mayor's Cup 2023 in partnership with the California Community College Far North Regional Consortium.  Now you need to change that.  That's a good problem.  It is.  It is.  Whereas the NorCal Mayor's Cup is an annual event bringing together students from middle schools, high schools, and high schools.  Colleges across the region to compete in a single day cybersecurity competition.  And whereas the NorCal Mayor's Cyber Cup brings awareness to cybersecurity careers and provides students an opportunity to engage in team-based learning.  And whereas for the third year in a row, this wonderful part, a team from Chico High School has brought home the first place trophy.  So.  And am I getting this right?  The name of the team is the Geriatric Journalists?  Correct.  Go, go, journals.  It's comprised, you guys might have to explain that at some point.  No, it's comprised of students Karen Bracketel.  Correct.  Sam Richards, Daniel Russell, Jacob Tost, and Samuel Zwiger.  Correct.  And it's coached.  Jonathan Andrew.  And be it resolved that I and the College of Mayor of the City of Chico on behalf of State Council do hereby congratulate the students and our members of the community to learn more about cybersecurity.  So.  Thank you.  Thank you so much for being here.  And I believe we have individual recognitions for each of you guys as well.  I'll make sure they get this.  Which we'll make sure they get them.  And Vice-Mayor, do you want to say anything?  Or do you want to see the.  It was actually a really amazing event.  They put hours and hours into it.  We had to be on like two hours at a time while you guys were all competing.  And it's just super exciting to know that we have some of the top of the line students  learning amazing security.  And that we're going to have that coming out of our Chico community.  And I know you guys are just amazing gals who are all going to do amazing things.  And I can't wait to see what you name next.  Thank you.  All right.  Go Panthers.  Appreciate it.  Thanks.
