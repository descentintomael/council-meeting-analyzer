 Thank you. Trying to be artsy sometimes doesn't work, and sometimes it does. I get tired of shooting the same picture every time, so I'm trying something a little different. There we go.

Public hearing. Item 4.1. Use permit modification 21-03 Unitarian Universalist Fellowship. Close parent. 1289 Pilbred Avenue, 18. 045-292-007. And Kelly, you can tell us all about it. Good evening, everyone. This is a request to modify a condition of approval of an existing use permit to allow for an updated applicant statement, activity schedule, and daily operating hours for the Unitarian Universalist Fellowship Church. The project site is located on the southeast side of Pilbred Avenue between Bryant Avenue and the West Side of the City of Chico. The site is designated Low Density Residential on the City of Chico General Plan Land Use Diagram and is zoned R1, Low Density Residential. Surrounding properties and land uses are predominantly single family residential. Another church assembly use, the Evangelical Free Church of Chico, exists approximately 1,000 feet east of the UUF. Vehicle access to the site is provided via a singular access drive off Gilbert Avenue, leading to a paved parking lot with 25 spaces. The street frontage has been improved, curved gutter, and sidewalk. The Unitarian Universalist Fellowship Church, or UUF, as I'll refer to herein, was formally organized in 1953 and acquired the property in which it's currently sited in 1955. Building construction and site improvements, including tree planting and landscaping, occurred in the 1960s. And in June of 2015, a 2011 UUF obtained use permit approval from the zoning administrator authorizing the expansion of the church, including construction of a new 100-seat sanctuary, which later opened in 2012. In accordance with the code, a permittee may apply for changes in any condition of approval applicable to the use. Since the issuance of the original use permit in 2011, the church has continued to develop new relationships within the community and grow its fellowship. To ensure its compliance with the existing use permit, UUF is seeking approval of a modification to condition number 6 to allow for daily operating hours extending to 9.30 p.m. and an updated applicant statement with an activity schedule that more accurately reflects both current and planned use of on-site facilities. Currently, weekly operating hours are limited to no later than 9 p.m. on weeknights, and the applicant statement accounts for roughly 60 to 100 hours of use per month. Allowed activities include funerals but not weddings. As proposed, the updated applicant statement would allow flexibility to use the church facilities daily until 9.30 p.m. and estimates the total weekly usage will be between 35 and 55 hours. Allowed activities would include funerals, weddings, and other rites of passage. The applicant's request to modify the rules to condition number 6 was initially submitted in December of 2021. At its meeting of April 12, 2022, the zoning administrator considered the request and staff recommendation. Both written and verbal comments were received from the neighbors in the project vicinity who expressed concerns regarding on-site security, traffic, and other nuisance issues from increased activity. Ultimately, the zoning administrator referred the matter to the Planning Commission for determination, as the request is to modify a condition of approval and constitutes a major modification of the use permit pursuant to the code. At the advice of staff, the applicant held multiple neighborhood meetings to meet with concerned individuals and discuss the requested use permit modification. The main points of concern, again, centered on traffic impacts to Filbert Avenue and overflow parking from larger events, lack of on-site monitoring, security, issues, and loitering or smoking after hours, and noise and nuisance from general increased site activity. Comments included in the public correspondence attachment E from 2013 relate to a separate use permit request, use permit 1305, to establish an elementary school on site, which was ultimately denied. The modification request before you this evening does not propose a change of land use to accommodate a school on site. No new construction, expansion of existing facilities, or site improvements are proposed. The applicant has provided a good neighbor policy, which includes solutions for overflow parking at an off-site location and provides contact information for the board president. Additionally, the church shall remain subject to the city's noise and nuisance ordinances, and after consultation with the Code Enforcement Division, I can confirm there are no concerns from that department regarding the proposed request. Staff is recommending three additional conditions of approval be placed on the permit to enhance neighborhood compatibility, and that's going to be new condition number nine to post and maintain current contact information with both our department, as well as condition 10 to display that information on site for the neighbors. And condition number 11 to display signs for no smoking and no loitering in the parking area, as well as to ensure that the parking area is cleared by 9.30 p.m. In September of 2023, a letter was submitted by legal counsel on behalf of UUF invoking the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act, or VLUPA, which is a federal statute enacted to protect religious institutions and assemblies against the effects of unequal or burdensome land use restrictions. The city attorney's office prepared a response to that letter, which clarified the timeline of events and confirmed the request to modify the permit was not considered minor for the code. No action to deny the request was taken at the zoning administrator, therefore no violation to VLUPA has occurred. A use permit is a requirement for all churches in the R1 zoning district. This request has been processed in accordance with our code. Staff is recommending approval to the change of hours and updated activity schedule. To ensure neighborhood compatibility, we have also recommended additional conditions, which are not unusual and do not apply unequal or burdensome land use restrictions to this specific church. However, should the commission choose not to adopt the staff recommendation, specific findings for denial must be prepared in order to deny the proposed request. The project has been previously determined exempt from categorical or CEQA pursuant to section 15332 infill development projects and no further environmental review is necessary as no new construction, expansion, site improvements or other activity having the potential to cause a physical change in the environment are proposed. So with that, the community development director recommends the planning commission consider the project staff report, hold a public hearing, and approve the proposal. The planning commission has been prepared to hold a public hearing and ultimately adopt planning commission resolution 2410 to approve the modification 2103 to use permit 1108 for the Unitarian Universalist Fellowship. That concludes. Thank you. Thank you, Kelly. Anybody have questions, comments? A couple questions, Kelly, if I can. Number one, can you just offer a reminder to the commission and anybody who might be listening in the audience, use permits, do those carry with the applicant or do those carry with the land use? The use permit runs with the land. And then we've rarely seen requests to modify use permits. Usually when we're looking at use permits, it's a brand new one like we have later tonight. Is the commission, is it within their purview to consider their compliance with the previous use permit or the use permit that's in existence? I would say that that's a different question. I think that's reasonable to consider since they were issued their original use permit, all activity on site since then. Okay. Thank you. I have a couple questions as well. You mentioned that one of the restrictions was having schools on site. Does that include daycare services? Daycare facilities would be a separate land use than this use permit allows for, which is specifically the church use and the construction of the sanctuary. So a request to establish a school or a daycare use on site would require a separate permit approval. And then my other question was your report talks about a church approximately 1,000 feet east of this facility. Do you happen to know what their operating hours are? I believe they also go to 9.30 p.m. Perhaps 10, but it's one of those. So it's 9.30 or 10. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Any other questions for staff? If there are no more questions, we'll open the public hearing. And do we have cards? We have 12 speakers. Okay. Our first speaker is Megan Johnson following Pam Sachs. Chair Wall, before we open the public hearing, could I just ask, one, if anybody has any questions, if anybody has submitted a letter, you can guarantee that the commission has read it. So if you don't come up here and just repeat it verbatim, that would be great. And then also, we're really looking at the use permit. And so if we could kind of keep the comments to that and not the church operations or anything along that, but really the use permit, that's really helpful for the commission in how we make our decisions. Okay. Thank you. Who's the first speaker? Megan Johnson. Hi. I'm Megan Johnson. I'm going to keep it brief because I know we have a lot of people. I've been a member of the Unitarian Universalist Fellowship in Chico. We call it UUFC since 1997. And it's a very important part of my life. I've been very involved in it. I've been treasurer and president of the board over the years. So I'm just in fervent hope that you can come up here and we will pass this modification. Thank you. Thank you. Ms. Johnson, can I ask you a quick question? We did receive a lot of letters that talk about essentially those hours and the increase of hours that they perceive would be used. And then in the staff report tonight, we had a range of 35 to 55 hours. Could you just comment on that? All right. So the actual use that you're intending and the hours used per week? Can I defer to the people that have been working on that a lot? Sure. Yeah. At the fellowship. They're being speaking too. Thank you. Thank you. Can you give me one moment, please? I just had a speaker want to... Okay. I'm sorry, the applicant. Angela Riston. Good evening. I'm a member of the Unitarian Universalist Fellowship. I'm planning commissioner of city personnel and fellow community members. My name is Angela Riston, and I'm the current president of the board of directors at the church. UDFC, as we've heard, has a lengthy history here. We began with small group meetings in the 50s and then moved to our facility. We completed our sanctuary, a building that has the capability to have a capacity of 100 people. We believe that our current use permit right now inhibits our flexibility and our ability to offer programs and activities that are not available to the public. We've been working on a number of activities beyond Sunday's worship. Our modification application summarizes these activities that we'd like to do, such as our giving garden, our religious education programs, uses by other nonprofit groups. We began, as noted, pursuing our... When modification to our use permit, we became clear that we couldn't do many of the activities that others were able to enjoy. And then, like so many others in our community, we were touched by the campfire in 2018 and the impact of the fire. We were also very concerned about the COVID pandemic, resulting in a direct loss of a significant number of our members. Emerging from these tragedies, once again, we find ourselves welcoming new members and guests and friends. We have the worship space, and now we'd like to have a bit more flexibility on what we do to worship and offer a follow-up program and activities that are considered consistent with other churches. When we renewed our efforts in earnest to modify our permit, we revisited the correspondence from our neighbors. We believe we have developed a better understanding of the number of concerns and how to address them. As a result, we have already made plans to make several changes, and some of them are already in place. But they are part of the priority in the conditions on the proposed use permit modifications. We are proactively addressing them. We've also, as I said, revised our good neighbor policy, which you have. While acknowledging the perceived lack of continuity and knowledge of the use permit, we are now establishing policies and taking actions to ensure that our use permit is understood by every board member and our lay leadership, including our new good neighbor policy. Unitarian Universalist faith is guided by individual conscience. We find wisdom from numerous traditional and non-traditional religious sources. We work for justice. We celebrate the divine with all, and we are committed to the work of the church. We gather for worship and service our spirits. The Unitarian Universalist church is built, building a beloved community beyond our walls, which includes our neighbor and our neighborhood. Thank you very much. Thank you, Angela. Pam Sachs, followed by Howard Lucas. Hi, my name is Pam Sachs. I'm a member of UUFC. I'm a member of the UUFC. I'm a member of the UUFC. I'm also a board-certified music therapist, and I just wanted you to know the kind of people that go to UUFC. We have school teachers, small business owners, doctors, students, art teachers, museum historians, college professors, insurance workers, and artists. To name a few, we may be small compared to our very large neighboring churches, but we are important to the community. We pass the offering basket every week and give 25% of it to local charities and other organizations. We also give $5,600 to the following organizations in Chico. During the pandemic, with such tremendous need in Butte County, we gave 50% of our offering basket. We donated $5,600 to the following organizations over the last two years. Sixth Street Center for Youth, Everhart Village, Safe Space, South Chico Community Assistance Center, Butte County Local Food Network, Hungry Trolley, Home and Heart, and the North State Shelter Team. Most of our members work for nonprofits in their spare time. We're very lucky to have a local food network. We have a very active social justice-level-oriented congregation. We come to our church to share or celebrate our concerns and joys with each other. It's an important place for us to be. And we need the flexibility to be able to schedule meetings on whatever evening or afternoon we need to have. Our current news format does not give us that flexibility. So, I've been saddened and felt uneasy by our neighbors' perception of us. I was not with the church when some past issues arose that created bad feelings, but I plan to be here for many years to come. And I invite our neighbors to communicate directly with our board president if any issues arise so they may be addressed immediately. If our neighbors want to get to know us better in our sanctuary or in our garden, they will always be welcome. We value good relationships. In fact, it's what ties us together as a church. We covenant to be good listeners. We love to be good friends. We work and understand others. More communication is our goal and we hope we can establish new and better relationships with our neighbors in the future. Thank you. Thank you, ma'am. Howard Lucas followed by Anna DeLore. Good evening. I'd just like to say that we'd be afforded the same hours as a耶. the rest of other churches in Chico, I think that's only fair. And I'm a fifth generation Chico. And I think that you will consider that we do important things in our community and need flexibility in our time schedule. Thank you, Mr. Lewis. Anna Delore, followed by Beverly McMillan. Hi, I'm Anna Delore. The UU Fellowship of Chico is open to all and encourages all to come. We provide an atmosphere where you can nourish your soul and your spirit, helping to provide a healthy citizenship to Chico. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Good evening. Thank you all for being here. I'm a relatively new member of the Unitarian Fellowship. And I wholeheartedly support its request for this modification of its use permit because the additional hours is going to allow the church to have just a little bit of extra flexibility in serving recovery groups, which is a very important thing to me personally. The Haverwood group also, and others in our community who need low-cost meeting space and have difficulty finding it. Since I moved to Chico three years ago, I have found UU's to be a remarkably valuable community resource. And I'm very grateful in this particular regard because sometimes smaller really is better. Larger churches in our community typically charge higher fees for space rentals, which all of these things are in one form or another. And that can serve as a financial barrier to the kinds of small groups I'm talking about. Small groups, especially recovery groups, that really help people. So I hope that you guys, you all will see that we all support the fellowship's request for this modification. Thank you. Thank you, Ma'am. Laurie Klingerman, followed by Martha Barbera. Good evening. My name is Laurie Klingerman, and I am the current president of the Chico Havera, which is a very small Jewish congregation, who, we have our own space. We've been wandering around for 21 years, sharing space with other faith communities. And we found the UUs two years ago, and we've been sharing space with them. We have our religious services in the sanctuary, and we, our holidays begin at sundown. So generally what we will have is a seven o'clock service, and then at eight o'clock we'll go into the church. We'll have a fellowship call, and we'll have a schmooze and snacks. And then at nineish we clean up. And I'm generally the first person there, and I'm generally among the last people to leave. So if there ever was a concern, someone could contact me regarding that, because I'm onsite when we have our services. We've also found that the UU space is really beautiful, and very quiet and serene for our prayers and our meditation. The campus style setting there just really fits in with our congregation. I absolutely invite any of the neighbors who would like to come to a service, or especially the snacks and schmooze to come on in and fight bread with us. Our high holidays are coming up, and they are the holiest of days. And we really do appreciate the sanctuary. It's a beautiful space. And I just wanted to share some of the use that is happening at the facility. Thank you. Thank you, Lauren. Good evening. My name is Martha Barguero, and I'm afraid we're kind of on opposite ends of the fence here with this particular subject. In 2012, the UUFC was claiming to be kind of a small country church. Now all of a sudden, they are equal to the churches in the local vicinity, which is the Lutheran Church on Moss and the E.B. Freed Church. I've already written a lot of this in the letter, so I'm not going to bore you with all the additional details. Those churches are very large. They are well organized, and have paid staff. They have landscapers. They have building maintenance. They have parking facilities. Large parking facilities. They also have a larger membership. What we're concerned about is that the UUFC has repeatedly failed to show that they function as similar to these organizations. They are a self-admitted volunteer organization. They do not have the staff to function, probably, I'm going to say, at their current level, let alone open now for nearly 100 hours per week, because that would be seven days a week that they're asking for. Seven, 30, 40 hours a week. They're not going to be able to do that from 930 in the morning to 930 p.m. What our biggest concern is here is also they've never outlined security for this additional, well, they're going to be pushing 400 hours a week that they say they would like to have their operating hours. We've had 16 calls to Chico PD since 2015, 50% of which have been in the last two years. So that's kind of a concern, and they've kind of addressed it. But this is a permit issue. They're not really, they didn't really resolve. They created some of the problems themselves. They went along with a gentleman who's living in their parking lot and fought against enforcement policy for three years. They created a very unsafe and unhealthy condition on the underside of our fence. This gentleman had no facilities, but was pictured with no facilities. Our concern was there's raised beds growing up, growing food for the local organizations in the back of their lot. He had access to all this property for quite a while. So we brought that up to a different president at the time. But this is highlighting the problem of not self-monitoring. These individuals don't seem to hold themselves accountable, and they made us promises five years ago about the history and the door contacts, and that was years ago. They promised us all that information. It never happened. So anyway, we are asking if they're going to be like other churches, then they need to kind of act like other churches. Pay for the grounds maintenance instead of the annual, it's a fire hazard, guess we better mow. Pay for the building maintenance and pay for the sheriff fencing, which they have not done. That's a real world thing. They talk about respecting the neighborhood, but obviously nothing I've told you today is about respecting Pogre Down New. So, thank you for your time. I appreciate it. Thank you. Joe Gleason followed by Lucy Sperlin. Hi, my name is Joe Gleason. I live across the street from the church and then one lot to the west. And first of all, I want to say thank you to the commission for letting yourself this work that you do. These are not easy issues. I would just point out that this seems to be a major change to the current abuse permit. And there's ample evidence and letters shown in the packet of the concerns that the neighbors have. I don't know, it might be too late to put into the record a recent letter signed by over 20 of the neighbors I have here, if that's allowable. I don't know, but if there's some way to get that to you, which also expresses some of the concerns that I have, and some other concerns that the neighbors have. I know that in the past it's been difficult for the church. And while I appreciate their mission and their leaning towards justice issues and helping other people out, it's been hard for them, it seems, to live up to the current abuse permit. And so I would just caution the commission to really consider what, what they're tripling the current abuse will do to the neighbors. Thank you. Mr. Clayson, if you have materials for us, you can give them to our clerk. Thank you very much. Lucy Sperlin, followed by Grace. Good evening, and thank you for hearing us. What I have to say is probably would not change the outcome of how our community decides life, because we live with what we have right now, the situation we have right now. But to shed just a little bit of historic light on how we got to this point in this neighborhood. I first came to the Unitarian Church in 1962. I'm sure a lot of you know that. It was shortly after the property was acquired. And in late 1960s, around 1968, two major things happened. The Vietnam War and the freeway went through. Prior to that, Fulbright Avenue was a thoroughfare, a through street. And it was not a pocket neighborhood. When the freeway went through, it created the pocket neighborhood, and we were stuck there, and also, unfortunately, lost a lot of visibility from traffic going through, which to a certain extent has affected our songs. So I just thought that having that little bit of background that we were there and things happened around us. And so we continue to do the best we can. Thank you very much. Thank you, Lucy. Grace, and then following Grace will be Julian Zener. Thank you. I don't have any prepared remarks. I just want to relay to you the good feelings I have about the fellowship. I've been a member since 1984. And I know that the people who are involved in leadership want to do their very best by their neighbors and get along with them and work out any kind of problems that may arise. I think you should pay attention to them as well as to the neighbors and find something that will unite us Unitarians with our neighbors. Thank you. Julian Zener, and then following our last speaker, Liam Powell. Good evening, commission members. I'm Julian Zener. I've been at Chico and with the Chico Youth Fellowship for 24 years. I'm not going to go into details of the fellowship, I don't have a youth permit. But I'm here to say the members of the fellowship are wonderful folks, a community from all walks of life and open to everyone. The UU principles, as I understand them, include valuing the worth of each individual, seeking the truth and justice, and accepting all love. I'm sure that the city, the fellowship neighbors, and the fellowship can resolve any outstanding difficulties as regards the youth permit. Thank you very much. Thank you, Julian. Our last speaker, Leanne Powell. Hi, my name is Leanne Powell, and I live directly next door to the fellowship. My husband and I, we bought our property in 1994, and we rebuilt the home that was there and added on. Anyway, I am not opposed to churches. I belong to another faith, and I attend every Sunday. And I knew that there was a church there when we moved in, obviously. However, over the last, since 1999, we've had numerous, numerous issues over the years. And my concern is, it's not, these folks are great folks. They're great folks, right? But the problem that I see and what we're going to be up against is that if you allow this youth to permit to go from 7.30 in the morning until 9.30 at night, 365 days a year, you are taking our nice, quiet neighborhood, my San Francisco, to a sanctuary. And I don't know what I'm going to be getting. I have already submitted a letter, and there was a lot of chaos and things that have gone on over the years. A lot of things that were promised, things that were not followed through. I feel like, and with the rest of the neighbors, we have basically kind of been watchdogs for the neighbor, for the Unitarian Fellowship. Things that happened in the parking lot, things that happened on their property. We're the ones calling the police. We're the ones talking to the police. We're the ones that are there, because we live there, because we care about our neighborhood. We care about our homes. I think what they're doing with having, I know they have AA meetings, CODA meetings, and NA meetings. I think that's fabulous. And I'm not opposed to that. And they're there all the time, and they come and they go, and it seems to be working out just fine. I just don't see having something from 7.30 in the morning until 9.30 at night, 365 days a year, is needed. Because what they already have, our neighborhood, are they even using what they already have right now? And what are you opening this up to? If you're going to be having weddings and funerals, Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays, until 9.30 at night, where is my peace? And where is the rest of the neighborhood's peace? Thank you. Thank you, Leigh Ann. And that's all the speakers? That is it. Thank you. We'll bring it back to the commission. Any comments? Any? No? Any comments? Do I have a motion? Do I have a motion? Close the hearing. Pardon? Close the hearing. Okay. Close the public hearing. Do I have a motion? Anybody? I have some comments. They don't have a motion. And I'll just throw this out, and the commission can do with it what they want. My first thought is, I think, what a wonderful, lovely group. Thank you so much for your kindness and just respect of the commission and your conciseness. So really, thank you guys for that. When we make decisions, we don't make decisions based off of what you are. We're making decisions based off of the property and the address and the use. So while I appreciate that there were comments about other things, other churches, that doesn't really factor into my decision making because what I'm looking at is the use on that specific property. And with that, the commission does have a higher degree of responsibility because the use does not run with the applicant. The use runs with that piece of property. And so any time that we approve or modify a use permit, we need to look at the application and look into perpetuity on what that looks like if the property was ever sold or goes to another applicant. So just so you know that kind of that lens that we look through, that's a piece. I really appreciate the comments from the neighbors and I received several letters throughout the week. And I will say, I think the conditions that we have in the use permit right now, we still have a gap there between the neighborhood desires and the church needs really to worship and to hold what are really valuable services. And so I don't know, I don't feel like it's our responsibility to bridge that gap. I wish that had been done outside of this meeting. But I would be in favor of adding some additional conditions that would allow us to approve this tonight. One of those conditions would be that all events, and maybe just not hours of operation, but all events would end by 9.30 p.m. That there would be no more than 55 hours of use per week. That any events that involve alcohol require either the applicant or a party who's renting to have on-site security. And that in addition to the contact that we have from the church, that there is a backup on-call security. And those services do exist. But that we have that, and that would be if somebody doesn't respond within an hour or something like that. So those are my thoughts. Any other thoughts? I have a question. So when you say 55 hours per week, do you mean of total use or of... Yeah, total use. Okay. So if there was use every day between those hours, I mean, that's really gonna limit... What are the hours right now? I don't think I saw that. Anybody? Page two of our staff report has... They do have the hours that they can operate, but it also has kind of what the... The breakdown. And I don't wanna micromanage different days and what starts, but I think if we just say 55 hours total, they can figure out their schedule, and they have said that they... A part of their good neighbor agreement that they will post that schedule so that the neighbors could plan. Well, currently, it's from 35 to 55 hours. So it would just be removing that minimum and up to 55. I'm comfortable with all of that. All of those conditions besides for that one, that one seems pretty limited. Just a question of clarification on the security. When you say that alcohol would be served on site and there would need to be security, what in your mind is security? Thanks. Probably paid, trained representatives who know de-escalation strategies. Kelly, has the issue of alcohol being served been an issue at all? Not to my knowledge. There's been no reports from PD or Code Enforcement related to alcohol service. But again, whether or not... If we allow a use that rentals could be allowed, it doesn't matter if they're currently doing it. They could do it in the future, and anybody who owned that property could do it in the future. I don't disagree with the security part. I think my concern is that when you're operating a small church on donations, to hire a private security company is typically not in the budget. I'd be curious if other churches have those same requirements. I'm thinking more if they're using it as a venue, and that's what is... Some of the neighbors we're talking about is renting it out, and we do have social activities use. So if there is a wedding, and they anticipate serving alcohol there, and you have an influx of, let's say, 50 to 100 people in that neighborhood, most venues do...wedding venues do require you to have on-site security. Thank you. And they are adding weddings in. So weddings we're not currently... We have funerals in. We have weddings now. What's our max capacity on this facility? Just over 100 in the same room. Yeah. I would say it's not typical for a venue to have on-site security for 100 or less. Usually it's going to be more than that, but they would require absolutely insurance. Security... I'm speaking just out loud. Security, in my mind, is super important, but I also think that it has to be balanced. And... One of the speakers spoke about their... Where they gather after church and have, you know, food and drinks. So if it's a night service, and maybe they want to have a... You know, a glass of wine, I don't think that that would... mean that they would have to have on-site security. I'm afraid that that's a little too, you know, restrictive for me. So if their capacity is only 100, I don't think that they would ever... 100 people drunk in a neighborhood could be quite a lot. So... I don't disagree, but I just think that that would be maybe the... the extreme end of what could potentially happen. Are you talking about security being... being utilized as a result of the numbers of people or that alcohol is served? One or the other? Well, no, I... I think that there needs to be some limits to that, because if they're just having a women's group and they want to have a glass of wine, to me, that doesn't constitute... Like, maybe... ...on-site security. Maybe there could be a break between, like, wine and beer and hard alcohol, because one will probably get you drunker and more belligerent faster than the other. Um... Also, I'm just one person, so there's a rest... Yeah. You know, if the commission wants to pass this as is, um, somebody's free to make that motion, too. I have a question, too, about the recovery groups. So I'm interested in the recovery groups. I mean, is there gonna be needles passed out? Is there gonna be certain... I don't know what that means. And that could go until 9.30 at night and all these people are being wanted in neighborhoods and they're not in cars. So is anybody able to answer the recovery groups' questions? No. What's the answer? I saw Safe Base and I saw some other groups, and I just... So the public hearing's closed. I'm sorry. Uh... Yeah, so, Kelly, could you answer that for us? I do not have any specific information on these smaller nonprofit groups or... There's a need to look to change. ...question, too, because it seems there's some lack of oversight in the civil... So if they added needle, do you pass that back to them? I mean, I'm not sure if that's open to... Now, in a neighborhood, so there's a little concern for me. I'd like to ask more specifics of that stuff. Why don't we consider moving this along, and if the issue of alcohol comes up, then they can come in and ask for their alcohol permit for the number of people they're going to have at some future date. We don't have to approve that now because this can't be all-encompassing, whether it's a glass of wine, whether it's communion, whether it's a party with hard work, whether it's a party with hard liquor. Who knows? And probably, more likely than anything, they're not going to be drinking. Most churches don't support that kind of activity. So I would just as soon leave the alcohol issue aside for another day, if so needed. Now do we hear a motion? Tony, would you be open to adding... adding all the extra groups that will be there, not necessarily the church groups? Yeah. There's contact information as well. Maybe you could be there to contact us. The neighbors you can't contact didn't actually either. So who's to be there? I guess, and what I don't think is that... I think the concerns from the neighbors that we're hearing is there are the activities of the church, and then there are the activities of anybody who's renting that facility. And those activities of the rental of the facility, they don't have somebody to contact when something goes wrong, or they need to have that. So I would think having at least two contacts and that person needs to be available. I'll just say, I think we're asking a lot of the neighbors. I agree. Yeah. Yeah, that's their house. It's changed in the last while. I'm concerned that this has been going on since 2021. It started, and there's still a big advocacy. So they've had time to come here. They have a great group. They're doing good right now, but what about the speakers? And so, yeah, I just think it's important to protect the neighborhood as well. And there's only houses. There's a church and a church and houses. So, yeah, it's a big decision. It's bothering me because it's a great group here, but we've got neighbors here. That's their investment. That's their property. So... Can you...yeah. I'll go ahead and make a motion. It would be a fan privilege before we get there, this is legal counsel for the commission, as a recommendation from our office, if we would also recommend, if you'd like, you could continue this matter for the next meeting to develop more facts. So the circumstances, as presented in public comment today, and table this for the next meeting, or as a determination, if you choose to do so. I don't support that. Okay, I'll go ahead and make a motion. I move that the Planning Commission adopt resolution number 24-10, determining the project is exempt from further environmental review, pursuant to CEQA section 15162, and approving modification 21-03 to use permit 11-08, subject to the recommended conditions, including the new conditions of approval, which would be the conditions 9, 10, and 11, that were...that Ms. Murphy went over, and then also adding an additional condition that they... that they do not exceed the 55 hours operating hours per week. Do I hear a second? Well, I'll second it, Ann. Nicole, can we have a roll call? Yes. Commissioner Scarpa? Aye. Commissioner Poulin? Aye. Commissioner Laffins? Aye. Commissioner Cooper? No. Vice Chair Scott? No. Chair Wall? Yes. Okay. That passes, Order 2. Yes. Thank you all for being here tonight. Appreciate it. And you're welcome to stay for our next item, if you'd like. Tina, before you go. We will start on our next item, which is use permit 23-03, and AR 23-12, Skyway Travel Center, 2495 Carmichael Drive, APN 005, 570-023. Chair Wall, can we just give the public a moment to exit the chamber? Okay. And then I just want to remind you guys to please turn on your microphones if we're going to speak, so the public can hear you. We have some people that are listening online. Okay. Thank you. Yes. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Okay, Tina, go ahead. Thank you, Chair Wall, members of the commission. The item before you tonight, item 4.2, is located at 2495 Carmichael Drive, and the general plan designation is regional commercial as well as the zoning. The site is currently developed with a restaurant building that's been vacant for about four years is my understanding. This almost one-acre site is located at the northeast corner of Carmichael Drive and East Park Avenue, just west of the off-ramp, the Skyway off-ramp of Highway 99. The proposal before you tonight is a request to authorize a new drive-thru use associated with the construction of a new freestanding coffee kiosk attached to a new parking lot. This will include a new convenience store as well as a new gas station, a car wash, and associated site improvements including landscaping. The existing restaurant building would be demolished to prepare the site for construction, and there would be reconfiguration of the parking lot in addition to landscaping. This is the proposed site plan. It shows a building that... Front Carmichael Drive activates that corner. There is a double drive-thru lane that accommodates the minimum amount, actually more than the minimum amount of cars that need to be before the service window to meet city standards for drive-thrus. And in addition to the double lane drive-thru for the coffee kiosk, there's the gas station canopy with the islands for pumping gas, and then there's the car wash on the far side of the property. There would be some trees that would be removed as part of the proposal, and then there would be new landscaping proposed as well. One key item that should be noted is that the... current access way that is... this current drive aisle that is closest to the intersection would be closed off as part of this project, which would improve off-site circulation as well as the internal circulation for the queuing for the drive-thru. This is the proposed landscape plan. It shows some of the existing trees to be removed. Shows by X's. And then it also shows the new trees that would be proposed and shrubs. It's conceptual in nature, but it does demonstrate that it does meet the city requirements for shading of the site, but that does include the canopy itself in addition to that. The commission is tasked tonight with not only looking at just the use permit, but also the site design and architectural review as a part of the process for both entitlements. These are the elevations, exterior elevations. You can see the material and color board in front of the lectern here. If you'd like to take a closer look at that, we could bring that up to you to pass around if you're interested. There are a variety of materials, and then this same design is also carried through for the freestanding car wash that's on the other side of the lot. I also have a couple slides that show the circulation of a fuel tanker, a dual fuel tanker. So this is the clockwise truck maneuvering movements that are shown. It's a little difficult to see. It's superimposed over the aerial of the existing site. You can see in a very light green. The outlines of the canopy, the convenience store kiosk, and the car wash. But this shows that the truck movements are possible at this site. Based on our review, the project's been determined to be categorically exempt pursuant to the infill development section. It's less than five acres. It's surrounded by urban uses. It can be adequately served by all. It's consistent with general plan policies. It has been shown to meet all municipal code requirements. Staff does recommend approval. We have provided you with one public comment that we've received from the immediate neighbor that occupies the building surrounding this particular parcel, and that's from the Butte County Office of Education. That comment letter was emailed to you, I believe, yesterday. Staff's recommendations for the commission to consider the staff report, direct questions to staff, provide comments, hold a public hearing, and adopt applying Commission Resolution 2409, including the findings and determining the project's categorically exempt, and approve both the use permit and architectural review subject to the recommended conditions. That concludes my staff report. I'm available for any questions. Any questions for you? I have a couple. Go ahead. You mentioned kind of what is in our purview tonight, and I just want to know, I understand the drive-through triggering our review. Yes. Why the architectural review? As part of streamlining our architectural review process, instead of having the applicant and neighbors that might be concerned about the project having to come to two hearings for two different processes, we brought both items together since it's under the Planning Commission's purview, since the Architectural Review and Historic Preservation Board is a subcommittee of the commission. Okay. And then with that, I was a little surprised that we don't have any architectural renderings for the canopy. Is that typical or? I have not seen renderings for the canopy. I have seen renderings for the canopy in the past, but perhaps the architect could speak to the design of that, but I don't have that. Okay. Any other comments, questions? Okay. I do have one question, and I just want to make sure, maybe I misheard you, but you said something about the existing drive would be changed? And that's on Carmichael? Yes. Let me use the mouse to try to show the area here. There is an existing drive here that is going to be closed off as part of the proposed project. Thank you. Just to follow up to that, though, the other drive is existing. It is. So actually we're taking away one. We're taking away one, leaving one, and then reconfiguring the parking. Okay. Okay. We'll open the public hearing, and we'll ask if the applicant has anything to say before we go any further. Good evening. My name is Julio Pinheiro from Milestone Associates. We're the design firm for the project. I'd like to thank the Commission for allowing us to present tonight. I also want to thank Tina for her help with the renewal process. We appreciate it. We're excited about this project. We do commercial development throughout the state. We're excited about bringing a unique design to this location. As you are familiar with it, it's an abandoned building. We feel that this addition will be a benefit to that site, make it look really nice. Proposing, like I said, a unique design. Proposing lush landscaping that's going to meet the landscaping requirements. But with any of these projects, our two major concerns we have are noise and traffic. So when we start this, it's the first two concerns that we always want to make sure we address. And so traffic, as mentioned in the staff report, yes, one of the driveways is going to be closed, which is closer to the intersection. But this site actually has two other driveways, one further north than the one that we showed. So we feel that even though we're closing the one close to the intersection, the circulation to that site would still be adequate for the amount of traffic that's used that site. One of the concerns is the queuing that we all experience with these drive-throughs. The stacking is always an issue. So we've implemented throughout most of our facilities a traffic management plan where we'll actually train staff and the employees to go out and even close the lanes. And during high peak or special events where it would prevent the overflow of the queuing to go into the street or even further into the site. So if you're familiar with, you guys know Chick-fil-A, In-N-Out, we name it. They always have to implement that just for the peak hour, typically just for a short period of time and not for the whole day. So we have a traffic management plan that will be in place. And it will be submitted to the board. Thank you. And we'll be sending it to the city for approval as well. The other concern is the fueling, the gas station. I know there was a couple of concerns that were brought up in one of the letters that was presented earlier. Gas stations at Genora are regulated by the EPA. There's a bunch of requirements that we need to meet. A lot of vapor capture. If you think about it, the last time you got to a gas station, I don't think you've ever smelled the gas because the pumps, the muzzles have a bad smell. So you need to use a vacuum to capture the vapor and then any of the fuel is contained. So if you think about it, I don't think you can ever remember a complaint about a gas station, fuels or emissions. We're really conscious of the greenhouse effect. We have to make sure that we take that into consideration. So the emissions is always a big deal for greenhouse gases. And so our design of the station is to provide us with a design that's going to complement the EV, the electrical trend that's going forward. So although maybe right now it might be a little bit more cars in the queuing, our studies have shown that the emissions of the vehicles in the queuing are actually less than the queuing of the intersection itself. So the noise emissions of the intersection is over. Right. So the noise emissions of the intersection is almost always more than the site that the section is generated. But we don't take that for granted. We do our noise studies. We do our environmental studies just to make sure that the site's going to be a benefit to the city and to the patrons that come to the site. I know that the traffic, again, that was brought up and I think I mentioned that we have a traffic management plan. One thing is this project is its own commercial. And so the restaurant before, I don't even know what that was for, but I think they're a little bit longer than what we're proposing on our project. So although we will be generating more trips, it may seem like a more trip, but if you add it up to what it was originally, it's actually a pretty comparable use. But that, again, we can show through our traffic analysis and provide that to the city. We don't. We know that the applicant or the owner is going to invest millions of dollars in this location. And so we want to make sure that it's a viable business for him and it's for the city. So we're not going to invest into a project that's not going to benefit all the parties concerned. So I know the letter was brought up from the Duke County Office of Education. We haven't had a chance to discuss the project with them. But we're definitely open to discussing any concerns that they may have. We are a friendly firm. We want to make sure that we consider any concerns or comments, especially from the commission or from the board that we may have that we think appropriate. We're going to, the main thing is this use permit, right? We're here for the use permit. So the drive-through is the concern. We feel that we have mitigated and have mitigated measures to account for any issues. So we're going to be concerned regarding traffic or noise related to that. Correct me. The car wash is also maybe sometimes a noise issue. That's another one that we've designed. So a lot of these are, since it's a number one concern for car washes, noise is always backings or blowers. So industry standards are evolving constantly. And we have, again, shown studies that the noise generator is not going to be able to handle that. So we're going to be very careful with this car wash. It will be less than what's generated on actually Skyway, the traffic on Skyway that is currently there now. So we're not going to be increasing the noise levels that are currently existing now. And then, so traffic noise, and I just think we're, again, the design, we're really excited about it. It is unique. I can tell you guys that Chico will have this concept first. I haven't done this project anywhere else. So we're excited about that. And I know the applicant or the owner is here as well to answer any specific financial questions or benefits as that as well. So with that, I want to thank you and answer any questions that the commission may have. Thank you very much. Thank you. Do we have any speaker cards? We do. We have nine speakers. Nine? None. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. My name is Tad Alexander. I'm Deputy Superintendent of Butte County Office of Education. I've been a resident of Chico for over 30 years. I'd like to thank you for all the time you put into ensuring that Chico is a great place to live. And in that spirit, I'm asking that you deny or delay the approval of this plan as it has been proposed at Carmichael. Butte County Office of Education has been serving the children of Butte County out of the suites located at 2491 Carmichael for more than 26 years. Our educational facility is contiguous with property in question. It is a crucial facility for our students. We have owned 2491 Carmichael for approximately 10 years. This building is key to serving some of the county's most vulnerable students. Our facilities serve foster youth. We have a community of about 1,000 students. We have a career technical education in the form of dental assistants and veterinary technicians. We serve students of all ages out of this facility on a daily basis. I'd like to be clear that I am pro-business and would have no issue with a change in the proposed building as it is an abandoned eyesore and attractive nuisance right now. But the installation of gas tanks close to our educational facility, along with the potential sale of alcohol and tobacco products, is a problem, not to mention the traffic congestion that already has been imposed on the building.

Alexander I have a few questions and if somebody else is better to answer them how many students are at that facility during the average school year I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry okay and then probably another question just kind of hours of operation for you guys there we are there all week long and we do have some events on weekends okay and then your location is that do you have a use permit to operate or is that something by right by having the students there okay all right Tina would you know that 2491 Carmichael Drive I'm sorry we can't we have a public hearing that we have to but yeah Tina you could find that thank you the this property that Tad is talking about is or mr. Alexander is 2491 Carmichael and that particular building I did look at some of the permit history of the site I know that for some tenant information I know that the permit history is not the permit history of the site I know that for some tenant information I know that for some tenant information I know that for some tenant there is no use permit on the for that property and I don't know the extent of the operations to know if a use permit would be required or not that would be something I would need to evaluate okay thank you next speaker is Amanda following Amanda will be mr. mrs. Wright good evening my name is Amanda Sammons and I'm the senior director of Workforce Development and Business Partnerships with Butte County Office of Education. Tonight I'm asking you to deny or at least delay the approval of this plan in consideration of the safety and security of our students and staff. I oversee the Career Technical Education Department which includes Butte County ROP. Butte County ROP has been serving the educational needs of Butte County and surrounding counties since 1974. At the Carmichael location we operate the following ROP student training programs. Medical Hospital Careers course, Medical Assistant Program, Registered Dental Assistant Program, Dental Specialty Courses, Certified Veterinary Assistant Program, Middle and High School Career Camps in a variety of areas including fashion design and medical careers and direct support professionals training. The ROP program moved into the Carmichael location in 1998. In fact, Suites 100 and 200 were specifically designed and built to meet the unique needs of our career programs. This includes six different dental operatories which are outfitted with the same equipment that you would find in your dental office. A significant investment that is not easily moved. The design of this space and the classrooms lends itself to support the high quality career training programs that Butte County ROP is known for in the area. ROP courses begin as early as 7 45 a.m. with staff arriving at 7 a.m. and our evening programs wrap up at approximately 6 p.m. Additionally there are specialty courses that are scheduled on evenings and weekends throughout the year. On average we have approximately 175 students enrolled in both our short and long term programs throughout the year including summer months. In addition to the ROP programs that operate at this site there are other student programs including on-site tutoring and FAFSA support for school-aged foster youth and homeless runaway youth, weekly youth advisory council meetings for school-aged homeless youth, educational and instructional services for Comeback Butte Charter high school students. I am charged with ensuring that our students have a safe and comfortable learning environment. We have a dedicated program to help students with a high school record. We have a dedicated team of faculty that work hard to ensure that their classroom environments are conducive to learning. Last year there was a car fire within the vicinity on Highway 91. Within minutes our instructors were alerting us to the smell of smoke within their classrooms due to the air being pulled in through the HVAC systems. The type of business that is located in this location has a direct impact on the safety of our students. Specifically safety from environmental hazards and having a viable plan in place for safe evacuation should an emergency occur. Please consider the safety and safety standards associated security of our students and staff as you evaluate the impacts of this proposed business at the carmichael location thank you mr wright good evening planning commissioners my name is brett wright i'm the director of school safety and emergency preparedness for the butte county office of education before working for the butte county office of education i served in public safety for 16 years i was a firefighter for five years and 11 years in law enforcement i assisted evacuating many residents in butte county through a variety of disasters having a clear escape route and safety zone to reunify our families and co-workers is essential to every safety plan i'm asking that this gas station be delayed or tabled until you can review the following safety concern i'm certain with my 16 years of public safety experience that this proposed gas station would prevent our students and staff anyone at cowsgate the residence inn or the courtyard hotel from safely evacuating the area carmichael drive is a short dead-end street access from east park avenue the proposed gas station entrance and gas pump area is approximately 800 feet from the end of carmichael drive the proposed gas station would only allow employees to escape to the dead end if there were an emergency at this location according to the 2024 emergency response guidebook or erg we cannot meet our minimum of evacuation distances the erg is used by hazardous materials technicians firefighters and police officers across the united states to guide them in establishing evacuation distances when there's a hazardous material spill i had a copy of this book in every fire engine and police vehicle i was in when i worked in public safety in the butte county area the erg recommends an immediate downwind evacuation of 300 meters or a thousand feet for a large gasoline spill which is only 55 thousand 624 feet for a fuel tanker fire as noted by staff the fuel tanker movements i quote are possible as you look at the single entrance exit for that fuel tanker we're assuming there are no vehicles in this area i believe there will be vehicles if you're proposing a gas station coffee stop a coffee shop a convenience store and a car wash i'm not sure how those movements would be possible with only 800 feet to evacuate from the proposed gas station our students and staff could minimize the minimum evacuation distances by going towards and through the fire having our students and staff trapped at the end of carmichael drive would also create a hazard for our public safety personnel they would have to attempt rescue operations while simultaneously mitigating the hazard far too often we hear about disasters how they could have been prevented after they'd already have been occurred i'm asking this planning commission to delay this project for further discussions about safety to prevent a potential disaster before it occurs thank you very much for your time thomas and then following thomas will be melissa anderson good evening planning commission my name is thomas flanagan i'm the senior director of maintenance operations and facilities for the ducal county office of education one of my responsibilities is the interior and exterior facilities and how they interact with our staff students and visitors who wish to engage with the vcoe i would ask that the proposed plan be denied and that the proposed plan be! disse disse disse disse disse disse disse disse disse disse disse disse disse disse disse disse disse disse disse disse disse disse disse disse disse disse disse disse disse disse disse disse disse disse disse disse disse disse disse disse disse disse disse disse put in place. And lastly is the health and safety as it relates to air quality. Several compounds of various human health are released from gas stations during vehicle fueling and from underground storage tank vents. These compounds include benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene. Measures to reliably resolve these adverse health effects are not effective when related to the proximity, which is less than 250 feet of the proposed gas station location. Benzene is the gasoline constituent most harmful to human health. Adverse health effects of benzene include nausea, cancer, anemia, increased susceptibility to infections, and low birth weight. According to the World Health Organization guidelines for indoor air quality, there is no safe level of benzene. Most call for a greater separation than the 300 feet recommended by the California Air Resource Board. The increasing safety zone distances were promoted or prompted by the ground-based air quality guidelines. The California Air Resource Board has also provided a long body of research showing that adverse health effects extend further and further from gas stations. A 2019 study of U.S. gas stations found that benzene emissions from underground gasoline storage tanks, vents, were sufficiently high to constitute a health concern at a distance of up to 524 feet. This is concerning as the BCOE has a total of 12 HVAC rooftop units on its facility. They are less than 300 feet from the proposed canopy area of the gas station. Each of the 12 RTEs is a total of 12 HVAC rooftop units. The BCOE has a total of 12 HVAC rooftop units. The BCOE has a total of 12 HVAC rooftop units. The BCOE has a total of 12 HVAC rooftop units. The BCOE has a total of 12 HVAC rooftop units. The BCOE has a total of 12 HVAC rooftop units. The BCOE has a total of 12 HVAC rooftop units. The BCOE has a total of 12 HVAC rooftop units. The BCOE has a total of 12 HVAC rooftop units. The BCOE has a total of 12 HVAC rooftop units. The BCOE has a total of 12 HVAC rooftop units. The BCOE has a total of 12 HVAC rooftop units. The and I coordinate youth prevention services for the County Office of Education, school ties and prevention programs. These programs address the needs of children in grades K through 12. Our offices are in the Carmichael parking lot right where the proposed travel center is supposed to be. Tonight I'm asking that you deny or at least delay the approval of this proposal for the well-being of the youth in our county. School ties work with homeless and foster youth. Our goals are to provide these students with the tools, support they need to succeed throughout their school career and beyond. This includes their involvement in a youth advisory committee, YAC. They are actively involved in activities around the community. YAC has a meeting place within our office that was created for and by these students. They dug this space with a nest and deserve it to be a refuge from the stressful lives that many of them know too well. As for our prevention programs, these address youth substance use and addiction, providing education and quitting services to all students and beauticians. The school has a variety of disse disse disse disse disse and we are bringing intervention office hours for students to our Chico Carmichael location this upcoming school year in August. These addiction interventions are a large part of our program. We offer students the opportunity to explore quitting substances that they may have started or already are addicted to. The California Healthy Kids Survey checks, collects data from students in grades K-12, and those in non-traditional settings, which would be continuation schools, which are a lot of our students. This checked data indicates almost half of our non-traditional students use alcohol and nicotine. And I want to be clear, it's not only non-traditional students who are at risk of use and addiction. These addictions are reported in students even as young as seventh grade. These are the students that use our facility on Carmichael, and they are using the product that this proposed convenience store wants to sell to. Our youth need adults to help provide access in the first place. As a result, I'm concerned that if a convenience store that sells nicotine and alcohol in the very same center that we provide quit services to these students, as well as the bustling traffic, it will interfere with our intentions of providing a safe place to decompress. Thank you. Thank you, Melissa. Travis Haskell and then Michael Williamson. Good evening. Good evening, esteemed commissioners. My name is Travis Haskell, and I'm an assistant superintendent with the Butte County Office of Education. And I've also been a Chico resident for more than 20 years. I am asking the commission to deny or at the very least delay the approval of this proposed plan. As we have shared here today, the Butte County Office of Education is not opposed to having a business at our shared location. In fact, we have had multiple businesses there since we have owned the building and have a positive working relationship with each of them. Our concern is over the safety concerns this particular business poses to our students and staff in multiple areas discussed by my colleagues. Given our many serious safety concerns, as well as the oversight of the deed of easement, we implore the commission to reconsider the need for these redundant services at this location. With access to all of these services in close proximity, is it worth the risk to our students and staff to add another gas station, another car wash, coffee house, and convenience store at this proposed location? All around our offices and gas stations, Costco being the largest. Additionally, there are gas stations to the west and the east of our office, as well as northbound exits on Highway 99 from our office. There are multiple car wash options within a mile of our location, as well as access to coffee, groceries, and convenience store items all along the Skyway. We have worked at this location daily, for the past 26 years, and have not observed a shortage of access to any one of these services. We question the need for these services at this location, especially given the safety and traffic concerns that will impact our students and staff at our educational center. Thank you very much for your time. Thank you, Travis. Michael Williamson, following Vianna Tadeo. Good evening. My name is Michael Williamson. I'm an assistant superintendent for the Butte County Office of Education. Our team shared many important facts this evening, and we appreciate your time and your open mind as we have discussed our concerns. Some of those shared concerns include discussing that the plan, as written, has overlooked deeded access being deleted along with deeded parking. All of my colleagues discussed that in many ways tonight's decision affects the students of Butte County, and I'm sure that will affect the students of Butte County for generations to come. Concerns were shared about additional traffic congestion in the area. We already experienced that during peak coffee hours with a coffee place right across the street. BRAC has shared the potential for liability related to failing to comply with basic safety requirements that are in every ERG, on every fire and police vehicle in Chico. You heard from Travis that the proposed businesses are redundant and already available in close proximity, which means, to me, we're utilizing space without actually creating more sales tax. We're just spreading out the same tax. Melissa shared about the negative effects on students in K-12 when alcohol and tobacco products are being sold on an easement for school and just feet away from where support groups and education is being delivered about the ill effects of alcohol and tobacco on new year kids. In closing, I want to share that the Butte County Office of Education's model is where students come first, and I would ask the Commission this evening to consider joining us in exercising that model by delaying or denying this rule. Thank you. Anna Tadeo, then Amrit Deol. Good evening, Commissioner Marius. My name is Anna Tadeo, and I represent the Butte County Health Department's Tobacco Education Program. Currently, there are 95 tobacco retailers in the city limits of Chico, and according to the Stanford California Tobacco Health Assessment Tool, 32.3% of Chico's 31 schools are within 500 feet of a tobacco retailer, about one block. And then 58.1% of schools are within 1,000 feet, which is about two blocks, so walk distance for young people, which can be problematic. This data does not even account for other youth schools, and we have to send the establishment aside from schools that are in such close proximity as well. The convenience store seeking approval to open would be in very close proximity to several youth establishments, and as we've heard tonight, a number of the youth that frequent these offices within this lot are at a higher risk for addiction to tobacco products. With the consideration of adding a 96 tobacco retailer to our city, I would like to introduce the idea of a tobacco retail license program and how it can address several important issues. A tobacco retail license is a local license that each tobacco retailer would need to apply for separate from the state tobacco retail license. The fees from these applications would fund sustainable enforcement independent of grant funding, which may expire or have limitations. Additionally, a tobacco retail license would fund tobacco education for retail stores, encouraging compliance and therefore supporting retail store success. Provisions can be added to a tobacco retail license such as distance requirements for how close a new tobacco retailer can be to a youth establishment, and counts on the number of tobacco retailers that are allowed and the city limits at any point in time. Other provisions such as minimum pack sizing and pricing can also be included, and prohibiting online sales to deter the PLA accessibility to these youth. Currently, 230 out of 482 municipalities in California have established retail licensing programs, including nearby Oroville. I wanted to highlight that 90% of adult smokers tried smoking or started smoking under the age of 18. Tobacco use often begins as a youth and then continues on to be a lifelong addiction. Evidence shows that about 70% of adult smokers do desire to quit. Preventing youth initiation at the point of sale and having distance requirements is one of those prevention efforts. It's the most effective way to reduce tobacco addiction rates and the associated health care costs. Tobacco retail license programs have proven successful in decreasing youth initiation and reducing illegal tobacco sales to minors. And I have some information if you're interested with my contact information if you'd like more, to contact us for more information about tobacco retail licensing programs. And thank you for your time. Our last speaker, Amrit. Good evening. I represent Skyway Travel Center. I will be the developers of this project. We started this project in 2022. And the first thing we did as a good faith was to reach out to our neighbors to share our vision and get their input for the development. I've had several meetings with the staff at Butte Education. I shared our plans and made certain changes to incorporate their concerns. During our last meeting, they said straightforward we were going to oppose any improvements besides the restaurant. We just want the council to be aware as per city zoning, the property has allowed usages of alcohol sales, liquor sales, car wash, and retail sales. The property has been vacant for the last 40 years. The restaurant building was built in 1978 and they have been serving alcohol sales since they opened. The Butte building was built in 2001 and they purchased by their current occupants in 2016. I'm sure they are aware of the zoning usages. Our project is not requesting a change in support. We are developing according to the code. Regarding sales of cigarettes, tobacco use, and alcohol, everybody is going to be ID'd. We are not going to sell to underage. We are going to make sure our licenses are at risk if we do. The project will bring in opportunities for employment. The C-Store and coffee kiosks are anticipated to bring in 20-30 jobs. The city of Chico is planning to expand its business and provide tax revenue on productive commercial real property which has been sitting vacant for the last four years. In short, granting approval of the CUP is a positive step for all. Thank you. I do have one question. Maybe somebody can answer it. What is the point of delaying this? What does that get us? So the thought of the delay, we would prefer that it was dismissed and it wasn't something that came before you. If that is not something you are capable of doing, then a delay so we can have further discussions over the easements at least that came up and the installation of gas right next to our building is probably not something we are going to be able to talk through. That's just not something we can support as it's detrimental to the students. So the delay would only be to deal with the easements if that's something that has to happen. Okay. Okay, we'll close the public here. I was going to ask, when we go to the huge bus, the Chico Unified bus, is there fueling going on right now? Is there fueling that takes place at the bus place at the end for Chico Unified where all their buses are stored? It looks like it could be a fueling center there. Nobody? Are you guys aware at all? It's right next to you guys too, so I'm just wondering if there's a lot of facilities and stuff. . I'm just saying it's pretty... . He was saying that the numbers were 5,000 feet or 5,000 feet. Paul, can we not do the public hearing like this? No, I was asking an honest question. There's fuel that's right down the street. That's something that we need to ask when they're up here so that we keep the public hearing. So if you want somebody to come back up, we can do that. Sorry. Sorry, Larry. Okay. Can I read one over? No, I'm going to reopen the public hearing. Go ahead. Okay. . I just want to make a point that, again, the project is zoned in the previews. The whole project is approved in all the departments. Other than the drive-through, that's what we're here for, is what used to be the drive-through. So all the gas, comments, and fueling, concerns, and all that really did not, for approval tonight, were ever the use permit. But I do want to make a point that this project was routed to all the departments, fire, traffic, public works. Everybody had a time to review it over the last two years and then had a chance to comment on it, which they did. And the departments gave us their comments, and we responded and revised our plans in kind. So this plan that you're seeing has not been the first rendition of the site plan. We revised it based on it. We have a lot of work to do. We have a lot of work to do. And so I want to make sure that we kind of bring it back to why we're here tonight. And it's for that drive-through. And we feel that we have mitigating measures that will be in place to account for any nuisance or any traffic that the drive-through lane will cause. So I just wanted to clarify that. Thank you. Thank you. Before we close public comment, I just have one question for Ms. Wilson. Just a point of clarification. But if the applicant decided they didn't want a drive-through, they would not have to come before the commission and they could proceed with their plan as designed? I actually have to correct that in that the use permit is actually for both the drive-through and for the gas station use portion of the project. Because the gas station needs the use permit approval as well. And that's the only way to get it through. And I think that's detailed in the resolution and the findings. Can you close the public hearing? I'm sorry, we have questions. Of the public or of those out in the audience? I just want to know how many students are served. The number varies annually based on program enrollments, but it's approximately 175 students throughout the year at that location for the ROP program. And what are the ages? They are anywhere from, from high school to young adult, like 18 to 25 for some of our ROP. Thank you. Okay. Now we'll close the public hearing. Bring it back to the commission for comments and maybe even a motion. Toni, you got something? I don't know that this matters, but I will say, so 2491 Carmichael Drive is commercial regional, according to the map that I have saved. Yes. That I did not access the internet, but I have it saved on my phone. And so with that, and I don't know if this makes a difference to the commission at all, schools would require a use permit, but special education, specialized training does not. So if we think about that use too, I know we've heard a lot, but it is not considered a school. It's considered specialized training. If there is a school there, they would have required a permit to operate there. Is that correct? As Madam Chair, Mr. Chair and commissioners, as a superior jurisdiction, we cannot impose our local requirements on them. I believe they get their permits directly through the state architect or something of that force. They're a state agency, and we can't impose our local regulations on them. So in answer to your question, a use permit would not be required because we can't require that of a different jurisdiction under the state regulations. And then the only other thing I would say is I, I, I'm considering the use permit as far as the gas station and the drive-through. So there's that. And then we have the architectural review. I find myself in a position that it's hard to weigh on a decision on the architectural review without saying it can't be. And that's not something that we have. If the commission feels like they can make a decision without saying that, I understand that. But we don't have that in our files. I just have a general comment that I, I did like the speaker's suggestion of the tobacco retail license. And I do think that that's something that the city, or that our municipal code, which I would think would go through the city council, should look at. But unfortunately, and correct me if I'm wrong, but that's not something that we can do here on the commission. Not on tonight's agenda. And I think you're right to contact your local council. Council member. I have serious concerns about this use permit. I'm really glad Butte County Office of Ed was here. I didn't even know that it was in close proximity to the Butte County Office of Ed, which is also a vulnerable community. I also have issues with the CEQA exemption. There are huge environmental and traffic impacts that go beyond what is reasonable for an exemption. I have issues with use permit finding two, three, four, and five. For two and three are pretty similar. It's about the proposed development. Let's see, actually. It's about the proposed development, the detrimental to health, safety, and general welfare. And three is about detrimental or injurious to property or improvements in the neighborhood. For two, this type of development, there are environmental health concerns. Be it, you know, the city or the county office of ed brought up some of them for the concerns, which included like noise and throat irritation, headaches, cancer. I also found lung damage and kidney damage. That type of pollution and emissions are just something that I wouldn't feel comfortable about being there in general, especially next to an educational center. For finding three, the Dutch brothers is right next to it. That with the use being so similar across the street, I don't think the coffee shop is needed and would create a concentration of the use, which could reduce revenue and be detrimental to both businesses for, let's see, findings five. Yeah, I just don't think the location is appropriate. The use of gas stations. I'm glad that he was brought up, but I just wrote my comments based on just gas stations. The use is going to diminish within the decade. The California advanced clean cars to regulations requires that all cars, all new passenger trucks, cars and SUV sold in California will be zero vehicles by 2035. That's an 11 years. There will be a significant reduction in this use. There are also seven plus gas stations nearby within two miles. I just I could not approve this or go forward with this use. It's just not appropriate for the location as well as for the neighbors. So anybody else. Anybody ready to make a motion. You're saying you want to see the. I do, but I will say if. I'd rather see how the commission votes on that. For me, it, I don't have issues with the use permit, but I don't. I personally don't feel like I can make a support anything on architectural review without seeing that critical piece. So that's, that's just kind of a tough spot that I'm in. But also we have other members of the commission, so it might be more expeditious and help the applicant move along in our process. And we take a vote tonight. And they can exhaust kind of any opportunities there by our decision. Yeah, Mr. Chair, Tina and I were just talking about that. If you like, Tina has a condition prepared where we can require them to provide the elevations of the canopy subject to staff review and approval to be consistent with the overall design theme of the style and design of the center. And if you feel comfortable, you can delegate that authority to staff to review. So we can delegate that to you to take care of it and set it up with the applicant? Yes, sir. And I trust you guys. I'm just going to say that that's not how I can vote, but I, if the commission wants to, I totally understand. And it's not disrespect to your guises. So we're just saying that's an option if you, if you all want to add to that condition, we can do that. And I'm just making a comment too that based on the samples down there, I think that that would be a huge improvement architecturally compared to what's there now. A motion? I'll make a motion. I will make a motion that, uh, we recommend the adoption of resolution number, uh, proposed motion. I move that the planning commission adopt resolution 24-09 determining the project is categorically exempt from environmental review pursuant to California Environmental Quality Act, CEQA, Guidelines Section 15332, and approving use permit application 23-03, and architecture review application 23-12 with staff looking at the canopy rate. Um, Skyway Travel Center, which has a wall. Yes. Motion carries. Bruce, do you have any need to take care of the canopy? Yes, sir, we do. Thank you. Bruce, can I just ask you a quick question before we go to the next? Maybe it's something we can talk about later. I'm real interested could it be possible for you to come back with a report at some point of what properties in the city of Chico are state owned and kind of under that state jurisdiction? I know Silver Dollar Fairgrounds and some schools, but I do find that tricky, I'll say tricky of a property owner kind of going through our normal planning process and then coming up against I think there was in answer to your question, I think there was recent state legislation where the city was obligated to identify properties that were available that could potentially be disposed of for residential uses. So let me do some research and if I can find what that report was, I'll certainly circulate it to the Planning Commission. I think that was a compliance thing where we had to do some kind of a summary or assessment of that. That's my recollection. But I can report back at your other meeting. And I just think of a developer looking and thinking this is the use that's allowed and then having a state entity that has conflicting uses. Great. Next item up. 4.3, Title 18. Subdivision Ordinance Amendment. Noticing radius correction. Yes, Mr. Chair, Commissioners. You may recall last year we did a comprehensive update of the subdivision ordinance. When we did that, we made a mistake and we left in, I've got it above on the screen, we left in a provision that says lot line adjustment, lot merger, plot map, part of, plot map or minor land division. We left that in there when it was only supposed to include the revision that includes tentative subdivision maps or parcel maps. What I'm saying is we mistakenly included lot line adjustments, parcel mergers, and minor land divisions in this requirement to get noticing within 300 feet when the current code, our old code, and our past practice has always been to send notice to 100 feet for those projects. Those are minor subdivision activities. So this change clarifies that mistake that we made, a drafting mistake that we made last year. So you can see the revision would include or a parcel map or a tentative map, and then we would relocate the lot line adjustment, lot merger down to our minor land division to the next sentence. So we're going to have to do that. And we're going to have to do that to the next provision below that provides for noticing at 100 feet, not 300 feet. All the other projects for normal, all subdivisions and parcel maps get set notices to 300 feet. Those are major subdivision activities. These are minor subdivision activities. That's why they should only be set for 100 feet. Coincidentally, all the other, like use permits, general plan amendments, rezones, all those other ones, those get noticing to 500 feet. And if they include the subdivision, it gets included with the noticing to 500 feet also. That concludes my report. If you have any questions, I'd be happy to answer them. Any questions or comments? Motion? I'll vote for something tonight. I move that the Planning Commission adopt resolution number 24-11, recommending that the city council determine the project is categorically exempt from further environmental review. OK. Reserved to CEQA 15061B3 and adopt the amendments to Title 18, Subdivision Ordinance of the Chico Municipal Code. I'll second it. OK. Motion to second. The public hearing is open and closed. No speakers. Can I hear a roll call? Vote. Commissioner Scarpa? Yes. Commissioner Poulin? Yes. Commissioner Laffins? Yes. Commissioner Cooper? Yes. Vice Chair Scott? Yes. Chair Wall? Yes. Thanks, Bruce. Sometimes it stinks to be the city and the media, because all your mistakes are so public. But I appreciate you bringing them to us. With humility. That's part of the process is looking back when you've done these and to make sure everything is cleaned up. And that's the normal part of the process, fine tuning it. Do you have any other reports? No, we're going to need to recommend canceling our next meeting. We don't have any items, but we will in September. And we are adjourned to the adjourned regular meeting on Thursday, August 1st, 2024, which is going to be canceled. Yes, sir. Thank you.!!
