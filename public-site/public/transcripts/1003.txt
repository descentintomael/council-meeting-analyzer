 One of the first meetings after the remodel, somebody decided that they wanted to make a point because we had the sign that said they had glitter drinks and they were on pizza and dropped pizza all over the floor and stained the floor. So I will call the regular meeting of Thursday, September 2nd to order and we will start with the pledge. Salute. Pledge. Salute. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. Thank you. Thank you. And roll call, please. Commissioner Wall? Here. Commissioner Poulin? Here. Commissioner Goldstein? Here. Commissioner Cooper? Here. Commissioner Deremedy? Here. Vice Chair Ober? Here. Chair Scott? Present. Thank you. We'll move on to item two, consent agenda. Is there a motion to approve? So moved. Thank you, Commissioner Wall. Is there a second? I'll second it. So we have a motion and a second to approve the consent agenda. All in favor, signify by saying aye. Aye. Any opposed? That motion carries 6-0. Item three, business from the floor. Members of the public may address the commission at this time on any matter not already listed on the agenda with comments being limited to three minutes. Do we have a motion? Behave yourselves. Behave yourselves. Behave yourselves. Behave yourselves. Behave yourselves. Behave yourselves. Behave yourselves. Behave yourselves. Behave yourselves. Behave yourselves. Behave yourselves.

Behave yourselves. Behave yourselves. shelter organization as well as True North served on the board for about six years and was also involved with you know some of the decision making that went into the the plans that True North has for that site and so I just wanted to make sure I feel comfortable I feel like I have some things that I can bring to tonight's conversation and I feel comfortable with my ability to you know just be an impartial participant tonight but I do have that pretty extensive history with the organization and I'm pretty pretty familiar with their plans and so if that I don't the city attorney isn't here but if that would seem to rise to a conflict of interest and I certainly am willing to hear that madam chair the city attorney is participating remotely so so I guess offense can see here oh Scott okay in his place Scott Nichols yeah so perhaps the city attorney's representative can help us with this it looks like Mr. Nichols is muted on our line can you unmute there we go Mr. Nichols is muted on our line Mr. Nichols could you weigh in on that hello hello yes yes the planning commission wanted to know what your opinion was on whether or not commissioner ober has a conflict of interest due to his past involvement with the this project and and I can explain again very briefly what that potential conflict could be Mr. Nichols yes potential conflict okay and go ahead and hear me out there yes yes we can okay good that's fine I was just explaining that I have a long history with this organization I'm not currently on its board but was for about six years was involved in some of the discussions around the project that would lead ultimately to an expansion in capacity again I don't believe that that creates any conflict but I did want to just acknowledge knowledge, you know, a fairly long history with the organization. Again, I'm not currently on that board or involved with the organization directly. The only question I would have is, did you receive any compensation from that organization in the past year? No. Okay. I don't see that there's any conflict of interest, but thank you for giving us that information. Great, thank you. Thank you, Mr. Nichols. Any other ex parte communication to my left? To my right? Great. So we will move on with the staff report. And Associate Planner Tina Wilson. Thank you. Good evening, Chairwoman Scott and Planning Commissioners. My name is Tina Wilson, and I'm the Executive Director of the Board of Trustees. I'm the Executive Director of the Board of Trustees, and I am the Project Planner for this item. The application is for a modification to the previously approved conditional use permit for the Torres Shelter, which is located on the south side of Silver Dollar Way, approximately 500 feet west of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Parkway in the ML Light Manufacturing Zoning District. The modification to the previously approved use permit will change the number of guests at the Torres Shelter from 125 to 195, to 995 people. The request also includes updates to the previous conditions of approval. No significant changes to the exterior of the existing facilities are proposed at this time. No project issues have been identified. The primary purpose of the project is to increase the number of guest beds from 125 to 195. In addition, updates to the original conditions of approval are being requested and recommended for your consideration. The modification to the previously approved conditional use permit will change the number of guests at the Torres Shelter, which is approximately 2500 feet west of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Parkway in the得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得 staff, provide comments, hold a public hearing regarding the proposed project, and adopt the required findings contained in the agenda report and approve modification 2102 to use permit 0109B for the Torres shelter, subject to the recommended conditions. That concludes staff's presentation and we're available to answer any questions. Are there any questions from the commission? I have one. Yes, one. How did you arrive at 195? That is the applicant's proposal to increase it to 195 by 70 beds. Okay. Why 70 increase in people as opposed to 65 or 90 or something else? I'd have to defer to the applicant on that as to what their rationale for that number of beds for their facility was. Do we know the occupancy rate as it stands now and what the anticipated occupancy rate may be at 195? As a question of clarification, is this related to the building code occupancy or just how many guests typically are there on a regular basis? How many guests do you have on an average night, say over the past month or something? I would defer to the project applicant as the staff planner. That's not information that's available to me. The only other question I have is on the transport to and from the facility, where would the transport be going from the Torrey Center to where? I'd also defer to the applicant on that particular question. We haven't been involved. I think staff's not involved in their operations. Okay. Commissioner Goldstein. Thanks. This also might be a question for the applicant, and you might have already said it. Are there any proposed changes to the building itself or is it just an increase of capacity within the existing structure? Staff has not been informed of any particular changes to the building itself, especially exterior. There may be some interior tenant improvements to help facilitate the increase in beds, but that's not something that's a discretionary action. Okay. I was also wondering about interior features. I'm not too familiar with the structure as it is, but I would imagine that an increase of around 50% almost would need more other facilities within the building, but you're not familiar with what those might be or if there are those improvements happening? We did not require a floor plan for specifics. We figured that they were were able to accommodate the number of beds that they were proposing. Okay, great, thanks. Any other questions? I have just one on number 11, which is on page four of six, and it said the operator shall provide reports of monitoring and any problems encountered on a monthly basis for the first six months of operation and on a quarterly basis thereafter, and then the reason for removing that says it's because housing division staff already receives these reports, but would we require those reports? Is that the justification for not receiving the reports? Is that we already received the reports? That is correct. If housing division staff already has this information, then we don't need to duplicate the effort. So what if housing says we don't need to duplicate the effort? Then we don't need to duplicate the effort. Then we don't want the reports anymore, and they're not required to send them. Housing division staff receives these reports already pursuant to their funding agreements with the operator. Planning division doesn't also need those same reports. Okay, I think my question, though, is that's current funding. If there was in the future not a relationship with the housing division, would that still be a metric that planning would have to take into account? I don't... I mean, my guess is when this use permit was passed, this was kind of one of the conditions of a conditional use permit, and so I'd want to make sure we're well past that, where it's, okay, we did a review, things are operating well. I would want that reasoning to be a little bit stronger than we already get the reports from some other person. So I would want to make sure that we're not requiring those reports anymore. One of my comments to the commission was going to be that we keep that requirement in there, and not only that, but we also add who those reports are going to, because if we leave it in, it doesn't say that it's going to the housing division. So I agree. Any other questions before we open the public hearing? Okay, thank you. Thank you. So we will open the public hearing and begin with the applicant. Mr. Galloway, would that be you? I think so. Okay, sounds great. I'm here. Welcome. I'm here. I might as well speak a little bit. I'm Matt Galloway, architect, and have been helping out with this project. So for the most part, things seem fairly stable. Straightforward, and I'm just here to answer questions. I think specifically I can address a couple right now. Why 70 beds additional? So the original report did not necessarily say exactly how many people. There was some nebulous language in there about families that didn't identify the number of people. So really the intent here was to clarify exactly a number of human beings that are going to be in the facility. And they've also made a decision to raise or to add a tier of bunk beds in certain areas. So the number is very specific as to regards to how many beds they can increase. Additionally, just given the time and the progression since the use permit originally was issued, they're adding a space for gender-neutral sleeping. So there's some additional beds that are going to be added in the facility for that. There was one other question that I was going to talk about, and I didn't write it down. Occupancy. Yeah. So again, Mike might be... Mike is also... Mike is also here who represents the Torrey Shelter, has been working closely with Joy. He might be able to speak a little bit to the number of occupancy rates. So from a building code standpoint, obviously we've gone through and looked at that, and it's all compliant. And then, Chair Goldstein, you mentioned the bunk beds. Is there anything else internally in the structure? Some minor wall modifications to make the flow work a little bit better for a couple of the areas where we talked about. We're like... Gender-neutral. I have another question on the back. Oh, where might they be going? So they could be going to Department of Social Services or other places, the hospital, medical services, other places that they might need to go to. I have another question, if that's all right. Are any of these beds, though, barrier? Or are any of them? Or all of them? Yeah. So... Yeah. Yes, they are. And they've been going through that process over the last several years. During the time when the fires were here, HUD was in town, and that was one of the provisions that they made sure that that was going on for the funding sources that they were receiving. So there were some alterations to programming to make sure that that could occur. Okay. And to clarify, you said all of the new ones are, or a section of them? I believe that all of them are. Okay, thanks. Depending upon who's... There at the time. Thank you. That was one of my questions. I don't know if you were right when you answered, but you have a low barrier. Can families come in? Are they intermixed with the low barrier people? Is that... I've never been in the Torrey South personally, so... Mike might be better to speak to that. There's a mixture of both. So architecturally, from my component, I'm looking at egress and making sure that we have the proper architectural components in there. Okay. Matt. Matt. Matt. Matt. Matt. Matt. Very familiar with the building. As I say, you might be able to answer these questions better than I. Well, I don't know, and I certainly have not been very involved over the last 18 months or so, so probably not. But the way that the building is configured now... Well, actually, a couple of questions. Let me back up, because I was a little confused by the staff report, but held off because I figured that you or Mike would know better the actual current situation. As I recall, the... Uh-oh. The capacity number was reset to 160 several years ago, and that was around the same time that it actually went to a more true low barrier, so there actually aren't any families, at least I understood, that typically stay. But that number was actually increased in part to accommodate the low barrier component, and actually the cafeteria was, and all of this might be for Mike, so this is just maybe preamble. The cafeteria was reconfigured so that at night people could sleep on the floor and be somewhat separate from some of the other populations in the facility. So that capacity. The capacity number going from 125 to 195, in my memory, there was actually an intermediate time period several years ago where actually the capacity was 160, and we often exceeded that. And just out of goodwill and trying to do the right thing. So my question actually for you, Matt, and you may or may not have an answer to this, but 195 for that existing footprint sounds very, very high. And I'm curious whether there's any data behind, it's similar to the question I think Larry maybe was getting at, to arriving at that number. I mean, what does that represent, for example, in terms of square feet per person? And is there a way that that's calculated that says that this facility can actually handle that? And then this question might be for Mike, and it has to do with staffing. I know that that's always a challenge, and to go to 195. And I'm curious whether that's something that you've been working on with some of the staffing ratios that at least were in place in the past. I'm not familiar with what they are now. It sounds like a challenge operationally, and I realize that's probably Mike, not you. So I can speak to the code compliance component as to whether we're pushing the limits in terms of the number of people in the building for a fire and life safety. And we're more than adequate. We provide above and beyond the required exits, and the building can accommodate that many people in a habitation, you know, sleeping environment. So from that standpoint, we're fine. In terms of staffing ratios, that's more operational. I think I'd have to defer that question to Mike. Right. But as far as you know, there isn't a, well, again, this might be Mike, kind of in the operations, you know, nationally in other communities of a shelter, if there is kind of a standard that is typically applied that says in order to accommodate this number of beds or this number of people sleeping, we need to have X amount of space. Otherwise, it becomes untenable, unhealthy, you know, other kinds of problems may arise. And that seems to me like, if not, you know, a fire kind of code issue, it would be more, well, I guess an operation issue, but an actual capacity of the building, which seems to me like it ought to be a code thing. Madam Chair, I think Tina would like to respond to that. Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank you, Madam Chair. Commissioner Over. In the staff report, I do detail that both the building official and the fire prevention officer reviewed the plans, and the building official noted there's an occupant load of 407, according to the certificate of occupancy. So this wasn't an issue of concern for staff when we were reviewing the project for that reason. I appreciate that. And so if we're at a point where, you know, it meets the code, then it meets the code. I totally understand our role. As it relates to that. I think anybody who spent any time in that facility would understand that, you know, the 407 would be crazy in that building. And, again, maybe Mike can speak to, I know he's intimately aware of the kind of the flow of operations and whatnot there. So I'll just hold off and see what Mike, if he has suggestions. I understand what you're saying, though, and I hear you. Where the official number came from. Appreciate that. I have just one more question. On the parking, because that is something that we're looking at modifying, I feel like I have an intuitive reason why we would be requiring less parking for a use like this. But typically, we would see if you're increasing the density, we would see a higher amount of parking. So why would modification be necessary? So the original use permit was based upon a number that was established in Title 19 at the time. And as we've worked through with some empirical data based upon actual usage at other facilities, we've developed a census for what's really going on. Through both at the Torrey Shelter and other facilities as well, Jesus Center is another one that we've looked at. And empirically, the ratios for every 10 beds that are in there, there's one car. And we actually doubled that amount of parking. And so we're over-parking for this and still feel like we're fine based upon empirical data. I had a conversation with staff and Bruce about this, and he's agreed as well that it seems more likely to defer to the actual use, and that's the nature of the request. Great. In essence, it was over-parked before. Thank you. I have just one more question. I didn't see anything talking about the number of bike stalls that's going to be provided, if it's going to be increased. So, again, it's existing based upon... Based upon the number that was required. Since we're reducing, we actually have additional bike parking than what we need. Okay. Any other commissioner questions? Thank you. And do we have any further public comment? Mr. Trollander? Thank you. Hello, I'm Mike Trollander. I'm the volunteer program designer here. I'm also the volunteer project manager. And I'd like to spend a minute taking you through some changes or what's happened to create a low-barrier shelter. You know, the building was built as an overnight shelter. All the programs inside it were designed for people to leave in the morning. And then over time, things have changed. They added the kitchen and the dining, and it became easier to program. But when the need came to be a 24-hour and low-barrier, the building did not respond to that at all. And so we spent six, seven months with staff and another consultant going through all the issues related to how do we meet our community needs, our low-barrier call. How do we get the building to respond to that? A couple things that were really important to us is that a low barrier, to be really good low barrier and to be a good 24-hour, is a lot of work. And so the reason for that is you need to create zones inside the building for people to be. And so a lot of this reconfiguration wasn't just for beds because the bedding is actually the easier part because everybody goes in stacks and racks and we have to get them appropriate. But it's when they're not in their beds is when really the bigger issue is, and that's dining. And so we created some zones by taking out some offices and rethinking the space. And those zones are designed for people to be there during the day. There's some desks, some office space, some TVs. We're re-envisioning the dining area to be, there's a barber shop, a place for volunteers to come in and interact with folks. But the idea was when you have that many people, we make a choice at the low-barrier shelter. They're free to leave. So we can compel them to stay. Then we can get them to stay. Then it's easier on our community and it's easier for them because what we have to offer really is a place to rest and hope. And so those are really the two things that we really bring. And we need to do that by making sure that people are comfortable there. So we deal with their pets. We deal with their addictions. We deal with their baggage. We deal with those things all in a way when you come into the shelter, you're wanted and you're semi-searched. And if you have craziness that we don't want in the shelter, then we have a baggage area or a place to put that stuff. But we're not going to search everybody and be cops and turn them into cops. This is a low-barrier shelter. We need them to come in. And if we can get them in, then we can begin to work on some of those things. So in the big picture, that's what a low-barrier shelter is. It's not a shelter that's going to do all the work it wants to do for the community. It's not there yet. It still has a long way to go. But this is our first big, big time to kind of make this work. The issue related to beds is a couple of things. One is you don't want to run your low-barrier shelter at 100% occupancy. What you do is you want to run it at about 70% to 75% occupancy and call that your staff and medium. And so your systems are set up for that. And if you do that, then that means there's always an open bed. So when somebody needs to come, then there's a bed for them. So if we run it full all the time, then all we've done is create a situation where there are no beds. And of course, we need more pieces of the puzzle, like how do we keep the entry point, the low-barrier shelter, to that capacity? And of course, there's times when it's going to ramp all the way up and we'll be two weeks totally full. And the overflow is on the dining room floor. And Matt's calculated that there's enough occupancy for that. But those are what we're up against with calling out the beds. And so the idea of the beds was we have three dorms. The men's dorm, which is a quite large dorm. The women's dorm. And then the gender-neutral dorm, which has its own restroom and shower. So when you go through the beds and you realize, and the beds we purchased are bug-proof. They're very comfortable. They're bigger. There's a twin bed. Because the bed is the client's domain. When they come in, that's the only space they get. It's their bed. And so they put their stuff on there. As a low-barrier shelter, we don't ask them to leave during the day. If they want to lay in bed during the day, it's okay with us. We'd like to get them out and about. But the dorm is open during the day as it is at night. So the capacity of beds is really a geometry issue of how many beds can you get in there. But you're right about the safety component and the livability component. You know, people snore. There's craziness going on. I mean, there's a lot of mental health issues. So the beds are designed to be zoned, depending on the temperament and what's going on with the client. The client's mental health, bariatric, people who need a hospital bed. And so our bed system now is three tiers. But they're not all three tiers. We have singles. And for people who require a wheelchair, you can't get a wheelchair up to a bunk bed. So we have to meet all those needs. So we have a spectrum of beds, single, double, triples. And then we have some hospital beds that they're actually functional as hospital beds. So the issue with the loading of the room is a big safety issue also. Because it doesn't take much to get a fight going on. And we have, we, our job as designers is to protect staff also. So staff has to have a respite area. They have to have, you know, they have to be able to see. But at the same time, staff has to feel comfortable. If they don't, we can't recruit the kind of staff we need to be there. So, you know, all these systems all tie to each other. So that's kind of the general idea. I would like to touch on the idea that it's not in the staff report. But this is a good time to talk about low barrier. The new design, there's a lobby at the front of the building. That door is unlocked 24 hours. That takes you into the shelter or into the lobby. And there are two intake desks that are attached to that lobby. So that down the road, if somebody wants to come in at 11 o'clock at night, we hope to accommodate them. Or 2 o'clock in the morning. If the police drop somebody off at 2 o'clock in the morning or a taxi, we hope to be able to accommodate that. We're not there yet. But the idea of recalculating the shelter was to meet those kinds of needs. And so that's a big picture. And I really am the program designer. You know, Joy could make it today. It was her team that worked with me on this for months. And they did a great job. Rich was part of that. He was part of the board at the time. But it took a lot of work. And luckily the city funded us for phase one. There are three phases. The use permit is only for the first phase. So anyway, if any questions, that's my little story. Any questions? You have a mic. So where are you getting that money right now? Okay, we're under COVID rules. So we have separation issues. Everybody has to wear a mask. So it's spread out. And we're under construction. So not only do we have, we've just spent seven weeks totally torn. I don't know if it's 60 beds or 900. I just want to hear it. I've heard different stories. Well, actually, I don't even know that exact number. Because when I go in there, all the beds are full. But we've taken some beds out because we have construction going on. And we take and we overflow into the dining room floor. So I'm not a good, I'm sorry I don't have the information. I'm not going to make it up. But it's definitely, I know that, I know what you hear out there isn't the same as what's going on inside of there. That I can vouch for. And there's no families allowed in there? What we did when we created the low, when we decided that, when Joy and the board decided, hey, we've got to build a low barrier. It put us in a spot where we had to create a pavement. And we built a family unit. So we created family bridge housing. There's a home here, a very large home here in Chico. That it's not a shelter. It's bridge housing. So when families come to the shelter, we usually place them in a hotel with one of our partners. Or they go into our Aurora house, which is a family unit where families live. . Yeah, there are. No, there are. It's very strict. There are no families at the shelter. We just can't mix the low barrier dynamics and the families together. It doesn't work. So. What's the timing on transitioning to the low barrier model? Say that again? What's the timing on transitioning to the low barrier? Well, they started transitioning over a year ago. The building wasn't up to, our program wasn't up to speed yet. Not only do we have a building program, but we also have a staffing program and a service program to develop. And it takes a long time to get there. But I would say they're probably almost three quarters of the way now. And the changes that are going in now will be the ones that you see the most in the community. There's more change. There's more livable outdoor area, indoor area. People will, they won't have to run off to, you know, to find a place to hang out. They can hang out there. But I would say we're about three quarters of the way. And that's iffy. You know, that's a guess. And you touched on animals. So with the new low barrier model, animals will be allowed? Animals are allowed now. The issue is they have to be service animals. We don't check any credentials. If somebody tells us they're a service animal, then they're a service animal. It's a behavior-based situation. If the animals don't behave, then they can't be there. We have to figure out something different for them, which we have. So are they with their owner at night or are they in a separate area? Yeah, they are. We put them in crates. And the beds are big enough now to where generally the animal can stay on the ground. They can stay on the bed with the owner. And that keeps them quiet and comfortable. And then, of course, people open it and they sneak them in and all that kind of stuff. You know, it's just the way things work. But also there's some programming on the outside in the courtyard area for animals. We have a dog run that we're putting in and a pet wash. And things that we're slowly putting together. Our phase two will address more of those kinds of issues. Right now they're a little bit ad hoc. But animals is really a big issue. You know, having a place to lock your bike is a big issue. When you come out, it's not stolen. Animals, you know, if you roll up in your buggy or your shopping cart, where you put all your stuff. And so it's a low barrier shelter. The idea is to accommodate that, not to hold in judgment and say, don't bring that in because you've got a shopping cart or something. We would do that. We don't want you. Right. And so what we're learning is to accommodate. But also to be pretty strict about, you know, we don't want to be fooled. And we don't want to add to, we don't want to enable them. And we don't want to add to their trauma. But we do want to help. And so, you know, this is a, when it comes to a low barrier, we're on training wheels. The whole community is. And so, you know, we have some hope. And we also see that it's very hard on staff because, you know, the other day they lost somebody who just deer to them with an overdose. And staff was in tears for hours and hours because this person has been coming for months and they've done everything they could to help them. And then the staff wants to know why they failed. And so, anyway. Thanks, all. Any other questions? Mike, what's your actual role there at the party shelter? I'm a volunteer. I'm a planner and a designer. And I, program planning is my big thing. Whether it's restaurants or businesses or, but I have been focused, I worked for four years on Jesus Center. Well, you said the Torrey Shelter. Pardon? You're just doing the planning for the Torrey Shelter. I do the program design. And I'm also the project manager. And I'm just a volunteer. And so, I give about half of my time.

So, I'm a volunteer. coming to shelter you don't have to carry your your dog in a crate you're welcome to take your dog if you're going if you're walking to the shelter and sitting in the shelter or you're sitting outside your animal can be with you it has to be on a leash and but it's not so much that dogs get get next to each other and start fighting they sit there you start barking and and if they're dogs there's a lot of cats too and other and other things and so so that's um so you know it's it's a tough it's a it's not easy and uh and so those are but but there have been times i know that that animals have been uh asked to leave because they were because they were uh vicious and so that uh and that's that's part of the part of it too and uh you know you know we we we have a duty to protect the people that are there mm-hmm and just the idea you know sometimes the community thinks i'll be just shovel them in there and that's where they belong you know we're gonna hold them in there and make it all work but the reality is is that you know we we have staff and and programming needs and and the idea that we're there to help and and and you and you have to do that very carefully and and you know dealing with pets is is one of those things and dealing with people that smell and dealing with people with bugs and dealing with i mean it goes on and on you know very obese people people with colostomy bags that are leaking and you know and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and it goes it goes on and on so thanks for the clarification i hear that as a concern amongst some people who don't have homes that they can't go into a shelter if they have an animal so that's an important clarification but obviously you can't address the entire homeless problem so i totally understand i'm not i didn't quite hear all that i'm sorry i'm an old man oh sorry i couldn't speak up i know you can't um house every homeless person in chica that would be impossible if you're current uh and projected capacity but i was just um pondering about how difficult it is for a lot of people who have pets to be able to go into a shelter so thank you for what you are able to do are there any other questions i have one more question okay and i don't know mike if you can answer this or not but how does um the tories how do they communicate how many beds they have available to the public to the police or you know so if it is two o'clock in the morning and somebody wants to come how do they know there's an opening do they have to come i don't know the current system i know jack used the operations manager uh pushes that information out into into different locations one of the ideas of creating of coming online is also some communication systems and so i know those are all under they've been under design under review and those things are will be uh coming out we hope with some of the uh changes that are happening now that's a that's i'm not i'm involved i'm involved in those things but i don't own those things like i do the other things so i i i'm not going to speak for them but i i know they're coming thank you thanks chair over um yeah thank you mike i think that you've shared a lot that is probably helping a lot of people understand kind of what the operations of of facility like this is and i think that what um what we're uncovering is what the challenges are of operating a congregate shelter a congregate low barrier in particular shelter particularly in the time of of a pandemic so so a lot of the operational issues that we were touched we've been touching on which i think are still appropriate to be talking about because we are talking about what what number is really appropriate which is what's in front of us tonight so it feels like a valuable conversation um and um and um and um and um and um and um and um and um and um and um and um and um and um and um and um and um and um and um and um and um and um and um and um and um and um and um and um and um and um and um and um and um and um and um and um and um and um and um and um and um and um and um and um and um and um and um and um and um and um and um and um and um and um and um and um and um and um and um and um and um and um and um and um and um and um and um and um and um and um and um and um and um and um and um and um and um and um and um and um and um and um and um and um and um and um and um and um and um and um and um and um and um and um and um and um and um and um and um and um and um and um and um and um and um and um and um and um and um and um and um you expand that number, then that pressure on the population and, importantly, as Mike points out, on staff increases very dramatically. I do have some concern, although I think Mike has allayed and staff has explained from the code perspective what this number really means. Any time, I think, again, having spent a lot of time in there working with people and serving meals, etc., any time that number goes up, I know what the impact of that's going to be. It's going to get harder. Unfortunately, and the thing that we haven't talked about because it's not really in front of us, but is what the outcomes then are. Because a shelter like the Torres Shelter being operated by True North Housing Alliance and that goes to the question about where families are. I think part of the reason that the organization changed, I know that one of the reasons the organization changed its title to True North Housing Alliance was to reflect the fact that they're actually operating a lot of facilities around town, including transitional housing and housing for families, etc. It's not just the Torres Shelter. And so that name changed. And I think that the community hasn't fully come to understand what True North Housing Alliance really does in relationship to Torres. Torres Shelter is just one component of their operations. But anyway, and those operations go to... And this organization has always been driven by and has had a tremendous track record in terms of placing people, moving people out of homelessness, moving people out of shelter and into actual transitional and permanent supportive housing. And those outcomes are what drives the success, which is what the community is demanding, is to see people actually moved into housing. Those outcomes are impacted dramatically by the fact that the community is actually moving people out of housing. And so that's what we're trying to do. And so that's why we're trying to do this. And I think that's why the numbers and the intensity of problems that the facility is addressing. That's why, for me, it was important to have this conversation when you're talking about increasing from back in the day, as few as 70 to 80 people with high outcomes to 120 to 160 and to now 195. I think the pressure that that creates needs to be acknowledged. All of that being said, Mike, I appreciate your description of what has kind of been done operationally and internally to try to accommodate this. And I think basically you've said that you and Matt as well are confident that the facility as it is right now can handle 195 and the code allows it. So based on all of that, I'm certainly not going to object. And I apologize for spending some time talking to you. I'm going to go ahead and wrap up. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Very good. Very good. Very good. Very good. Very good. Very good. Very good. Very good. Very good. Very good. Very good. Very good. Very good. Very good. Very good. Very good. Very good. If I can offer one observation on the animals and well-behaved versus service, I might suggest that we allow the staff, as they are right now, to apply a standard that actually works for them, and allowing them the ability based on a service animal definition to not allow an animal in if it is being or appears that it will be problematic and a threat to other animals or to other people, might give them the power to actually have a standard. It is a little lower than you would probably prefer, but it sounds like they are already basically allowing that to go up to the level of well-behaved that you'd like to have in there, and thereby allow more animals in than really technically maybe should be because they're not. So I would just say I might be more comfortable leaving the service animal in there so that the staff has that tool. And I was going to add there might be insurance liability that they have to say service animal, and so I wouldn't want us to be lower than what their standard needs to be. One of the presumptions with this is the operator knows best how to do their business, and they all seem to have some unique characteristics based on their service animal. So I'd be cautious in tinkering with any operational aspects of the operation because from our standpoint, we don't really need to regulate what they know best how to do. At least that's the staff standpoint. Thank you. If we were to change that, not... Sure, if we would want to. We could potentially consider the term support animal. I know that there is a designation that basically it's like a behavioral support animal classification, and I know renters can have those in apartments where otherwise pets aren't allowed, so it's kind of between well-behaved and service animals. That's just an option, support animals. Yeah, and I think the applicant indicated they have all kinds of different animals, so it's really tough to get a one-size-fits-all thing to address this. You've got dogs and cats. You've got... Anyway. I just got from a source that currently there's 20 to 25 beds empty every day. But pre-COVID, they were full every night. So that's from someone that works at the torture shelter. That answers some questions. Yes. I might have to claim that as ex parte communication now. But that is... Yeah. Yeah. We can use a train. Actually, I think I need to ask you to say that. Is Mr. Nichols still on? Yes, I'm still here. Okay. So does that need to be claimed as ex parte communication? I couldn't hear the speaker. He wasn't speaking into the microphone. I couldn't hear his comments. Okay. So we had a member of the commission who received information on the number of beds that were open at the tourist shelter via text. Yeah. He should disclose that text. Yes. Yes. Nice work. Does he need to disclose who it was from? Yes. It would need to be the parties and just a summary of the content. Sorry. He was from Joymark. Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Nichols. No more texting. No more texting. Sorry. Sorry. I'm a tour. No email either. Okay. Any other... So we had... You had the reporting. The... Gender neutral... Probably should have not done it all at once, but... And I'm going to type. Yeah. The reporting... Oh, the plan. Oh, who's the... And could you clarify, Tina, who's the plan, the transportation plan going to? And that would be on exhibit... No. I? No. Uh-uh. Uh-uh. Uh-uh. Uh-uh. Uh-uh. Uh-uh. Uh-uh. Uh-uh. Uh-uh. Uh-uh. Uh-uh. Uh-uh. Uh-uh. Uh-uh. Uh-uh. Uh-uh. Uh-uh. Uh-uh. Uh-uh. Uh-uh. Uh-uh. Uh-uh. Uh-uh. Uh-uh. Uh-uh. So I would have to double check all of our files to see. I did not do that research. Okay, so this condition, it does say prior to the operation of the shelter. So we are not requiring an additional transportation plan with the increased number, is that? Madam Chair, that is correct. This is a modification to a use permit. So all of the original conditions of the use permit are in this exhibit except what was modified. So that is, they were just wanting to change the name of the entity that was the operator. Just to have it accurate, that was the request. We could essentially get rid of the condition altogether because it was a one-time. condition and presumably happened at such time prior to operations beginning. I would, personally, since they're increasing the capacity, I would like to see a new one submitted. I'm sure they're going to be doing it anyways. What would that entail? Yeah, what would that entail? I can speak briefly to this. Just history. I don't know what it would entail now, and I don't know what that plan might look like. But I know that just from an operational standpoint in years past, it fluctuated a little bit depending on availability of things like relationships with the various bus and shuttle providers who would, as their capacity allowed, would issue batches of passes that the shelter would then use. To be able to get people, you know, able to ride a bus to work or whatever. There were some, there have been some other arrangements made to shuttle people, but I don't know that there has been a lengthy history of a formal shuttle operation. It's been more, as you might imagine, given the nature of that kind of work, I think it's been more kind of cobbled together. I might be wrong about that. Mike? Mike might be able to speak to that. Do you want to open the public again? Not really, but. Sorry. Rich, Rich, haven't you just become ex parte communication for the rest of us? No, because he's not talking to anybody outside of us. I think a board, I mean, yeah, a commission member to a commission member can share their background history and knowledge. Any new. Well, you're talking about procedure. Yeah. They're engaged in my history of understanding and knowledge, I think. If I'm wrong, I'm happy to step aside. Bruce? I think, Madam Chair, what is the concern? And I can give you a condition that gets at the concern. And if there is somebody you feel that you want to have review some report, then we'd be happy to include it. Yeah. Because this says. I think. Unless they're home. Are these the new conditions? How do we go about that? So, actually, you want to go to I, Exhibit I. Right. And that is, that was what we are actually approving. So, the blue is more of here they are and here's more. But this is the black and white of what we would be approving. So, Condition 8 does still say prior to the operation of the shelter. So, Commissioner Poulin is. Saying that's still in there. Does that need to be in there? Or does it not? Well, yeah. And before it was going to BKEG. So. I just request that it be updated to say submit a revised plan for transporting guests based on the new low barrier model in the new capacity. Got it. Can we have a quick, like, straw poll on how many would support that? Just raise of hands. I don't see why not. Okay. I don't think it's necessary to update the language. But no reason not to. Based on revised plan for low barrier shelter. Got it. Okay. Anything else? Well. For a motion? Yeah. I have just one. One comment before we do that. And I think I can say this as the veteran of the planning commission. One thing. There was a lot that was said tonight. I think what speaks volumes to me is what wasn't said. And sitting through multiple use permit changes. This chambers is usually packed when that happens. So, I have sat through a school use. So, I don't want to island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island So the fact that we have something that I would expect there to be public comment, that I know that we had several businesses in the area that were notified of this, that this has been out there and we do not have opposition, leads me to support what we have before us tonight. Good observations. I would entertain a motion. Commissioner Wall. Okay, I would move that the Planning Commission adopt Resolution No. 21-07, approving the modification of the Conditional Use Permit subject to detached conditions. Thank you. So we have a motion from Commissioner Wall. Is there a second? I'll second it. Great. And we have a second from Commissioner Cooper. So before us is that the Planning Commission adopt Resolution No. 21-07, approving the modification of the Conditional Use Permit, subject to the attached conditions. All in favor signify. With the addition of the condition to have the transportation plan submitted to BCAC. Right, with the revisions that include the low barrier shelter. Great. Got it. All in favor? Aye. Any opposed? So that motion carries 7-0 with no absences, which is great. All right. Moving on. Thank you, Mr. Galloway. Thank you, Mr. Trollander. Regular agenda, we have none. Item 6, reports and communications. Bruce. Madam Chair, we don't have any. Just reminding you, we've invited you to participate virtually in the State American Planning Association. A couple of you have registered for that. If anybody else is interested, please contact Nicole. There'll be other trainings that come up along the way, too. Anyway, I don't have anything else. We do have something in our next meeting, so we will have, for our next meeting on the 16th, we will have a subdivision here. Okay, great. All right. And then with that, we're adjourned. Thank you. Thanks. Thanks, Tammy. Yeah. Thank you.
