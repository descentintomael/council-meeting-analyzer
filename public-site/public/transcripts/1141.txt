 Thank you.  Thank you.  If everybody could have a seat, please.  All right, we will call the regular city councilman in the city of Chico to order.  And before we start with our invocation, tomorrow is the five-year anniversary of the Paradise Fire.  And I think it's appropriate at this time that we take one second for each person who passed away in that fire.  So we're going to do 85 seconds of silence to remember those who we lost in Paradise.  So if you could please join me in silence for the next 85 seconds.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you. Would everybody please stand and join me in the Pledge of Allegiance.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you. [inaudible]  All right.  Madam Clerk, if you could take the roll, please.  Here.  Here.  Here.  Present.  Present.  And this time, we'd like our closed session announcement from City Attorney John Lamb.  Good evening, Mayor, City Council.  Tonight, City Council recessed in closed session.  All members of the Council were present, with the exception of Council Member Tandon.  The first item was conference with legal counsel, existing litigation pursuant to Government Code Section 54956.9 from Section 8 regarding the fire victim's trust claim.  Council was brief.  Direction was provided.  No final action was taken on that item.  Item 2.  Item 2.2, conference with labor negotiators.  This item was not discussed in closed session.  There is no report.  Item 2.3, conference with legal counsel, existing litigation.  In the Warren v. Chico case, council was brief.  Direction was provided.  No final action was taken.  That concludes my report there.  All right.  Thank you very much.  And speaker card announcement.  Anyone wishing to address the council should first complete a speaker card, which can be found at the back of the chamber.  When completed, please turn the card in to the city clerk.  Speakers will be taken and ordered.  The cards are received.  Once the speaker is taken, the cards are received.  When the speaker is called, no additional cards will be accepted.  And now we're going to move on to proclamations.  I'm going to come down in front for this.  A few of these.  Is Zachary Elstein here?  Come on down.  How are you doing?  Good.  All right.  We have a proclamation for the Homeless and Runaway Youth Awareness Month.  Whereas California has an estimated 200,000 children who are homeless, including some 1,100 K through 12 students in Butte County and approximately 25% of youth exiting foster care will experience homelessness.  And whereas a high percentage of homeless youth have been physically, sexually and or emotionally.  Abused by their guardians and are frequently re victimized by or exploited while living on the streets and in shelters.  And whereas natural disaster and lack of affordable housing have exacerbated youth homelessness across rural California.  And due to the lack of stable housing, homeless youth face great difficulty in assessing, stabilizing and succeeding in school, reducing the likelihood of successful graduation.  And whereas LBGTQ young adults.  Are 120% higher risk of homelessness when compared to their peers and comprise 40% of unaccompanied homeless youth.  Population and whereas the citizens of the city of Chico are key to preventing youth homelessness by acting as mentors and role models.  For these youth and guiding them towards available resources, productive choices and creating opportunities for youth to successfully transition into adulthood.  Now, therefore, be it resolved that I, Andrew Coolidge, Mayor of the City of Chico.  On behalf of the Chico City Council, joint advocates and communities across the country in taking action to prevent youth homelessness and runaway.  And do hereby proclaim November 2023 as Homeless and Runaway Youth Awareness Month.  And do commend this observance to all our citizens.  And on behalf, I'd like to present you the proclamation and thank you so much for being here.  Thank you very much.  Absolutely.  Would you guys like to say a few words?  Sure.  Alright.  Thank you.  Alright, and then, do we have Leslie Johnson and Nicole Drummond?  Yes, we're here.  Alright, come on up.  Alright, we like to recognize the good people in our community and certainly we are doing that tonight.  So, a proclamation for the Chico Housing Action Team 10th Anniversary.  Thank you so much for being here.  Whereas, the Chico Housing Action Team 10th Anniversary,  the Chico Housing Action Team, CHAT, which is just easier, just easier to say,  first came together as a volunteer organization in November of 2013 to discuss the issue of homelessness in Chico and consider how they might make a difference.  And whereas in 2015, CHAT opened its first rental house using a master lease model, subletting individual bedrooms to shared houses to persons who have lost their housing and continuing to open homes with their number, amazing numbers, of homes.  So, this year CHAT is only housing 85 rental units, 31 of which are owned by CHAT.  Whereas CHAT will soon be opening Everhart Village, a 24-hour managed shelter with 20 sleeping cabins to provide treatment and navigation services in collaboration with Butte County Behavioral Services.  And on behalf of the Chico City Council, we do hereby recognize and appreciate CHAT for their 10 years of service in the Chico community and encourage citizens of Chico to celebrate CHAT in their manhood.  many contributions to our city.  Thank you so much.  Leslie Johnson, I'm on the board of CHAT  and the president of the board.  We really appreciate the recognition for CHAT  and the support the city council  and the various city departments  actually have given CHAT over the years  as we've tried to make a difference.  I feel like CHAT's a community organization  in every sense of the word.  We came together as community members  concerned about a problem  that was impacting our community  and that I think everyone was concerned about.  And we didn't know really even what we were going to do  and some would say didn't know what we were doing.  I did say that.  But we got so much support  from the housing provider community,  the people that had been working in homelessness.  We met with people, we educated ourselves  and we learned a lot about what was going on.  When we reached out for volunteers,  we got hundreds of people from our community.  When we needed funding,  our community would support CHAT.  So I feel like we are very much a community organization  and we have been able to make a difference  and we haven't ended homelessness yet,  but we will continue our work  until we get to the end of the year.  So hopefully our organization isn't needed any longer.  We really appreciate our community.  And yes, it is very expensive,  the kind of work we're doing.  And our residents do pay rent,  which we feel is really great  because it gives them the dignity of being renters  like anybody else.  But that doesn't cover all our expenses.  So it's been great to have community support  and grant funding from the city  and other agencies that have enabled us  to help move a lot of people out of the city.  And we've brought people from homelessness to housing  and we continue to do more.  So thank you.  Well, I can't say much more than that.  And I know this is a long meeting, so I won't.  But I did just want to say that CHAT is amazing.  And since 2017,  which was when we started keeping some records,  we've moved inside over 675 individuals.  And we also helped over 100 individuals  in 47 households find housing after the Camp Fire.  And in this moment, I wanted to say  we're still helping Camp Fire survivors in different ways  and all the other people that need solutions.  And we are about to open a tiny 20-cabin village,  which is just amazing.  It's taken a long time to come together.  And it's really exciting that it's here.  And we appreciate all the community support,  city, county, individuals, and organizations.  Thank you so much.  Have a great night.  Thank you.  All right.  We have some awards, too.  And these are very well-deserved.  So these are the Mayor's Achievement in Arts Award.  But it has nothing to do with me.  It actually just has to do with people  who are fantastic in our arts community.  And we're going to start with Christine McShane,  who is not here, but I believe Dori Morrow  is here for us.  So we're going to start with her.  And I believe Christine is actually teaching an art class.  Is that correct?  She is in Paradise teaching a large painting class for free  as part of the commemoration of the five-year anniversary.  So you've done a very good job of making your choices here.  All right.  Well, and we will recognize her in recognition  of Christine McShane's artistic contributions to the community.  And you know what?  Let me do this, too.  Let me have our arts commissioners,  Monica McDaniel and Vianna Boring.  Are you here?  Come on down.  We'll have you guys do the actual presentation of the award.  So come on down.  Yeah, absolutely.  We love having our commissioners here.  We certainly don't recognize them enough for all they do.  So since moving here in 1989,  I'm going to need to place this so I can read it.  She has been teaching and working with a variety of groups,  including Ollie.  She's a member of the Chico School of Art,  over at Chico State, and then the Autism Center in Chico,  Little Red Hen, Paradise Art Center, amongst many others.  She also highly sought after artists for her commissioned work in murals.  Her passion for supporting others is clear.  She has taught art to cancer patients and caretakers  at the Feather River Cancer Center in Paradise.  She offered art therapy in her private studio for campfire survivors.  And Northern California Art Therapy Association.  She has taught at-risk youth in Chico schools,  and the Boys and Girls Clubs throughout Butte County.  So on behalf of the City Council, we want to recognize her.  And we'll have one of our commissioners present the plaque to you here  for Christine McShane.  Thank you.  And tell her thank you for us.  All right.  Next is Legacy.  Let me see.  Legacy Stage.  Come on down.  This is in recognition of Legacy Stage's contribution to cultural  and the vitality of our community.  Legacy Stage has successfully created events for the Chico community  that are mindful of inclusivity, supportive of local artists,  and providing high-quality performances for all of Chico.  Legacy works hard to ensure that all cast crew and musicians  are paid a stipend for their work.  And this is an important step in providing paid work for professionals,  performers, crew, and artists in our Chico community.  When casting, Legacy features performance and crews from various backgrounds  and experiences, including but not limited to LGBTQ people,  people of the global majority, women, parents, and college students.  On behalf of the City Council, City of Chico,  we'd like to thank you for your service to our community.  Thank you.  Congratulations.  Congratulations.  Congratulations.  Congratulations.  Congratulations.  Congratulations.  Congratulations.  Congratulations.  Congratulations.  Congratulations.  Congratulations.  Congratulations. And next is the music connection. I think we've all heard of these folks.  we've all heard of these folks.  So,  come on down.  All right, in recognition of the Music Connection  support for arts in the city of Chico,  since being founded in 1994,  the Music Connection has provided a space  for music lovers, educators, students, and fans  to come together and take their love to another level.  Not only have they provided a rich learning environment  in their stores,  they have taken their passion outside  for numerous school visits  to demonstrate and showcase band instruments.  The sponsor and equip,  the local Chico Summer Music Academy,  events of Northern,  sorry,  events of the California Music Teachers Association  and the California Youth Orchestra,  and to donate teaching studios  for annual monster piano concert auditions.  On behalf of the city of Chico,  we appreciate everything you've done  for the Chico Music Academy.  We appreciate everything you've done for this community.  And thank you so much for being here.  All right.  And that will conclude our awards.  Thank you so much, commissioners.  We appreciate you being here as well.  And at this point,  we will move on to our consent agenda.  So, all matters on the consent agenda  are considered routine.  And can be enacted in one motion.  Do we have any speakers on the consent agenda?  All right.  So, we will take Mr. Hutchinson.  One speaker equals three minutes.  I know most of you are here on something  that you consider much more important tonight.  But I've spoken on this issue before  about using MOUs.  And I've asked to consider  getting out the plunder room  and going to the MOUs.  And I've asked to consider  going to agreements.  Final agreements.  Not open letters of change  that change constantly.  We've seen this throughout the entire process.  I'm asking the council  to have one of our fine attorneys  explain why you use MOUs  rather than using final agreements.  And explain it.  I'm asking anybody  who has access to the internet,  go to Google and look up MOUs.  Look out what they're for.  What the purpose of them.  What the purpose of them are.  I brought it up before.  And I've asked to reconsider.  I'm asking you now  to have it explained to the public  why this hasn't happened.  Why you can't reach final agreements.  As far as this organization goes,  I've seen nothing but defaults  in their work habits.  I've seen failure after failure  after failure.  I've watched kids  being attacked by dogs  that when these same dogs  attacked police,  police showed up within five minutes.  And the dogs,  the same dogs that attacked the police  who was in a car,  had a canine,  had a gun,  showed up within five minutes.  When a kid called,  there were four kids all together.  I happened to be in the area.  I was able to come over  and extravide.  I'm getting away from there.  And nothing was done.  No police showed up.  They called.  They called 911.  I was right there listening to it.  And nobody showed up.  No, I don't think they're doing a good job.  I don't think they deserve retention.  I think they deserve review.  Very serious review.  All right.  So, I think we have some new folks tonight.  So, we're going to explain the rules  for being here.  Oh, we have to vote on the consent agenda.  Let's do that first.  I was going to...  I need to review a rule.  I'm going to review the rules myself.  Yeah.  Would you like to register and no vote?  Please.  Two, actually.  2.1.  All right.  Mr. Winslow, 2.1, 2.2.  2.1.  2.1.  2.1.  2.1.  I'll second.  When you're ready.  Okay.  So, there's a motion and a second  to approve the consent agenda  which is voted on by the City of Chicago  under Chapter 2.5.  4.  4.  5.  6.  7.  9.  10.  11.  12.  22.  24.  25.  35.  12.  13.  18.  19.  22.  23.  25.  26.  27.  28.  31. matter, is it means issues within the purview of the city council. So that means issues within the city of Chico.  31.  31.  31. So that being said, signs need to remain at the back of the room. We do not cheer in this chamber. We do not boo in this chamber. We also ask you to turn off your cell phones just because we're turning our room on the  I'm turning our moment of silence.  I heard him.  So chairing and booing, we'll adjourn the meeting  while we'll recess the meeting for a short time period,  come back in, and then try it again.  And we haven't done this time and time again.  So we also determined the time that speakers are allowed to speak  based upon the number of speakers.  At 15, it changes to two minutes.  At 25, it changes to one.  How many speakers do we have?  So we'll give one minute apiece.  Signs at the back of the room, remember your comments need to be limited  or adhered to the City of Chico and items within our purview.  So only items that can be addressed by the City of Chico within the City of Chico.  Any comments, please, on items that don't meet the schedule, First, I apologize for the two minutes of our attention. You pronounce my name just right. You pronounce my name just right. Hi, Council. I'm going to bring up an age old thing here. I want to talk about curfew in the plaza. I want to talk about ordinance in the plaza. Over the last several weeks, I've made kind of a personal mission to go after 11 p.m. and before 5 a.m. to the plaza and notice people sleeping in the plaza.  a.m. to the plaza and notice people sleeping in the plaza. We had to cancel a DCBA sponsored event  a week ago Saturday because of the conditions of the plaza. And what I'm asking is put some focus  on enforcing the ordinances that we have in place. Very simple. Downtown Chico needs some help.  That's it.  This cup. Think about it for a moment. Think about the size of it. Okay. In Maine, a young woman  named Hutchinson was talking about her impact after being shot at. One of the things she said  at the end of it is, I was worried about whether the cops would show up.  Why?  Why?  Chico has the same problem.  See this cup?  Wednesday after your last meeting,  I'm coming home from a doctor's appointment.  I'm happy because it's a good appointment.  My wife's at the bus stop.  I greet her there.  We're saying how nice it is.  As I start walking,  as she gets on the bus,  as I'm getting off,  we say goodbye.  I start walking along.  A guy suddenly comes up,  charges up to me and says,  hit me, hit me.  I'm sending.  Okay.  I start to walk down.  No response.  I get hit by a cup full of liquid.  Don't know what it is.  Call the police.  Two hours later,  nothing.  Nothing.  I can see it.  One minute is ridiculous.  Dan Mark,  followed by Maria.  Are we on your hands?  Good evening.  I want to address this  to the City of Chico.  about a resolution  I would like the City of Chico to adopt.  The City of Chico could make history.  In Northern California,  being a rural town,  I would like us to adopt  a ceasefire resolution  for the ongoing crisis in Gaza.  Your point of order,  this does not relate to the business of the City of Chico.  It certainly does.  We could make an impact here.  The City of Chico.  Sir, if you could just pause for a second.  If I can get an opinion from our City Attorney.  Yes.  I'm a member of the City of Chico.  Thank you, Mayor, City Council.  This item is regarding outside the jurisdiction of the City Council.  As indicated by the Mayor earlier,  we're keeping a time restriction on it.  These items that are not within the purview of the City Council  are typically not within the discussion for this particular issue.  So, what we're recommending at this point  is that these items should stay on focus  as to what's within the jurisdiction of the City Council.  With all due respect,  I don't know how the City adopting a position of a ceasefire,  is not in the best interest or in the interest of the City of Chico.  If you could explain that to me.  I'm not asking you to go there and stop the war.  I'm just asking you to adopt a ceasefire.  Sir, we don't do back and forth conversations here either.  Technically, Council isn't even allowed to address speakers  except for points of order.  So, I'm addressing a point of order.  Thank you.  Outbursts are also not allowed.  Those people will be asked to be excused.  So, with that,  we want to coordinate.  We want to move forward.  The Attorney has given his review.  Council Member has made an issue.  It's been discussed.  You'll need to keep your comments local to the City of Chico.  I would like.  Okay.  Again, another outburst.  We'll just recess the meeting for 20 minutes.  Okay. There we go.  Folks, we have a way of doing this.  We're doing business.  And it's not shouting from the floor.  It's giving everybody a chance to speak.  Thank you.  .  .  Okay, folks.  .  If I could have your attention.  .  The way this works,  and we're not going to do outbursts either,  so,  is, if in fact we have to do this again,  we take one more recess,  and then we clear the chamber.  So, that's how it goes.  And that includes any outbursts either.  Like, I shouldn't be having conversations with members of the public,  because we don't want that to be how our city works.  We don't want people to come in here and yell and try to get what they want.  Because if we did that,  we would have every single group in town doing that.  And that time we've had,  and we've had to deal with that issue.  So, we're here to discuss issues relative to the City of Chico  and within our purview,  not issues that we have a secondary connection to,  not issues that we can't do anything with.  So, that means if you want to talk about the City of Chico  and something within our purview,  we're more than happy to hear you.  If not, we will ask you to stop speaking.  If you don't stop speaking,  we will again clear the room,  or we will again take a recess,  and then we'll come back,  and if we do it again,  we'll clear the room.  We've done this before.  We'll probably end up doing it again.  It's not my favorite thing to do.  I certainly don't want to do it.  Outbursts are not allowed in this chamber at all.  Speaking from the floor out of turn  are not allowed in this chamber.  So, anyway.  So, we'll resume.  Question?  Um, Marie Barnaby,  followed by Emerald Walker.  Okay.  If you're going up in the center aisle.  .  I can't make sure you started, too.  .  Okay.  Local Chico students are experiencing fear  as a result of the war.  I would like an effort made by Chico City  to make local students safe,  as well as the local Palestinian Muslim people of Chico.  Thank you.  .  Now, a pop-up, followed by Amy Harrison.  Okay.  So, I have here a resolution that was adopted  by Richmond City Council  and Providence City Council from Rhode Island.  City Councils have already adopted this around the country,  and it definitely affects our local population  and also our money as our funds are going locally,  being moved out of this community,  and going to fund this ongoing crisis  and humanitarian catastrophe that's happening in Palestine.  So, I want to submit this to your city council  so that you can take a vote amongst yourselves  to adopt the same exact resolution  that other city councils have already adopted in this country.  So, I got 23 seconds.  I just want to preface by saying  my family is from the Pomo Nation.  I grew up in Paradise.  I'd like to acknowledge that this is Machuta land  that we're all on.  And it's a colonial occupation.  And so, we should all be sensitive to the plight  of people that are under occupation  and these kind of things.  So, I'll concede my time.  Please adopt this proposal.  Thank you.  And Harrison, followed by Amy.  .  I would like to speak in support  of the local Palestinians in Chico  and ask that you adopt a resolution  like the ones in Providence and in Richmond.  We took 85 seconds earlier  to honor the lives of those  lost in Paradise.  Think about how long 10,000 seconds is.  Let's not do snapping either. Let's not do snapping either. Okay, we don't do that kind of stuff. We don't do a closet. We don't do snapping.  Hi, my name is Lana Hadid.  I am a local Palestinian.  I'm a Palestinian American.  I grew up in Chico, California.  I am experiencing  a lot of grief.  I've been in grief  this past month.  No one in our city  hasn't said anything.  Butte College, Chico State,  no one has reached out  to the Palestinian students  asking, how are you doing?  How are you okay?  Are you okay?  Is your family in the West Bank okay?  No one cares.  And it's very...  Let me...  Sorry, I have 23 seconds.  Okay.  As an American Palestinian,  I stand here watching a genocide.  I stand here with my taxpayer money  funding a genocide.  Our government has made us complicit  to this genocide.  I am standing here asking for a ceasefire,  asking you guys to do your best.  Thank you, Butte.  Thank you.  So, Mohamed, today,  I was out there at the beach  and I did a full genocid.  So, when I see somebody  in a  –  –  –  –  –  –  –  –  –  –  –  –  – !  It's like, I can't focus in school and I'm just hoping you guys can like, I don't know what you guys can really do, but that's it. Thank you.  Thank you.  Hello, my name is Shahira Bossy.  I'm a current student here in Chico.  I'll keep my message short and simple.  For the first time, our voices as Muslim, Arab, and Palestinian youth are finally being heard after years of advocating for an end to the unrelenting violence inflicted upon Palestinians.  However, it seems to be falling on deaf ears.  Here in Chico, and we're losing faith in our own community support, forced to take on the brunt of your labor as we plead for empathy.  We will be joining the efforts towards the national shutdown for Palestine and organizing a walkout this Thursday from 1 to 3 p.m. on the Chico State campus.  You have to address the council and the microphone is in the podium.  As students from Chico State, Butte, Chico High School, and Pleasant Valley High School, if you as our council do not choose to support us, we as students will continue to organize our communities and peers.  Rallying until our pleas are finally heard.  Coming back next time with even more students.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Hi, my name is Ramzia.  I go to Chico High.  Since the conflict has started in Gaza, Islamophobia has been increasing and our lives are being in danger because of this conflict.  that have been going on for the 75 years in Gaza.  It did not start in October 7th.  But I'm calling, racism have been increases in our school  and around the world because of this conflict.  And people have been getting injured, killed  because of this war and conflict.  It's not a war, it's a genocide that's happening.  And today my friend got through a pencil  and said, oh, don't bomb me.  What is that?  It's frustrating seeing this happen  and no one wants to hear us here  and don't want us to talk about the genocide  that's going on and killing over 10,000 people  and over hundreds of people being killed and murdered  and injured and bombing refugee camps, ambulances, homes.  It's just frustrating seeing this.  And you guys saying we can't talk about it,  it's just frustrating thinking.  All right, I think we need to go back to Bill again.  Let's do comments in relation to the city of Chico.  Parent break from the night.  Recent events with my neighbors brought me here  to request that an ordinance be drawn by the city council  for secondhand smoke.  My neighbor enjoys marijuana,  which is his thing, that's perfectly fine.  But when he's enjoying it to the point  where I can't have my windows open at night  and my kids can't play  in the backyard because of the obscene amount of it,  that's excessive.  I know we have an ordinance for noxious odors,  but for whatever reason, it only pertains to tanning.  And there's a whole chapter for noise,  but absolutely nothing for smoke,  secondhand smoke or anything of the like.  And it doesn't even have to be tailored specifically  to cannabis, tobacco, cannabis, whole nine yards.  That's all I ask.  .  Thank you, Ms. Gonzalez, Ms.  Okay.  I'm sorry, please do not address us unless it's your time to speak.  Thank you.  Go ahead.  And again, please give your remarks relative to the city of Chico.  I just said my name.  Yeah.  It's not directed at you.  Okay.  Well, I'm a student at Chico High, and the increase of racism since the genocide has  increased so much.  I'm the person who the pencil was thrown at, and I asked, I have complained so many times  to school, to the principal, to the vice principals, and they say they're not allowed, they're  not able to do much.  So I asked you guys to at least, I don't know, lend a hand, do something.  There's like so much racism.  I'm being called bomber all the time.  I'm being called so many names every day at school.  This is a place where I go to learn.  I didn't come to this country so I can face more racism.  I'm in Chico.  I'm a local Pakistani.  I've come here to learn.  I've come here to have more opportunities, learn more.  But instead I'm faced with all these conflicts.  It's frustrating.  It's confusing.  And I ask that I'm able to, like you guys can do something about it.  I go to Chico High, and it's hard.  It's just annoying.  Thank you.  Thank you.  And as a note, any issues in regards to Chico Unified School District, Chico State, it  must be addressed to the school district or their district.  It should be addressed to their respective bodies.  So, students are not the only ones experiencing increased racism, and particularly,  Islamophobia, and those kinds of harassment in our city.  It is also adult people who are not students.  It is certainly within our –  the purview of the city to be concerned about harassment, hate speech, hate crimes, etc., etc.  And one of the things that the city can and should do in regards to this increase in racist  harassment happening within our city is to adopt the resolution that Yama presented that has been  adopted by other cities in the United States is certainly within your purview that if the city  took an official stance, actually making a statement that showed some kind of sympathy  and care for the people who are facing this kind of harassment because of the international  situation that our tax dollars are paying for, that could make a difference.  As Richmond and Rhode Island did, we are asking for the  state to take a stand.  I'm calling for the Chico City Council to adopt a resolution calling for a ceasefire to join a  growing chorus that is appalled that our taxpayer dollars are being sent to commit genocide in  another country.  Point of order, Mr. Mayor.  Ma'am, you'll have to limit your comments to the city of Chico.  I'm calling for the city of Chico to adopt a resolution.  There's not enough to do that because you could call for us to do a resolution.  A child in Gaza dies every 10 minutes.  They are drinking water.  Water contaminated with sewage because there is no...  The rules here are still the rules.  All right.  We will take another break.  There...  Thank you, Council.  We have scratched the surface on this issue.  A couple of months ago, actually a couple of years ago,  we had a corporation out of Sarasota buy Pleasant Valley Mobile Estates.  Before then, it was owned locally.  The rents were nice and low.  As of now, January 1st, they're going to raise our rent 30%.  So I'm going up $150 a month.  And what we have in the park, being a handyman, I know a lot of people.  And whether we can get this on the agenda or further issues that we want to resolve  or get to something to be done, we'd appreciate it.  I have a lot of senior citizens in the park that are on fixed incomes.  And most of them are right.  Not most of them, but some are about $1,000, $1,100.  You've got an $800, a $795 monthly, $300 PG&E.  They don't have anything left over.  So we do have an issue.  And hopefully we can get something going on the agenda for future reference.  And maybe we can get something established.  I want to pass this on to you.  Thank you.  Thank you, Mayor.  Could we follow up on what you've done?  Thank you.  My name is Nora.  I am a Jewish American resident of Chico,  here to urge our city council to adopt the resolution given to you,  like that of Richmond, California, and like Providence, Rhode Island,  in support of the people of our local Palestinian population here in Chico.  It is within your purview and within your best interest  to adopt a resolution that supports people here in this community.  These are your people.  They are students and workers.  And they are right here, right now, asking you for your support.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you, Council.  I'm here on behalf of the seniors at a mobile home park.  Right now, the city spends most of their budget on making their citizens safe  with police and fire.  What we're asking is the council at least agendize the item of us.  It's each one of you.  It's you, other than Tom, has a mobile home park in their neighborhood.  We have over 2,000 spaces in town, and all the rents are going up.  These are just land leases.  People are just renting.  The biggest problem is, is these companies, none of the money is staying in Chico.  All this money that all the rents are going out,  and they're really not helping our citizens.  This is the last place that people have to go.  There's two or three people that die in our mobile home parks every single year.  I've lived there for eight years.  And it's important.  These people have nothing.  You guys don't get a phone call from an elderly woman that's 80-something years old  crying on the phone and saying,  I don't have any place to...  Just hang on a second.  You'll let the other people do this.  I'm going to take my shot at this.  No, I don't.  That's time.  Thank you.  All right.  Hi.  I would like to ask the city council to adopt the resolution that was presented earlier.  I think it's absolutely...  I think it's absolutely within your purview to be concerned about Palestinian citizens  being affected by an international tragedy.  So I would just like you to reconsider that and maybe take into account  that maybe you are not Palestinian.  You don't have to deal with that.  I'm talking about residents of this city,  people who just spoke a few moments ago, actually.  So I just think it's within your purview and within your power  to utilize your words to defend those citizens  and make sure that it's safe for them.  Thank you.  Thank you, Ms. Lawrence.  I'll hand it over to Cheryl Jordan.  Hello, my name is Florence.  I'm a lifetime resident of Chico.  I am calling on the city council to please support  the resolution for a ceasefire presented earlier.  This is an opportunity to show support for your constituents,  show them that you care about matters that affect them daily.  I would also like to support the call for rent control  throughout the city of Chico.  Housing is a basic human right that must be accessible to all people.  Thank you.  Thank you, Ms. Gonzalez.  As mentioned on your website, the City of Chico's mission is to protect and enhance our community's quality of life for present and future generations.  I was walking my dog Saturday and saw some were raising charges of genocide or ethnic cleansing in Gaza.  This charge is false. Israel unilaterally withdrew its citizens and military from Gaza in 2005.  Israel's response to Hamas attacks are not aimed at removing Palestinians from Gaza.  The only reason I'm saying this is so that the Jewish people also feel safe.  Please stop. Relate the comments to the City of Chico. We're not commenting on international events at this point.  Okay, please be vigilant in standing against anti-Semitism. We must speak out when there is disinformation about Israel.  Thank you.  Senator Monroe.  Senator Monroe, followed by Councillor DeWitt.  Hello, Councillor. I'm sorry to see that Deepika isn't here because I came down tonight just to thank you all for looking into the Airbnb issue.  It has now been kind of tabled for a year, as I understand it, and will be looked at again just to make sure that there aren't outside interests that are purchasing up all kinds of homes in Chico to rent them as Airbnbs.  I think that that...  Could well be happening and it's drying up our housing stock.  And the folks whose mobile home rates are going up 30% is outrageous.  We do have rent control, but for some reason it doesn't apply to renting lots in a mobile home park.  And that really needs to be addressed and changed. Thank you.  Thank you.  Senator Monroe, followed by Councillor DeWitt.  Hi, I'm Kathy Glatch, and I live in the Pleasant Valley mobile home estates.  And I find it interesting tonight that you started the meeting with providing housing to homeless youth and the chip probe and all that, which is wonderful.  I applaud Chico for doing that.  We're on the other end of the spectrum.  We're getting kicked out of our houses.  We can't afford to live there because we live in a mobile home park.  We own our mobile homes.  We've chosen not to live in apartments where we can't...  We don't have a backyard.  We don't have a carport.  We don't have...  All the amenities that we have in a little senior mobile home park.  We have a little pool in our community and our bingos on Tuesday night and all that fun stuff.  We've earned that.  And we can afford to live there.  But what's happening is these predatory companies are purchasing land in Chico.  They bought our mobile home park two years ago, and they raised the rent every year.  And COVID, they were kind of respectful of that and held the rent down.  And now they've bumped up the rent 30% starting January 1st.  That's $150 for some of these people.  They're on fixed income.  They're disabled.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Good evening, everyone.  So I wanted to remind you, if you recall, in the last year, there have been some anti-Semitic flyers that were spread in neighborhoods.  I have a master's degree in Holocaust and genocide education.  So I'm passionate about that.  And so I just wanted to encourage you to remain vigilant about potential anti-Semitism in our community.  Hate crimes against Jews represent 51.4% of religion-related crimes.  I was disappointed to see that one of the organizers of the protest on Saturday, Red Star Chico, had made a statement on October 17th on their Instagram that seemed to be justifying the massacre.  And I don't think that there's any reason to justify what happened.  So I think that we need to be vigilant about that.  And so I encourage you to be vigilant about that.  And I encourage you to do so.  And thank you for helping to keep our community a safe one for all groups.  Good evening.  So I think everyone's heard of the broken window theory.  When we don't pay attention to the little things, they become the big things.  It becomes cities that are degraded.  It has people who are mentally ill that aren't cared for.  And I think we are seeing the output of a lot of bad policies.  A lot of bad policies.  That happened locally a long time ago.  And that are happening at the state and national level.  And so what we're seeing here tonight, to me, is the result of that.  A lot of divisiveness.  We've got homeless people in our streets who are going ping-ponging around when they've been offered shelter.  We have other things happening like that.  We have people that are speaking out for people that they're concerned about.  We're avoiding an elephant in the room, too.  So I'm just going to say I'm concerned about the Israeli people in Chico.  Also, because broken window theory, when you don't stand up and say something, big, bad things happen.  And there are other people being impacted, yes, as well.  But I think acknowledgement of a massacre is important.  Good evening, council.  Thank you for hearing me.  First, I'd like to express my solidarity with anybody seeking affordable housing in Chico.  I think that's an extremely important issue.  Thank you.  I was born and raised in this city, and I myself have had housing insecurity problems.  I want to continue to live here.  Now, not to be, excuse me, I would also like to echo the sentiments of the speakers.  If you could address the council, not the crowd.  I apologize.  I would like to echo the sentiments of the speakers earlier who mentioned their concerns for the safety of palaces.  We don't see it in Chico, but it's a separate issue, and it's a separate issue, and it's a separate issue, and it's a separate issue, and it's a separate issue, and it's a separate issue, and it's a separate issue, and it's a separate issue, and it's a separate issue, and it's a separate issue, and it's a separate issue, and it's a separate issue, and it's a separate issue, and it's a separate issue, and it's a separate issue, and it's a separate issue, and it's a separate issue, and it's a separate issue, and it's a separate issue, and it's a separate issue, and it's a separate issue, and it's a separate issue, and it's a separate issue, and it's a separate issue, and it's a separate issue, and it's a separate issue, and it's a separate issue, and it's a separate issue, and it's a separate issue, and it's a separate issue, and it  My name is Catherine Madrix.  I'd like to take my time to urge this council to adopt a resolution of ceasefire as Richmond, California, as well as Rhode Island has done already.  I would like you to consider the safety and well-being of your Palestinian Muslim populations in Chico.  Thank you for your time.  Hi.  Hi.  Please adopt the resolution that you've been presented, a resolution that aims to support and protect our Muslim, Arab, and Jewish community members here in Chico.  As a professor at Chico State, I'm speaking up for my students, all of those members I just mentioned, who have and continue to be impacted by what we're seeing in Gaza.  And I hope you seriously consider the resolution.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Sarah, do you follow my name in the file?  Hi.  I'm Sarah.  I am a field engineer for Paradise, for the rebuild.  I am Palestinian American, and I'm here to advocate for the adoption of the resolution mentioned earlier.  I would like to provide a perspective on local security in addition to U.S. security level.  San Diego just passed a law three years ago about implementing increased surveillance technology, the City Council of San Diego, into the city.  And with the increase of surveillance and technology that we will see as a result of this, it will likely affect proposals of increased surveillance technology all throughout California.  And considering that U.S. allies will likely...  We will likely have access to local civilian data if these proposals are implemented, we are much more vulnerable to U.S.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Our next speaker is Nikki Pyle.  As a lifelong citizen of Chico, I would like to ask the City Council to adopt the resolution for ceasefire in Gaza, as adopted by other councils such as Richmond and in Providence, Rhode Island.  I implore you...  Thank you.  ...to demonstrate support for our Muslim and Palestinian communities, as well as our Jewish communities.  This is a global issue impacting us locally, and it is important for our City Council to please demonstrate what the local people feel, which is support for all, but also there is a global issue that is setting a precedence that we need to address.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you, Senator.  All right.  We'll move on to public hearings.  Item 4.1, hearing regarding an ordinance of the U.S. security level.  City Council of the City of Chico approving Amendment Number 6 to the Development Agreement 0502 between the City of Chico and Merriam Park LLC.  And we'll start with a report from Mike Sala.  Welcome.  Thank you, Mayor Coolidge.  Good evening, Council.  A slide presentation here.  This is a proposed amendment to the Development Agreement for Merriam Park.  It's Development Agreement Number 6.  Merriam Park is a big project located on the north side of East 20th Street, west of Bruce Road, east of Bedford Drive, and south of Humboldt Road.  For a little project background, Merriam Park was originally applied for in 2005, approved in 2007.  The approvals included the whole gambit of things that we approve in the Planning Department, the General Plan Amendment, a rezone.  We adopted a whole new chunk of the code to implement the traditional neighborhood development zoning.  Adopted an environmental impact report.  And also approved a development agreement between the City of Chico and Merriam Park LLC.  Since then, since 2007, we've approved four different subdivisions.  And approximately 600 units have been developed in Merriam Park, as well as a lot of commercial space.  And we've also followed up the original approvals with five development agreement amendments.  Those amendments did certain things like provided flexibility for the Parkside Terrace affordable housing project to be created there at the end of Hartford.  Or Bedford.  It replaced a roundabout on East 20th Street in Concord with the signal and the planter boxes that you see out there now.  And it facilitated the state's acquisition of the courthouse site so that it could be developed for that purpose.  As well as several other things that we amended over the years.  This current DA amendment proposal would do these five things.  And these are my next five slides, so I won't spend too much time here.  But it identifies the remaining residential developers who are no longer Merriam Park LLC.  Updates the total number of units that we can anticipate in the project.  Updates the completion dates for the neighborhood parks.  Reduce the number of affordable units to maintain a 15% affordable unit requirement in Merriam Park.  And several others that I'll talk about if you want me to.  To identify the remaining residential developers, like I said, Merriam Park LLC is no longer in the picture.  And local developer Dan Gonzalez has acquired most of the site.  Webb Homes also owns 24 acres there, shown in the middle.  As I mentioned, several subdivision maps have been approved.  Basically the entire site has been mapped now.  We know where the lots are and where they'll go, except for the Webb Homes piece.  But we already know that he's going to build apartments on that site.  Then the second major item is to adjust the anticipated number of units in Merriam Park.  So this is a little graphic out of the Environmental Impact Report that talks about the fact that back then, it was 2006,  and we were anticipating that they could develop 2,300 units in Merriam Park.  And if you look at the very bottom of this slide, you'll see that that 2,300 is based on existing market information.  And that was, again, 2006, when we didn't realize, but we were about to head into a huge recession that completely stopped development for several years  and changed the environment.  And that's when we realized that we needed to change the market conditions and market outlooks at that point.  So nothing really happened on the site for several years.  And then the new developer, Dan Gonzalez, came along, acquired it, and put forward a new plan that was different than the old plan and responded to those market conditions.  Also, the redevelopment agency went away during that time.  So some of the flywheel effect of creating commercial space and residential above to help the city acquire revenues to do the redevelopment,  that all fell through.  And went away.  So now, based on where we are, about halfway built out, and the rest of the site being mostly mapped out,  we know that the anticipated number of units is no longer 2,300.  Those dreams are gone.  Now they're looking at a realistic 1,667 units.  So that amendment would acknowledge that change in what we actually anticipate coming off the land in that project.  The completion date for the neighborhood parks,  the ones in the development agreement now have long passed.  The first building permit was in 2009.  So the first park was supposed to be in 2014.  Of course, it wasn't going to happen by then.  Second park by 2019, north of the creek.  That obviously also hasn't happened because development was really slow.  We didn't really see development really get started out here until about 2018.  So just for geographical context, Park A is actually half built.  So the second half of it is currently graded and probably going to get built here in the next couple of months.  The deadline for that would be August of next year.  And then we set a trigger instead of a date for Park B, which is on the north side of the creek here.  And that would be when the north half above the creek is about half built out.  So when we see substantial development on there, then we want the neighborhood Park B to come online.  And those are pragmatic future dates.  The other item is to reduce the number of portable housing units required.  So based on that 2300 units in the original likely development scenario, there's 345 units of affordable units required.  And now that the number is closer to 1667 that we think will get built out there, the development agreement amendment would only require 250 deed restricted units.  So it maintains that 15% requirement based on the new total build out.  And then there's a handful of other things.  There's a handful of other requirements.  I'll talk about any of these if you'd like.  But to keep my comments brief, I'll skip these for now.  You can always come back to them.  To summarize, staff supports the development agreement amendments.  This proposal went before the Planning Commission about a month ago.  And the Planning Commission recommended approval of the amendments.  And we recommend you do that by introducing the ordinance in your packets tonight.  And I'll answer any questions you have.  All right.  Questions for Mr. Sullivan.  Mr. Sullivan.  Thank you for a concise and comprehensive presentation.  Sure.  The question that I have, I want to make sure I understood what you said.  The original estimate of 2300 housing units was an estimate, not a commitment, not a contractually binding commitment, right?  It was an estimate based on the information people had at the time?  That's right.  It was what they thought they were going to do in 2006.  And was that a commitment from the prior developer?  Yes.  The original developers who controlled Merion Park LLC that left the picture during the recession.  This is not a commitment that came from Mr. Gonzalez?  Well, it's not a commitment.  It's just a...  It's not a number that came from Mr. Gonzalez?  Right.  That's correct.  So it was an estimate, not a commitment?  It was only an estimate.  It was never required that they build this many units.  It was just...  We wanted the EIR to look at this very huge, ambitious building.  We wanted it to look, it was a separate building, it was separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate  If you say no to this amendment.  Mr. Sala, if you could please.  Ma'am, we don't allow personal attacks in this room.  Oh, sorry, I got another one.  Thank you.  That's two points.  Oh, my.  You can have both.  Yeah.  I'm sorry, I didn't quite catch your question.  I asked what would be the repercussions of us not updating the alternative proposals,  leaving it as is?  Well, the developers might continue building out there and deliver all the affordable units,  or they might decide to breach the agreement because we're asking for way more than 15% now,  and they could walk away.  And it would just get built pursuant to the T&D code.  Right, so they have to build without the development and opt out.  Yeah, and our triggers for the parks and other requirements that we expect from the developers would go away.  Okay, thank you.  Further questions?  How common is this that this happens on every single large development like this?  It was funny because somebody told me back in 2007 that it'll never get built out the way they think it's going to build out.  Every single project has to change along the way because you don't plan for recessions and stuff like that.  And we're lucky we have a place that's still called Merriam Park.  Gotcha.  All right.  Thank you very much.  Appreciate it.  Anyone else?  Vice Mayor?  Well, just follow-up.  Following up on that, I would say that every development has some adjustments,  but are they 23%, 24%, 25%, 6% of what the estimation is?  I mean, that's a pretty large amount.  I understand Mr. Gonzalez took over something from somebody else,  but this is a big amount of 700 houses we're taking off of the market.  I wouldn't put it that way.  It's more of a recognition of what has happened.  The build-out over there is about halfway done.  It's built at less density.  It doesn't have a bunch of three-story buildings, four-story buildings with a bunch of residential above the commercial ground floor.  You just see the commercial ground floor out there.  Density is the way to go, and that's the best thing we're supposed to do.  Apparently, it's very hard to build a mixed-use building because banks won't lend it.  They will say, well, is it a residential project or a commercial project?  It's both.  We don't have a product for you.  We don't have a lending product for you.  So there's dreams and soundbites.  It sounds really good, but the actuality of getting them done is tougher than it sounds like.  Definitely tougher than it sounds like.  It's still a pretty cool project, but yeah.  No, it's a beautiful project.  I mean, I get my hair done out there, and I think the Barton is super fun to entertain at.  But I'm just trying to understand.  I'm concerned about how—  I agree.  It's a large change.  We've got to have housing.  We've got to have housing.  We've got to have housing.  I would say the very large change in the project is due to the very large economic depression that we went through.  2007, 8, 9, 10.  All right.  Ms. Roy.  Do you know what the average, the density of the project overall is with this proposed build-out or what's happening right now?  I don't know.  I think it's the neighborhood of 15 units per acre, but I'd actually ask the developer if he can address that.  Sure.  Okay.  And do you know the density range for the zoning?  Right, yes.  Especially in these dues.  7 to 35 units per acre.  Yeah, so it could be about half the density maybe than what it is.  They could have built the whole thing out of 7.  Yeah, yeah, right.  Okay, thank you.  So, Mike, it's 18 and a half units an acre that's inclusive of single family and multifamily.  Yeah.  Yeah, they've got some very dense areas and they have some single family.  It's very dense.  It's as dense as anything in Chico.  Oh, yeah.  Sure.  All right.  Thank you.  So we'll open the public hearing.  Do we have any speakers?  Yes.  We have two.  David, follow up.  Follow up by Ron Gary.  Thank you.  Hello, everyone.  Counselors.  So the original master plan, shed a little bit of light, was very zealous, overly zealous.  And it was a best case scenario.  Lots of things had to happen for this to work.  And when the RDA $60 million got pulled out of it, that knocked the wind right out of the sails.  That was the number one thing.  And then the second thing, coupled that with a recession, and you got everything changed.  So I pick up the project.  And I looked at Chico, what it needed.  I looked at the market conditions.  And in my opinion, it needed an economic development cycle or model where we would build a commercial area  with a sustainable, walkable, higher density around the commercial for live work.  And then we would branch out and go into lower density.  That's what I did.  I master planned it.  It seemed very easy on paper.  It wasn't.  A lot more grayer than when I first started.  I didn't know it would first start coming here.  So we switched that model.  And what do we have at this point?  We've got, you know, a new model of 1,667 dwelling units planned or built at this stage.  And as Tom pointed out, our average density across all of our residential is 18.5 units.  And those of you that know multifamily, your range is 18 to 22 units for a multifamily, right?  We're 18.5 across all of our residential.  On top of that, not counting any of these numbers, there are 180 that I have planned or built half of them at this point.  The ADUs aren't in that number, nor are they counted for in my affordable housing.  Each of them is below the 80% for moderate housing.  And so that right there is another addition that we're not really being looked at.  So by the end of 24, we should be at about 455,000 square feet of commercial.  About 1,000 employees are right there right now at Marion Park.  We'll be about 1,100 by the end of 2024.  Total mixed use by the end of 2024 is 150,500 square feet.  Now, when I started building mixed use, no bank would loan on it.  So I personally financed all of my mixed use so we could get it going.  It will only fit certain places.  After we would get it stabilized, then we were able to have it financed by a bank reluctantly,  still at a very low loan-to-value ratio.  At this point, we're having trouble getting insurance on it, so it's really difficult.  We're successful with 150,000 square feet.  At the end, when you look at our model versus the one that was done before,  I would say that we've done this.  We were successful.  I'm happy with it.  We now have a VA hospital.  We have a commercial thriving district.  We have live work.  We have the parks.  We have the community, and all that seems to be clicking the box.  The only thing that Mr. Orme was upset with me about in this whole development  was that I did not sell to a Fred Meyer commercial building.  In fact, he was pissed, and instead I held off because I wanted something bigger.  We got a cancer center instead.  If there's any questions.  So, yeah, at the end, it was a matter of master planning this thing and juggling it around.  I feel really excited about what we've accomplished, and, yeah.  That's all I have.  Are you investigating that noise, Mr. Gobson?  Thank you.  There's a reason nobody builds these types of developments.  I know why.  May I ask a question before we go?  Sure.  Is there anything in the development agreement that sticks out to you as it is constraining you from building higher density?  Nothing in the development agreement is constraining us from building higher density.  It's a balance.  What does Chico want?  What does Chico need?  And it's a balance.  And how much high density can it take and what's reasonable?  We're not a Portland or a San Francisco.  I try to get into that area, but you still have to give them a little bit of space and have diversity in living.  So the number one thing I think we're lacking in Chico is diversity in living situations.  We go multifamily or we go affordable housing.  There's nothing in the middle, which is what I build.  I build workforce housing, right?  So if you can get out of affordable housing, you have a place to land.  That's what I shoot for.  And that's my goal.  Thanks for the question.  All right.  Further questions?  No?  Thank you.  All right.  Next speaker.  So I really don't have a dog in this, but I'm not sure that I'm advocating for one outcome or the other, but I am totally confused.  I thought that we had a housing shortage in Chico, and I thought we had a tremendous demand for low-income housing.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay. !  the economic factors that go into Mr. Gonzalez's recalculation of the number of houses that the  market is demanding, like why is that? Because how are you going to make good decisions about  future developments if we have a policy that says we need to do infill, we need to have low-income  housing, we need to have more workforce housing, and we have a development that is providing all  of those things, and now we're reducing it by 27 percent. So I'm just confused as to what the  policy of this city is. Either we need housing or we don't need housing. Either the market demands  more housing or it doesn't demand more housing, or is it that the type of housing that is being  developed in Merriam Park is out of touch with what the market is actually demanding, and if  that's true, what is the market demanding?  And shouldn't we build that? So I hope, no matter what you decide, I hope that there's some clarity  that comes out of this situation because we have the same people that are opposing Valley's Edge  on urban sprawl are not saying anything about Merriam Park, and we're reducing housing as  opposed to increasing housing. So I'm just confused as to what the council is doing,  promoting what your policies are, and what the housing needs of Chico actually are. So I hope that  out of this you can explore the answer to some of those questions. Thank you.  So I obviously, we probably can't force Mr. Gonzalez to build more housing than he wants to,  but I do think if we can hold him closer to the 345 number of affordable housing units,  that would be a positive for the city. We need more affordable housing. We have a horrible  homelessness problem, and I think that having more units that people can actually afford would be good.  Thank you.  Megan, do you have any other comments you want to make?  Hello.  I am glad that I was here to hear this information about the development in Merriam Park.  I would also like for Mr. Gonzalez to explain why he needs to reduce the number of affordable housing units  down to 250 when 345 is already a pretty low number for the entirety of the development going forward.  Chico has an affordable housing crisis already, and if there's problems with density due to high traffic,  which is one of the problems with Valley's Edge, then there are solutions to resolve that problem  through more better public transportation and more community resilience. I would just like for  Mr. Gonzalez to respond to that.  Okay.  So, I'm going to ask you to explain how this is going to benefit the community and be affordable for the workers,  because $15 an hour, 30, 40 hours a week, does not cover the higher rent cost. Thank you.  So, Erin Short is our final speaker.  Please hold.  Thank you, Council.  I just wanted to address the point that was brought up, that mixed-use loans do not exist, and I urge the Council to look further into this before they let the potential developers off the hook for what they originally promised the city.  Housing is a major problem here, especially affordable housing, and I do not believe that that is a factual statement.  There are mixed-use loans that exist.  It's how mixed-use buildings are built in Portland, for example, which was brought up by the developer.  So, I would just really encourage the Council to look into that.  Council to look further into this and really do everything they can to hold  the developers to what the original agreement was. Thank you.  All right. So we will close public hearing and entertain a motion or further discussion.  I'd like to make a motion to accept the recommendation of Planning, Commissioning, and Community Development  Director and approve the approved recommendation.  Second.  Motion and second.  I have a further comment.  Yeah. I just want to comment on some of the comments that were brought up.  Mary Park is really not like other developments in Chico.  I believe it's the only development in Chico's history that has a 50% affordability requirement.  We don't otherwise require affordable housing as a condition for subdivisions.  So it is what they're sticking to is that percentage there.  It's unfortunate that Mr. Gonzales has found that he could not finance or could not sell housing at a higher density  because we really do need to use the shorter term.  We don't have the land that we have to build efficiently enough to address our housing needs.  And what Mary Park's been doing, however, is transitioning what is possible within Chico.  Because like Mr. Gonzales said, he could not get an interstice loan at the start in Portland or in the Bay Area,  thanks to them, who are willing to loan on these sort of projects.  But it's considered that Chico isn't a safe place to do that.  And I think it's important that developments like this can happen so that we can progress towards being able to  sustain a kind of building that is going to address everybody's needs.  Mary Park is a lot closer to that than anything else that we have going on.  I think just by it being there and by it building out opens up the possibilities for other developments.  So we don't have to look at large tracts of land nearby and say the only thing that's feasible here is very low density sprawl  for very high income people.  Because what Mary Park is doing is inviting more of a diversity into a community, creating a space that people can walk,  access things they need.  And that's something that we're seeing that the jobs it provides can actually be occupied by people who live in the development.  It's really not something that we're seeing in other large development proposals in this town.  So I'm happy to support them going forward with this.  Although I also wish that just more affordable housing could come out of these lands.  And that finance for affordable housing for mixed use was more available than it is in our area.  Vice Mayor?  I just wanted to add a couple of small things.  What a bummer that we did lose the $60 million in RDA.  We would have changed that project.  And having recently built something, I know even if you could get somebody to finance it, getting somebody to insure a mixed use building would probably be near impossible right now.  So I'm glad that we are able to, as a council, be flexible in what we're doing.  Hopefully in the future as these things come forward, this was an inherited project that had some pipe dreams that we all didn't know was going to happen as we move forward and other projects come forward.  Thank you.  I think they'll be a little bit more on target and have less of a variance.  And I'm sure we'll see that affordable housing in other ones that come forward too.  So I will be supporting this.  And thank you for all the beautiful work that you've done out there.  But we will keep an eye on this moving forward as a project.  All right.  Further comment?  So I'm clear.  There was a motion and a second to introduce the Orders of the City Council of the City of Chico,  per Main Amendment No. 6,  to Development Agreement 0502,  between City of Chico and Marion Park LLC,  Gonzales Development Company.  Councillor Bennett?  I would like to extend my appreciation to Mr. Gonzales and Mr. Webb for all of the homes you have built in our community.  I appreciate it.  Thank you very much.  And my vote is yes.  Thank you.  Councillor Morgan?  Yes.  Councillor Van Overbeek?  Yes.  Councillor Winslow?  I'm just glad we're not removing the 15% affordability or something.  I'm just glad we're not removing the 15% for our department for future building going on out there.  Yes.  Okay.  We'll turn it over to Mayor Riddle.  Aye.  Mayor Kudlich?  Aye.  Carries 6-0 with 1.5-6.  All right.  Item 5.1, addition of drones to military equipment inventory.  A report from Chief Alderman.  Good evening, Mayor.  I'm the Chief of the City Council of Chico.  I'm the Chief of the City Council of Chico.  I'm the Chief of the City Council of Chico.  Good evening, Mayor, Vice Mayor, members of Council.  I'm here tonight to just talk about the addition of two drones within our AB 481 requirements.  I have to first throw myself on the sword for a mistake I made.  I want to apologize to Council, to city staff, and to the community.  When I did my AB 481 annual report, I missed one of the drones that we actually had.  I had preauthorized from you.  So I made that correction and have posted that back to the website.  But I wanted to own that mistake as mine as I wrote this report.  Moving forward, as you see in the report, it's a pretty straightforward request.  We removed two of the smaller drones from our fleet.  We were able to get a trade-in credit for those.  Our goal was to use that credit for a future project.  We had a purchase of an upgraded miniature drone, same type drone, just better technology.  And then likewise, we have a request for a larger drone that has a much better camera capacity for our PIX4D crime scene mapping system.  We initially thought that when we got that system, our current drones would be able to, the larger drone that we have, the Matrice, would be able to run that program.  We've since found three.  We've been able to run that program through a test evaluation of that PIX4D program that the camera system on that drone cannot keep up with the program that we purchased.  So our goal is to use the second drone request here, the Mavic 3 Enterprise drone, to simply be attached to the PIX4D crime scene mapping program.  So my request to you is straightforward.  We have the funds already on hand.  We have a credit at one of the drone supply lines.  We have the money that we need to help our suppliers to help us purchase this.  And the fiscal impact on it will be already budgeted within my budget.  I'm not requesting any funds from you.  I'm simply asking that, per the law of AB 481, you are the governing body that has to authorize us to add that to our inventory.  I'll answer any questions that you may have about that.  All right.  Questions for the Chief?  Thank you.  Mr. Ronslow.  When did our drone program begin?  When was the first time the police department required a drone?  It was a little over a year ago.  I can't remember the exact date.  No, that recent that we first got any drones for the police department?  So AB 481, the first report was due last year, or the request for equipment that was termed military equipment came into play in 2022.  We started getting the drones.  We started getting the drones right around that time, which is why the one drone that I said I missed in the report was my fault because we were creating this new procedure.  And as we created the new report that had to come out, we received that first bigger drone.  And it was about that same time that I missed it.  I just, because I remember hearing that there's been several iterations of like new drone technology comes out.  And we're like, we're seeking to get the new, the newest drones.  And so, I mean, I was wondering how many years we don't see a new one.  Because there's always, it's improving technology, right?  So as soon as you buy this, it's like next year there might be one that is of higher caliber that we're going to be seeking to get.  Yeah, for sure.  The minute you buy something now, they already have something in the works that's much better.  I don't foresee us needing to upgrade anything.  I don't.  I don't think we're going to be able to do that within the next year after this purchase.  You know, unless something breaks, but that's already approved by council for us to just replace.  But the only thing we found is just simply because of the requirements of the PIX4D crime scene mapping camera needs, none of our drones had that capability.  Initially we thought it did.  We found out it didn't.  And we brought in the company to test our drones with their program.  And they said, no, you need this specific drone that has this specific camera system in it.  Is the one that didn't work with that the one that we returned for that $1,500 credit?  No, it was, those were two of the really small ones that we used for interior searches.  And so it was actually a win-win for the area because we traded them in.  We got a credit.  But then Paradise Police Department, who's trying to get their drone program going, were able to purchase those two drones from the company for a much lower price.  To help them get their program started.  They get like a second-hand drone program?  Exactly.  That's good.  So they stayed local and we got to upgrade.  Thank you.  Chief, so this 3D mapping software, the drone is very interesting stuff.  How much staff time will that take?  Because you're going to automate something, right?  You don't have somebody in a crime scene.  So presumably you're going to save money.  How much time do you need to save?  Well, I can speak from experience on that as a crime scene investigator for three years of my time on patrol.  I've drawn out many crime scenes by hand that take you, you know, 15, 20 hours to draw out a crime scene.  The current system that we have, you can fly this drone over a crime scene.  It works directly with the PIX4D program and is creating it as you fly it.  So it's, the turnaround is exponential.  And the cost in terms of, you know, the cost of the drone.  The cost of, you know, having an officer draw it by hand on the clock versus flying it with a drone in a matter of 15, 20 minutes is, you just can't compare it.  All right.  Thank you very much.  Mr. Speaker?  Yes, we have four.  All right.  Three's up.  James Hutchinson, followed by Ray and Sharon.  Yes, we have four.  We have a number.  We have a five.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Okay.  What you heard is a bunch of stuff.  And it's broad generalities focusing on the positive aspects of what they say are the positive aspects.  Talk about the drone that flies inside.  It's been reviewed by a number of organizations that review drones.  One of the biggest problems with that particular drone is it's noisy.  And I mean noisy.  We're talking about 76 to 86 decimals.  It's not a drone.  Can you imagine that, going down the hallway, looking for a crook?  You're going to hear it if you know what a decibel sounds like.  It's one of the reviews, one of many.  It can't see in the dark.  It doesn't have thermal cameras.  It's difficult to repair or modify.  FPV drones can quickly get a new part to replace damage normally, but not with this one.  And they don't come cheap, the parts in this.  We also have a series of other ones.  Another article that says reasons why Avatar is not worth it.  Another one that points to the cons of Avatar.  One of the things they talk about, it doesn't have an avoidance system.  So it's flying down a hallway, and the person trying to guide it goes wrong.  It's going to hit the hull.  And what happens?  You've got a difficult to repair drone, and you've only got one.  You've only got one.  And you've lost it.  You need to look into the facts of this instead of this glittering generalities that you just got said.  These are out there.  There's all kinds of sites on this.  What the heck are we talking here?  Look at DroneBlog.com, for instance.  It's one that reviews and it also lists the positive aspects of this drone.  But one of them is not public safety.  It's a gaol.  A lot of police units use it.  Yeah, thousands.  But there's a lot of flaws in it and a lot of problems with it.  And these flaws are coming out.  And people know about it.  But we don't.  You're not hearing it.  Why is that?  Why is the police department covering up the deficits in this problem?  Why are they covering up the whole facts?  You're getting it again.  Listen to it.  Look at the facts.  Go look it up yourself.  Delay on this and go look it up.  Get somebody to actually do the research.  Instead of just saying, hey, I want a new toy.  I want to throw a new drone out there.  You're talking about saving officers' lives and this won't do it.  You're putting them at risk.  Damn it.  Get with it, would you?  Thank you.  Great share.  How about that, then?  Well, you all already know that I'm against this, obviously.  I don't think that the police force in Chico should be getting any of this.  I think that the police force should be getting any more equipment, any more military equipment, particularly, but not just no more.  There should be less of what there already is.  The more hammers you put in their hands, the more they will treat human beings in this community like nails.  Why does the city continue to give more and more money to the police department, but somehow there isn't time or money for appropriate training relative to de-escalation and mental health crisis?  But more than that, that the city should use a lot of the money that is currently going to the police to do the things that would be needed to do the work that they're doing.  So, I think that the police force should be actually directly addressing people in crisis and addressing the inequalities within our community that lead to so-called crime.  A surveillance state does not actually make the people safer.  And as you heard earlier, there's a lot of people in this community who are feeling really unsafe right now, and the police used their drone to monitor our rally over there at the plaza this last weekend.  And, you know, as a Jewish Israeli woman, I think that's a lot of work.  And, you know, as a Jewish American, I also want to point out that the Israeli military trains U.S. cops in the brutality that gets committed here on U.S. soil.  This is another reason why you should pay attention to that resolution.  I know you want to cut me off for that.  But, ultimately speaking, there's a lot of killer cops on ChicoPee.  Frankly, one is too many, and they shouldn't be getting any more money, any more equipment, any more toys that are not toys, that are military equipment, that are tools of violence and war.  and that is not the way to treat civilians within a community that you want to treat as a community  and that ultimately speaking why are we even talking about the continued surveillance of  our people and the continued increase in military equipment in the hands of police who are already  equipped with so many weapons and so many tools of violence when there is no accountability for  all the people that the police have killed in this community namely Desmond Phillips of course  I'm going to name Desmond Phillips and I'm going to name Desmond Phillips over and over and over  again because I haven't been here in a while so you haven't heard his name in a while so I got to  say it over and over again justice for Desmond Phillips and the Phillips family and all of the  families of this community and the extended families of the people who were killed you know  we had that moment of silence for paradise early earlier and Stephen Vest was a was a campfire  victim survivor as well and he was also killed by Chico PD and none of this stuff actually makes  the community safer.  The drones don't make the community safer the military equipment doesn't make the community safer  and I'm just going to run out my time here because I know you don't actually care what I have to say  anyway but at least I'm going to take up your time and tell you that you shouldn't do it because  it's the right thing to do is to tell you not to do it justice for Desmond Phillips.  I've got it.  I'm going to oil his chair while I'm down there too.  Thank you very much.  Yeah.  Can I speak?  Yeah okay excellent.  Yeah as far as drones go after our police chief's presentation you know it looks like they're part of our  history.  Part of our life right now.  But as far as my tax dollars go I'd see I'd rather see them spent on more detectives in a better lab.  I've spent through the lab once and it looked like bare existence.  So I'd like to see my tax dollars going for solving crime.  And as far as military acquisitions I would like to see a public forum on each of the  acquisition specific to that particular purchase of military equipment. All right, thank you.  Thank you.  Nicole Mata, followed by Yomar Lachlan.  Good evening. So I am coming to speak about the drones because I am in support of them.  I have worked in fields before and had to go into apartment units before where there were like unstable things happening.  And I think that.  People need to be aware of domestic abuse statistics and who is at risk there.  It is, of course, the victim in that scenario, but also it increases quite a bit the risk to officers responding.  That's a lot of times when they get injured or killed.  And so for me, for them to have the ability to send in military equipment, it's a it's a it's a word to send that in to an advance to be safe.  I think that's a great thing.  I think their families would certainly appreciate that.  Also, for crime scenes and all of that, I'm here to tell you, like I've been a victim of crime multiple times.  And no offense, Chico Police Department, but many years ago when it happened, literally there were fingerprints on a wall in black when they stole TV and all kinds of other stuff.  And they didn't do it because, like, literally they did not have the resources.  So if my taxpayers can go to the resources to have us be safe, I would appreciate it.  I would like to say something.  I would like to say something on the terms of safety.  There has been increased violent scenarios happening in this town.  A nice Samaritan was in a donut shop trying to intervene in a tip jar incident and was literally very violently stabbed.  I saw the wound myself and it was horrific.  I myself have been privy to bullying and harassment and being followed.  And we've seen evidence of that here tonight.  Not once, but two times.  And so I would say that anyone has a right.  And I would like to try to have theirs be safe.  And for me, the police department is here to keep me safe.  So, yes, I want my taxpayers to fund the ability for them, like tonight, to intervene where it's necessary.  Ma'am, hold on.  Excuse me.  We do not tolerate those kinds of signs.  I would like to hear the announcement.  Exhibit A.  Everybody, thank you.  Sir, thank you.  Quiet, please.  Please.  Please do not allow her back in the room.  Thank you.  That's the third time I've asked her.  Thank you, Mayor.  I appreciate that.  So that is case in point.  And I would like to also make a statement to one of the council members here.  I do not feel it was appropriate.  And this is pertaining to the job, the job that was happening here tonight.  The people were asked to calm down and go.  And as one of the council members exiting, throws a fist up in the air in solidarity.  That doesn't make everyone feel safe.  And when you're acting in a role as council, I feel it's appropriate to be professional.  So I think that does relate to safety.  We all need to be here to care for each other.  And that's not very caring.  Okay.  Our last speaker is .  Okay.  I just want to echo the earlier statement.  I'm suggesting that we should not be spending money on this kind of thing.  I don't know if you've ever been on the receiving end of this military equipment that police departments in this country have received.  I don't know if you've ever been shot with a rubber bullet or tear gassed or had a concussion grenade go off near you.  Or been hit with an LRAD sound cannon.  And some of the military equipment that the United States has been giving to police departments.  I don't know.  if you've ever experienced that before or seen somebody get hit in the chest  with a concussion grenade and have a seizure in front of you or an elderly  native woman who's praying with sage gets shot in the face and lose her  eyeball from a rubber bullet I don't know if you've ever experienced that  before I have experienced that before my friend over here and me both experienced  that in North Dakota at the Standing Rock Reservation where the police  departments there were funded 22 million dollars to violently attack peaceful  protesters right I don't understand what scenario that you would need to  use military equipment against your own civilian population if your civilian  population is unhappening with the way that you're governing it should be their  right to remove you I believe that even says in your founding documents of the  so-called country that your civilian population is supposed to have the right  to stand up against tyrannical government  so I would really  suggest that you don't spend any more money giving any more military devices  to police departments the statistics show that policing policing in this  country doesn't actually make people safe the statistics show that police  don't actually spend the majority of their time effectively solving crimes  those there's plenty of statistics you can read I don't have them off the top of my  head but I'd be happy to bring them back for you  the police department of the state of North Dakota has a lot of evidence that says that police are not the only people who are involved in crime in North Dakota  but it's also true that police violence in North Dakota Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez Gonzalez  no police injuries of any kind or any issue in 20 degrees,  spraying water cannons at people,  using LRAD sound cannons against civilian population,  not just civilian populations, but in digital.  Well, there's military equipment, my friend.  Yeah, but you're putting it in the hands  of your military equipment inventory.  Yeah, point of order.  We're not bantering back and forth.  Just say your piece.  Go ahead.  Give me an extra 20 seconds.  Yes, he did.  Thank you.  And that's why I'm admonishing him.  All right.  Into speakers.  All right.  Entertain a motion.  Second.  Motion from Council Member Morgan.  Second from Vice Mayor Reynolds.  May I have a quick question?  Hold on.  Let's do a quick.  He didn't ask, but I'll be quick.  I just.  I just want to say I've heard really compelling cases  for how useful the drones are for the police department  in de-escalating situations sometimes, keeping people safe.  The story I also heard was how when there was a particular drone  that was desired for some particular qualities it had,  the police department was going to purchase it,  and they found that it was half the cost  that they expected it had been.  So they bought two of them, right?  That's just to say that I think at times I feel,  like we should err on the side of restraint when it comes  to putting additional funds because we can always justify new purchases  of new equipment, especially when this technology is changing year  after year and we're always looking at new purchases  of really similar things with somewhat different qualities.  And sometimes I think that we have to strike a balance somewhere.  And I immediately feel more compelled to err on the side  of restraint with spending here because I don't sense that there is  that from anybody else on the city council.  Thank you.  Thank you.  If I can make a comment.  Yes.  To the work of my colleague, my young colleague,  Mr. Winslow said, so the technology here isn't so much  that drone, it's the software and the image processing software.  And as long as the camera system, correct me if I'm wrong, Chief,  as long as the camera system can put out enough pixels  to feed the software, then as you update the technology,  we're really talking about software upgrades.  So it's the image processing software,  that will get upgraded, not so much the drone.  That's where the technology is in the image processing software.  Yeah, software.  Am I getting that right, Chief?  Yes.  And the computer.  All right.  Further comment?  All right.  I have a question.  Proceed.  Council Member Bennett?  Yes.  Council Member Morgan?  Council Member Van Leverbeck?  Yes.  Council Member Winslow?  No.  Vice Mayor Reynolds?  Aye.  Mayor Cooney?  Aye.  Carries 5-1 with one absence.  All right.  We're going to take a short break.  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back.  Three.  And we have a report from Director of Human Resources and Risk Management, Chelsea Pheavis.  Go ahead.  Thank you, everyone.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you, Ms. Gonzalez, and Ms. Gonzalez, and Ms. Gonzalez, and Ms. Gonzalez, and Ms. Gonzalez,  there wasn't really a good structure from going from being a human resources analyst to a principal  analyst to a director and so with this new structure it helps us provide kind of that  middle ground to have a senior analyst which is a position we did have in the past and it also  addresses the inequity of pay for our human resources analyst and brings it a little closer  to market value we're still a little bit below but it does bring us closer to where we could be  so that is what i have before you this evening it's a savings of approximately 16 000 to this  year's budget and then an ongoing cost of approximately four thousand dollars for the future  all right questions so the senior human resources analysts we do not have currently and then human  resources analysts are the ones that are currently working on the project so we're going to have to  have a few questions about the senior human resources analyst we do so we um have non-budgeted  uh the senior human resources analyst position um it is in existence we have a job description for it  we had and filled the principal analyst position which was amanda patton  she previously occupied the senior human resources analyst job title  and so she was reclassified so we do have the position it's just not filled  and we do have the human resources analyst position which is  karen allison who does our benefits and life insurance and all that good stuff  gotcha all right any other questions questions questions no thank you very much  all right entertain a motion  all right any other questions  all right any other questions  second  motion second  when you're ready  council member bennett  yes  council member morgan  council member van vandenberg  yes  council member lindsloy  yes  vice mayor reynolds  no  mayor koelisch  aye  carries for 2.1 assets  aye  all right item 5.3 council discussion direction on funds from parks and housing  and we have a verbal report from city manager mark  so  thank you mayor council and it's meeting meeting of june 6 council directed staff  returning council and discussed additional allocations of  a majority of funds if you remember we did not allocate 100  of the funds while we won't have final numbers on the indirect revenue so we'll go to the next meeting  in september and october of 2024  and we'll leave it with two to three millionaire  if it recommended a target for a fund return moving forward  as to the increasing expense allocation this year we are experiencing early sign in with  success rebound in the police battle so much so we plan on cutting it in half and separate it in half  before you ask me to unfreeze five of his officers positions starting in January, primarily  so that we can start the hiring process in anticipation of, I guess, four or five new  hires that we're already expecting next year. So the idea there is we're just going to be  right ahead of that nutrition before it hits us. And that's expected to cost four or five  hundred million dollars in business a year, both in payroll and in the costs, and probably  maybe eight hundred to a million dollars in substance use if those positions remain filled.  Additionally, the Parks Department developed a market advance for five projects totaling  1.7 million. If there's interest in exploring those further, we can bring those back or  we can have them before we get to the normal way of the process.  So with that, looking forward direction, how do you look to see this?  Okay, questions. Before we start rattling out the zittings, we'll hear the speakers.  But any questions for the sitting board?  Mr. Sorensen, so on housing, what we're talking about is money from grant writers for affordable  housing as opposed to, do I have that right?  Well, it was housing.  Okay.  Mr. You mentioned, I believe it was Councilmember Lin who mentioned how we have  prepared the specifics on the budget money.  Okay. I remember him talking about more grant, people to write grants to get more,  apply for more, apply for grants for more affordable housing projects.  I just want to be clear about where the housing money would go for the housing pieces.  Mr. I would have a better conclusion on that one.  I don't think our biggest challenge is grant funding.  I think the money that was made available for housing could be used for that purpose.  Other state funding, that's always a match.  You know, maybe a three-year issue.  And then other ideas I've come up with, like the housing fee.  Housing is a big location.  Housing money is always earned through the state loan.  Requirements for affordability are not a given option.  You know, a lot of other things I have thought about.  I'm not sure if the Council would be, at some point,  going to need that money out of the capital in the federal community.  And that is very costly engagement.  So, stashes and other things, that costs at some point might be a good idea as well.  There is a fund, you know, that does the pay to get it, but not enough to meet that very involved cost.  Is it possible to give the Council some guidance that if, for example,  there was another million dollars going to housing,  how many units would that result in?  I think that would depend on the amount.  I figured out in that, in the 2020, that, you know,  we use any money that we generate that's available to leverage in our projects  in order to be able to use it in a single, kind of large, set of things.  So, it's all about timing.  If I'm in Congress, if we happen to put together the list,  I then will appropriate the equity, if there's a need to do that.  We'll see what we do.  Thank you, Mr. Rudd.  So, City Manager, how much money could possibly,  and maybe I'm asking you for a guess,  but how much money could be set aside for housing,  as Mr. Veague explained,  some, some,  useful purposes for that money?  Because I've lost track of the numbers.  So, at this point, we believe we're on track for an unbalanced view,  just for a year of five million.  Okay.  And I think we would want to keep at least two to three million  for about .  That's two.  Okay.  And we want to spend that money to .  It's still so soon in the process.  I mean, we're starting to cut up the policy.  We're starting to apply, but it's not even prepared yet.  So, that's what concerns me is,  and a colleague would say about this time,  what are you willing to give up, right?  So, should we wait until we have a better feel  for what might be the possibilities economically?  That would be a good approach.  You know, it's not as if it's on,  we'll have the next patch of .  Right?  And then, three months after that,  another batch.  Currently, all we have is one more.  Yeah.  Now, I remember saying that I would support this conversation  back when we were talking about the budget.  So, I still am committed to support your ideas about housing.  But at this point, I'd like to wait a little bit  and see how much money might be there  rather than have a long conversation about what ifs.  Before we make decisions,  let's go through questions first.  So, any other questions from the guys?  I want to just clarify that what we're looking at  in terms of further direction here is,  do we ask for you to come back with a supplemental appropriation this year  or do we defer it until the next regular budget this season?  But then, maintaining the direction that we are going to use  some of the measure-age sales tax funds,  as we've put out in flyers to the majority of the voting population in Chico  to fund parks and housing to a certain extent in some fashion.  Yeah.  I heard you, Peter.  Okay.  I had to make sure I understood where we were going with it.  Yeah.  As far as, I guess, I mean, what was just said about, like,  where we put the needs in, certainly in my mind,  in making the motion before,  was that we would address the needs as identified by  the Community Development Department and the Housing Division,  which I thought would look like grant-righted housing analysts  just based on conversations I've had,  but it might not be the case that that is the best use of the funds.  Okay.  Yeah.  All right.  Do we have any speakers?  Ms. Warren, did you have a comment?  Ms. I do, too.  Ms. Kolmata, followed by Florence.  Ms. Good evening.  I'm here as an individual, not one named Karen.  And I am here to talk about the  parks part of this equation.  So for Measure H funds, back in the day,  a lot of the talking points and other things that were put out to sway  and convince people to vote in the affirmative for Measure H was that  the attention would be paid to the roads, primarily some public safety,  of course, which has been addressed to some extent there.  The roadways, as you can see,  and the roads that you can probably read about in the mean streets of Chico  and the Chico ER are not good.  And I know you all know that.  And I saw the 10-year plan.  I appreciate all the work that had to have gone into that.  I've been watching for years as both these gentlemen and others have put on presentations  to note the degradation and what is needed.  My concern is if we're trying to already scoop out money and parse it out on something  that was not really sold to the voters,  people are going to have a very bitter taste in their mouth  if they're still driving on mean streets.  And to me, what I thought I had heard a lot of was a complete overhaul of streets,  not just patching and other things.  So I would fully expect that we are able to address these projects in a meaningful way  such that the citizens can have their city look like what they've wanted it to look like  for a very long time, feel cared for.  It makes us feel safer.  I appreciated that we are trying to draw attention to the police force  and be able to have better retention by having competitive pay  because one of the other elements of the road thing would be safety related to not having enough traffic cops on the beat.  They're allocated to other things constantly.  And it's so important that we start focusing on that because a lot in the papers are accidents.  And it's probably a tie-in with road condition and people just going,  yeah, odds are with me.  You know, they'd be in my favor.  And they are.  So when you guys make these consideration points about the allocations,  at least for these come up years,  I think that the, almost the full boat of it,  needs to go to the roads like the people thought they were.  I'm just concerned about the swerve and I just want to put it out there.  Thank you for your time.  Thank you, Florence.  Who's our last speaker?  Hello.  I would like to say thank you.  I want to speak in support of using Measure H funds for park and housing programs as well as the roads, actually.  And I believe that using these funds for these programs will keep our community safe  and strongly discourage the idea of unfreezing by police positions.  I do not believe that police keep our community safe.  And statistics have shown that putting funds towards the community resources such as housing and parks  do more to keep our community safe, to keep crime rates low,  and generally build up the people of our community.  Thank you.  All right.  Further discussion?  Mr. Mortimer.  So, as we commonly do, we're discussing money we don't have yet prior to the budget process.  But I'm going to be there.  There's some things that I can remember about what we did and what we have to do.  And I'm going to be there.  So, this discussion is extremely important to the church.  And there's no good in doing it.  So, I see it as a table.  I'll second that.  Do you want to put it on the table?  No.  To the budget?  Okay.  All right.  So, we have a motion and a second.  The table will be discussed.  With all due respect, the motion, the reason we got to this discussion,  is because in the regular budget session, we had really about $10 million, maybe less than that.  There were some millions of dollars that were unallocated that we were anticipating to receive out of Measure H.  And we're finding that it is consistent.  That's what we are expecting these funds.  And we brought this conversation back.  To be honest, I'm not totally opposed to tabling it, because the whole intention in that motion there was that  when we do have the money, that we're just assuring that there's more of a diversity of uses in it than we were seeing out of the use of Measure H funds before.  So, yeah, I think that's all for tabling it.  I don't see any problem with that, given that we can't be sure that we have the funds anyway.  Okay.  So, I'm going to make a comment.  I agree with that.  I want to take a step back before I do that.  So, I agendized this item to be brought up and discussed at council homes for parks and roads.  And public safety.  The committee that ran the election also included housing in that argument.  And I think that probably helped us sell to the voters.  So, not necessarily against that.  So, the projection right now is that we have $5 million in the general fund currently from Measure H.  So, I would prefer to just allocate that in January.  I'm not sure.  I think we should sit on $8 million that we could spend on projects or whatever it ends up.  Or five or three.  So, is that projection for what we have already?  Or is that a projection for the extra that we're going to have?  That's a projection based on the one quarter.  Yeah.  That we do the calendar year 2020 for the non-partner.  Yeah.  Or we brought in $5 million.  We allocated four million for that.  And then for this fiscal year, we assumed .3 or .4 million.  Even though now the forecast suggests that it's a little bit less than that.  And we allocated all of that for it.  So, looking forward, including roughly $1.8 million to be carried over from last fiscal year.  And we're a lot more money than we can get out to this fiscal year.  We should have it after around $5 million.  But again, this is all just based on one single quarter.  Sure.  No, I understand that too.  And I sit in finance.  So, I get that.  I don't necessarily think that it's the best plan to, you know, if we move through in the next quarter,  it looks like that's going to come to fruition, you know, spending half of it.  But, you know, relatively conservative estimate.  Seems to make sense.  I mean, I don't think we necessarily need to bank all the money for one year and spend it on the next.  We typically don't budget like that.  We spend the money that we have that year that we have.  So.  Yeah.  So, if we maintain .  Right.  So, I have one more.  Yeah.  And then we need to vote on the table.  Uh-huh.  The table .  So, maybe it would be better to have the discussion after three quarters, which, if I'm not mistaken,  would be January 30th would be, or, yeah, we would have second, third, and fourth quarters.  We would have the second quarter in January, and then three months after that, we would have three quarters.  But we want that in the whole picture.  An entire . . .  So, all I was going to add to that is that there's always still the chance that major  H is going to go away.  And if it does, we're going to want to be very, very particular on where this money  goes, because there may not be more happening without a member election.  So, I just want to make sure we have all the information we need on what's coming down the road.  And I would just say I agree with that argument.  But at the same time, too, I think the voters are hungry to see progress.  Mr. Cobb, a question, please.  I figured you could do that, too.  I still have . . . as I'm thinking about this, I think whether we bring it up later or we give more firm direction now,  I'm less concerned about, because at some point, we want to allocate these funds, I think, in this way.  And I hope that there's some agreement on that.  I just would like to maybe suggest as a friendly point.  I think that we're not going to be doing a firm amendment to tabling it, that when we do discuss this again,  we do have a proposal from Community Development and Public Works Department on the best use of the funds for parks and housing.  So, we're not looking at this in the abstract the way we are now, but with firm proposals from staff.  May I have a question?  Hold on a second.  Let's see if you accept this amendment.  No.  No?  Okay.  Madam Clerk, would you reread the motion?  The motion was to table it until the election.  Okay.  I should have held it during the normal budget cycle.  Okay.  Approved it, June.  And that was seconded.  The end is in May.  The end is in May.  Approved it, June.  Well, can I make a substitute motion that we table this until January and we come back with proposals from Community Development and Public Works Department for use of funds towards parks and housing?  That was a question.  Yes, you can.  I'll second your substitute motion.  Okay.  We just want to comment on the substitute motion.  So, we're going to wait a month.  We don't have all the data, so it's actually a worse than coming from court, ahead of time.  It's all right.  I don't know if that makes sense, but we're going to have more information than – – than  and we're going to have proposals for use of the funds,  but you're saying we'd have less information.  Why don't you have more?  Not less than that.  You'd have to have...  And then you're going to ask to have on top of all the other things  that you're asking to do.  All right.  So we will...  Go ahead.  Are we having a conversation or are we having a...  Call it off.  Call it off.  Go ahead.  All right.  I have a question.  So since the two motion lists to table,  and that's on January 5th,  are there other departments in the list?  Do you want to dive into that?  Well, parks, division, within public works,  maintenance, department, and community development.  So it's just parks and...  Parks and council.  Parks and community.  Right.  Okay.  And that was the substitute motion.  So on the substitute motion, Council Member Bennett?  No.  Council Member Morgan?  No.  Council Member Van Rylbeck?  No.  Council Member Winfield?  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds?  No.  Mayor Privilege?  Aye.  It tables two to four.  All right.  So going back to the motion, the original one, which was...  Wait, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  It's a little bit of a...  I know.  It's a little bit of a jump, but it's a jump, but it's a jump, but it's a jump, but it's a jump, but it's a jump, but it's a jump, but it's a jump, but it's a jump, but it's a jump, but it's a jump, but it's a jump, but it's a jump, but it's a jump, but it's a jump, but it's a jump, but it's a jump, but it's a jump, but it's a jump, but it's a jump, but it's a jump, but it's a jump, but it's a jump, but it's a jump, but it's a jump, but it's a jump, but it's a jump, but it's a jump, but it's a jump, but it's a jump, but it's a jump, but it's a jump, but it's a jump, but it's a jump, but it's a jump, but it's a jump, but it  Boy, has this been a fun night.  All right, reports and communications.  The following reports and communication items are provided for the council's information.  No action can be taken on items under this section of the agenda unless the council agrees to include it on a subsequent agenda.  City Manager's Report.  Mr. Schoens.  No.  All right, item 6.2 are the monthly financial statements that are attached for informational only.  Item 6.3, Council Member Request Pursuit of APMP 1010.  Council Member, as we were in the request, the item would be agendized for the future meeting after stating what the item would be.  A majority of the council is needed in order for staff to agendize.  Do we have any Council Member Requests?  Vice Mayor.  I would like to agendize a conversation about mobile home parks and see if there are ordinances that could possibly apply for our community.  Just on mobile home parks.  And I'll second that, if you didn't hear that.  All right.  I'll motion to second.  Council Member Bennett.  Yes.  Council Member Martin.  Yes.  Council Member Bannon-Probat.  Yes.  Council Member Winslow.  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds.  Aye.  Mayor Kulish.  No.  Council Member Strybon-Glenaston.  Yes.  Council Member Winslow.  No, that was it.  That was my discussion.  Oh.  Yeah.
