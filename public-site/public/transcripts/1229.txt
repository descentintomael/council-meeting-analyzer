of the agenda how many speakers do we have we have three all right three minutes so i'll call the first two names and if you can line up in the middle aisle nicole nava followed by beau powell good evening council um i am here to talk about the budget agenda and i'm going to talk on this item about resources the allocation of resources um i haven't been at some of the meetings and but i have been reading about them and one thing in particular just rubbed me a little bit raw which was a discussion that was had on um maybe deferring some road work to try and get i believe it was something like an additional engine and additional staff over at fire station one we all know i'm a heavy public safety supporter and all that so not to take anything away from that group um but what i'd like to point out is once again like beating a dead horse sorry but we do spend an inordinate amount of our general fund other things that come into our community serving a population that hovers around one thousand people we have what like a hundred twelve thousand i don't even know it's somewhere around there and it's just very concerning to me to see what happens to the people who are important to me that like when things with the road do get done it tends to be on the major thoroughfares which is also important but people have been waiting for literally decades for residential areas to get done i was super happy to see real lindo that was a major thing well done public works and other people and the contractor but i would like to see us really dig in in neighborhoods where we people can really feel the fruits of the labor people got together and against all odds passed measure h and i think they would like to see you guys do the will of the people on the platform that everybody spoke to and where those funds would go so there's that i also would like to be a proponent for having good healthy nice activities continue in the park i've been super thrilled to see cards step up and others it's been so refreshing on my evening walks to see healthy activities and i think that's something that we activities kind of counterbalancing some of the negative activities but we still have issues there that i would love to see addressed so again as you move forward and you're moving through things and you talk about realignment of some of the things in the budget in the future if you could just really think about all those people in the tiki-taki houses that have been waiting a really long time to have smooth roads i sure appreciate it thank you so much for your time as you know i've been here quite a few times about the spraying and stuff that you say is obvious jurisdiction um in 2014 i ended up moving into chico because of all the seizures i was having from the chemicals the bad commissioner was allowing farmers to spray our neighborhood with a neighborhood full of sheriffs public employees and the employees retired teachers retired chico state people in low employees so i came into chico here and i started coming to city council meetings nobody paid any attention to me just like then just like now and um i've been going to the doctors and they were giving me all kinds of drugs to to try to stop the seizures all kinds of mental health drugs i got the reports they were over drugging me and stuff and i ended up calling the city clerk a lot and they arrested me for annoying phone calls but in my mind that was the only way i was going to have any proof that i was trying to do something 20 20 years now, 20 years ago, they started using methyl bromide again. You know, Deborah Lucero sat next to me at the county meetings. And then when we went to the Tuscan water things, she heard what I said to the county supervisors. And she apologized to me for what's happened to me. I called Todd Kimmel's shoe and told him that she apologized to me, and he went bananas. He told me that they haven't used chemicals, that chemical, for wrong information. You know, I had the act commissioner saying they used it since then. We need people to respect each other. Three of you went to the Pyre Academy. The North 41 Fire Station gets sprayed all the time by farmers. They can't sell their nuts unless they spray those firefighters. There's no blue line. There's a bunch of dots. Cops need to stand up and say, respect my community. Respect my coworkers. You all need to do that. Respect my children. Thank you. Thank you. And our last speaker is Bill Monroe. Hello, Madam Chair. Bill Bennett and all y'all. I just came here to real briefly just bring up that Julian Zener had a wonderful letter to the editor the other day talking about the Galeri Grail cancer screening test. And I think that he sent that to each of you. I hope he has. The thing that he... The thing that he missed in his letter was the risk that that test places the city in. If folks go once a year, $265 paid for by the city to get this test done, because they're exposed to awful things as firemen and police, it's logical that they will say, oh, well, I must be free of cancer. And thereby avoid... And thereby avoid other legitimate testing, such as colonoscopy that Tom Van Overbeek brought up in the last meeting. And if they do that, what they could then say, if a few years down the road, oh, well, I didn't get that, those normal tests, because I had the Galeri Grail test. And they'll turn around and sue the city. That's all I have to say. Thank you. Thank you. You still need to grow your beard back. I just don't recognize you. It's good to see you. Okay. Public hearings. Appeal of the Airport Commission approval of the minute order of 125 lease of real property at Lockhead. Spelled appeal. So, first of all, we will have ex parte communications, if any. The staff report is up to $15. Council discussion and or question is 10 minutes. Open hearing for the public input, no more than 50 minutes. Additional, the appellant has 15 minutes. Speakers have 30 minutes. And then the appellant rebuttal. We'll close the public hearing and then council discussion motion vote 20 minutes or longer as determined by the council, just so everybody knows what the rules for an appeal are. So, we will open the public hearing. So, I did want to do exactly what you just said, Mayor. Ex parte communication. I did have a discussion with Mr. Speltz, the appellant. And, Madam Mayor, I also had a conversation with City Manager Sorensen, Director Gustafson, and Mr. Speltz. All right. Can I ask a question of the clerk? In ex parte communications, if I talked to the City Manager, a member of the City staff, about a matter, does that need to be disclosed? No. Thank you.

Quick overview of the presentation I will give will show the area of 100 lockheed what constitutes a legal lease for the city, a timeline of what transpired over the last few months, options provided to the appellant Mr. Mark speltz, reasons for the arrow flight lease, the new leasee that we would like to go with and the city attorney review of the situation or the scenario. So this is 100 lockheed that's an aerial of the airport you can see it with an arrow there delineated it's office and hangar space at the very end kind of the cul-de-sac of lockheed avenue on the restricted area the ramp space so pretty sought after space because it has direct access to the airfield and restricted area. Here's a street view of it the photo on the left is the office space and the hangar in the background this is from the parking lot of the facility and the photo on the right is from the airfield the ramp space of the hangar space that's included with 100 lockheed. So an appropriate lease in the charter requirements are delineated here I know this is a busy slide but I kind of wanted to go through it so everybody is aware of what constitutes a lease by the city of Chico. City of Chico charter section 641 states in pertinent part that the purchase or lease whether a lease or leasee of real property shall be approved by the council except as otherwise provided in this charter section 1007.1 of the Chico city charter otherwise provides in pertinent part that the airport commission shall have the following powers and duties. B the power to enter into leases and contracts in connection with operation of all the facilities and properties of all airports and airport properties belonging to or under the control of the city of Chico. City of Chico charter section 1111 states that all contracts shall be in writing approved by the city attorney and executed in the same excuse me in the name of the city by an officer or officers authorized to sign the same. Adopted budget policy G.8 states that all new leases of city property with a cumulative term in excess of five years shall require All airport leases must be reviewed and approved by the airport commission. Again all airport leases must be reviewed and approved by the airport commission. Here is a bit of a timeline for the lockheed scenario. In 2021 mark speltz entered into a valid lease with the city of Chico for the space. Leased it for four years. In early 2024 speltz requested the lease with Dawson Taylor aviation services. Providing helicopter maintenance and a flight school for helicopters. In 2024 that lease was signed over so it superseded that lease with Dawson Taylor then superseded the speltz lease. It wasn't finalized since the airport commission meets quarterly wasn't finalized or formalized if you will until October. That's officially when the Dawson Taylor aviation lease for 100 lockheed was executed. In late November Dawson Taylor decided to reduce their size and actually move to a smaller facility at another airport ranchero across town and ultimately and unfortunately defaulted on the lease. In fact they still owe some money on the last month or so of lease. In November that same period of time speltz discussed the desire to release the hangar with airport manager tom barr which barr verbally supported however no lease was moved forward and At the same time, aerial firefighting company aero flight engaged executive staff and tom barr regarding the need to expand their footprint at the airport and they needed something quick and significant and then learned that the 100 lockheed spot was available so they could move to the next airport. Staff at that time recognized the significance of an aero flight expansion at chico regional airport and you will see later in some slides. It's for parts storage, parts and service aircraft storage, aircraft self storage, support and the potential for manufacturing sector jobs to retrofit some of their aerial firefighting airplanes 8400s that they primarily use at this facility. We have a significant scenario to have aero flight expand their footprint and operation if you will at chico regional airport. So pretty important to have that happen. However, we also do not want to put anybody out on the street. Mr. speltz has been a fantastic general aviation tenant at the airport, been an airport member for many years and a big contributor to the community. So once we made the decision to go another direction, we did our best to find some options for Mr. speltz to store his aircraft. So we provided two other options for him to store his aircraft. January 2025 speltz reoccupies the hangar without a lease or authorization. Early 2025 and ultimately in April with accordance with the proper lease formation procedures the airport commission approved minute order to execute a lease for allocated to aero flight incorporated for aircraft parts storage, aircraft aerial firefighting and retrofitting and aircraft storage. In May speltz appeals the airport commission's decision and minute order and here we are tonight June 17 to hear the appeal. So again, there is some significance in approving aero It is staff's objective and our duty to find the highest and most intensive use of airport property. Since I have been in this role for the last ten years we have done everything possible to make sure the airport fund is fiscally sustainable and will continue to be successful for long-term and we are looking for that long-term sustainability and that is how we do that with the We are looking to find the highest and most intensive use for all of our airport properties. Again, we have a very successful general aviation membership out there and we do not want to put anybody out on the street and have the utmost respect for Mr. Speltz and all he does for the community. We continue to offer two options for hangar space, one in E row on the south end hangars and one on B row. So again, just to kind of reiterate For the aero flight lease, the engaged city staff late December looking for available space to expand, support their aero firefighting efforts in California, the west coast, nationally and even globally. Aircraft with parts and service, store aircraft at the facility, potentially grow their manufacturing division that retrofits new and used aircraft. Staff recognize the potential of a much higher and more intensive use of We also hire lease revenue. This lease with aero flight is a 73% increase compared to the previous lease. So we are going from 3,000 per month to 5,200 per month with escalators in year three of the first five-year term. That is just an aerial shot of the space that aero flight wishes to lease from us. The southern area is the facility They have a lot that they wish to store aircraft parts in and then they want to lease a pretty significant spot of the ramp for aircraft storage. This is their existing facility next door to 100 Lockheed. This is 77 Piper. These pictures were taken today. At any given time that is their a400 aircraft, their flagship aircraft of their aero firefighting expand and lease the 100 Lockheed space would support this aircraft operation out of chico regional airport. City attorney review, the lease was terminated in 2024 at Mr. Speltz's request. The purported lease for the hangar space with Mr. Speltz is invalid and not enforceable against the city because it was not in writing, not approved by the city attorney, not signed by the airport commission. Even if the airport manager were authorized to sign the purported lease it is still invalid because it was not in writing, not approved by the city attorney and not approved by the airport commission. Therefore it is my recommendation the city council deny the appeal and pass a resolution of the city council of the city of chico denying an appeal and upholding the airport commission's approval of the lease of airport hangar space known as 100 Lockheed to aero flight inc. I can answer any questions at this time. All right. Any questions from council of staff? Council member Van Overbeek. So, Mr. Gustafson, when I the new council was seated one of the new members asked me can you rely on what the city staff tells you? And I said almost always. And that particularly applies to you. However, I have some I think there's some things that you left out the staff report says claims he has a lease based on verbal communication but there's more than verbal communication. So on November 6th, Tom Barr sent a note to Mr. Speltz saying describing the insurance requirements and said hey they'll be in the lease. On January 21st of this year he sent a note to Speltz in a conversation they were having about the lease. Mark Speltz asked him do I have the lease so Tom Barr sent an email back and said yes it's yours I agree they can sublease from you. The concept was that Speltz has the lease and he agreed he would be happy to sublet to Aeroflite for whatever space he didn't need. The city also cashed his rent checks I've seen copies of January, February, March, I don't know what happened after that, as well as paid the utility bills. So would you if you can't expect the tenant to understand the city's approval process and if the airport manager says yes it's yours any reasonable person would think that the city was going to grant them a lease particularly when they had a lease before and there was two years remaining on that lease. Where do I have, where am I wrong here? No you're not wrong and that's where it's a very tough situation. And you know these difficult situations come up from time to time and it's a tough decision and Tom at the time did not have the authority to approve a lease. No I know that but there's no way that Mr. Speltz would know that. Well anybody in commercial or residential real estate knows that if you're leasing or renting something it's not valid until you have a contract signed and executed. Well right and he was in the process of doing that but then the Aeroflite guys came in so listen we all want Aeroflite in there. We all want the highest and best use but that is secondary to the city keeping its word and to me that's the issue is the city going to keep its word or not. Yeah and real quickly and I'll pass it to the city attorney. Yes the city you know our word is extremely important and I will say that our change of direction was quickly communicated to Mr. Speltz right around the same time. Granted yes Tom has a great working relationship with all tenants out at the airport and so when somebody talks to him informally sure it's hey yeah they've defaulted on the lease at the moment we don't have anybody else looking at it sure it could be yours but then you know several days later somebody else with a much higher and more intensive use a lot of longevity to fiscal responsibility knocks on the door we have to weigh that until something was executed we're still weighing that and again we have the utmost respect for Mr. Speltz and that's why my direction was to find him options and we've located two options for him to store his aircraft not as big as the existing facility totally understand that but in a context of the conversation that I had with him verbal conversation primary objective was ultimately to store his aircraft and we've provided two options to do that so agree it's a tough situation it's not tough it's very straight forward well they come up at times and we have to make tough decisions and our decision is really for the fiscal sustainability of the airport and to bring manufacturing jobs into the community so I understand the situation if I may so when we told Mr. Speltz that he did not have a lease did we continue to accept his lease checks he occupied the facility so those checks were cashed by finance January February I think maybe March to January February for sure but after that as this really ramped up and moved forward we stopped cashing those checks was there a discussion about not accepting those checks since we took the position that this was not an authorized lease correct yeah at that point when did we notify him that the lease that there wasn't a lease there wouldn't be a lease my official notification to vacate the premises is March by the end of the month in March but Tom started to have those conversations that hey we were considering another lease and going a different direction in January in January Mayor and Council thank you for the recognition Miss Mayor just one second yeah so there's clearly been a significant lapse in communication here which you've already addressed I'm just curious moving forward have we altered our standard operating procedures with communication for tenants in the future so that this isn't a recurring issue absolutely yeah those corrections have already put into place and you know it's difficult you know Tom's in a position out there where he's engaged with airport tenants and it's real easy to have informal conversations and handshakes over certain things but any sort of lease is not you know we have to discuss that internally and make a formal decision internally and execute it appropriately and go through all the required steps discussed in the city charter great city attorney thank you Mr. Ryan thank you Mayor of State Council I did just want to correct one comment Councilmember Van Overbeck you mentioned the presumption that you know the public can't expect to know the city's process but the courts actually have held that a public a member of the public who enters into contracts with the city or negotiates with the city is presumed to know all of the city's procedures whether they do or not the law does presume that and puts the burden on the party that is negotiating with the city to understand the city's codes and laws and the rules of the city thank you for that but I still think it violates the spirit of the situation is that there was a commitment made to the man and we're reneging on it because we got a better offer that's the reality of it and I'm unhappy about it and it's great that action is being taken to fix that in the future alright any other council members I'll wait for the appellant to make his comments before I make further comments alright public hearing for open public input okay we have six speakers and Mark Speltz will go first and he will get 15 minutes that wasn't your timer you're good okay go ahead ladies and gentlemen of the council good evening my name is Mark Speltz my wife and I have raised three daughters in this town and we cherish the memories we have of Chico I'm a long time resident business owner I've served on several local boards I've been a member of the Chico Chamber of Commerce Peg Taylor Adult Day Care Center Budome Health Enloe Medical Center, Enloe Foundation Chairman of the Board of Enloe Health System and a founding member of the Chico Police Department business support team where we've raised several hundred thousand dollars for the Chico Police Department additionally I've been a pilot since 1976 and have hanged a plane at the Chico airport for the last 17 years I'm here tonight to respectfully ask the council to reconsider and overturn the airport commission's decision to not honor both my lease and the written not just spoken but written word and the agreement I had with the city briefly I'd like to cover the facts that led us here whether by design or oversight your report provided to you by staff doesn't paint an authentic picture and contains inaccuracies the first fallacy being my claim I still have a lease based on verbal communication I will show you I have written communication as well it was far more than just verbal and I'll clearly outline that for you as you know in the fall of 21 I saw a hanger from my airplane and approached the city's airport manager Tom Barr regarding 100 block heat the facility was in poor condition having previously been used for storage by air spray the attached flooded offices had last sheltered animals after the campfire despite the conditions we agreed to a long term lease and I began necessary renovations I've never vacated the building since that day during this time I offered the hanger offices for law enforcement K-9 training temporarily housed the Butte County Sheriff's helicopter all my improvements offices and my airplane remain intact on site and they have since day one having invested tens of thousands of dollars in the building I also sought to contribute to the airport community's success by supporting a young couple establishing a flight training and mechanic business I've also been a part of the airport community's success and I've been a part of the airport community's success they were struggling so in 2023 to ease their financial burden I requested and received the airport manager's agreement to transfer my lease to them resulting in a new agreement with the city and again throughout this period I maintain my airplane and offices in the building the situation took a negative turn on November 5th 2024 when observing the young couple struggles I informed the city airport manager of my intention to transfer my lease to them If you would like to have you look at item E this is a response from the airport manager asking is the hanger mine quote unquote yes it is yours if anyone is interested in using this space I agree they can sub lease from you Tom Barr this is outlined in the discussion area of your staff report and I quote Tom Barr did respond to Mark Speltz by email that he could have a lease for the facility end of quote in addition to affirming my lease both verbally and in writing the airport manager also provided a copy of the former lease along with the city's insurance requirements so I could abide by them by December 5th the couple confirmed their departure and the city's airport manager and I agreed on the terms of my new lease effective January 1, 2025 on December 22nd 24 I said I would like to send an email to the city's airport manager confirming the tenant's departure and my lease resumption following his return from vacation we reaffirmed the new lease I subsequently paid the January rent which the city accepted and cashed if you could look at item E please it's a copy of my check for January rent and you'll see that the city in fact did cash it on the week of January 12th the city's airport manager informed me that the city and Alicia Rock representing an outside company were interested in leasing my space seeking clarification I emailed the airport manager and on January 21st he explicitly confirmed the hangar was mine again refer to item E not much gray area based on repeated verbal and written assurances I paid $5,000 I received my February rent which again the city took the check and cashed if you look at item G that would be my February rent check cashed by the city situation then escalated when the city's airport manager informed me that the city had secured a new tenant and on March 10th issued me a 21 day eviction notice forcing me to increase my legal expenses that wasn't the only surprise coming more surprises despite of cashing my February rent check on February 25th at 1042 AM the city entered my hangar without authorization legally called trespassing my hangar I've paid rent I submitted a statement I submitted my March rent and on March 31st I received an invoice of all things from the city for April rent which I paid item K you will see the city of Chico sent me an invoice for rent for the month of April which I paid I paid all utilities sewer invoices other expenses and I received an email confirmation of my lease I just got to say these contradictory actions beg the question if I lack a valid lease why am I being billed for rent how is it the airport manager doesn't know the other staff are deal making at the airport how is it no one knows when offers or payments are accepted are these accidental omissions or otherwise as a small operator I recognize that the reliability of the airport's manager's commitments are crucial for the airport's stability and reputation if individuals and businesses cannot depend on these assurances it's going to severely damage the airport's ability to attract retain tenants along with airlines if the airport manager's verbal and written communication have no meaning where do we stop how about the finance manager how about the fire chief how about Billy the chief of police how about the city manager's word spoken and written and worthless my actions have been in good faith relying directly on the airport manager's title reputation and verbal and written assurances this trust led to a significant investment in upgrades to my airplane as well as the hangar with the expectation of a continued long term presence as an example recently last month I had to defer PG&E's request to the airport manager to house their firefighting pilots which we did last year and I had to tell them I faced potential eviction due to what appears to be a disregard for promises and integrity misdirection about the terms of my lease diversionary tactics regarding the timing and truth of the events that occurred and prioritization of legal maneuvers over ethical conduct this not only impacts me directly but it sets a dangerous precedent for current and future airport stakeholders if the city and their word cannot be trusted what are the long term consequences for the airport and for the city I have acted in good faith I respectfully request that you as trusted stewards of our airport and our city do what is right uphold the commitment made by the city airport manager allow me to continue my lease as promised preserving the integrity and trust vital to the Chico Regionals Airport at this time I would like to introduce my attorney Michael for his comments I would like to introduce my attorney Michael for his comments Good evening My name is Michael Shepard I've been an attorney in California since 74 been in Chico since 81 was general counsel for Aero Union was on the cardboard for 10 years in fact I think this space Aero Union even rented it from Fred Davis way back but at any rate what I found dealing with the city is the city always has a! So in this situation you got a long term relationship with Mr. Spells he's been leasing space out there for his airplane for over 20 years in 2021 he leased this space everybody knows who he is out there at the airport the city knew the airplane was still in the space he never went anywhere he never vacated the space he told the airport airport manager he was taking the lease back in my view that's a legal assumption and the manager agreed he accepted the rent everything's going forward then the city manager gets involved all of a sudden Mark is told oh well they were in default well there's there's default and then there's default and there's legal and there's legal yeah alternative spaces were offered those were not acceptable what we're asking the city to do or the council to do is to approve the appeal overrule the airport commission and honor the lease with someone who has had a long term relationship out there at the airport not to honor the lease would send the wrong message to all the airport tenants would be seen as a conscious disregard for the rights of my client it's not the way the city does business to have to end up in court where the determination is not preordained as this council knows well based on the lovely experience we've had with the homeless lawsuit thank you next speaker shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift Good evening, Council. My name is Philip Larios. I'm the President and CEO of the Hignall Companies. You might remember us as Hignall and Hignall for several years here. I state that just because I know a little bit about leases. I've done a few over the last few, several decades. The most important thing from my perspective is as we deal with leases, there's legal, yes, but there's also a word. There's also a bond. I have several agents and representatives in the field, and when they err against our policies, their spoken word means more than my policy. Unless it breaks the law, I hold them to their word, and I honor their word. And in this particular case, you have a representative in the field. He verbally and written, in writing, email, acknowledge a lease. In my book, that's a lease. I understand the attorney's legal words. However, a lease can be written on a napkin. It can be written on a piece of toilet paper. It can be written on just about anything. And in this case, it was an email. And it's an electronic document. And it's time-dated. So it's a lease. From my perspective. And I would honor it if it were my employee. That's all I have. Thank you. Stan Gungel, followed by Dan Jay. Hello. I'm Stan Gungel. I've known the Speltz family for a long time. Mark and I share a love of flying and their activities in general. Some 25 or 30 years ago, my wife and I offered to build 12 airplane hangars that the city of Chico had budgeted to build themselves to replace 12 existing hangars that remained on the north flight line of the airport. The city accepted the offer, and we built the hangars on Row Charlie, Row C, alongside our own hangar on Charlie 10. Excuse me. We offered the hangars for lease, to the public, and had them occupied by the second or third year. We collected money monthly from our tenants. As time passed, we would alert the airport manager or the designated official of who was leasing and the starting or ending date of the occupancy. We would pay the city annually for their fees on our properties. In all, it was a pretty low-key arrangement. Whoever was assigned to handle, the airport properties was the guy you worked with. Everything was up front. A few years ago, my wife and I quit flying and started selling our 13 hangars to private individuals. The last hangar was sold about a year ago. At no time was anybody involved except the airport manager. It was simple. Advise the manager, complete the deal, send copies of the sale to the airport manager. He would say, send it through the city system. That was it. In Mark's case, the city of Chico had an airport manager in charge of airport affairs. That person assisted in the transfer of these lease obligations to city individuals. The city cashed months of lease funds submitted in good faith. There was no reason to believe there was any problem, and he moved forward with good intentions to personally, make the Chico Regional Airport a progressive, better place. If the city was contemplating some airport growth plan involving this property, you would think the airport manager would be aware of said plan. If the city intended on granting a lease of this property to another party, the airport officer should have known these facts as well, unless the decision to exclude, Mr. Speltz, was made in lieu of an offer made by another party after the fact. In reading and listening to others orate this occurrence, it seems evident that any logical, intelligent observer would say, who dealt this mess anyway, that person or entity should have to answer for their clandestine attempt to thwart Mr. Speltz's lease continuation in favor of another party. That's time. Thank you. That's time. Thank you. That new improved property. Thank you. Okay, Dan Jay followed by Brian Baldridge. Thank you for the opportunity to speak on this matter. My name is Dan Jay. I've been a business owner and property owner at the Chico Regional Airport for 25 years. Eighteen years ago, I built 28 hangars and a two-story building. leased from the city. During the negotiations with the city, up to the date of construction, there were many things, many changes, that ultimately were reflected in the formal contract with the city. But it was the many conversations with city personnel upon which I relied that motivated me to move on with the project. In my daily life, and particularly in my business, my word is my bond. My handshake seals the deal, so to speak. More than once, I've had the opportunity to walk away from a handshake deal to accept an offer from another client that would have made me thousands of dollars more. Tempting? Yes. But morally wrong, and I would not do it. In the case at hand, you have Mark Speltz, a respected member of the board of directors and a member of our community, and an avid supporter of aviation. Mark made substantial improvements to the property, 100 Piper, that he leased in 2021. In 2023, he requested and was granted the request to have a second party assume his lease, under which, by agreement with that party, he'd still be able to house his airplane. But for what it took, for whatever reason, the new tenants did not follow through with their commitments to the city. Recognizing this, Mr. Speltz requested reinstatement of his original lease. He continued to be billed and paid rent to the city for months. He had the support and encouragement of the city's airport manager, Tom Barr, who, not with just conversation and a handshake, but even written communications, assuring him that the hangar would still be his. Mr. Barr's decision was a sensible one that should not even be challenged or criticized, and certainly not overridden. It most certainly would have not been questioned but for a second party allegedly willing to pay more money. If not made right, this is a moral issue that will be a black eye on Chico City management and will have negative repercussions for others seeking to move to our airport and our city. I implore you to do what is right. Reinstate Mr. Speltz's original lease not as a favor, but because it is the right thing to do. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Brian Baldridge followed by Peter Magnuson, MD. Madam Mayor, City Council and staff, my name is Brian Baldridge. I'm a longtime member of the City Council and a longtime resident of Chico. I've been associated with the airport since 1977. I was co-founder and former president of the Chico Air Museum. I worked for Air Spray for eight years. I've been a pilot and a mechanic around here for a pretty long time. In fact, I worked in this property hanger back in 1977. I was an apprentice airplane mechanic way back then. Also, I've dealt with Tom and former airport managers over the years and I've worked on a number of leases for the Chico Air Museum, etc. I do have a whole bunch of respect for Tom. He's not here today, but he's been great across the board in terms of his integrity and it's really been a blessing on the city what he's done to me. I also, Mr. Speltz mentioned that the condition of the property when he moved in was poor. I saw the condition of the property before it was leaseable, rentable at all, and it was extremely poor. There was dry rot, the roof was leaking, the toilets, it was unbelievable. Completely un-leaseable, un-rentable at all. Along comes Mark and gets things so it's up to snuff, it's actually occupiable. Henceforth, a bunch of income to the city since then. All the goodwill and everything that went along with it. Now, along comes the airport commission, this new potential leaser in the middle of it pulls the rug out from under what Mark's doing. I also would like to mention a little bit about Aeroflite being in the air tanker business myself for a while. Aeroflite currently, has it been a year or two since they started that lease? Or a union hangar? A year? Two years? It certainly seems to me every time I go by there, it's completely underutilized at all. They've just got some airplanes in there and that's it. I've never seen anybody up on a scaffold working. I'm not saying they're not doing it, but the offices, the number of people working there, I don't know what they promised you in terms of employees, but it's completely underutilized. And I'll also throw out the fact that there's a whole bunch of space on the flight line, vacant lots on the flight line, that they really turn out to be a big, giant tenant, lifelong tenant. It's a Canadian company, by the way. There's plenty of room for them to expand if they have to. I'd like to see this appeal be approved by the council and do the right thing. To me, it's kind of an unethical thing you're doing here and kind of mean, actually. Thank you. Our last speaker is Peter Magnuson, MD. Good evening. I thank the council for the opportunity to speak on behalf of Mr. Mark Speltz. I want to give a little different spin about this issue. I'm Peter Magnuson. I've been a practicing cardiologist and Chico resident for the past 37 years. I've known Mark for most of his time. I first got to know Mark when he and I served on the Enloe Board of Trustees about 25 years ago. During that time, we discovered our love of bicycling and proceeded to do some training rides together. Ultimately, this evolved to regular rides at 4 a.m. Riding up Route 32 fully ablaze with headlights and flashing taillights. Why did I do these crazy rides? In addition to the cardiovascular benefit, I trusted my partner. He was steady, dependable, and encouraging. I came to know that if we had a problem such as flat tire, rain, cold weather, or a fall, he was always there to bail me out. Furthermore, I had to get up at that ungodly hour because I knew he was out there waiting for me. I could not have done this training without him. We explored our riding further with rides across the states of Iowa, Nebraska, Oregon, and Colorado. I felt safe doing these sometimes exhausting rides because Mark was at my side. I trusted him. The peaks of our riding partnership were climbs on the Markleyville Death Ride, Alpe d'Huez, the famous climb on the Tour de France, and the most brutal ride we'd ever done, a stage of the Tour de France climbing the Col de Tourmant in the Alps. I was able to ride with Mark at the time of the! I felt totally safe because I was riding with Mark's belts. I totally trusted him at my side as my partner. My wife and I traveled by air with Mark and his wife. Mark was at the controls of his Twin Engine 340. We travel with him because we trust him. We trust his skill, his judgment, his word. In the end, the current conflict concerning the occupancy of the hangar does not appear, in my mind, to be about money. Rather, it appears to reside in the relationship and trust between the airport commission and Mr. Speltz. The city would do well to encourage, build, and support this relationship. They could not possibly have a better partner. Thank you. All right. That's it. You can close the hearing. Right. Close the public hearing. We get three minutes. Oh, if he wants a rebuttal. Mr. Speltz, would you like to rebuttal any of the wonderful things that everybody had to say about you? Did you really get up at 4 a.m. and do bike trips? I really want to know. You have three minutes, though. The floor is yours. We don't anymore, but we did then. Well, in closing, counsel, I feel the position you're in is a tough one. There's no question. I guess I'd focus on the fact that the airport manager gave me verbally many times and in writing that the lease was mine. I assumed that to be true. I paid rent. I paid it. What you've heard from the current airport stakeholders is a desire to keep intact the trust and integrity of airport operations for present and future stakeholders, including potential airlines. So I again request that you do the right thing and honor my lease. I'm more than happy to visit with Aeroflite if they want part of the hangar. That's been my intent all along, is to have some other people share the hangar with me. Happy to visit with anybody. So thank you again for your time and what you do. Mr. Sells, may I ask you a question real quick? I think we're all touched by all this and I think staff would also like to see something that would work out well for you. What's been the problem with the other hangars or the other spaces that have been offered to you to rent? I presently have water, electricity. I can't get my airplane in a hangar without electricity. There is no electricity. One of them is too small. It won't even fit in one of them. And have you discussed, you have discussed with Aeroflite about sharing the space? I have not. Okay. Just a concept. Yes. I also have a question if that's alright. So why did you vacate the first lease and then also then why did you want to return to that after it was vacated? Yeah, good question. Dan and Cheyenne, I was struggling to make ends meet. I was making a whopping $500 a month profit and I said that's $6,000 a year. That may keep them in business. And if I can save them $6,000 and have them stay in business, it's a win for the airport, it's a win for everybody. So that was the reason I said Tom, why don't you give it to them, they can save $500 a month. Hopefully it'll work. Well it didn't. Okay. Okay. And then why did you okay, but so you knew that the other hangers theoretically wouldn't work for you? Did you have that option at the time when you moved out of there to lease the to let the city release the hanger when you first left? Sorry, I can repeat that. That was convoluted. Yeah, say it again. Did you, the hanger that you are at now or that you've been offered, is that where you moved when you ended the lease of the Lockheed way? I never moved. My airplane, my offices have been in that hangar at 100 Lockheed since day one. Oh, okay. Even when the other business was there? Yes. Okay, good to know. Thank you. Council Member Van Overbrek. Mr. Speltz, so my recollection is that space is just under 10,000 square feet? Yes. And how much space do you need to park your aircraft? That means, sorry, that is the hanger space, the offices in addition to the parking space. 10,000, yeah. I don't know if Dan can tell you the size of the airplane. I know it doesn't fit in any of your . So 1,000 or 1,500, I mean? Probably more or less. Okay, and you indicated me in a conversation that you would be delighted to sublet what you don't need to Aeroflite. I just want to Anyone that, yeah, anyone that'll anybody that works. I've turned down about 15 people and I've added two. So you have other people who are subletting? I have people who want to sublet. Okay. But if in order to get this done, the city said to you would you use your best efforts to kind of deal with Aeroflite for the remaining, call it 8,500 square feet of hanger space, would you agree to that? Yes. Okay, thank you. Did you have a question? No. Okay. Thank you. I guess I actually have one other clarification. So you said that you never fully moved out of the hanger, but the other company took over the lease and you ended the lease. Why didn't you sublet in that situation? Just curious. I was subletting to them. Okay. But my understanding was that the lease was terminated that you had. It was terminated. I remained in the hanger. My airplane has been in that hanger since day one, regardless of who had the lease, whether it was me or whether it was Dawson Taylor. Okay. So part of my agreement with Dawson Taylor was I keep my office, I keep my airplane space, and a little niche back in the corner. Okay, then I'm confused. I guess there's just a difference in what we're considering subletting because it sounds like you were off of the lease in that situation, but you still had an agreement. So you were subletting from them, not subletting to them, correct? Both. Okay. Interesting. All right. Thank you. All right. Thank you. So, Eric, can you, for my edification, can you do that timeline? Can you put that back up? Oh, sorry. Because I think it's I mean, I think it's important for us to set emotions aside. It's important for us as a council, at least myself, to be sure that we're making the correct understanding also of the legal implications of what we're looking at as well as the our honor and word and all that good stuff. Absolutely. Here's the first section of the timeline. Speltz entered a formal lease in 2021. And then early 2024 is when he requested the lease be signed over to Dawson Taylor. And it was my understanding that, I think, to end important to answer Councilmember Goldstein's question, is Mr. Speltz subleased from Dawson Taylor to keep his aircraft in that hangar? Mayor Reynolds, have we opened to council discussion? Sorry, yeah, I kind of opened it back up. And that's what I asked Eric to come back up. I'm sorry. No, you didn't want to diverge. Just a comment to Mr. Sparks. I completely agree with your comment from earlier. You said this whole series of events is a disregard for integrity, and I completely agree with you. It's too bad that the city has fractured some relationships with someone who's had such an impact on our community. But it is the City Council's responsibility to remain impartial and unbiased representatives of the city. And I think it's important to take consistent action, whether or not it was a tenant who was a great person for the community or a menace to the community. And in this case, I think the law is clear. There is no other lease besides a true written lease. And unfortunately, it's going to take some corrective action in the future so that this does not happen again. But in my opinion, I do not think that an email suffices if the lease was officially signed over to Dawson. Council Member O'Brien. So this is both an unfortunate and problematic situation. Mr. Speltz is a wonderful member of our community. I have the utmost respect for him and what he's done. I thank you for that service, Mark. I heard terms, listening to everyone speak, I heard terms such as duty. I heard terms such as act honorably. I heard terms as our word. I heard this is a moral issue. I heard do the right thing. I Can we get away with this legally? Probably. We could probably get away with it. But we can be both legally correct and morally wrong. This written documentation, yes, it was in an email, did not come from an airport staff member. It came from the I have the authority to do that or not. He gave his word, he gave the city's word to Mr. Speltz. I, in good conscience, cannot go back on that word. That's our responsibility as a city. And I'm going to vote to uphold the appeal. Council Member Winslow. Yeah, there's unquestionable economic benefits to Aeroflot occupying that space. But it does strike me that the city's case here, that we can't do anything about it, but I do think it's a good thing. I think that we can transfer the space to Aeroflot. It is relying on a loophole and a technicality in the law. And I think that we do risk a lot down the line. I mean, there are severe repercussions to losing faith and breaking honesty. And it strikes me that the more honest thing to do here would be to honor Mr. Speltz's occupancy of the site, given the understanding, given how little has changed. I mean, it being an email, he had the lease before. The lease hasn't changed, right? It's only been passed from one person to another. So I think it was reasonable to expect that the city would resolve the city's part in it. I certainly, as a renter, would never expect to show up to my landlord with the lease. And so I think that it is just based on those values that I hold to move forward with honesty that, yeah, given our airport manager's communications, that's the right thing to do. Madam Mayor, are you... You can do whatever you want, Tom. Don't say it. I'll say that. Well, I have a motion that I think is a compromise that might satisfy if I can make that motion. Unless, Dalia, something you want to say? I also have a comment, too. Let the two comments go, and then I'll let you take it away. How about that? Thank you. I've been in commercial property management all my whole life. And I've been fortunate that I've never had to address a situation like this. And it's very awkward. I can feel my emotions on this one because I know you. And I also know the law. There is no lease. But there's other considerations. So, thank goodness I never got myself in this situation as a landlord's representative. So I'm not sure what I'm going to do. But I'll make up my mind in a minute. Council Member Goldson. Yeah, I've been pretty unsure this whole time. Actually, thinking about it, I had one more question for Mr. Gustafson on the timeline. So there was the email that basically had the written statement that said, you know, yes, you have this. And then exactly how much time elapsed from that to the other company, Aeroflate, getting the Yeah, it was immediate. Really parallel at the same time. And granted, Tom Barr made a mistake by having those informal conversations and in an email saying that it's yours. And I'll add that no lease was executed or approved from there forward. But Aeroflate engaged us right away looking to expand and expand their operation at the airport. And so my understanding, I instructed Tom to say, hey, I know you've had some discussions with Mr. Speltz on reassuming his lease, but we have this opportunity with Aeroflate that we need to explore. So my understanding, Tom communicated that right away with Mr. Speltz the first part of the year. So sometime in January, late January, February. Yeah, that's really interesting just how short that timeline was. Yeah, my comment is just that this is an incredibly hard decision for me because when we're just looking at the legal matters side of it, like, I'm actually, I guess, surprised that we're tasked with kind of determining the legality here because this feels like something that would be determined by a judge. I mean, you have a written communication saying you have this space, rent it basically, and then there's the legal written lease and as somebody who has rented many places, I'm like, well, I would never assume that a landlord saying yes, you have the house means that I have it until I have signed that thing. But there are many types of leases out there. sounds like Katie has a comment. Councilmember Holly. Since I know that some council members have not made up their mind, I just want to urge consistency in decision making. I don't think that it makes sense to simply go with what some staff members, such as the airport manager, says. You know, when other staff people mess up, it can be very embarrassing to the city. It can fracture relationships, but I do think that we need to be consistent in our decision making here. Like Ms. Goldstein just said, as a renter, I would never enter into a home without an official lease, and I don't think that should change whether you're renting a commercial property. Councilmember Van Oberbeke. Thank you. I want to reiterate something that my colleague Councilmember O'Brien said, and that is just because something's legal doesn't mean it's right. It doesn't mean it's moral. I have extensive experience both leasing as a renter and being a landlord with commercial property, and I have never had a situation where there was a somebody who looked like they were authorized, in this case the airport manager, to make a commitment where they've gone back on it. I mean, it's never happened to me. Just like Dale and I are about the same vintage, and it hasn't happened to him. So, the second point I want to make before I make a motion is we've had speakers up here testify to Mr. Speltz's integrity, and I'd also like to point out he makes a living managing people's retirement money, so if that doesn't make a testament to what a trustworthy person he is, I don't know what could. So here's my motion. Move to grant the appeal and instruct staff to renew the lease to Mr. Speltz under the same terms and conditions as the previous lease, but ask Mr. Speltz, and he's told me he would do this, that's parenthetical, Debbie, to use his best efforts to arrive at a sublease with Aeroflite for the space he does not require. I'll second that motion. So, sorry, just for clarification, that would be to re-enter into a handshake agreement? No. Mr. Speltz has a lease, to renew the lease, whatever the legal term is, that already exists, there's two years remaining in it, it's a five year lease, but that he promised us, which he has said to me, that he will use his best efforts to arrive at a sublease with Aeroflite for the space he doesn't require. So remember it's 10,000 square feet roughly, he's going to need 1,500 or 2,000, so Aeroflite can get 80% of the space, in theory, but remember, Mr. Speltz has a lease, that is up to him, but if he says he'll work to make that happen, I believe him, and you should too. My only concern with that is that instructing staff to have it on the same terms, I just don't know if things have changed. Well, that means that the rent, that the staff could come back and say, hey, we don't want this guy in here, we're going to triple the rent. Or, so I'm saying it's under the same terms and conditions, so it expires when it expires. He'll, till the end, of the lease, not for another five years. Yeah, and it also provides for two two-and-a-half year options to renew, and whatever the formula was for the rent. Mr. Lamb, can you? Yeah, Mayor, Council, I just wanted to make a couple comments. First, I think with respect to the decision on the appeal, that's before you tonight, it's relating to upholding or denying the appeal, right? So, what my recommendation for that is, I think I kind of see where this is going, is that my recommendation is you direct, you provide us with the direction, typically for denials, we'll bring back a resolution at the next meeting on consent, consistent with your findings tonight. And that's then on consent, the resolution will be presented back, it gets approved formally, therefore, there is a record of your denial with finding, or of your upholding with findings specific to the resolution. With respect to the lease agreement, the direction I think is to bring it back to staff to negotiate, and then take it back to the airport commission with direction from council here. The key is, we really want to make sure that any subsequent agreement is lawful on both ends, and we've already indicated the issues with the process that the prior negotiations went through. We should bring it back and make sure we follow that process. Airport commission should review, approve, and authorize specific, you know, city staffers to approve and sign the agreement with my signature as well. If I may, can I play this back? Sure. So what you're saying is we should either approve or deny the appeal now, and then refer back to the airport commission to work out the lease deal with Mr. Speltz? The normal process, yes. But going back to that first part, direct staff to bring back a resolution consistent with your finding tonight. Got it. So I want to be clear, are you saying that we should not uphold the appeal? Isn't that what this whole thing is about? Yes, you would be upholding the appeal, and you would be directing us to bring a resolution. I wanted to clarify that because I didn't hear that just now. Thank you. Uphold or deny the appeal is our options. Okay, so do you want me to restate my... I got it. The city clerk says she's got it. You got it. Okay. The motion has been adjusted based on feedback from the city attorney. Right? So it's, right now I have to a motion to to uphold the appeal and direct staff to bring back a resolution consistent with findings specific to the resolution. The lease agreement that you're talking about in regards to the terms would go back, staff would take that through the normal process with the airport commission. Sounds good. I will just say that while I value honesty very highly, I'm also okay with applying some pressure. I think it's important to the city that Aeroflite is able to use the space they can, and our next meeting is in a month. And we would have to approve this finally for it to come into effect. And we always could reconsider our decision. But I'll support it now. I'm very conflicted on this one. But I think that if there's a way that we can get an outcome that benefits the most parties as is the motion, then I'll tentatively support that. But I think we do need to make sure that we're being very careful in the future about how we move with leasing our spaces. Can I just ask one quick question? Can you, at this point right now, there is no lease on that space, correct? That is the city attorney's office's position. The city attorney's office position is right now there is no lease on that position. And we have not been accepting rent there since the spring, March-ish, right? Correct. Okay. There was a lease that was transferred to another party. It was almost transferred back, but not for the lease. That lease still exists with those conditions in that timeline? Getting hung up. Mayor and council, I recall that there was communications where I think the question was whether does Mr. Speltz assign his existing lease to the new tenants? And I think the response was no, have them have their own. And that is clear direction as, hey, we're terminating ours, go enter into a new one. And so I think your decision though, besides the legal, financial things, justification. I think there is equitable concerns that the council has and maybe that Mr. Speltz has some equitable rights that you feel are relevant here. So if I can just make an observation, we have a motion and a second. I agree. I was just asking for clarification from the attorney whether we have a lease right now or not before I make my vote. And who is the second? I will call for the question. I didn' t hear the second. Councilmember O'Brien did. I will call for it now. Sure. Councilmember Goldstein. Aye. Councilmember Hawley. No. Councilmember O'Brien. Yes. Councilmember Van Overbeck. Yes. Councilmember Winslow. Yes. Vice Mayor Bennett. Yes. Mayor Reynolds. No. It carries 5-2. With the resolution to come back on consent. All right. And we're going to take a quick break before we go to our next appeal if that' s okay. Get the door and come in. All right. Item 4.2. Hearing resolution on mending the city' s fee schedule. Looks like we have. Ms. Childs from accounting on this. Good evening. Good evening, mayor and council. Ms. Childs isn' t able to be here tonight. I' m going to take this one. At the city council meeting of May 6, the city council conducted a public hearing regarding our annual fee increases for various fees throughout the city using different inflators that were already predetermined. One of those inflators was the highway construction cost index. And that was set to increase the fees that were subject to those by 23.4%. Those fees being the transportation facility fees and storm drainage facility fees. At that meeting the city council directed staff to bring those fees that were subject to that increase back to the finance committee for further consideration. And we did that on the May 28 finance committee meeting. At that meeting the finance committee recommended that we use a rate of 3% for those fees in the fee instead of the 23.4% so before you tonight are the amended fees with that 3% inflator and we' re here to have the public hearing for those fees if they are approved as is they will be implemented in approximately 60 days and I can take any questions. any questions for staff from council? council member holly. at the finance committee meeting where this decision was made I think staff did make a suggestion that in the past because the index can be so volatile in certain years previous councils have directed or made the decision for those development impact fees to not only take into account some decreases from previous years but also to be spread out in future years. so I think that' s still an option on the table? as far as the municipal code is written there' s no provision for decreasing fees when the inflators go down however when they do decrease we keep the factor for inflation at the previous rate so that when we do we can have a smaller spread than if it had gone down. there is consideration for those decreases in the long term. what we encountered this a few years back with the construction cost index where that index which is a little bit more subject to economic drivers earlier than the highway construction cost index that was set to be increased quite a bit and at that time we the middle and did half of the increase at that time and then the next year you still see the impact because you have to keep that where you are at the time that you made the increase it made a bigger increase the second year but it was spread over a longer period of time. thank you ms. martin. any other questions for ms. martin. I will take the floor and then we will move on to the next item. martin. ms. ms. ms. ms. ms. ms. ms. ms. Highway Cost Index, or the HCI, amounted to an increase in the transportation fee for a three-bedroom, two-bath home of $3,000. And for the storm drainage, it would be an increase between $3,000 to $6,000 per developed acre. For a 5,000-square-foot restaurant, for example, the fee would have gone from $138,000 to $170,000 under the 23.4 increase. But CBA, we look forward to discussing later this year when the NEXUS study gets underway regarding the actual use of the HCI index. But we're here tonight to say that we appreciate the Finance Committee's thorough and thoughtful recommendation to Council to increase the fees by the current Consumer Price Index, and I believe it was the one that you used in February, right? February or March, which was around 2.8, so we rounded it up to 3. So we hope the Council will support the Finance Committee's recommendation to increase the storm drainage and transportation facility development impact fees by 3%. Thank you. Adam Fidelling. Evening, Council. Mayor Reynolds. I would echo Ms. Toma's comments. I'm here as chair of the local... The local government relations committee, the Sierra North Valley Association of Realtors. I know that's a mouthful, but I would exercise... I would urge... Be conservative, you know, with development impact fee increases. Sounds like the city has already done that or is doing that, so continue on. Because every time a development impact fee gets increased, it gets passed on to the consumer. That's just reality. And continues to impact the affordability of housing in our community. I know we've got to pay for development, but you've got to consider the other side. Thanks very much. Thank you. And he was our last speaker. Thank you. All right. We'll close the public hearing. Any further comments or questions from the Council? So if I can, as a member of the... Chairman of the Finance Committee. So our thinking was... We had a couple of reasons why we recommended the 3% increase instead of the 20%. So we had a 23% increase. So first, we tracked the increases in the fees over the last five years, and they roughly tracked to the rate of inflation. And so when there was this 23% jump, there was an anomaly someplace. I still don't understand why it is. And we have a nexus review coming up in 26, where they're going to look at all the fees entirely. In the meantime, we decided to... Let's keep it consistent. We're consistent with the trend we've seen over the last five years or so. That's point number one. Point number two is we are very sensitized to the price of housing in Chico. Right now, if you want to build a three-bedroom, two-bath, 1,500-square-foot house, the fees, I'm trying to remember, are approximately $44,000. If this proposed fee increase had been approved, that would increase the total fees more than $10,000, about $5,000. And I just... If we have to do it, we have to do it, but I think there's a problem. And the third part of it is I talked to some of my friends in the building industry and said, okay, on this highway cost index, has there been any significant inflation in any of the component, you know, pavement, PVC pipe, labor, trucking? And they couldn't come up with any. That was abnormal. So the only conclusion... The only conclusion I could come to was that that 23% was an abnormality, and that's why we recommended 3%. Council Member Winslow? I have a hunch that with these, as with other impact fees, that we're dramatically under-collecting, and that means that we have to subsidize it some other way. The fact that we have that nexus fee update coming up soon, I think makes it more appropriate to, like, accept something like this, and then, you know, there won't be a dramatic impact if we really are off. But also, I just got to trust my finance committee, so thanks for looking into it. All right. If I may, just to provide a little bit more context, when Council Member Van Overbeek says we decided, I will point out it was a two-to-one vote. The reason that I didn't agree with the finance committee's overall assessment was that CPI reflects vertical construction costs. We're talking about HCI reflecting costs associated... associated with roadways. That's why it's Caltrans who is... is gathering this index. But I think that we also have to take into account, I completely agree with the Chico Builders Association, 23% is astronomical. That will absolutely have an effect on the consumer, but at the same time, the accounting doesn't pencil out if we don't have any funding, if we don't have any funding, for our infrastructure. So at the end of the day, I think that we can do better than 23%. I would propose potentially cutting this in half, maybe 10%, and spreading it out between two or three years. I think that would be probably a more equitable distribution for both the city and for the industry itself. All right. Thank you. Thank you. Consider... I'll just make a quick comment. I think this is wise council discretion. I want to applaud the Finance Committee for finding that wise discretionary solution to this. So thank you, Chair Tom, and the rest of the team. I'm going to support this. Just one more quick comment. I also want to put into context, we are reevaluating the increases of the development impact fees. Next council meeting to see that, when the index decreases, we can also decrease our fees with it. And the growth and development ad hoc committee, we did see at last city council meeting, they will also be working with city staff, such as Mr. Vig, to alter our development impact fees in the coming months. So a lot of good changes are being made. And I don't know that 3% is reflective of the costs that the city will incur. All right. Consider a motion. I have a motion. I would like to make a motion that city council adopt a resolution of the city of Chico-Meninga city's fee schedule as it was presented, which would include the 3% increase. Second. I've got a motion and a second. Okay. Council Member Goldstein? Aye. Council Member Hawley? No. Council Member O'Brien? Yes. Council Member Van Overbeck? Yes. Council Member Winslow? Yes. Vice Mayor Bennett? Yes. Mayor Reynolds? Aye. Carries 6-1. All right. 5.1, consideration of approval of South Park Drive conceptual design options. Mr. Ottoboni, public works and engineering. You're up. All right. Thank you very much. Good evening, Mayor, Vice Mayor, and city council members. Let me pull up. You can shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift That's where I will get in the next slide I guess but our primary objective and mission is to fix the road Currently we're in the design process with the expectation of going out to advertise for bid this winter so that construction would begin Next season next construction season so some context of where we're at in the process of project delivery and so One of the primary reasons we are here is several years ago. We had a consultant headway engineering a traffic engineering consulting firm look at circulation access and so on in Bidwell Park and One of the recommendations was to create a separated facility for bikes and pedestrians from vehicles and so at the time we as staff had talked with the Bidwell parks and playground Commission and in order to kind of really look at in more detail we need to do some engineering work to Delineate where the path could go for the separated facility So it took Us a while to get there, but ultimately we came back to city or to the Bidwell parks and playground Commission and in that time the council had taken action about looking at closing parts of Lower Bidwell Park to vehicles so through that we came up with a second option which is option two in the staff report to close off it South Park Drive to vehicles completely and so you wouldn't need to do the widening or anything like that The slide here it shows what the recommendations from headway were to create that separated facility So again subsequent over the last couple years kind of subsequent to some actions We were at the Bidwell parks and playground to consider this option And then again in parallel the council was considering the option of closing it to vehicles altogether Looking at collision data We really don't have a lot so there's not really like an existing issue necessarily The recommendation from headway I think mostly reflects just the best practice to separate those types of modes of transportation With bikes and pedestrians separated from vehicles So I just want to point out that it's not necessarily an existing safety concern. It's just kind of a best practice so what all that means is option one is again is reflective of the headway engineering report Again, the goal and objective is to fix the roadway But while doing so really a staff we're looking at ways to improve access for all of Chico plus visitors of that While trying to minimize impacts to the residents on woodland and also Centennial that's kind of further to the east there on South Park Drive So the main thing here again work in option one We're creating a separate facility to the parking lot and then we're looking at the! With the single direction the eastbound direction for vehicular traffic We've highlighted showing parking spaces based on Our understanding and view of the park that's used already for parking What we're trying to do is really just put barriers around Trees because a lot of times when you see vehicles parking there. They're right up against the tree wells or up against the Trunks of the trees so we want to create space because that's how you can damage and kill a tree And also kind of maintain some of that to be used for future parking Because you have the bi-directional path We looked at removing some of the parking on the north side of South Park Drive So that you don't have vehicles crossing over the bi-directional path to try and park the car So that's why we've shown in this option removing that That existing parking one of the other main features of this is moving the Sorry that's Went a little too far On the bottom there you can see is is relocating the driveway access to caper acres parking lot So currently when you exit the parking lot is one-way traffic for vehicles And then you have to kind of go to the east To leave moving this over in alignment with the existing parking lot allows for bi-directional access to that parking A lot so that you don't just have to go up South Park Drive to get into the parking lot You can go up Woodland use the street there Option two again kind of came about from council direction to consider and evaluate what it would look like to close it to vehicle Access so we added this idea in there from a engineering project standpoint This very much simplifies that there's no widening. We're simply removing and replacing the asphalt in kind We've shown this option and I'll explain a little bit more when we look at the cost The cost on option to show a little bit higher, but it's not necessarily an apples-to-apples Comparison as we added in paving of the parking lots Because of the savings of not having to widen and so we want to use that asphalt to eliminate or reduce ongoing maintenance costs and access To those parking lots So again option two is pretty straightforward the one real change on option two That we don't have an option one is by closing off South Park Drive to vehicles. There's one parking lot that does not currently have access to it and that's the sycamore field parking lot So we would need to create a new access point in order to get to that parking lot and those amenities near sycamore field so Again similar would be an option to realigning the main access point to caper acres So we originally went to the bidwell parks and playground Commission last month I believe for two months ago and through that interaction with the Commission The Commission recommended staff to reevaluate a third option and which is similar to option one, but rather than having the diagonal parking It was converting a lot of that space Removing a lot of those parking spots. Sorry to the west near Cypress Removing those from being shown on the plan and then converting some of the diagonal parking spaces to parallel parking So that was essentially option one and option three are similar with that slight difference there in the parking aspect ultimately the bidwell parks and playground Commission voted and recommended to City Council on option two shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift the parking lot and the parking as I mentioned we provide cost estimates it' s not really apples to apples option 2 you would think would be cheaper but again we added in other features like paving the parking lots and putting in permeable parking space so we added costs in there but again you can see the variance of costs for this portion of the project. thank you Mr. Chair. that concludes my presentation and I' m available for any questions. questions for Mr. ottomani? council member van overbeck? Mr. Ottomani if you did the same parking lot paving as in option 1 and 3 which I think was the most expensive option for when we had a conversation about this you said that would really save a lot of money and it came in as the most expensive option so I was confused. if you eliminated the paving of the parking lot areas you' d roughly be in the $1.2 million range I believe. it' s really not the most expensive it' s the second least expensive if we do the paving that way. does that assume that the parking lots remain the same size or that they' re expanded to compensate for losing the street parking? that would just keep the parking lots as is. at the bidwell parks and playground commission there was discussion about looking into the future kind of in a separate route expanding the one mile parking lot area into the old horseshoe pit areas. so that would be an opportunity to increase parking capacity. council member holly? there are a number of there might not be a clear estimate for this but I' m curious maybe our operations and maintenance department might have a better idea of how much time staff effort and money this might save in the long run to have those parking lots with the permeable pavement rather than keeping them gravel. the gravel component is severely maintenance heavy in all of our parking lots in the park. irreversible or regular asphalt we recommend that. it reduces our maintenance liability significantly. so despite being a seven to $800,000 increase cost it would still significantly be an investment in the long term. council member goldstein? I think I missed the figure of how much that would save or about how many years do you think it would take to recoup itself if we could get that I think it would take about five years to have the fancy or permeable parking surface versus leaving it as gravel. it' s hard to go back and factor the amount of hours we spend on each parking facility the frequency that we have to grade that and re compact it each year and look at fully burden rates but it adds up over time it' s substantial. the thing for us is we have extremely limited bandwidth in the park division so it' s really an opportunity cost to where we need those folks our maintenance staff doing other things in the park redoing the parking lots is very time consuming. we typically have to have folks from right of way division street maintenance division come over and assist so any time we could reduce that maintenance liability is the benefit for us. but are you is it I mean look you' re a very experienced guy is this five year payback or 20 year payback or to give us a sense of kind of horseback management or something like back guess of what you think the payback is? probably it' s accelerated probably five years. really? if we' re not having to perform those maintenance activities. that' councilmember holly was your question based upon just paying the existing spaces that are there now on the north side you' re not talking about removing them over? was that your question? yeah I' m talking in relation to I think it would be more expensive to add the permeable pavement to the existing parking lots we have which would in turn make them more accessible for people using mobility devices I believe compared to those gravel lots. thank you. if I can point out if they added the permeable paving to option 1 and 3 they would be even more expensive than option 2 right? correct. councilmember o'brien. first of all staff was given the impossible task I applaud you for taking this on utouch bidwell park and people are going to get riled up it' s the way it is and probably the way it should be I appreciate that. A better community but it makes it tough on you thank you for your work on this. A quick question I' ll hold some other questions about the horseshoe pits and converting some of those to spaces do you know roughly how many that would convert to? no we don' t. We haven' t done any layout or work on that. That starts to get into the scope creep aspect of the project and so we' re trying to keep it focused again the objective and goal and mission of the project is to rehabilitate the road and so that was where we came to the conclusion with the parks and the parks and the! We have 18 speakers. Are we at two minutes? That' d be two. Since it' been a long time. m going to get that. So what I' ll do is call the first two names like always and if you could line up in the middle aisle it would help it go a little bit faster. Logan Underwood followed by Jill Kirko. I apologize in advance if I don' t say your name correct. Circo? Okay. Thank you. Just one second. Oh, I'm sorry. It's not. I thought it went back to the screen. There we go. Let me start your time over. All right. Okay. I would just like to say that I think option two would be very nice for people who are, you know, regularly going to the park. I feel like the it feels like it would be good for like people that actually go to the park instead of making it more accessible for more cars. And I feel like as you create more space for cars, it creates a bigger need for the cars to get access to it. And you just slowly start creating more space for cars instead of having a park. And I don't know. I think Circo is pretty unique in how like there is like a very nice accessible, walkable park. And even like cycling. Like it's pretty amazing. And if there's a way to improve it and maintain it long term, I think it would be great. I think that would be a very good decision. Thank you. Thank you. Jill Circo followed by Elizabeth Griffin. Since I only have two minutes, I need to Go over to the speaker so everybody at home can hear you. Yes, you can pull the microphone down. Well, you know, when I hear people talking to this, I would just like to talk. Okay. Okay. Okay. Well, I won't use my mic. I'm going to use your voice. Since I only have two minutes, I need to get right to it. I strongly support option four. This started as a simple repaving and now it's turned into kind of a totally different animal. 95% of the time of the days of the year, there's absolutely no problem parking on South Park Drive. And I think that's a good thing. When there are occasional special events, the neighborhood has adjusted nicely to the additional cars. Utilizing the nearby streets and the additional parking at Chico Unified School District and at the Card Center, the additional parking there. If any additional parking is needed, it seems to be a good thing. It seems that it should be on the north side of South Park Drive. Maybe where the Horseshoe Pit area is, for example. Annie Bidwell stated specifically when she deeded the park to the City of Chico 120 years ago that the existing trees, shrubs, bushes, and vines should be considered sacred. And they should not be changed unless it was absolutely necessary. These parking, additional parking spaces, in my opinion, are not absolutely necessary. Replacing the natural environment with additional concrete seems totally against her wishes. I ask, what studies, observations, surveys, complaints, accidents, etc., have been investigated to warrant... That's your time, I'm sorry. Elizabeth Griffin followed by Nicole Nava. There has been no proof, no evidence that any of these improvements are needed except for the resurfacing of the pathways, the roadway in the park. And that is desperately needed. Anybody who is in there every single day, like I am, and several of the people who appeared here are, will testify to the fact that there's terrible potholes, there's dangers to people who are walking, there's dangers to people who are riding bicycles. We need to get those roadways resurfaced. If you spend the extra million dollars, which number three is going to cost, you are going to have fewer dollars to do the rest of the work that's necessary to make these roadways possible and usable for the vast majority of people. There's easy solutions to these problems that are more fiscally sound than wasting this money on something that doesn't need to be done. In particular, the re-placing of parking, taking these positions from the north side to the south side, there's no justification. I have read or heard nothing to explain why that is being done, why that would be necessary. By doing that, putting those parking places there, people who park there in the evenings are going to be blasting their headlights into the houses that line the street there, which I'm sure is going to affect their privacy and their comfort. I wish you would consider this and other people who are speaking are going to talk about other aspects, but I know that the vast majority of you are concerned about the safety of people. By marking pathways, by putting up signs for speed limits, by putting one-way signs when they're needed and making that more clear, that in and of itself will create more safety in the park. Thank you. Thank you. Nicole Nava, followed by Eric Booth. Good evening again. Getting to it, to me the data does not support any of the first three options at all. Option number four is what I would like you to lean into. I am here as an individual, not in any official capacity. I am a resident, full disclosure, of Woodland Avenue, so I just want to put that out there as well. However, I'm near the end, so a lot of the impacts of one, two, and three wouldn't necessarily be felt by my family, but I can empathize with those who this would have a major impact on. But, and I will say there's people who are making judgment calls about, oh, the headlights wouldn't be at the houses. I have pictures to show that's not true. There's hours when it overlaps where the headlights would be pointing straight at the homes. The aesthetics, like you come into the park, it is so nice to have green space on both sides and just, it's a calming effect. And speaking of calming, there's things we can do. So I am an advocate for repaving South Park Drive, as per the original plan, putting in calming things like speed bumps. Your real threat is e-bikes. I can't even tell you how many just on my daily walks where that is the problem. And there needs to be education there, right? But speed bumps would even help with that. You could leverage the parking lot along the third baseline for additional parking, were that a need. It's really not a need. I live right there, I see it. But if you really feel a burning need for additional parking, please don't remove the vegetation and put it on the south side of South Park Drive. Please look at probably 30 spaces could probably be picked up on that third baseline. Just throw up a big, nice, high foul ball fence, call it good. No one uses it. I've taken multiple pictures, multiple nights if you're interested, and there's been like most one car on that side. Just saying. So again, let's preserve the green space. It's a beautiful park. Thank you for listening. Thank you. Eric Booth, followed by Michael Vandermoof. Good evening. I'd like you to take a moment and think about how it feels centered at a crowded parking lot or a busy city. You may lean forward, turn the radio down, perhaps you put both hands on the steering wheel while doing what you can to limit distractions. While you may or may not be more anxious, you're certainly more alert. When driving through a park such as Bidwell, this is how you should feel when obstacles may jump into your path at any time that are the form of pedestrians. That anxious, alert feeling you get while driving in a crowded area protects you, and more importantly, it protects those outside of your four-ton metal cage. Driving tends to be a mostly autonomous action, something that is routine and mundane. The way we design our roads can have a great impact on whether a driver is alert or relaxed. This is why we'd urge you not to widen the roads in Bidwell Park. Not only will you take away precious, limited space in the park from pedestrians, you will also inadvertently encourage people to go faster. The more space you give to vehicles with less obstacles around them, the more likely you are to end up with a relaxed driver that is not paying attention. You can see this effect on other streets throughout Chico, such as 8th and 9th that run through residential neighborhoods, where people are comfortable driving 60 miles an hour on those roads. I've also seen people in their vehicles race their dogs down South Park Drive, hitting speeds that should not even be accessible while in the park. Bidwell Park should be a destination, the end point of your trip. It should be a breath of fresh air from the city, not an extension of its often chaotic, noisy roads. We should not be taking away space from families, young and old, and eager to revel in moments of peaceful nature. Cars should be sharing space, yielding to pedestrians, and should be going slowly as possible. The design should accommodate and make it difficult and uncomfortable to go any faster than the speed of the road. It should provide a safe and safe environment for the public to visit the park. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. south part drive. So I use the road for commuting and for recreation. I have some problems with option three which was the one that was suggested by the playground commission. Widening the road doesn't really make a lot of sense especially in that section from Cypress to the inlet for one mile. If anything that should be the one section of the road that's closed down to traffic completely if we don't go with option two. It's going to incur a lot of cost. It's going to make people drive faster. People are definitely going to ignore that two foot strip of gravel and they're going to be driving all over the place as fast as they can. So obviously it would be great to have the entire road close to traffic but I would suggest if we can't do that with option three adding in some modal filters maybe a bollard at the gate and a bollard near the inlet for the road. The inlet for the parking lot near one mile and just closing that section down to traffic. I think the park should be for people and not for vehicles. That's all I have to say. Thank you. Carol Whipple followed by Jeff Gladts. Yes, I've lived in Chico for many, many years and I live on East 3rd Street and I always go into town, into Mangrove by going down East 4th. Street and every time I get to the point where I can go into the park, my mind goes into the park between the two pillars that were there. And one was built in 1902, which was the year that my house was built, and the other one was 1933. And I'm speaking to option number four because I really think that the simplest thing is to keep it as simple as Annie Bidwell wanted it. And to me, it's like the gate into a magical place. And if I were going to Notre Dame, I want to go in the front door, I want to go in the side door. And I also want to say there was a time when someone all the way from England who was a Shakespearean thespian came there with two photographs and he wanted to find two things, the boulder that Little John was on and the log that the fighting went on, and he wanted to know where it was. Well, we told him we didn't know where the log was, but there were many boulders in the creek and we hoped he found it if he looked hard enough. But anyway, Bidwell Park is a wonderful place and I suggest that you really keep it as simple as you can. Thank you. Thank you. Jeff Glatz, followed by Bruce Burke. Mayor Reynolds, Vice Mayor Bennett, council members, thank you. And thank you for a couple of you guys who came and met me on location. I appreciate that. I got to have to speed through this. I would add, nice pleasantries for everybody, but as some of you may know or didn't know, I was on the park commission. I was on the park commission for eight years. And had I still been on it, it might not have the same recommendation, by the way, but just because I would have had a couple of things to say. What I wanted to talk about, you can hear about from everybody about the beautification of it and that's absolutely true, but I want to talk about the cause and effect of some of the things you're doing. So I made a little presentation about what happens if you put a different entrance onto Woodland Avenue, what happens to the traffic patterns around Woodland Avenue. Basically putting an entrance outside Sycamore Field will create Linden Street to become thoroughfare. That's a totally disrepair. It doesn't have sidewalks on half of it. Kids, probably 30 kids each morning, so 60 kids a day are walking down the street going to school. Creating additional traffic on that is a bigger public safety hazard probably than what currently exists in the park. Additionally, the way it was originally designed, 7th Street is 33 feet wide. Right now, Woodland Avenue is only 23 feet wide, so removing, closing off South Park and moving the parking onto Woodland also doesn't work. If you have two, if you park on both sides of Woodland, you've single lane of traffic, so that doesn't work unless you close off parking to one side. Every decision has ramifications outside of the park and those don't seem to be addressed. Linden is 28 feet. It's the skinniest street there. Sycamore, which currently was built 75 years ago, which is the other entrance to the west of Linden, is 32 feet wide. And then like I said, 7th Street, 33 feet wide. South Park itself is only 17 feet wide. And to go to what some people are saying, it should not be enlarged. You could actually take the 17 feet, make 10 feet a bike and car lane, and then 7 feet or do another foot pedestrian only and create the safety barrier you're trying to create while just repaving and not having to do any additional work. It accomplishes all the goals necessary. Thank you. Thank you. Bruce Burke followed by Kirk Mumford. Good evening, City Council. My name is Bruce Burke. I'm a resident of Woodland Avenue for over 33 years and have had plenty of opportunity to observe the comings and goings. I'm a daily user of the park, either cycling or walking a dog. And I have concerns about option three for sure. Also for option one and option two. I speak in favor of option four. I think that parking on the south side of South Park Drive is unreasonable. Number one, it's un-aesthetic. And people will not use those parking spots to walk all the way over to one mile. They'll try to get closer and if they can't get any closer, they'll move on with baby carriages and picnic supplies. I see it as a very difficult time. I think that the city has to do with the fact that there are a number of dog walkers and cyclists parking on Woodland Avenue and leaving their car there now because they feel it's more convenient to park there than in the park and it's also safer. The pavement, the plan was designed by a company that builds freeways on condemned property. This is a John Jewell of Chico. This is a Chico. I think we can do better. It would be nice to get a municipal or city park architect to give some input on this. I wish I had plenty more to say but the pavement I think is an issue and overdone with the plans. Thank you. Thank you. Kirk Mumford followed by Kathleen Gabriel. Thank you. You have the next question. You have the next question. You have the next question. You have the next question.

You have the next question. You have the next question. You have the next question. to see, instead of gravel, I'd like to see permeable asphalt. Because if it will save money in the long run or pay back in five years, I'd be in favor of it. But anyway, I'm not in favor of two-way bike paths anyway. I think they're just dangerous. And if there's oncoming traffic, I just take the lane. And that's the way it works. And I've never seen any conflict. I don't know. The only place that it strikes me as their conflict is when you turn off woodland into the one-mile parking lot. Because there's a whole bunch of bicyclists that exit there to go out Biff or out River Road, that area. And they leave. And when there's people trying to come in, there's a little bit of conflict. But that's usually early. It's about 10 in the morning. And I don't know. We seem to manage it. I've never seen a wreck in the park. Thank you. Kathleen Gabriel, followed by Ann by Kirk Kaufman. I'm here to speak on behalf of the Chico Heritage Association, of which I am the president. And we would like to speak for you to consider the historic. You gave us the full electoral significance of the entrance of the park on 4th Street. We also in favor of option 4 and not making any changes to the entrance and the exits. The history of the 4th Street entrance is documented as early as 1900 in local newspapers. For over 120 years, this is where the public has been invited to enter the park. In 1934, the four granite pillars were erected, to give tribute to Annie and John Bidwell and emphasize the welcoming entrance to the park. It was actually in the paper that they were going to give the desired and deserving dignity to Bidwell Park as well as honor the donors of Annie and John Bidwell. Anyone driving on 4th Street cannot help but see the 16-foot high pillars that are capped with wrought iron lamps flanked by 12-foot pillars also with wrought iron lamps. The pillars were designed by local stonecutter John Warren Robby, the son and business partner of the former mayor, William Robby, founder of Chico Granite and Marble Works, which began in 1879. For the last 91 years, these pillars have adorned the grand entrance and we, Chico Heritage Association, and the many citizens we represent, respectfully ask you to continue to keep that entrance and to continue to keep that entrance. The park is open so it welcomes visitors to the beautiful Bidwell Park. Thank you for considering our request. Again, we are for option four. Make it simple. Just fix the roadway. Keep the entrance and exits on the south side the way they are. They work really well. I'm in there every day, a couple of hours in the morning and in the evening. They work great. Let's just keep it simple and keep our park beautiful and honor the history. Thank you. Thank you. And by Kirk Kaufman, followed by David Welch. Hi, so I also ride my bicycle through that part of the park multiple times almost every day. I have a whole bunch of suggestions. One is if you continue to allow motorists to drive on South Park Drive, please add speed bumps to slow the traffic. If you create new diagonal parking spaces, please make them back in, which is much safer than head in. And then you don't have the issue with the headlights shining in the house. Place any new parking where it's needed most. It is not needed between Cypress Street and the one mile driveway. There's nothing there. There's no need for anybody to park there. And I think that it would, no matter which option you choose, we don't need to allow cars to drive between Cypress Street and the one mile driveway. It's a beautiful entrance. It can be a beautiful entrance for pedestrians and bicyclists. You don't have to let cars in there. I also urge you not to widen South Park Drive, not even to build a multi-use path. I've never felt like I was endangered by cars on that stretch of road. And if the only thing dividing the vehicle path and the multi-use path is two feet of ground, it's going to be really tempting for motorists to go into that path to pass slow or stopped vehicles. Consider the long-term maintenance costs, not just the initial cost of the project. And if you don't widen the road, you also don't need to remove the parking on the north side of the road. You can keep it. And finally, please allow two-way travel by bicyclists. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. David Welch, followed by Bo Powell. I'm in general agreement with Ann's comments. The one area that I particularly want to focus on really is just the short section of this that is between the Cypress Avenue entrance and the driveway into the Bidwell Park parking lot. Despite the appeal of those pillars, there is absolutely no functional reason for cars to be allowed in the parking lot. There is no parking space for cars to be on that section of road. There is no place to park there. There's no recreational facilities there. Everybody who wants to come in can come in very nicely off of Woodland through the existing driveway. I don't think there's any room need to move any of that. But simply place some bollards in that entrance where the entrance gate at Cypress is, and let that be a pedestrian and bicycle route along there with no need to widen any of it. Keep it simple. Keep it relatively cheap to do that there. Thank you. Thank you. Bo Powell, followed by Portia Cerruti. I don't see Bo. So we'll go with Portia Cerruti, followed by LaDonna Kanegi. I'm sure I massacred that. Hello, thank you all. I came to speak tonight to us all as park stewards and not parking lot stewards. I live nearby. Can you speak up, please? Yes, just get closer to the mic. There you go. I came to speak as park stewards and not parking lot stewards. I live in the neighborhood, but not across the street from Bidwell Park. But I want to speak about the look and feel of the neighborhood. There was a development done on East Avenue and Kent Field, and it was Italian Tuscan design. And they were not allowed to go around onto Kent Field because that would change the look and feel of the neighborhood. And if we put parking lots down Woodland Avenue, South Park, we're changing the look and feel of the neighborhood. And I don't think we should do that. I think we need to keep the park beautiful as it is. So I am in support of option four with clearer signage in addition to rehabilitating the existing parking lots and structures that we have. Regarding option two, I just wanted to point out the neighbors have not been considered in this option. It would bring a lot of traffic, as Jeff said, onto a street that's very narrow. There's a lot of potholes. I live down Linden Street. And we get asphalt kicked up into our property regularly. There's a very high berm on that street. So parts of that street don't have gutters. And so it gets impacted when it rains and gets flooded. There's also not sidewalks down that entire street. So a lot of the students he was talking about walking up and down every day walk in the street. So I think we need to consider the impact on the neighborhood. And I think we need to be more careful about that. And I think we need to be more careful about the Thank you. Thank you. LaDonna Kanighi followed by Julie McCalla. Hi. Thanks. I would like to see the interest. I understand we're going to have a project with 4th Street. I'd like to make sure that this is all integrated well with 4th Street from bike lanes coming into the park. I've always wondered why there's cars coming in there anyway. But I don't live in the neighborhood. So I just ride bike there. So I wouldn't mind seeing that section from the gateway to Cypress closed. I don't see any reason to make the roadways any wider, definitely, than heat paving. But narrower street spaces I think are better. And I think that's a good thing. As much pedestrian and bike spaces we can accommodate. Thanks. Thank you. Julie McCalla followed by Ted Swartz. I just decided to speak tonight as I listen to other people. So mine's very short. I first want to say I back option number 4. And I do live on 7th Street. And I must tell you, I'm a big fan of the street. You know where the streets end. You know where the streets end. You know where the streets end. You know where the streets end. You know where the streets end. You know where the streets end. You know where the streets end. You know where the streets end. You know where the streets end. You know where the streets end. You know where the streets end. You know where the streets end. You know where the streets end. You know where the streets end. You know where the streets end. You know where the streets end. You know where the streets end. You know where the streets end. You know where the streets end. You know where the streets end. You know where the streets end. You know where the streets end. I would really encourage to keep the cars at a slow pace, not fast. And I agree with those electric motorcycles that are going to appear if you really make it convenient for them to ride in there. So keep it safe for the kids. Keep it safe for the people that can't walk fast, are older, can't hear, cars coming. So I encourage you to vote for number four. Thank you. Thank you. Our last speaker is Ted Schwartz. Good evening, everyone. I was wondering if I could ask the engineer how many, because he said the trees were one of the reasons. How many trees are going to be removed under the options of one, two, and three? We'll make a note and ask them. And if you want to just go ahead with your comments. You can't ask how many trees are going to be removed? We can ask them during our time, but this is your time to address us. That's one thing. And then, you know, the voters of Chico, they voted in Measure H because of the need for extra revenue. And now you're talking about spending millions of dollars to change something that is absolutely fine just the way it is in most of the speaker's opinions here tonight. Also, you know, mature trees. They give off. A lot of oxygen. They deaden. They mute the sound. And they also just enhance the general beauty of the whole area. And my concern is with all of this change that they're talking about, they're going to probably remove trees. And the trees are the whole reason that they. One of the reasons they gave. For the reason why. Because people were parking next to the trees. You can park out on the street. Out there. There's always plenty of room out there to park on the street. I do it myself. And many of the people like myself are long, long term residents. Not that that makes any difference. Once you live in the city for six months, you're considered a resident. But I would very much consider leaving things well enough left alone. And I think that's the only way to do that. Thank you. Thank you. That is it for speakers. All right. We made it. Further comments from council? I have a question. Just for staff. I think it was a member of the heritage association's comment that may have confused me. We don't intend to alter the existing gateway. No. Okay. That's not part of the project. I just wanted to make sure. Council member van overbeck. So Mr. Schwartz had a very good question. Which was with options one and three which involve widening the south park drive. Not only trees but what other vegetation would have to be removed? So no trees would necessarily be removed. There's a couple that were recognized as already being dead. That would be removed as part. There is some shrubs on the south side. But the whole concept was of the bifurcation of the path towards the west end. Would go through kind of that grove so that we don't remove any trees. That was the whole concept of that in the design. And so the intent was to keep all trees as much as possible. Again there are a couple that were recognized as dead. And so those would come out as part of it. Thank you. So if I may follow up. Option two same thing. Correct. That's just staying in the same footprint. Thank you. Council member colsey. Question were there any options looked at that kind of combined any of the ideas presented such as. Let's see there's option two that includes closing the road to vehicles. And has kind of a different method of adding the permeable parking. Were there any other potential options looked at. Like if you added different ways of doing parking or entrances near sycamore field. But still closing the west side access to cars. Or just any other options considered. Yeah I mean we always bounce off different ideas when we do our design on our projects. And come up with the design criteria. Again the foundation of this consideration was from the headway engineering report. Looking at creating a bidirectional path. Because currently it's one way. Except for that portion from one mile to cypress. And so just making that more consistent. For separated purposes. And then again the second option kind of came to fruition from council direction on considering closures. And then the third option kind of came to fruition from the bidwell parks and playground commission. And then option four is no build. Just do it. Put it back as is. So that was kind of. Kind of how we got where we are. And we support kind of all those different ideas. They're all feasible. And so ultimately it's a council directive. Okay. And there was also the closure of an entrance right where kind of seventh intersects with woodland. And then a potential driveway location just to the west of that. Can you remind me why that was looked at being. Why that entrance was being moved. Sorry which one again. I might be reading it. I'm trying to get it right. But it looks like there's the possibility at least in option three. And I think some of the others of closing one of the driveways between woodland and south park. Right at 7th and woodland. And moving that west just a little bit. To directly access the cape breakers parking lot. Cape breakers yeah. Yeah closing down the one that's like 100 yards. Yeah that was the intention of that. Is to remove the existing access. Because it's again westbound or eastbound only. So the whole concept of moving that is to make it a different location. You shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift that's the only way to get I' m also wondering about how much cost that is to add the new driveway and get rid of the old one? I don' t know if these things come in chunks. overall it' s nominal we' re probably talking 40 to $60,000 in that ballpark but again to create access to caper acres directly from woodland so you can get in and out through that one location. thank you. council member wenzel. I want to bring up because some people the neighbors I spoke to before and one of them brought it up here this concept that adding an entrance at the end of linden to access the ball field that would there would be impacts on linden street essentially being used more often and that being an impact of the kids that walk down it being that there' s lack of sidewalks and the traffic that goes down south park drive I guess and they' re all public roads that meet our standards. there' s a lot of roads in chico that have potholes that' s not necessary part of our design criteria when we evaluate options but it' s not infeasible I guess based on what the existing conditions are. I' m not sure how many stop signs are on that street but we just added new ones in that neighborhood and I think it makes sense if we don' t want it to be used as a thoroughfare like that then stop signs are one way to get people to go around. thank you. any other questions? I have a quick question. clearly option number 4 was preferred from at least the majority of the people we heard from tonight but one thing putting all the things we heard from anne and jeff and what not together is anything been looked at or was it talked about maybe in park and playground commission of option 4 keeping it the way it is now and is there a way to divide and put a line on there so So you could have the bike and pedestrian traffic separated and do the speed bumps and pave the current parking spaces that are there now? I guess I'm not fully following that. Could you clarify or restate that? So option four that the majority of people like is just repave it, just keep it the way it is. But I did hear the suggestion of can, I think it was Mr. Glass said, can we put a line on there to have the traffic separated for bikes and pedestrians and cars just with separating it and doing that? And then the, what was the other one? Two-way travel of bikes. I don't know if we can get that with that. Anyways, did we look at that? Oh, speed bumps to slow people down just to traffic calming. Again, putting a stripe down the road, that's option one, right? It's creating a separation. It's creating a separation between vehicles and bicyclists and pedestrian uses. So when we evaluate those things, we're going to go with the least costly option possible. So there's not an adequate space with the existing footprint of the asphalt to accommodate all those things in that existing footprint, hence having to widen. So yeah, if you want to achieve separation of facilities, then there's the widening aspect. And again, further to the west, that's where the path in order to not. Remove trees and keep all the existing trees there would separate from the roadway and then kind of meander through where we would not have to remove trees and then come back and be contiguous. So hopefully that answered the question. But option one adds all the parking spaces, which moves the parking spaces to the south side. And I'll just, from my perspective, the intention wasn't to add parking necessarily. It's used. It's used already as parking. So from our perspective, we were just kind of formalizing because it's already used. And again, we wanted to mostly protect the trees so that vehicles didn't park right up against the trees that happens now. So you're saying right now where all the grass essentially is, people are just pulling off and parking in the grass? People use that as parking. Yeah. But mostly at the larger events, not like on a day to day because I go through there. Yeah. I mean, I've seen them on a regular basis. It's not frequent. It's not a lot. So, yeah, it's just it was trying to formalize it so that it was done in a more controlled manner and not kind of a free for all. And then, again, parking right up on the root zones of the trees that then affect the health of those trees. Gotcha. Okay. Thank you. Council Member Van Overbeck. Thank you, Madam Mayor. So, Mr. Autobahn, if we can provide access from woodland to the ball fields. So there's already access to one mile. There's access to caper acres from woodland. So if we provide access to the ball fields, there is no reason cars need to be on South Park Drive. Correct. Because cars. That's option two, yes. Yeah. Right. Option one and three are basically there's some difference in the parking configuration, but they're the same idea. Okay. So that's number one. Number two is. Those parking. Lots all have the opportunity. I'm talking about the parking lots for caper acres ball field and especially one mile, which is the most heavily used parking lot. And Council Member O'Brien talked about the horseshoe pits is a place to expand. So we could put all that parking away from South Park Drive because I think, you know, when you're I love to look at my cars, but I don't like to look at other people's cars. That makes any sense. And so when you when you're looking toward the park from woodland. And having all those cars parked there in my mind is an eyesore. They can be tucked into lots to serve the purposes of the people that are going to park there. That improves the aesthetics. And it also makes it more convenient for the people who are using those facilities. So the idea that somehow if we eliminate car traffic on South Park Drive is going to create some huge crisis for the people on woodland and lights are going to be shining in their living room is nonsense. I mean, I lived on a street across from the deer pens and nature center there. And I never right across from where the parking lot from the nature center is. I never never had that problem. So I just don't buy that. And we never had a complaint for people from people leaving one mile or caper acres that there was a problem with headlights and people coming out. And the headlights are going to seem anyway. It's just going to be 50 feet or 40 feet closer. So the idea. Of keeping South Park Drive or closing it to vehicular traffic. Which is option to giving people creating one more access to woodland. And it is the second. I want to reiterate the second cheapest option as opposed to the most expensive. To me. Doesn't take away. It actually adds convenience for. People. Who drive cars. But it's all it's all about the experience is not about safety so much. As is about the experience of the park and it's a different experience if you're sharing a road. If you're pedestrian or cyclist. With a car as opposed to knowing. You look for him when the when they cross but knowing that you don't have to worry about that. So I I'm a very strong supporter of number two. For those reasons. When I when I remember they want to ask another question. Okay. I mean. You know where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where we've kind of developed a standard for that a lot of our bike paths where it's Swing gates where they're offsetting so you have to meander through a car can't get through there but also it's used as a Mechanism to slow bikes down before they enter like an area that has vehicles so there'd be offset swing gates So my question So I know you already kind of explained this the cost differences in the projects But I'm trying to wrap my head around the two million dollar approximate figure for option two when it seems like largely Option two is closing the park road to cars in that area and then there's some permeable surface Is there something else is there like a widening going on or what else makes it cost so much more than option four? It's the addition of that additional driveway for second more fields parking lot And then you can see kind of in the line-item costs a big difference in the roadway excavation And then you have a increase and in the permeable parking servicer. You don't have that an option One or three so that's a three hundred sixty thousand dollar line item right there for permeable surfacing So that's where a lot of the costs are added in so again. It's not a necessary apples to apples comparison on this Because it's added in the permeable surfing permeable surfacing plus the paving of the parking lots And how much was that driveway going to add? More feel I don't know it offhand. It's just asphalt and roadway excavation aggregate base part of the reason I was asking was just if there was any way to Not that anybody else would support this but to keep it so that cars can go between us the sycamore pool entrance and the last entrance without additional driveways if that would even be feasible, but still closing the main section between one mile and Pine Street closing that two cars If if that would save any costs And if that even makes sense I don't think there would be any cost I think that just probably honestly caused more confusion of where to enter the park and get in and out From my perspective yeah, and I think on top of that it would also create vehicular traffic where we have pedestrians and bicycles without the ability to expand the road I'm a huge advocate for shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift I would also be willing to if that' s not something the council supports this would be the second cheapest option if we were to not go with the permeable surface in which case more savings short-term but we would slowly incur those operations and maintenance costs over time for the gravel lots to be consistently redone as they are now. may I make a point only option two has permeable pavement costs priced in all the other options are using gravel lots just to make sure everybody' s clear. correct. thank you. thank you. any other questions? is it grant funds we' re using for this? these are measure h funds. thank you. Councilmember winslow and then obrien. I want to give a shout out to the neighbors who come up and advocate here I feel they' good stewards of the park it' s not often you have a bunch of neighbors show up to make the hard point they' re not a parking problem in front of their houses and I really do admire that showing up even at risk of some there. We have a fantastic park and I like this conversation because none of these are really bad I think some of these could be better or more expensive or others but our park would be fantastic with any of these options going on but there' s some more than others and I think we get a more green space what I value is more secluded and quieter space everywhere in the city there' s cars and you hear it there' s not places where you can even just go around on a bike or walking and not worry about cars creeping up behind you and so the idea that we have a quieter and safer place, a place that' s more joyful for people riding bikes and walking in groups I think this is a really unique opportunity to have that and that' s what Bidwell Park is for us we certainly would not be considering putting a car lane shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift! Follow shift shift shift the parking lot and I think thank you. I will second that motion. I will also note that it seems pretty clear that although people are supporting different options it' s clear nobody' s advocating for the park road to be widened or to have unnecessary parking and I think that there are a couple of paths forward of how we can accomplish the common goal we have and I think option two is a really good way to get there. I will be a hard no on that one. I disagree with everything about this. I think we should leave it the way it is. When we sat and listened to somebody talk about their lease space that they' ve only had four years and how we should think about the intrinsic value of the person in that community. What about the intrinsic value of all the people that enjoy the park just the way it is right now and don' t have a single problem with it. We have to shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift All right. Aye. Council Member Hawley? Yes. Council Member O'Brien? I might have supported this if I had an opportunity to actually speak on it. You jumped ahead, so no. Well, but... We never have to jump to... Once we make a motion, we discuss. I know, that's fine. I'm sorry. You're right. I didn't get to... I apologize. Actually, it was three council members that I was before, but anyway, that's fine. Well, we haven't finished voting yet. Would you like to go? Nope. Okay. Council Member Van Overbeck? Yes. Council Member Winslow? Yes. Vice Mayor Bennett? No. Mayor Reynolds? No. It carries 4-3. All right. 5.2. Consideration of a grant proposal from School Violence Prevention Program. Barbara Martin. I know it's out of order, but was option 2 with parking or without? It's in option 2, and that's what you just voted for. Extra parking? No, we had three certain existing parking lots, not new parking. This is option 2. Anyways, we'll have to talk about it later because the votes already happened. Mrs. Martin. Thank you. I'm going to have Information Services Deputy Director, shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift Thank you Madam Mayor, city council, my name is Josh Markey I' m the deputy director of information systems I' m here tonight for your consideration of the grant proposal submittal for the fiscal year 2025 cops school violence prevention program grant. The city of chico in collaboration with California state university chico, university police department, chico unified school district and other local public safety agencies is seeking your approval to submit an application for the cops grant this year's cops grant. The proposed project aims to enhance public safety communication opportunities and to increase our ability to communicate with university police with our own police department and other local agencies. And also to potentially install license plate reader systems for the school public safety systems near local schools and acquiring an advanced security screening equipment. The total grant request is $500,000 with the city providing a 25% match of 125,000. Budget policy g7 requires grant solicitations in the excess of $100,000 to be considered by city council. And it' s the staff recommendation that and can be submitted. The fiscal impact is that $125,000 of local match would come from the existing i.t. replacement fund and that we would work currently negotiating with the university to recoup those costs over the use of this equipment. So hopefully that will be a cost neutral or a cost positive in the future. thank you. any questions? just to be clear this is budgeted? correct. We would be using the existing capital improvement project that' s the tech replacement fund. thank you. council member holly. just a minor question. I' m curious where you are in negotiations with the university to recoup those costs? we' ve been talking with their captain and their chief. We' ve come up with a price that we think is fair for them to benefit from some of our radio resources and use our network. And then it would also include the recoupment of that $125,000 over like 10 years or five years. sounds like a great collaboration. thank you. anybody else? can' t see. all right. how many speakers do we have? all right. consider a motion. move to approve. second. council member goldstein. aye. council member holly. yes. council member van overbeck. yes. council member winslow. carry 7-0. of the council do you want to go on and do 5.3 or do you want to take a break? let' s get it done. s go. 5.3 west sacramento avenue and warner street safety. mr. ottoboni. great to see you again. thank you. all right. good evening again. item 5.3 is consideration of the west sacramento avenue and warner street safety improvements project. based on council direction at the may 20th city council meeting to evaluate safety improvements on these segments of roadway. staff went back evaluated different options. and so looking at the project objectives. transition of bike and pedestrian features in a safe and effective manner. creating connectivity with existing infrastructure. traffic calming. all those overarching with really a safety aspect. so we evaluated three different options because the council direction was looking at a quick build. we looked at a permanent build situation and a popup demonstration. which is a! this is kind of busy and probably hard to read.! but in that period of time there was a total of 24 crashes. ranging from severe injury to only complaints of pain. so a decent amount of injury collisions reported over that six-year period of time. about 38, 39% of those were related to bicycle and pedestrian incidents. and obviously on the bottom right there the age of the victims. the number of people that were you can see the younger age obviously being around the high school and the university. kind of in line with what you might expect in terms of that demographic. so looking at west sacramento. and the existing conditions. so what you have is a 40-foot span from the face of curb to the face of curb existing. currently there are class two bike lanes only on the portion from the railroad tracks to warner street. there are no bike facilities from warner to esplanade. there's on street parking in that stretch along chico high school's campus but on the opposite side of the street where the residential homes are. there's a traffic signal existing at warner street and west sacramento avenue. the current configuration of that is dedicated left turn lanes with a you also have perpendicular class one facilities in terms of tying into existing features. you have the railroad bike path and obviously with the esplanade project we're constructing the class one separated facility along the esplanade. that stretch really creating connectivity between those two main existing features. and then excessive speeding is often experienced with the high school aged new drivers down west we would be looking at a permanent build option and looking at that what we would do you can see the sections there from the staff report on the right-hand side. essentially what we would be looking at doing in a permanent build would be pushing the face of curb on the chico high school side out nine feet into the roadway to create space for a separated 12 foot wide bike path with a three foot separation from the travel lane. we would go to reduce lanes to 11 foot which is a common measure and that would allow us to maintain parking on the residential side of the street. that's for the portion from esplanade to warner street. then further to the west to the railroad tracks. essentially you would have the same section there. although there's no parking you could add parking but really you would have an eight foot buffer on that side from vehicular traffic. it has dedicated and separated facilities and connects to the features at the railroad bike path as well as esplanade. it maintains the on street parking for the residents on the north side of west sacramento. it limits the modifications that would have to happen at the traffic lane. we would be able to maintain the same turning movements. this option competes extremely well for upcoming grant opportunities I will talk about more. then again the traffic calming element by having the reduced lane widths down to 11 feet would slow down vehicles. the challenges with that would be utility relocation so the storm drain line existing runs down the curb face on the south side of the street. by moving that out nine feet we would have to do some modifications to how we would be able to! construction that we are going to be doing that is going to be a permanent feature. we are going to be looking at a quick build option for this portion. working with that existing 40 foot front curb. this is what staff evaluated many different ideas. worked through it to understand what the implications are. the benefits of this is we could do it timely relative to a permanent build. there is vertical protection for the cyclist with the on street protected class two bike lanes. there is obviously reduced project costs. although likely not going after grant funds for that. less than what our match funds would be for a grant. still decently substantial. challenges again the traffic signal impact. at warner west sacramento by doing a quick build you would really affect the ability to have the dedicated turn movements and the through lanes. on a quick turn around to come back to council we do not really have the option or ability to further evaluate what that would look like and what those impacts would be. by reducing or eliminating the turning movement now you will be stacking cars further back there will be more delay time essentially reducing those levels of service at that intersection. also there would be costs associated with moving signal heads reprogramming the traffic signal system so those are added costs that you wouldn't necessarily have in the other option. again one of the other challenges would also be this concept would require removal of parking for the portion from warren and the other warner to esplanade which would have to go through internal affairs based on our municipal code which would include a public process to notify the residents and property owners of that item coming forward to internal affairs. the pop up demonstration didn't really talk a whole lot about that or show anything here but essentially if that' s a desire of the council it would essentially be a that's a really long configuration. moving over to warner street i think this is a real great opportunity to look at different ways to improve that over the years the university has bought those homes on the three cul-de-sacs i think it's stadium way bryce and la vista i think i forget the third one so a lot of those homes have been demolished to achieve future build-out of the university's master plan and so we're looking at the construction of those homes and re-envisioning that stretch from west sacramento to legion you have a really wide right-of-way of 56 feet so a great amount of space to play with and then as you hit legion and go towards second street through the main part of campus that necks down to 46 feet existing bike lanes class 2 bike lanes are already there you have no on-street parking for that stretch you have multiple pedestrian and bike crossings so there's three segments street that are on the first street that stretch that have signalized crossings including a pedestrian scramble are only one in chico where there's a whole pedestrian only phase to the traffic signal that's at second street you have two stop sign controlled crossings and three uncontrolled crossings so those are existing conditions looking at a permanent build concept again utilizing that wide right-of-way on the top here landscape center median reducing the lane widths again to 11 feet providing a full buffer and widen class 2 bike lanes within that existing footprint it would be an opportunity to repave the road take take out the crown and reduce the turning movements onto the campus or the university property at strategic locations that fit their ultimate master plan build out there's a great opportunity for aesthetics for chico state in this too projects that we're working on with some features whether it could be banners other gateway features painted crosswalks that are chico state themed are things that we've contemplated and worked with the university on you could have the widened bike lanes and then you would have consistent class 2 protected bike lanes for this stretch that would then transition and tie in with what we already have on ivy street with those protected class 2 bike lanes there and then we would have the challenges again is the time to deliver on the costs and so those are the two main challenges associated with the permanent build. Quick build there' s no real changes from the existing because you already have class 2 bike lanes there and so we haven' s been ss4a grant program coming up quick next week applications are due. Looking at that option of the permanent build we did rough planning level estimates of about $10 million for the two locations combined the ss4a program has a 20% minimum match to be eligible and so we reached out to our partners at chico unified and chico state that would directly benefit from this and ask them to participate and put some skin to the game. Chico unified came up with $250,000 and chico state has come up with half a million commitment towards the 20% match. Combined as shown in the staff report that would be $750,000. The 20% match total would be about 2 million leaving our portion for the city at about 1.25. A little bit more about the ss4a there' s a $680 million pot of money available. It' s a program that obviously is focused on safety improvements and some of the eligibility criteria is having an action plan. Our local road safety plan and transportation plan and general plan all suffice to meet that criteria. It prioritizes and addresses road Pretty much all these elements would be addressed as part of these permanent improvements proposed. With that our staff recommendation is for the council to direct staff to proceed with the permanent improvements option and secondarily authorize staff to submit the grant for the ss4a program. That concludes my report I' m available for any questions. Thank you. First good work goodness and such a quick turnaround with a grant deadline coming up. When we brought up this item we weren' t thinking we would apply for a grant for it. I' m glad to see you jumping at opportunities and having people in your department to make that happen. I was looking at the design here and we expected in order to make this work on west sacramento we' d like to have a I' m looking at the design and it says a six foot bike lane and then a six foot sidewalk next to each other on the west sacramento. I can see how that could function as a two way bicycle track but would this support people riding bikes both ways on it when it' s also shared as a sidewalk? Based on the design guidelines the design guidelines of 12 foot bidirectional is the minimum. That achieves that. It' s the same as what we have going in on bruce road here soon. It' s multi use paths on the s there too. council member bryan over back. is this in the budget for the current fiscal year? it is not. the long-term plan is lead time to do the permanent solution doesn' t matter because it' s not in the budget. it would be the following fiscal year 26-27. we would have to come up with a supplemental to come forward and likely to council especially depending on the status of the grant application. we would submit the grant next week. it usually takes four to six months to get a response on whether we' design work in theory between now and then using our local funds. at the end of the day we would probably want to go in line with what the grant funds are. this project I think is I want to thank council member winslow for bringing it up but given how heavily this is traveled by students at the high school and university I think it' s critical we get this done but we have to shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift s the ss4a is the here and now there' s a big pot of money because they haven' t had a lot of agencies going after this pot of money because of the 20% minimum match. If unsuccessful we would look at other opportunities like the active transportation program next June to maybe reapply and go after a different program. Without the grant funding this project really is not moving forward until we get those other funds that we need to be the city council wants to direct those funds to do the project? the permanent build we get a $10 million project for 1.25 million and we retain parking in an area where I' m sure the residents and property owners are going to be very disturbed. There' s going to be some pushback on that. That seems like it makes perfect sense. The other option project and it' s 3 to 6 million and I' m going to say it' s probably going to be 6 million plus it just seems to go that way and we don' t have the money. It' s almost a no brainer isn' t it? councilmember o'brien. I would concur with that. Vice mayor bennett, this area as has been noted notorious for accidents. We have many, many students both at the high school and college. The college level been in the park and are accessing that. Very crowded and very dangerous at times. I think this really is a no brainer. I don' t like spending money we don' t necessarily have earmarked. I agree with councilmember ben overbeck we need to be careful about that. We spent $2 million on the park. We need to be mindful of that. But to get a $10 million project for 1.25 million with some matching support from the school district and chico state I think is like I said a no brainer. I will support that. public comment. I' m just making sure I don' t miss any. How many speakers do we have? We have nine. All right. Three minutes each. I' ll call the first two speakers. Jesse horgan followed by marie patterson. I got set up. I'll call you back. I'll call you back. Good evening, mayor and city council members. I really love the report that city staff put together. I just wanted to add some things that I think might broaden the discussion a little bit. We support the permanent project, the longer term project. We have a letter that I sent to you all that I think And I want to acknowledge the people from president Perez committing $500,000 of funding towards the grant match. I personally will if we proceed with the grant to apply, I will work to get another $500,000 approved. There' s a process for that. It takes a while. It' ll be into the fall. But I will work to get more matching funds from our associated students sustainability fund. Let' s see. Our goal is to allocate $1 million, so to double the current allocation to make it easier on the city to get this funding approved. I just finished. I didn' t. I just got the results of our transportation survey that we do annually. So this is the 2025 survey. And there' s four points that I think are relevant. One is that we have a lot of funding for the transportation program. One is 38% of students walk or bike to the campus. So that is a high, high percentage compared to other universities. 34% of faculty walk or bike to campus. So that gives you an idea of the numbers of people who are using this corridor on west Sacramento and Warner Street. Also, 10% of the respondents to the survey said that safety was the reason why we were able to get this funding. We identified exactly where students shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift the grant. And we will be able to continue to support the! shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift fronts and it's great to see that the council does as well so I'll make mine short and sweet. So not only does it improve safety for our students, faculty and staff as well as Chico High students making their way to the campuses so there's benefits there. Increasing pedestrian and cycling and other sustainable forms of transportation. Also from a university perspective it improves the entrances from the north and the south adding some additional flair that the team has put together to hopefully increase that community that you've now entered campus that will hopefully help encourage and increase our enrollment over the years when the project is included. Hopefully increasing and attracting again more students. From a sustainability perspective obviously it's in line with both of our climate action plans as well as our transportation demand management plan improving air quality and reducing our greenhouse gas emissions by increasing more students. So that's a big part of the project. So we're looking at that and we're also looking at the! As Mr. Horgan had mentioned hopefully there's an opportunity for us to increase our match funding from the university through some of the sustainability funds so hopefully that can help decrease the cost that the city is putting forward. So we as well support the permanent build out for both corner and west Sacramento. And I thank you for your time. Thank you Kirk Mumford followed by Ann Byker-Kaufman. Thank you all for coming out with that wonderful presentation. I like the permit bill. But I am I share an concern about possible funding. But I am I share an concern about possible funding. And if nothing else I'd like to see them stripe that piece, you know, replace the stripe lines to turn into a class 2 bike lane. And I've asked for years for striping along the south side of Sacramento from Warner to the Esplanade. But I was told by Fritz McKinley years ago that, you know, paint costs money. So I didn't even get paint. But it seems to me, I mean, I like that because I shop over at the Safeway over there. And I come down off of 3rd Avenue. And that intersection is really a mess. I have a couple questions. I don't understand if you have a two-way bike path and it runs along either the south or the north side of Sacramento Avenue, what you do when you get to a quarter because you can't take a left turn lane. I mean, what are you supposed to do? Are you supposed to get off and go across the street? With the pedestrians and then cross again with the pedestrians and then get back on your bike? I mean, I just don't understand it. And even on the pictures you showed for the permanent build going south to Legion, you know, you've got a median in the road and it looks like the turn lane disappears. So what do you have to do? You have to get off your bike at the light there and then you cross the street? Is that? Is that the way it works? I don't know. They're not allowed to just address your comments to us and then we can address it later. Yeah, I don't know. What happens? I mean, I got the same problem with the downtown revision, you know, because you got dual bike lanes or single bike lanes, and I'm not sure what you're supposed to do at the corner if you can't take a lane. Okay. Okay. Okay. You shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift! Follow Follow! thank you. I support the whole project and the permanent build option. I usually don't support two-way bike lanes because it is confusing. This one would work because there is hardly any side roads or driveways on the south side of Sacramento. I would like to propose a simpler and cheaper quick build option than the one that staff came up with. That would be first of all having a lot of the county. You would have to shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift is that you don't have to get rid of any parking. In fact, you increase the amount of parking if you do it that way. And parked cars can act as a buffer which is more effective than some flexible bollards. So it gives more protection to the bicyclists. And something that sounds a little crazy, but I just read about it in the MACTO website, you could use the 12-foot wide two-way cycle track as a lane for emergency vehicles because it's a lot easier for bicyclists to get out of the way than cars. So it's actually something they do in the Netherlands all the time. So something to consider. Anyway, this would be a back pocket just in case we can't get any funding. For this project. Thank you. Thank you, Ann. Tim G. followed by Sarah Lanham. Thank you for letting me speak with you this evening. I just wanted to celebrate the way that this project brings together the Chico Unified and the university and the city and the synergy to change the culture of the spaces on campus and welcoming people into the campus. And it seems to allow the possibilities of more modern urban thinking about cities that there needs to be lots more walking going on in urban spaces. And so it seems like a really nice idea and I hope we'll be able to move forward with it together. Thank you. Sarah Lanham followed by Bryce Ingersoll. Hello, dear council members. My name is Sarah Lanham and I'm the commissioner of sustainability with the associated students at Chico State. And I'm here to give my input on agenda item 5.3, the grant application for a permanent build regarding street safety project for West Sacramento and Warner Street. I rely on biking as my primary method of transportation with downtown Chico. And whether it's commuting to and from school or coming home late at night, biking is a central part of my daily life. As a student and resident, I'm increasingly concerned about the lack of infrastructure and safety measures in place for those of us who use alternative forms of transportation. On a regular basis, I feel vulnerable when riding in the downtown, especially around areas with poor visibility or inadequate lighting. After an incident last year, I was identified with a while walking home in the dark, I no longer feel comfortable walking at night. The incident I mentioned could have been potentially avoided with the preventative measures in place, such as adequate lighting. My only alternative has been biking after dark, which still feels unsafe without proper infrastructure. Recently, I had the opportunity to hear a pitch on the long-term proposal to improve bicycle infrastructure near campus. Some of these visions included integrating protected bike lanes, improving street lighting, and adding a diagonal crosswalk in an area that is heavy in foot traffic. This would improve safety for the students that walk or bike to campus, which should be a priority. As for bikeability, Chico has mixed reviews. A majority of these reviews are negative, one even labeling Chico as a city with weak bikeability. An important perspective to consider when regarding these mixed reviews would be the opportunity for improvement. Let's make Chico an undisputedly walkable and bikeable community for our students and for our full-time residents. I would like to emphasize, alongside CSU Chico students, this also includes students that attend Chico High School. Including safety, this project supports a broader long-term goal, sustainability. Chico State has been committed to becoming carbon neutral by 2030, and commuting remains the largest source of emissions. From students and faculty and staff, in response, I formed an alternative transportation student advisory committee to advocate for these changes and encourage more students to choose low-emission commuting options. I respectfully urge the council to consider applying for this grant. It is not simply a project to fund, it is a strategic investment in public safety, student well-being, and the future of sustainability for our city. After listening to the responses from the staff report, I must add on. You mentioned that the city, just recently, has been a part of the city's I have not spent too much money on the park to contribute with this project. I must emphasize that you need to care about resident residents. Thank you so much. Okay, Bryce Ingersoll, followed by LaDonna Kaniga. Hello, Council. My name is Bryce Ingersoll. I'm a recent Chico State graduate, and I'm here to show my support for the recommendation. for item 5.3, which is the permanent option. During my time at Chico State, I took a course in transportation planning where for our final project, we actually focused on West Sacramento, specifically where it intersects with the railroad. Because it was such a good example of what poor planning can look like and how dangerous it can be for pedestrians and bicyclists alike. And we know that drivers regulate their speed based on the urban environment. In this case, it would be good to reduce the lane sizes. And then also the Class 1 multi-path is a great way to do this. And then I also served on the Chico State Alternative Transportation Committee where we reviewed the proposed plan and we all unanimously were supportive of it. And personally, I live in Chico State, in the South Chico Campus area. My daily commute to campus never felt as safe as it could potentially be, along with many close calls with vehicle collisions on my bicycle. I actually had a pretty severe fall on 2nd Chestnut Street that ended up losing me both my front teeth. So, I have one back now, but another one's gone. And since then, I've been working on my bike. I've had to pay for an extensive, expensive emergency visit to Enloe, visit the dentist and the periodontist where I'm currently undergoing a process for a tooth implant. And after all this, it's been apparent to me that bicycle infrastructure is not merely a safety issue, but also a financial one. When the city does not take the initiative for proper infrastructure, the costs are pushed onto the individual. Thank you. Thank you. LaDonna Kanagy followed by Michael, uh, Vandervoort. Hi, uh, thanks for this time to speak. I'm LaDonna Kanagy, and I am a professor of, of geography and environmental studies at Chico State. And I teach some classes in sustainable transportation planning and one in, uh, uh, planning for sustainable communities. We've done some short, quick build, uh, pop-up kind of projects, um, in the past. And, um, uh, this is an area that's, this is such a, like an, uh, a golden opportunity to, um, uh, do the infrastructure in this, in this, uh, area. We've been talking about trying to redo the bike lanes for years. And one of the, um, barriers was that the power lines were going to be put underground through campus, which has been done on Warner Street. Um, if you ride bike through the area, you'll notice every seam has a, in the bike lanes has a hump in it. It's just, they're real, and they're, we kind of have some of the stingiest bike lanes ever, um, on very fast streets. I ride on West Sacramento. I live up the, um, bicycle path on the railroad. So I drive this all the time on my bike. And I usually commute to campus, um, via bike. And I'm just really interested in seeing this done. And, um, was at a meeting with, uh, I, I love that the partners are involved with Chico Unified, Chico State being supportive. Now we have Jesse Hogan as a, as a parking, um, manager on campus. Um, that's really creating, you know, a lot of, um, um, projects that are gonna be really beneficial. Um, and then to see, we also had Yvonne from BCAG was really interested in, um, also had some funding, I believe. And so I feel like it's a, it's like the right time to really do this permanent project. Um, if there's any, um, desire to do like just a pop-up, um, I can offer my class for maybe some data collection or something this, this fall. Um, but I, um, fully support this project. Um, I'd love to see the intersections through campus be made into pedestrian scrambles, those T intersections, maybe do some, you know, paper art or something there. Um, and just, um, really, um, you know, um, also extend the project to third street, um, second street. If, I think the boundary showed second street, we have no bike lanes between second and third street. And then it starts the, uh, buffered bike lanes down Ivy. And so, I, I suggest it be extended to third street, but I think it's a really fantastic opportunity. And it seems like there's, um, uh, like a lot of energy behind it right now. So I would, um, love to see this approved for the permanent build. If you need any help with the pop-up, I'm here. Thank you. Thank you. And our last speaker is Michael Vander, Vanderbort. Sorry. It's a hard name. It is a hard name. I don't really have too much to add, but, um, I'm also a recent Chico state grad. And in my four years of biking around Chico, I've been hit by a car twice. Um, both in a class two bike lane, and the paint didn't really do me much good. So I'm an advocate of the permanent build separated bike path, and that's all I have to say. Thank you. That is it for speakers. All right. Thank you. Any future, uh, further comments or questions from council? Council member Winslow? Yeah. Um, this is just great. I mean, I think it's been evident. I don't think there's been a single opinion uttered that was not, this is great. so good work. And, uh, right. Not this meeting. Not this meeting. Well, this particular good item is what I'm referring to, to be sure. Uh, yeah, I really had, and I continue to have enthusiasm for us being able to do sort of like more like down and dirty street improvements, which is of probably between what you're considering a pop-up and a quick build in that you're not resurfacing the street. If there's bumps in the bike lane, you just deal with it. And I go to other cities and I, and I see a lot. There's been a lot of, um, rapid improvements in that way. And I think the, well, it's not as smooth and pristine, um, as, as a resurface street is, it still has that effect of safety. Um, and I think we should be pursuing things like that. So if, if the money doesn't come through, um, I don't think we should forget the, the quick build concept and we can keep it under 3 million. I think we can sort of tamp down some of those expectations, but still be able to make these improvements. But as, as it is with this grant opportunity, I think it's a, uh, no brainer then that we, we do it. So somebody can make a motion or. Council member Holly. Just to echo the comments, um, council member Winslow just made. I think it's a great collaboration with C, CUSD, the university. Can you tell it's almost 10 PM? Um, but as far as budgetary concerns go, the most likely outcome, even if we do get awarded this grant, is that some of that money is going to come from other of our major road rehabilitation projects in our 10 year plan. Um, and I'm willing, willing, willing to make that sacrifice. This is such a big safety need due to the, uh, records of collisions we've had here. So I, I will definitely vote with, with submitting the grant. And I am hoping that we can also give council direction to maybe in the long term have that backup plan of a, um, cheaper quick build option. But maybe that can come after we hear back from the grant. Council member O'Brien. So I just really want to compliment staff. You put together a really comprehensive plan with, uh, not a lot of time. So well done. And then getting the, the, uh, assistance, the collaboration with Chico State and, uh, Chico Unified is outstanding as well. So I'm going to support this. I would ask that we hold off on anything. If we don't get the grant, what that looks like moving forward, we need to look at all our, our, our, our, our, our, budgetary concerns. But I will support this moving forward. And thank you for bringing it forward in the first place. Addison, thank you. I have a question. The SS4 grant for all program that's due next week, can we only apply for this? Because North Avenue is in my district. And I would venture to say that the elementary school and junior high school cares are putting their lives in danger just as much, if not more, as West Sacramento. Can we only apply for one area or? We can apply for other areas. I would maybe recommend in this situation, we, we, we actually got SS4A grant funds last cycle last year to develop a safe routes to school master plan. And so we're still waiting on getting the funds to do that. North Avenue, Chico Junior, or Bidwell Junior High, that's been a problem for us. We've been trying to improve that for a long time. I know over the years I've been here, we've evaluated a lot of different ways to try and improve that. We've worked with this school district to improve on-site circulation, looking at different ways to improve safety. And so we don't have a really easy solution there yet. And so I might just say maybe let's go through the master plan idea for those specific locations. The opportunity, I think, with the partners of Chico Unified and Chico State for Warner West Sacramento, I know is really opportunistic. And so there will be opportunities to address those other areas and other school circuits. Does the master plan include all schools? Yes. Perfect. Yeah. Yeah. And I wasn't saying that I don't support this. I was just curious what the parameters were if we do one at a time. And I know we, it was on the agenda a long time ago for the safe routes to school. Yeah. So I didn't know where that ended up and went. So. We're waiting on the grant funding for that. It's taken them a while to get us the master agreement. Okay. All right. Consider a motion. Move to approve. I think safety is our number one responsibility. And this clearly is going to improve safety for our students. Can I add one friendly amendment to it if we need to possibly? But because this is just authorizing them to go for the grant program. But do you also need direction to be able to direct you to specifically work with Chico State and Chico Unified and all that? Would that help to also continue to put that forward? Yes. Yeah, that helps. I think based on what Jesse said, we'll continue to explore that and we'll work hand in hand to maximize that contribution so that we can hopefully have a successful grant application. Thank you. Yeah. I'll second the motion. And I had a question. I'm sorry. I'm kind of spacey with my cold. But yeah, if, right, if we don't get the funds, could we then bring it back to discuss what kind of quick build we need? What kind of project we might pursue? Might that be a process? Yeah. If that's the council desire, we can always bring that back once we have more information. Again, if we don't get award on this SS4A round, I think there's some other opportunities and maybe we can explore that at that time and have a discussion there. And also, usually projects like this take a long time to actually come to fruition. Do you have any guess at, you know, when we might expect the construction to, you know, happen and be finalized if we got the funds right now? Yeah. So things that affect the timing of a project are environmental, which this is working within a built environment. So that typically results in a categorical exemption, which saves us time. Utilities, there's going to be some utility stuff, but most of that's going to be internal with our storm drain system. And then the third is right of way. And so we are intentional in trying to stick within the existing right of way so we don't have to go through acquisition. And that can add a year easy. And so with all that said, I think from the time we get notice and it's going to kind of depend on the SS4A program because if we are going to use their funds for design, you can't start expending that until you have that agreement in place. So it might be a year before we can even start on it. We'll kind of see as the program goes along. So I think within a four-year to six-year timeframe would be reasonable. All right. That sounds pretty good in terms of regulations. I know it's not going to be a road project, but it does make me think that something involving working with LaDonna's class or otherwise doing a pop-up or minimal quick build in the meantime could still be great. Just throwing that out there. All right. We've got a motion and a second. No further comments? Okay. Council Member Goldstein? Aye. Council Member Hawley? Yes. Council Member O'Brien? Yes. Council Member Van Overbeek? Yes. Council Member Winslow? Yes. Vice Mayor Bennett? Yes. Mayor Reynolds? Aye. Carries 7-0. Reports of communications. No action can be taken on items under this section unless the council agrees to include it on a subsequent session. Do you have anything else, Mr. Mayor? No. City Manager? All right. Council Member Quests may be verbally requested at this time and would be agendized at a future meeting. After stating what the item would be, a majority vote of council is needed in order for staff to agendize. Do we have any comments? No. Council Member McFadden? I have one real quickly. So two years ago the council approved a project to do as an item I brought forward, a wayfinding sign project for downtown. I found out that explorer chico was doing a wayfinding sign project for the whole county. So we decided just not to do anything until they came back with a report. They have a report. What I would like to do at this point is to create a committee. You would think I would learn my lesson on ad hoc committees. And the committee would be me, it would be somebody from public works, I have talked to Director Gustafson about that, somebody from the university, somebody from the cycling community, and somebody from the DCBA, probably the director, the new director. But since I need, I am going to need more than an hour of staff time, I expect this to be a 10 or 12 hour thing. I would like permission from the council to fill out the form. And I would like to have a discussion with the committee. So you want to agendize to have this discussion? Yeah. Okay. Second. Okay. All right. Council member Goldstein? Aye. Council member Hawley? Yes. Council member O'Brien? Yes. Council member Van Overbeck? Yes. Council member Winslow? Yes. Vice mayor Bennett? Yes. Mayor Reynolds? Yes. No? All right. That's it. We will adjourn to July 8th at 5 or 5.30. Thank you.
