 Hello everyone and welcome to today's training session. This is peak agenda training session number two for drafting and approving. My name is Heather Pyle. I'm a product training specialist from Granicus and I'll be conducting your session today. So this is considered session two of three or potentially four training or group online training sessions for you. Highlighted in the lower left hand corner is an overview of today's session. So really the purpose of today is to help you become familiar with peak agenda item creation and then also go through the workflow process of the approval workflow process. So if you had taken the previous session one that would be an overview of administration. Essentially what we're doing here is we're starting with the сторонcccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccc after you complete the third session of agenda coordinating. So that is if you are using our streaming solution, you will end after session three. If you are not using our streaming solution, then you'll continue on to session four, which is peak minutes. And that's we'll cover processing and publishing minutes to your view page. So quick outline there. So this is considered day two of our session. I know sometimes people end up taking the sessions in different orders, but officially this is considered day two to us. So what we'll cover today in this drafter and approver session, we're going to start with creating an agenda item in peak. We'll review all of the fields within an item template and discuss adding attachments to those items. So we'll create and save it and then review some of the information that you have access to in the system, such as creating a duplicate item or creating a new version of the item. We'll preview the item and item packet. We'll work through our approval process. So we'll also go through some information about searching for items in peak and with a Q&A if anyone has any questions. So we are live and recording this session. So if you're not familiar with our recorded group sessions, each of you will receive a copy of this recording and I will be uploading it to your media manager site for you to review in the future or share with your associates. So everyone's microphone is on. So if you have any questions, please feel free to post those on the Q&A and we'll try and answer those on the Q&A and post those on the Q&A and post those on the Q&A and post those on the Q&A and post those on the Q&A and post those on the Q&A and post those on the Q&A and post those on the Q&A and post those on the Q&A and post those on the Q&A and post those on the Q&A and post those on the Q&A and post those on the Q&A and post those on the Q&A and post those on the Q&A and post those on the Q&A and post those on the Q&A and post those on the Q&A and post those on the Q&A and post those on the Q&A and post those on the Q&A and post those on the Q&A and direct those questions to either your project manager or your specific product trainer. And if you're not sure where your question goes, you can just go ahead and ask it and I will direct you to the right person or format. But please submit questions. All are welcome. And again, I just want to thank you for your time and your participation today. So from here, I'm going to minimize my screen and log into my Granicus University media manager site. So if anyone has a chance to just send a quick thumbs up or chat that you are now viewing the login page to my media manager site for Granicus University, that would be appreciated. Thanks, Josie. You're on top of it. So from a drafting and approver perspective in PEAK, everyone will start by opening their preferred web browser. And if you're not sure where to start, you can go to and navigating to the URL of your media manager site. So this login will be given to you directly by your project manager or your trainer. And it's always going to start with the name of your agency or jurisdiction.granicus.com. So we'll be working in our Granicus University session today. But this is where everyone always starts when they log into media manager or PEAK. And then I'm going to be logging in here. So I'm going to be logging in from a drafter's perspective. And then once I sign in, if you've participated in any of the previous in session one, referring to administrators, you know that once you log in, the landing page is actually our Granicus platform, the media manager site. But since I'm logging in as a drafter, once I logged in, I was brought directly to the PEAK system to my dashboard. So we're going to start from the perspective of where your drafters would log in and be brought directly into the PEAK system. So this system is comprised of the four tabs up here at the top that your users would use. And then depending on if you are an administrator or not, so I do have my Granicus drafter set up as an administrator just for training purposes. Administrators only have access to this tab here, but your drafters and approvers are going to have these three tabs. So the dashboard, of course, is what we're looking at here. And it's comprised of the top row of the page. And then the top row of the page is where you're going to see the top row. If I click on them, it are going to be a shortcut directly into this items tab. So I'm going to click on that. And then I'm going to go to the top row of the page. And I'm going to go to the items tab here just so you can see there's different categories here on the left. And then based on the item that's selected, which right now it's looking at all items in my system, I can perform a search through here if I wanted to. And then I'm going to click back to the dashboard tab. If I choose the shortcut, so as a drafter, if I clicked on the shortcut to view my items, it does take me directly to the same items tab. But now it's automatically selected the category of my individual items that I've created. And then I can still sort and search through this information if needed. So a little bit further down in the training, we are going to talk about some searching capabilities and some more information in this tab. Before we do that, I just want to talk about one other thing, the meetings tab. So I'm going to toggle back to the dashboard. So these two tiles up here, shortcut to the items tab. And then the four coming up meetings indicated here, your drafters probably have a lot of items. Some items here won't need items. Some items here won't need items. Some items here won't need items. Some items here won't need items. Some items here won't need items. Some items here won't need items. Some items here won't need items. Some items here won't need items. Some items here won't need items. Some items here won't need items. Some items here won't need items. Some items here won't need items. Some items here won't need items. Some items here won't need items. Some items here won't need items. Some items here won't need items. Some items here won't need items. Some items here won't need items. Some items here won't need items. Some items here won't need items. Some items here won't need items. Some items here won't need items. Some items here won't need items. Some items here won't need items. forward if I want to look at future meeting dates or search through there. The information that's contained in this square for this for these upcoming meetings is going to be, of course, the date and the meeting body. And then down below here, this is just showing the number of items that are scheduled and the number of items that have been approved. This information is typically more for your agenda coordinators, which we'll talk about in the next session. But it is helpful here. Sometimes your drafters will look to see this indicator here, whether or not the agenda has been finalized or not. So that is something that the drafters or approvers might look to. And then they can also use the meetings tab to view upcoming meetings as well. So you can either use this scroll bar down here to view the dates for upcoming meetings or click on the meetings tabs. Some people might prefer this one because it's a little bit prettier because you can view the calendar with the color schemes that have been applied. So drafters and approvers typically don't work within this meetings tab. They're not scheduling the calendar dates or processing the agendas, but they might just come in here to look for the date for their upcoming meeting bodies. So, again, here's my city council meeting on February 3rd. I'm creating items for this meeting date today. And other than that, this is probably going to be just for informational purposes only as it applies to drafters or approvers. They would probably not even be able to click on any of this. Some people won't even bother сторонcccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccc Creating a new agenda item is going to be by clicking the create new tab at the top. And then I'm going to choose agenda item. Now, depending on your system, you may be using different agenda templates, as you can see listed here in my system. And if you are, those would be uploaded. Your project manager can help you with that. And they would be labeled fairly straightforward. So it is pretty obvious which one to choose. Or you may not have any specific templates. So you may just simply click agenda item to open your template. So either way, you'll always click new and then either choose a template or just click write on agenda item to choose the template you'll be creating for this item. And today, I'm just going to use our basic template. So I'm going to click here. So once we open this screen to create an agenda item, you can see I picked the basic template. So it's labeled here. And I'm just going to scroll down here to give us a quick overview of the information that we're going to enter. So we're going to start with a title and possibly a suggested action. That's optional. And then as we come down here, there's going to be some drop down menus where we'll need to enter some information in the system. If there is an asterisk, that does indicate a required field. And then down here at the bottom, the pending uploads section. This is where you would be browsing your computer and uploading your supporting documentation or your attachments. So we'll talk about that information. As we're entering this information, the system is not automatically saving it. So the information won't be saved. So we're going to click here and then we're going to click here and then we're going to click create. You may notice next to my create button, I've got a little checkbox, setup approvals. So if this box is checked by default, that means as soon as I create this item, I'll be directed directly to create those approval workflows. Or you may choose to have it unchecked by default. Your users can specify if they want to go right to approvals or if they want to manually start that approval process. So we'll go over those. settings as well. So let's go back up here to the top and start entering the information for our new item that we're creating. So up over here in the top right hand corner, there is an option to make this entire agenda item confidential. And as you can see, I've hovered my cursor over so it does give a fairly straightforward description of what setting this toggle box at confidential will do. But basically, it just means that this entire item is not going to appear to the public. So if when this agenda is published, that information is not going to be included when it goes out to your view page. However, users within the system who can view this item will of course be able to see all of this information. And also all of your office members will be able to see this item when they view the information, the published agenda in the I legislate application. So once we start talking about when we're publishing our agendas, and we're making all of these items and implementing them, we're actually going to be able to see all of this information available to the public. There's actually two different processes or places we can publish the information one is to I legislate for your board members, and the other is to your view page for your public. So when it comes to confidential information, we can toggle this box and make this entire item including its attachments, confidential from the public, but still available to peak users and office members through us, I legislate. But as we move further down to the attachments, we also have an option to make this item available to the public, but maybe but just keep some of the individual attachments confidential. So we'll talk a little bit more about that when we get down to the attachments. But if I turn this on, no one in the public is going to see it except for PEAK users and office members. So I'm going to keep it off. Most commonly you do, but if anyone has any questions about that feature, please let me know. Now from here, I'm going to begin entering my item title, which is typically the first thing that you would enter. So I'm just going to type right here in the box. So both of these text fields for your item title, which is required and your suggested action, which is not required, basically have the same properties. So within each of these fields you can enter up to 5,000 characters. You can enter up to 5,000 characters. You can enter up to 5,000 characters. So you can enter up to 5,000 characters. You can enter up to 5,000 characters. You can enter up to 5,000 characters. You can utilize all of these rich text editor fields that are listed here. You can even, if you have a lot of information to put in, expand it and make it a little bit bigger so you can see everything. If you don't use the suggested action field, and as an example, if you wanted to enter like approve or adopt or something like that, if you don't use this field as part of your workflow process, we'll just skip over it. We don't have a way to remove this box. It's not going to affect any of your reports or information moving forward. So we're going to go ahead and click on the box. So we're going to go ahead and click on the box. So we're going to go ahead and click on the box. Look like something is missing. Just here when we're creating the information, we'll just have to skip over it. But as far as entering information here, you can see that my default font and size are Arial 12 point. So typically that is set in your administration settings. And at the end I will point out a few references in administration that apply to this setup of drafting items. So typically you wouldn't change the font or the point because that's set for your entire portfolio. So if you want to change the font or the point, you can do that here. agenda and all of the items on the agenda. But you do want to be careful if you wanted to use any cutting and pasting features, or if you'd like to cut and paste information from another document on your system into this text box, we always suggest that you paste that information as text. And if you do that, it's going to carry over and use the same font and type or font and size within this box. If you don't use the paste as text feature, when you're cutting and pasting into these fields, you may have some discrepancies within your fonts. And really, it's just going to make a little bit more work for you to have to go back and get them all set at the right information. So you can cut and paste information into these text boxes. And then of course, you can use any of the formatting options that are listed here as shortcuts, such as bold, italics, underlined. We can add color to our agenda items. items if we'd like, and then you can also even add a background color if you prefer. So basically, you're just highlighting the information and choosing it there. And I'll set it back. And then we've also got the bullet points if you want to make a list or even numbering information. In addition to these formatting options, there are some additional format options in the menu up here at the top. So we've got the standard ones, and then also some super strict scripts and strikethroughs, and then some other additional font information and sizes or even alignment information. So there is an option to insert a couple things. I'm going to just enter down here to the bottom. So under the insert function, you can add a horizontal line. This just breaks up information within this box. So it's just adding a line like that. And you also have the option to insert a hyperlink. So if I wanted to insert, for example, here's the URL to our post. And here we've got the post and post and site. I'll just paste this into here. And then the text that would could be displayed would just be and then you can see it added in a web link there. So that's what it will look like if you add in those links. One other thing you can add is a table. This is helpful. So I'll just kind of add in a select one here and see how it added in the table. I'll make this a little bit bigger. And then these images up here if you hover over them it gives you an idea of how you can change the properties remove it and then add rows before and after. And then I'll just click this one here and delete the table from that example. So So I'm going to remove this information here. And if you want to remove that line, I just click the backspace like delete to remove the line as well. So again, when you first start off creating your item, the first thing most everyone is going to do is enter the item title in this rich text editor box. It holds up to 5,000 characters. You can use any of these editing functions or formatting functions. And then you can also cut and paste into the system. But we'll highly recommend that you paste as text so you can keep the same font and formatting. So I'll just pause for a moment to see if anyone has any questions about entering the item title. And then same information applies if you're adding a suggested action. And if you don't, you can skip over that part. So it looks like we don't have any questions so far. Perfect. So we'll move right along. I'm just going to scroll down here and add in the rest or some more information to my item. So these. Fields in here. Again, we've got red asterisk. So this is going to be the information that is required. Now the item type. This list of options are configured in administration. This is just classifying the type of item this is. It is not going to indicate where this item will be placed on the agenda. That's going to be down here under agenda sections. So this is just classifying what type of an item this is. And I'm just going to make this a resolution. And then right next to the item. Type field. You can see the item ID. I'm not able to enter any information or select. So once we're ready to create this item, then the system will automatically assign it an ID number. So remember, none of this information that we're entering has been saved or even uploaded into the system yet. So the peak system doesn't know any of this information exists until we click create. So at that time is when the system will gather the information and assigned an item ID. So below that, it's going to be our submitting department. And these departments, again, are specified in administration. And then the drafter. So the name of the drafter creating this item will automatically be filled in in this area. So I am set as a peak administrator status. So I do have the ability to select a different drafter to assign to this item. So if an administrator were creating an item, this means that you are assigning editing capability. So you can also assign editing capabilities to another drafter in your organization. So whatever name of drafter is listed here is the drafter that has editing capabilities. And of course, any system administrators can edit that information as well. Other drafters in this system will be able to view this information. They just won't be able to edit any information on the item. So moving down to the meeting body, meeting date and the agenda sections, you will have to specify this information. In order, body, date, sections. If you see if I try to click a section, of course, it doesn't know what section to use because I haven't indicated who the meeting body is. And if I want to select a meeting date, there are none listed because it doesn't know what meeting body to look for dates for, of course. So we'll always start with entering the meeting body first. And I'm creating items for my city council on the February 3rd agenda. And then now I can come down here and choose my agenda section. So I'll scroll down and put this on the consent agenda. Now, you can specify to have this item placed in more than one section on your agenda. It's not very common, but the system does allow you to do it. If I wanted it to be with resolutions and on the consent agenda, I could list both. You can keep adding them there. In this example, I'm just going to keep this in one agenda section. Now, from the drafting perspective and selecting the meeting date. There is an option in PEAK for your agenda coordinators to specify a submission deadline and also a cutoff time. So if that information has been specified for this meeting, the drafter would not necessarily be made aware, but this meeting date of February 3rd would not be displayed in this drop down menu. So if the agenda coordinator for the city council meeting on February 3rd had entered a submission deadline or a cutoff time, then the draft would not be displayed in this drop down menu. For this meeting and let's just say that it was this morning or if it was at 8 a.m., then that removes this meeting date from the list here. So your drafters would not be able to select it or even see it as an option. They would be able to see it in the meetings tab and they would be able to see it on their dashboard, but they just wouldn't be able to select it when they're creating the item. So that's what happens in the drafting perspective if you're using that items submission deadline option. So. I toggled around with this date here, so I'm going to go back and select my agenda section. You can add additional item fields below this information if you want, such as information to make it fun, or if you don't care about Marvel movies, or but of course, if there is additional information that you would like to be included when your drafters are creating items, we can add additional fields here. We do recommend that you talk to your project manager about that, because typically when you add additional fields, we do need to make sure that your reports are going to include those additional fields, so there's some other configurations that would need to be done within the system, and so keep that in mind with the fields. I'm going to pause just for a moment and look at this question in the chat window. Oh, so the question is, is there an option to allow a drafter to create an item that you would like to be included in the system? If so, please feel free to ask. I'm assuming for a meeting, if the deadline is passed, if you're referring to the deadline as in the cutoff deadline, then a drafter, as far as their permissions within the system, would not be able to create an item, so it would have to be someone with permissions to create items past the deadline, and typically that would always be a system administrator, and potentially your settings would include an agenda coordinator as well. So we've got a question here. If you can please let me know that I've... As an administrator, you cannot allow a drafter to pick the date because it is based on their permissions in the system, so when your drafter logs in, they have just drafter permissions, and the setting determines who can create an item after the deadline has been. So if you, in that instance, you would either have to create the item yourself, as an administrator, or maybe make one of your... Someone who is a drafter, you might need to give them additional permissions. And yes, submission deadlines are optional, so it's something that when the agenda coordinator creates the calendar date in this system, they have the option to add in those submission deadlines when they create the meeting, or go in when they're getting ready to start processing the agenda, and then add in those submission deadlines at a later time. Definitely optional. And I'm not sure... So I hope I'm pronouncing your name right, if it's Stina. So if you, Stina, could let me know that I answered that question, I'd appreciate it. Or if you need me to follow up on anything, please let me know. And at this point, I'm going to take another quick pause, and before we move on to the process for uploading information. Okay. Oh, yeah. Oh, I got you. Yes, we all have drafters who routinely miss their deadlines, don't we? So perfect. Yeah. And then your trainer can help you figure out, maybe based on the way your system and your process is, if maybe you could allow some of those people to be administrators or have higher levels of permissions in the system. So... Great. Thanks. Okay. So now let's move on to this pending upload section. This is where you're going to upload your supporting documentation or your attachments, which they're most commonly referred to as. So we're simply going to come down to this box and click browse your computer, and then this launches the window where you would be browsing through your network or folders on your workstation to add information. So I'm going to click my first document and click open. Oh, I'll click another one then. So once I select my document to upload, now remember, these aren't uploaded yet. These are just waiting. They're pending to be uploaded into the system. I have two options for each attachment. So the first thing I can do is edit the name. So this is the name that the attachment was on my computer network. If I wanted to change anything in here, I could. Now I'm not changing the name, of course, whatever it's named on my, my system, but this is going to be the name, the new name of it when we upload it. And then there are three different attachment privacy options. So the default is the most common on the agenda for everyone to see. So basically that means that we talked kind of earlier when we were talking about making this item confidential, we've got the public who can see everything. We've got our office members who can see the agenda through the iLegislate application. And then we've got our peak users. So on the agenda for everyone to see means that those three groups of people can, will all be able to see this attachment. If we change it to on the agenda, but confidential, that means it's still going to be on the agenda. So your office members can see this attachment, but the public will not be able to see it. So confidential, public cannot see it. And then the third option is not on the agenda at all. So this means that only users within the peak system would be able to see this attachment. So I'm going to add another, I'm going to add another document to the attachment real quick, and then I'll review those options one more time. So I'm going to browse here and add in another document. This time I'll do an Excel. So again, I can edit the name and I can set my privacy either on the agenda for everyone to see on the agenda, but confidential, meaning the public cannot see it, but your office members will see it in iLegislate. And the peak users, of course, will be able to see this specific attachment. And then the third option is not on the agenda at all. So only peak users when they're logged into the system can see this particular item. So these privacy settings are per each individual attachment. So you can upload as many attachments as you would like. We do recommend keeping the file size of each attachment no larger than 100 megabytes, mainly because when it comes time to process your agenda, you're going to have to have a lot of time to process your agenda. So you're going to have to have a lot of time to process your agenda. And then on the second option is on the agenda packet. Those large file sizes can really slow down that process. But also we've found because we're publishing these files to the public, any documents that are larger than 100 megabytes can sometimes be difficult for the public to download. So just in taking that into consideration, that's typically why we're recommending that you keep these attachments at 100 megabytes. The system can certainly handle larger attachments. We're just looking at our process for creating our agenda packet and making sure that the constituents can easily access those documents. the information when they download it from your view page. So if you had something that was a really large file that you would potentially want to include with this item, what we would recommend is back up here in the item title field when we were inserting a link is potentially inserting a link to that information where they could either click to download it for purposes like that. So so at this point we've gone through and entered all of our the first part of our information. Entered our item title. We talked about the confidential aspect. If you want to add a suggested action such as adopt or approve or amend that would be entered here but we can skip over that if it doesn't apply to your workflow. And then we've filled in all of the necessary fields within here. We've determined if you wanted to enter some additional item fields you could add those into your system. So you could add those to your system. So you could add those to your system. If needed and then we've uploaded our documents. So or we've added our documents to be potentially uploaded. So at this point now we're ready to create. So I am going to uncheck setup approvals just because I'm not ready to create my workflow just yet. That's optional for you if you if you wanted to go right into that section. But at this point I'm going to click create. And at this time this is where all of this information is now being uploaded into your peak system. So we've got some additional information on our screen now that we've actually got all this information loaded in. So starting off at the top this summary box up here is indicating that this item is in draft mode. Here's the file ID. So the system assigned this ID number once we created the file. So now we have our new file ID. Of course the name of our title is here. And then we have our current title. And then we can very easily expand and click on these attachments to view that information if needed. There's a couple pieces of information over here that reference some information we'll talk about coming up in just a few moments. The first one is this V1 indicates that this is version one of this agenda item. And if we wanted to create additional versions we would use this button. So I'll be talking about this option and how that might apply to your workflow. And then also cover page included. So over here in this page we have our new page. And then we have this toolbar. We have an option to use this button to toggle that off and on. So I turned it off and I can turn it on. So the cover page you might refer to cover page as something different in your organization. Some places call it a staff report or a cover memo or an agenda title page. So the peak system calls it a cover page. And that's the cover page that is included on your agenda packet at the beginning of all of your attachments of course. Once we get all this information loaded in and discussed we'll actually download so we can view what our cover page is going to look like. By default your system or my system is including a cover page every time it creates an item that is a setting in administration that you can turn off. An example of when you may want to not include a cover page is if you have an item that might not require it such as a minutes or something like that. So that would be the purpose of the cover page and then also over here in the upper right we have the item discussion options. So this is going to be used more often in our approval process once we get to that point of the session. But as this item is is in your system or working through your approval process this just allows users within the system to communicate information about the item. It is not available to the public. This information can only stay here within the system. So only users who have access to view this item in PEAK will ever see what the item discussion is. So that would be the drafter of the item or any approvers as they work through the system. So we'll do some examples of entering item discussion information as well today. I just want to come over here and go over a couple other things in this taskbar. The editing item lock button is, of course, unlocked because we're still processing this item. Depending on your user or your permissions, you can lock an item and then unlock an item. Below that is an option to set to approved. So if you have an item that does not need to go through your approval process, you can simply click set to approved and it changes it here. And then again, if you have permissions, you can unlock the item and I'll set it back to draft. So set to approved or set to draft. The option is there. Now you also have an option to duplicate an item and I'll show you an example of that coming up. So if we have an item where all of the information needed is for the most part the same, we can duplicate everything from the item title to all of the attachments to the workflow. We'll just create an entirely new item number. And when I show you that one, I'll also show the example of a volume. So we'll select the volume and we'll select duplicate items and we'll select duplicate items. And we'll select duplicate items and we'll select duplicate items and we'll select duplicate items. And we'll select duplicate items and we'll select duplicate items and we'll select duplicate items. And we'll select duplicate items and we'll select duplicate items and we'll select duplicate items. And we'll select duplicate items and we'll select duplicate items and we'll select duplicate items. And we'll select duplicate items and we'll select duplicate items and we'll select duplicate items. And we'll select duplicate items and we'll select duplicate items and we'll select duplicate items. And we'll select duplicate items and we'll select duplicate items and we'll select duplicate items. out. And then moving down to the cover page, we talked about this being included. And then sometimes at this point is when your drafters might want to view what the cover page is going to look like or what this information is going to look like when it is presented to the public. So that's when we would use the download button. And we have an option to download just the cover page or the entire item packet in three different formats, either Microsoft Word, PDF, or HTML. So I'm going to click download the cover page as a PDF. That's most common. So I'll click download from here. And you can just monitor this here and it will let you know when it's done. And then I'll click download again to open it. So it just opened my cover page in a new tab. So if I toggle over here, I'm still in peak. I just have a new tab. So the report that I've generated, so this is, of course, just our test. Staff report. So you can see we've labeled it staff report instead of cover page. So if you happen to be following along in your system and you've generated a cover report, and maybe it's not what you were expecting, it could potentially still be in the process of completing some requests that you had made for that report. Or if you've generated a report and it looks pretty good, but you might want to make some additional changes, the process for requesting changes to this staff report through Granicus would go through here. Project. Manager. And what we would ask you to do is mark up this document, you know, either write in if there's information you don't want, you can exit out. If there's additional information here that you would like to be included on this report, go ahead and add that in and then you would submit that to your project manager and we can get that taken care of in your system. So if anyone generated a cover report, don't panic. If it's not what you want, we'll definitely get it up to your liking. Definitely. So I'm going to close this tab. So we were in the download section. I just did the cover page right now. But if you want to do the item and the packet or the item packet, that means it's going to show you what the cover page and then all of the attachments will look like. So there's two different options here, public or council. This kind of comes back to those attachments, those three different attachment options that we had as far as making them available to the public or the council or just peak users. So for here, public, as you can see, this description is showing that it will not include item attachments marked confidential. If you ran one for the council, then you can see this will include all attachments from there. So most of the time you're always going to do for public because you're wanting to know what the public is going to see. So then from here, I'll just click create or generate packet and then it does take a few seconds to populate that information. And then it gives you another warning here in this text when it's ready for you to click the download button to view it. So sometimes it takes a few seconds, just depending on your system. But essentially what's going to be generated here is going to be our cover page that we just viewed. And then we uploaded two different attachments. So we'll scroll down through our different attached documents. I'll click here on download. So open it up in a new window. And we have our staff report and our first attachment and not our third attachment. So from here. I'm going to come back down here and look at my attachments. Oh yes. So here's why only my one attachment is. So this one was made hidden. So you can see that is what the public would have seen in this instance because this setting was set at hidden. So you can edit the information with these attachments after your post. you've created the document. So if you remember when we were uploading this information, we could edit the name and then set, you know, your permissions, hidden or public. From here, we'll be able to use the icons, either the pencil icon to edit, the four-point icon rearranges the order, and then you've got the trash can if you wanted to remove an item. So if I click here on the pencil icon, this allows me to edit this item, and then I'll make sure I put it on the agenda for everyone to see. I also have the option to replace this attachment if I wanted to, and I'll just click update. Now the order these attachments are listed here is the order they're going to be listed for the public, and also the order they're going to be in the package. So once after the cover sheet, the first attachment is going to be this Word document, and then after that one, it's going to be this one. If you would like them to be in a specific order, of course, you may need to rearrange them using the four-point arrow, so you just drag and move. them down and around. Back up here to the top. So we've gone through, we've created our item, we've reviewed the information that's available to us after we've created it. Reminder that the system does not automatically save, so you do want to make sure that you, after you make a change, you come down here and click the save button. So moving on from the item details. There are two other tabs listed here once we create the item. So the approval status tab is where we're going to enter in our workflow. So we'll be coming back to that in just a moment. But I do just want to click here on the item history to point out the information available here. So the item history is basically an audit trail of everything that's happened for this item, beginning at the top with the date and time that it was created, and then just working its way down as far as any specific changes or actions that were made. So we're going to go ahead and click on the item history tab. And then we're going to go ahead and click on the item history tab. So the user name of the person who created the item or made any of these changes is also part of that history. So again, all of this information would be in the item history tab. So by default, whenever you open an item or want to review it, it will always be on item details. And then you'll have to know to toggle over here. I'm just going to take one quick pause to see if there are any questions before we move on to the approval status tab where we're going to add the item history. So we're going to go ahead and click on the item history tab. And then we're going to add the item history tab. And then we're going to click on the item history tab. And then we're going to add the item history tab. And then we're going to add the item history tab. And then we're going to click on the item history tab. And then we're going to add the item history tab. And then we're going to add the item history tab. And then we're going to click on the item history tab. And then we're going to click on the item history tab. And then we're going to add the item history tab. And then we're going to click on the item history tab. And then we're going to click on the item history tab. And then we're going to add the item history tab. And then we're going to click on the item history tab. And then we're going to when you're ready to start a workflow, you can create an entire new workflow by clicking here, or you can choose a preset workflow from this drop-down menu. We recommend presetting workflows just because it streams on your process and makes it a little faster for your drafters to get these items processed into your system. If you do choose a preset workflow, you do always have the options to edit that workflow, so I'll be going over those options. Now, the list of workflows that are listed here can be filtered based on the user or the department, so you can create a workflow that is available to all users, so everyone can always see it in this list. You could create an approval that is just for a specific user, so we can make an approval that just the Granicus drafter can see when they're logged into the system. For example, if the Granicus drafter is the only person who ever creates approvals for the library board, you could only allow that for that person. Then you can also base it based on department, and that's the most common filtering way. When you create a new user in the system, we always recommend that you assign them to their department, and then that would also help associate or filter the different sequences that are available for here. So, I'm going to select the test for training sequence just to show you. I'll show you a couple different options. This is a fairly straightforward sequence. You can see we have three different stages. So, this first person, Seth, is the first person who's going to be assigned to the department. And he'll post the first post on the сторонcetutcccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccc like it, you can always go back and select another one. So I'm going to pull up a different workflow just so you can see how they can be configured a little bit different ways. So you can have more than one approver in a phase or a box at a time. So this sequence starts with one phase where we actually have two different approvers going through the approval process at the same time. So both Betty Smith and the Granicus approver can be reviewing and approving this item at the same time, and it will not move on to the next phase down here until everyone in this phase has approved the item. So you can set up your workflows to go through one approver at a time, or you can group them together in stages, or you may refer to them as phases. You can have really an unlimited number of people going through at one time, but realistically, maybe you would have three or four if you needed to. So I am going to select to use this workflow. So I'm going to click You. this workflow. And now once I've selected this workflow, I do have the option as a drafter to make any edits or changes to this if I feel it's necessary before I decide to initiate the workflow. And I can do that just by clicking the pencil icon to edit any of these phases. So I could simply click the trash can and delete the whole phase if I didn't think it was necessary. I could use the four point arrows and swap the order of these phases if I wanted them to go in a different order. Or I'll click the pencil icon and maybe I've determined that Betty Smith doesn't even need to be part of this particular workflow. So I just simply deleted her and I can save it. So now I only have one person. And then maybe I've determined that down here I'll add another person to this workflow. So if I click add approver, I can see that I have a person. There's two different types of approvers in the system. An approver is what you would probably most significantly identify with. That's the person who reviews the item and they can approve or delegate the information, which we'll talk more about delegating. And FYI is still considered an approver, but they're not going to be taking action on the item. They're just going to or even editing the item. They're just going to be reviewing the information. So they're really just getting an FYI notification that this item exists in the system. So a lot of times people will put your FYI's in the last phase. And then that's communicated to everyone in your organization that if you're an FYI and you get a notification, that means that the item has been approved or that means it's gone through your entire process. So you have those different options to work through if you'd like to. But if I decide I want to add another approver into this sequence, I'll just choose their name and click add. So now I've added three people here. go back to my, I'll just click my checkbox and save. So you can see Brandon here is an FYI approver because the I above his head indicates that that is his status for approval. So potentially I could remove him out of this sequence. And I could add, I could add another phase and just put my FYIs at the end. So you can see I did start with choosing a preset workflow option, but then I did have full capabilities to edit and arrange it if I needed to make any specifications for this particular item. So all drafters do have the ability to edit that information. So the idea is we would want these workflows to be set up as close as possible to what they would need without having to make all of those changes. And then at this point, since I made so many changes, I could choose save as a template. So that's, it's available in the future. If I don't like it, I could just remove it all together and start over. But at this point, I'm going to click initialize workflow. I'm going to go ahead and start this approval process. So I'll click initialize workflow. Laura Benz сторонcée au сторонcée au сторонcée au сторонcée au сторонcée au! Notice down here, restart workflow. Sometimes this label is a little misleading. Restart workflow actually cancels the whole workflow. So if I were to click restart workflow now, it would actually delete or remove all of this information. And I would be back from square one where I would need to start with an entirely new workflow. Now, any approvers in the current phase would receive an email notification if that did happen. But just just a quick note, restart workflow is the same thing as cancel workflow, just labeled a little bit differently. So I'm going to pause for another moment to see if anyone has any questions about going into the approval status and selecting a workflow or making any edits and then initiating that workflow. Okay, so I don't see there any questions in the chat window. So thanks so much. I assume you're all still out there with me. If anybody wants to send in an emoji or a signal to let me know, you can still hear me loud and clear. That would be great. Gotcha. Thanks, Josie. I knew I could count on you. Okay. So from here, I do want to back up to a couple of the options that we had when we were creating items in regards to the new version option and also the duplicate items. So I'm going to go ahead and click on the duplicate item and show you how those work. And then once we're done with that, we're going to I'm going to log out and I'm going to log in as the approver. And we'll walk through the steps that the approver will go through when they're working with the items. So from here, I'm going to go up to my items tab and pull up all of my current items. And I'm going to select an item that already exists in this system. I'll just select this first one here. So I'm just going to click the pencil icon over here. This allows me to open this item. And. Edit or work on any specific information. So working with this item, I'm going to I'll show you an example of duplicating the item and then also creating a new version. So if I click on duplicate, which I'm going to do now, actually, let me the main thing that's going to change. Sorry, I didn't duplicate yet is this item number. So we're basically copying most everything in this item, but you'll see this number is going to change to a new one. It's not going to be 39 anymore. So they click duplicate and then I'll say yes. And duplicate is the same as copy. I know most of you probably know that, but for some reason, calling it duplicate does seem to throw people off, especially if you're used to using the term as copy file in your previous systems. But peak refers to it as duplicate item. So sometimes that throws people off or they don't know to look in this spot for that feature. So you can see now we've got a new file ID number. Now we're on 41. But we've got the same title of our item. We've got all of the same attachments. And then as I scroll through here, all of this information remains the same, except you can see we don't have a meeting date or an agenda section. So all of this other information duplicated or copied over, including here I am. This is my name, the drafter. So I'm going to go ahead and copy this. So from here I can just move forward and select an upcoming date and add in my agenda section. So when you use the duplicate item option, again, basically everything is being duplicated, except the file ID, which is assigned a new one. And then also you will need to enter the meeting date and specify the agenda section. And then when you click save, then that will, of course, save all the specific information. So now we've added this duplicate item with a new file ID to an upcoming city council date. So that's an example of the duplicate item. So now with this particular item that we've duplicated, I want to demonstrate an example of using the new version feature. So new version is not the same as a duplicate because we're actually going to keep working with the same item number. So this item, Grand U 41, we're always going to be working with this same item. Excuse me. So I'm going to click new version. Also note up here is where we're going to begin seeing or determining what versions we're on. So once I click a new version, I'll just specify, yes, I'd like to do that. So now you can see up here in the summary box, we've got our same item number, but now we're on V2 or version two. And then below the summary box, we can actually toggle back and forth between the different versions here. So if I click on version one. There's version one. Notice I can't pick a new version there. And then I'll come back here to version two, which is the one that I just specified. So you can see all of the information copied over, including the ID number. And then as I scroll down here with the information, you can see just as before, though, we do have to specify a meeting date and an agenda section. So I'll select. We've got the same attachments, of course, you can edit that information or attach additional information. Now, with the new version, there are some specific information that you are going to want to know. So you can only edit the current version. So you see I'm on version two. So if I wanted to change anything. I can just click on the new version. So if I wanted to change anything in here, I can edit. But if I come over here to version one, you'll see that it's just basically a summary of the information. There's nowhere in here I could change the item title or I could even manage or edit the attachments. So if you create a new version, you can only edit the most current version. You also can't add new versions while the item is going through your workflow process. So if I once I start the approval process of this item, the new version, as we noticed before, it becomes grayed out. So you can't create a new version while your item is under the workflow process. So an example when you might use a new version is if you have items that have been referred or tabled or amended. This just allows you to keep all of the information located under the same file ID within the system and then go through the different versions. Keeping all of the information contained together. Now, when you publish these versions to the public, they are only going to see the version on the meeting date that we have selected. So version two, the public is only going to see version two on the meeting that we select here. Oh, I forgot to save. I do that a lot in this system. OK, let me save this version. So the public is only going to see version two on the March 17 City Council meeting when it's published. If they want to see version one, then they would have to look on the City Council meeting for this date. So I'm going to take another moment to pause to see if there are any questions about drafting items and using the duplicate items. but you're likely to have some more questions about the new item feature or copy item feature or the new version feature. I did just send through the chat box a link to our support site that has information about versioning. Sometimes it can be a little confusing. So if that's helpful to anyone, I did send a link through the chat box. And I see there's a couple questions. So I'll look those over real quick. Yes. The question is, so could you potentially use versions for ordinances that require second readings? Yes, that is a very common use of the versions where they would come into version two and the title would be second reading of ordinance. And then version one would say first reading of ordinance. So yes, perfect example. And then yeah, there is a question about if you can duplicate an item instead of creating a new version. So you can. It really just depends on how you want the information to be stored in your system. Because remember, a duplicate item creates a whole new file ID. So when you're searching for that information in the system, all the versions stay together under one file ID. So if you duplicate an item and then you want to create a new version, then you need to duplicate Now you end up with more than one file in the system with that information. So you can definitely choose to duplicate instead of new version. It just really depends on your specific process. So let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on either of those. And Okay, so moving back to our agenda item that we just is under review. I'm going to go to my items tab and we were doing the purchase of laptops. So this is the one that we just sent through the approval process. So at this point now, you might be wondering, well, what as a draft or what can I do while this item is under approval? So remember, you can't make a new version. We just talked about that. Oh, the Granicus ID. Are you referring to this ID? So this is the file ID that there's a question on if we could elaborate on what the Granicus ID means. So I'm just going to back up a step. The file ID is what gets assigned. So, you can see here, And you can see the number of items that you can find here after you create an item. And that's the idea that is a unique to the peak system associated with this item. So you can search the system based on the ID. It's kind of like a house number. Like if you know you, if you live at house number 2946, that's just where your house is located on the block. It's kind of this is where this item number is located in the system. So, hopefully that answered your question, Josie. But let me know if you need more details. We just have our system. And what might be confusing, let me come back to this. We have our system with a prefix, Gran U, and then adding this significant number in the middle, and then with the date at the end. But you might in your system, maybe just use a number like 40-2022 or something like that, and not really have a prefix with any characters at the beginning. So 40-2022 might be a, a better indicator of how you would use a file ID. Okay. So moving down here. So back to our item. So now we've put our item through the approval process. But as a drafter, what can we do while this item is going through approval? So number one, what are also, what if we needed to edit any information? So maybe we decided we needed to edit the name of the title, or maybe we have another attachment that we need to add. So, we can just add a document to the document. And if you did, so I'm going to come down here, and browse my computer and just add an attachment. So we're going to just pull up a specific document here, and I'm going to save it. So I've added this attachment. But now no one really knows that I changed this item. Remember we've got our current approver is the Granicus approver. So that's when the item discussion usually comes into play. So the only way that the current or any previous approvers would know that any edits were made to this item during the approval process is if you document those changes in the item discussion. So I'll just say added new attachment. And then I can reference that a specific attachment if I needed to. So I'll just add this one. And then when I click comment, it's going to start keeping a running dialogue here throughout the system. So now the drafter of the item always gets a notice when there's discussions added. But also any current or previous approvers will get notified as well. So if the Granicus approver hasn't had a chance to come in here yet, or maybe reviewed it, but needs to come back a little later to take action, they'll know that something was changed. So that's a perfect example of when you would use the item discussion. And then just remember, none of this information is available to the public. It's only available to peak users who can come in the system and see this particular item. So one thing you can do while your item is under review, you can make changes or edits, but we always recommend that you document those under the item discussion. The next thing that you can do is maybe edit anything under the approval status or the approval process. So maybe I'll just say, I heard that the Granicus approver went out of town for a week and isn't even going to be able to approve this item. I could click skip workflow and it would skip this entire phase and just move on down to the next phase. So you do have the option to skip workflow approval. It does skip that whole phase. These approvers in this phase would get notification about that, of course. Or you have the option just to send them a quick reminder or notification. If I just click this email button, the system will send out an email to the Granicus approver. As a friendly reminder, there's an item waiting for their approval. So and then down here at the bottom, remember that the you can also restart the workflow, but that's just canceling the whole workflow. So if you wanted to restart or cancel the whole workflow and start all over again, you could do that as well. You probably wouldn't do that after you've gotten too far into that workflow process, but it is something that you can do after you have already sensed this item through the approval process. So from here, I am going to move on. I'm going to log out at this point, and I'm going to log back in as the approver. So you can see what it looks like from that aspect. And then we'll go through the options that your approvers have once they're moving through your workflow. So I'm going to come up here and sign out. And then I'll come back in here and sign in. And this is going to bring me directly into my workflow. So I'm going to go back to my peak dashboard, and now you can see I'm the Granicus approver, and I've got three items waiting for my approval. Now, there are two different ways that your approvers get notified if they have an item waiting for their approval. There's an email notification, or there is when they log in, of course, they'll just see they have items waiting here. So I'm going to pull up the email notification that is received. And slide it over onto this screen so you can see what that looks like. So the Granicus approver was the first approver in that phase. So when we initiated that workflow, this is the email notification that went out. So it comes from noreplyatpeakagenda.com. And then it'll say hello to the approver's name. And then the information that's contained in this email, it does have quite a few detailed information. We've got the type of item that it is. We've got the peak file ID number. It's also indicating the name of the drafter who submitted the item. And then we've also got, you know, the target meeting date and the meeting body. So I know I've got a city council meeting on February 3rd that this item, purchased laptops for training rooms, is waiting for my approval. And so from here, I could just click on this link, purchase laptops, and it would take me directly to the login page on my web browser for media manager or peak. So we can click right there and it takes us there. But also if I'm a frequent or an active user within the peak system, when I come to my dashboard, the number of items waiting for my approval always lists here. So once I'm logged in, I'll just click on the number of items waiting for my approval. So remember that box always directly takes us to a shortcut to the items tab, but it selects the specific category that I've selected. So needs my approval. So these are the items that I've selected. So now I've got a couple more items waiting for my approval. I'm going to start with my purchase of laptops. So I'm going to click on the pencil icon that's going to open it up and let me view this information. So from here as the approver, you can see I have a lot of the same information now that the summary box up here, you can see now shows that this item is in review. I can simply click on any of these attachments and they will launch, and I can open and review the information. Okay, And then as I scroll down here, I can review. And as an approver, I can make any edits to the information that was entered here. And I can also attach additional documentation or edit any of the attachments that currently are here. So as an example, or remember, we have our item discussion box here. So if I do make any changes, then it would be recommended that I add it into the item discussion. So maybe I just want to change the name of this. There we go. So I've changed the title. I'll click save. So then I'm just going to add over here. And then I'll click comment. And again, whenever you add in a comment, the drafter and any current or previous approvers will get an email notification from that. So from this point, once we've reviewed the information and made any changes or edits, so again, same types of editing that you can do as a drafter, that's when you would be ready to move on to the approval status. So this is where we can. So we can see where we are in the current workflow process and who will be coming further down or who had previously. And then within our face box, you can see we've got two different options. So thumbs up, I approve. You can even hover over it and it gives you that option. Or this person, this is the delegate function. So I'm going to start off with first we'll approve an item and then I'll pull up one of those other items and we'll do an example of delegating. So you can see how both of those work. So. Okay. So we've got two items here. Now, if there were other people in my same phase and I was the first person to approve, then it would still show the green checkbox above my head, but the other approvers, it would show if we were still waiting on them. So all of the approvers, of course, in a specific phase have to approve before it can move on to the next one. So that was an example of improving an item. I'm going to go back into my items list and select an item and show you an example of delegating an item. So I pulled up my items that need my approval. We're going to go to this next one here. I'll click the pencil icon to open this. And then just as before, I can go through and review this information, determine if there are any item discussions. And then under approval status, this is where I'm going to use the delegate button. So I'll click here on this icon. And then from here, this is a list of other users in the system or the person that I would want to delegate this information to. So I'll pick Joe Drafter. And then when I click delegate, you'll see that it has a message. And then it says, Joe Drafter has immediately changed the person in this phase from my name as the Guernicus approver to Joe Drafter. So Joe Drafter would have received an email notification that he's been delegated this item. But I now do not have any permissions to edit or you can see even approve anymore because my name is immediately removed from that phase. So again, your approvers have two options when they are asked to take action on an item. One is to click the thumbs up and approve it. And the other is to click the button. And the other one is to delegate to another user. So sometimes that delegate is used if you have an approver who maybe is going out of town and won't have time to review an item before it goes on to the agenda. That's when that feature is used. They'll just go through their pending items and delegate to someone else. And typically they would communicate that information with the person they are delegating to. And it works from there. So I'm just going to take another quick pause to see if anyone has any questions. So our next item is our process for approving items. And then there's a couple other things that I do want to go over within the system. We'll talk about searching and a couple pieces of information. I know a lot of people on the call our administrators. So we'll go into admin and reference some information as it pertains to drafting these items. So let me know if you have any questions. Okay. So our next item is our process for approving our items. So our next item is our process for approving our items. So let me know if you have any questions. So our next item is our process for approving items. So our next item is our process for approving items. So our next item is our process for approving items. Okay. So our next item is our process for approving items. Okay. So our next item is our process for approving items. Okay. So our next item is our process for approving items. this drafting and approving process, especially your approval workflow, there are a lot of email notifications that are being sent out as far as if from as simple as an item needs to be approved as someone added to the item discussion. So I sent that link again through the chat window. If anyone's interested, you can click there and that'll take you directly to some more details on our support site about that specific information. So from here, I am going to, I'm going to go back to my items tab and talk a little bit about searching within the system. So the way the searching works here within Peak, it's kind of a little bit like if you're doing some online shopping, you've got some categories over here on the left where you can filter down like what items need my approval or I have previously approved. And so when you specify here, then you can narrow down your search criteria among that category. So over here, it's going to take you to the search criteria. And then you can go back to my items tab and talk a little bit more about searching within the system. So if you're looking for items that are on a specific meeting date, so we're, if we wanted to pull up all the items that are on our February 3rd meeting date, you're going to want to go into the search window and you're going to want to meeting. You can see here's all of those. I can view which ones have been approved or are still in review. And then you could even narrow it down even further by department or even by items. So if you wanted to export these results to a CSV file, you can. So it basically just creates a spreadsheet of all of the items that were the results of your search criteria. And then you've got some additional ways to, right now the default is always on the simple search. But if you move over to an advanced search, you can actually get into much more detailed information. If you're looking for something like you remember what the title is, but you can't remember the ID in the system. If you wanted to look for all of the items that a certain user has drafted or created in the system, you can search that way. So only one approver has ever drafted items. Toggle back here. Edit my edge search. And then you can even go through, actually move back to this simple search. In the search field here, this is just going to search through and kind of give you a highlight of the attachments that have those words in it. So you can see it pulled up the items of my mosquito surveillance, but it also highlighted the attachments that might have those titles in them as well. So definitely some advanced searching capabilities. Or again, you can keep it simple if you want. But basically, all of that is categorized within the items tab here within the peak system. So from here, I am going to go back and pull up my template that I was using when I was creating a new item. I just wanted to cross reference some things for the next slide. So I'm going to go back to the our! So your drafters probably are not going to have administration rights. But once we're here in administration, the meetings category, this is where all your meeting bodies are listed and your body types. And then if I come down here to agenda items, this is the field and administration that really most specifically applies to creating new items. So in the item types section, these are all of the options that will appear in that drop down menu. You can add new records or you can edit any of the existing ones. Or of course, remove them by clicking the trashcan. We've got item IDs. So this is where you can see that our peak system is adding a prefix to our file ID in addition to a number and the year. So the prefix and the suffix are optional. So you may just want to have a running number and you may want to add the year. If you're using the year, then of course once a year someone in administration does need to come in and change or update the year in that field. So, if you wanted to add additional item fields, you would do that through this section. Again, we do want to make sure that you communicate with your project manager to make sure if you are adding item fields that they will be included on your reports. And then this is the item approval section. So all of those workflows that were available once we went to add in, send this through the workflow process while we were creating our item, those are all created within here. So you can go through and view any of the current workflows. You can either create workflows or edit them, or you can add a new workflow. So if we click here on add workflow, this gives us the ability to assign it to just a specific user or just a specific department. And then if I don't assign it, this workflow is available to everyone, and then this would be where you would name it and when you can begin building out that information. So again from the administration tab under the agenda item section, this is where these fields pertain to creating your items and the specific information that you're going to request from your drafters. So I'm going to go back to my dashboard and take another quick break to see if there are any questions about the information that we've discussed so far before I wrap it up. Okay, a couple other things I just want to point out if you ever have questions about our peak system or our peak process, we always have the help center is listed here in the upper right hand corner. So this is a quick link directly to our Granicus support site. It's support.granicus.com. So you can always just type in this web address and go directly there. So I'm going to put this in the chat box as well for everyone. So once you're on the Granicus support site, then this lists all of our products. And then here would be the peak agenda. So you can always click into here and then search our knowledge base, ask a specific question about peak or use any of the shortcuts here to get specific information. So everyone has access to the support site. And then there are different areas within the system. I just came into the items tab here where you'll see a guide me section. And by clicking here, this does start a guide of just walking you through different areas within the system and giving you a brief description of what that field would do. So the guide me is a little more short and straightforward. And if you're looking for much more detailed information, then you can go to our help center or our support site. So just as a quick review everything that we've covered today. So we started off I was logged in as a Granicus drafter. So when your drafters and your approvers log into the system, they will be brought directly to your peak system and view their dashboard. So the dashboard is going to show specifically for that user the number of items they've created in the system and the number of items that are waiting for their approval. If they are not an approver, of course, it would always show zero. And then again, these two shortcuts will take you directly into the items tab. And then the four most current items here on the dashboard and they'll show up on the dashboard and they'll show up on the post and post and post and post and post and post and post and post and post and post and post and post and post and post and post and post and post and post and post and post and post and post and post and post and post and post and post and post and post and post and post and post and post and post and post and post and post and post and post and post and post and post and post and post and post and post and post and post and post and post and post and post and post and post and post and post and post and post and post and post and post and post and post and post and post and post and post and post and post and post and post and post and post and post and post and post and post and post and post and post and post and post and post and post and post and post and post and post and post and post and post and post and post and post and post and post and post and post and post and post and post permissions to come into some advanced settings here in this column where they can actually go and view details or even open an agenda or minutes. But they would just look at the status like final or draft if needed. So drafters do and approvers do spend a lot of time in the items tab, either searching for information or pulling up a list of items that are waiting for their approval. And then to create a new item, just to review, we're going to click Create new and then choose an agenda item, you'll either choose a template that is part of your solution, or you might just click agenda item if you just have one template that you're using. And then from here is when we will begin entering the title of our item. You can add a suggested action such as adopt or amend or approve. If not, you can skip over. Again, remember, you can add a suggested action such as adopt or amend or approve. If not, you can add a suggested action such as adopt or amend or approve. If not, you can add a suggested action such as adopt or amend or approve. If not, you can add a suggested action such as adopt or amend or approve. If not, you can add a suggested action such as adopt or amend or approve. If not, you can add a suggested action such as adopt or amend or approve. If not, you need to select edit and edit and edit and edit and edit and edit edit and edit and edit and edit and edit and edit and edit and edit and edit and edit and edit and edit and edit and edit and and edit and edit and edit and edit and edit and edit and and edit and edit and edit and edit and edit and and edit and edit and edit and edit and edit and the type of item is not where it's placed on the agenda. It's the category or the classification of this item. That's used a lot during searching. And then remember, the system's going to assign the item number once we upload this information. So I'll pick my department. And then you'll always select your meeting body first before it will allow you to select a date. And then after you select the meeting body and the date, you'll be able to choose the section. So agenda section is where you will specify where this item will be placed on that specific agenda. If you have any additional fields that you would like to add, those would be listed down here. And then down in your uploads is where you would browse and upload any of those supporting documentation. So just as a reminder, we do recommend that you keep your files under 100 megabytes or less. And then remember, there are some attachment privacy options. Most likely, you keep it on the agenda for everyone to see. You could have it on the agenda but confidential so the public cannot see it, but everyone else in your office and your office members can, or you cannot have it on the agenda at all, meaning that only peak users can see that information. And then once you have entered, all of the information in your item template for your agenda item and selected your documents for upload, that's when you'll click create. You can choose to go directly to your approval process or you can manually go into that section. So I'll click create. Everything now is being uploaded into the system and this is the point where we've got our summary box. So we're still in draft mode. We've got an official file ID assigned. with our document name. We're in version one and we can review the list of all of the attachments here. We can set the item to approve. We can copy or duplicate the item. If we have permissions, we could view the agenda. If not, this would be grayed out. We can turn off the cover page if we don't want that as part of our agenda packet. And then we can download the cover page or the item packet, which is the cover page and all of the attachments to view that information to see what it will look like when it's published on the view page and how it will look to the public. And then remember, you've always got the item discussion information. So once we send this through the approval process, you'll want to document any changes that you make through there or any other information. And then moving on to approval status, this is where you could add a new workflow or select an existing one. If I add a new workflow, here you can see how this could potentially be very time consuming because we're having to name the phase and then go through and pick all of the approvers every time. So now if I want another phase, I have to do a lot of clicking of naming the phase and adding the approver. So remember an FYI, if you specify an FYI, that means that they are not going to be editing or taking action on the item. They're just going to get an FYI email notification so they could review the item if they needed. So if you don't want to use this template, I'm just going to click remove. And again, we would definitely recommend setting up some workflows with an administration. So it makes it much easier on your drafters to select a workflow and then simply use click use this workflow and then initialize means that you're starting it. But as we discussed, you all of your drafters can potentially edit a workflow that's already been set up before they decide to initialize it. So they can always edit the approvers that are in a certain phase. They can always delete an entire phase or rearrange the order of them if they would like. And they can also add a phase. Initialize this workflow. Now this is on to Sally. And then as we discussed, while it's under workflow, you cannot create a new version. You could always make a duplicate or a copy of that item if you'd like. And while this item is under approval, I could make edits or changes to this information and document in the item discussion. And I can also, as a drafter, review the approval process, skip an entire phase, send an email notification to the current approver or edit an existing or another stage that's coming up within the system. I can also restart it, which means cancel. So I'm sure everyone's heard that one enough times. And then remember, when it's time to approve this item, your approver will receive the email notification that I showed the example of earlier. They can click on the link of the item title and it will take them directly to log in. Or when they're in the system, of course, it will show that there is one item waiting for approval. And. From there, your approvals will have two options to approve the item or to delegate the item. And so when they click on it, it brings them to the items waiting for their approval and they'll click on the pencil icon. And that allows them to open up the item, review or edit any of the information. And then when they're ready to take action, they'll go to the approver status, click the thumbs up to approve or click delegate to choose another user in the system. As soon as they delegate, it will they will immediately be removed from that phase and the new person who is delegated will be replaced. So from here, I'm just going to simply click approve. And now in this particular phase, we're still waiting for Betty Smith before this approval can move on to the next. Workflow group. So I am going to take one last quick pause to see if there are any other questions. And and then from there, we'll say our final goodbyes for today. Okay, perfect. Well, I don't see there are any other questions in the chat box, but thanks. Thank you, everyone, for your time. And participation. I appreciate it. So just as a reminder, you know, I'll be uploading this recording into your media manager site. So look in the archives tab under your training folder or it might be labeled peak training. And so you'll have access to this recording. And for those of you who are joining me tomorrow at this same time for agenda coordinator training, I look forward to working with you then. And then everyone else and everyone have a great day. Thanks. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
