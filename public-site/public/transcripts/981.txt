 Ready to get it? Okay, welcome everybody to the regular Chico City Council meeting on July 6th. Happy Fourth of July. I hope you all had a nice weekend. We'll call the meeting no order here at 6 o'clock and start with an invocation by Police Chaplain Bud Sheldon. Come on down. Thank you, Mr. Mayor, Council. Let's pray. Almighty God, we come before you today. Lord, I ask that you would grant to these council members wisdom and discernment, that ability, Lord, to see what's best for our city, for the inhabitants, Lord, for those that come here. Lord, we pray for your, just your wisdom. Lord, we know that there are many people that have different perspectives of every problem, so we ask that you would give them the wisdom to know what's the best. And Lord, we also just ask your blessing upon all of our city workers, that you'd give them safety and health and peace in their homes. And we ask this in your name. Amen. Thank you. All right. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Please stand and join me in the Pledge of Allegiance.

Let's do three minutes. Okay. Okay. So our first speaker is Laurie LaRiviere and Robin Engle. And I'm sorry if I mispronounced your name. And if your name was called second, go ahead and stand up in the middle row behind me. And we'll go ahead and join them. Get ready. And we'll proceed. Go ahead. Okay. Hi. My name is Laurie LaRiviere. I'm a psychiatrist. I attended Chico State back in the 90s. Had to leave town to get my training and came back in 2016. I love this town. I really want to be a part of helping the solutions for our homeless folks. We know that many of our homeless folks, they're dealing with mental illness, developmental disabilities, physical disabilities, and substance use disorder. We have to recognize that these folks have been experiencing these things for a very long time. And what we need to do is create safe environments that allow healing, hope, purpose. We have wonderful businesses that can provide employment. We have an amazing, loving community that could come together and really do some neat stuff. And so I just wanted to let you know that I work only 10 hours a week so that I can do whatever it is that I want to do. I can do to help this community. I do have resources that may be helpful as far as like I'm a member with the Mind and Life Institute. The Dalai Lama's birthday was today. Many of you may enjoy watching his video, a movie that was made 37 minutes freely available at the Mind and Life Institute to get some ideas about how we can bring this compassion because we all have such wonderful hearts. And I know that's the reason why everybody's doing this. I know that's the reason why everything has been so hard because we're also very sensitive and raw because the traumas that we've experienced as a community. We have a tendency to poke each other and it's okay. We can be with it. So I just wanted to let you know that I have presented a solution that a designer and I have worked on to Casey Reynolds. She's very much in support of this. I believe this solution needs the collaboration of private government as well as faith and secular ethics communities. And if it requires the participation of the residents that we are hoping to serve, we cannot have a plan that doesn't include the voices of these people in need. And I have the capacity to be with those voices. So if anybody has a voice, please let me know. I'm not sure I have any idea of how I can be of more benefit. I would really appreciate it. You can contact me at drlaurielaw at intentionalsustainablewellness.com. It's drlaurielaw at intentionalsustainablewellness.com. And I also have a website, intentionalsustainablewellness.com that if you're interested, you can go to and I'll be adding more and more information that I believe may be of benefit to this community as we work together. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Alex Brown for being such a perseverant and heartfelt representative for us on council. Regarding fiscal matters, there is still a blatant lack of transparency. There has been between $40 million to $50 million of federal funding given to the city of Chico because of the impact of COVID and we have a right to know where this money has gone. It hasn't all been used, it seems, but why are our businesses still failing miserably? Our small businesses when a lot of this money was specified to help stimulate our small businesses. We have the right again to know where this money is going. It's not supposed to be used to turn Chico into a city that can only be sustained by the extremely rich population and that's what this council has been moving towards doing with money that is designated for other purposes. There is an ever-changing fluid number in terms of our bankruptcy, which isn't called bankruptcy and I'll never understand that why it's not called a bankruptcy, but it's a syllabus. It's a! It's a It's a syllabus. syllabus. syllabus. syllabus. syllabus. syllabus. syllabus. syllabus. syllabus. syllabus. syllabus. syllabus. syllabus. this, yet year after year, our city employees negotiate their salaries, and they're not willing to budge. And I kind of don't blame them, given that city manager Mark Orem, you receive over 200 percent more than the average city employee in Chico, and over 237 percent higher in salary than the national average government employee. The highest paid governor in the United States, Governor Newsom, receives less in cash pay than you do, city manager Orem, and that's in the 200,000. These are public pieces of information. I don't appreciate being interrupted as I relate public information that is available. It's my right under the First Amendment to speak my piece. Thank you. I have 19 seconds left. So I will just say thank you again to Councilor Brown for being my only representative who has integrity, honesty, and compassion, and is representing our entire community. The rest of you should be ashamed of yourselves. I too thank you. Okay. Hold on, Mrs. Nava. So let's start at the beginning once again. So we do not applaud people in this chamber for the sole purpose that applause leads to opinions being hindered. It's been a long-standing order of this institution. And again, I will say this because it's obviously hasn't been the purpose of this chamber. It's been a long-standing order of this institution. And again, I'm not saying that's a good or a good thing. It's a good thing. It's a good thing. It's a good thing. It's a good thing. It's a good thing. It's a good thing. It's a good thing. It's a good thing. It's a good thing. It's a good thing. It's a good thing. It's a good thing. It's a good thing. It's a good thing. It's a good thing. It's a good thing. It's a good thing. It's a good thing. It's a good thing. ready to go. Okay, go ahead. Thank you. Good evening, council. So I'm here to address the resting place solution and some other stuff, but first a quick thank you to Public Works. I've noticed some really good noticeable improvements around town and I'm super appreciative, so please let the staff know. Moving on to the resting site, what I'd like to address is that multiple times I've emailed you guys and I've emailed the Butte County Board of Supervisors and various and sundry folks and what I want to land on that I think gets missed from how polarized we all are and I think some of us are trying to push back into a direction that would be a good one is that there are things that we can do with the resting site to make it amenable and be pushing folks toward a wellness path, which I try to pound. And so some of those things are reasonable things like we're coming up on a week where it will be in excess of 100 degrees. I don't think either that it's too much to ask for misters and things like that. It is uncomfortable wherever in Chico you are when it gets that hot if you're not inside an AC. That doesn't mean provide AC, but there are some mitigation factors that we can do. There's new devices that create things like this. I also believe that it, to me, reading the book, I think it's a good one. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. as, you know, no storing public property or your personal property in public place. That's been addressed before as well. It seems like a simple amendment to find a spot. It doesn't have to be the world's most perfect spot in the middle of summer. Try your best where people can get their things there. And there could be maybe two, one on each end of town. And these are things that would mitigate the problems of why people aren't going to certain spaces, right? The goal, and I think this is shared by everyone, hopefully at this point, is to get the parks and the waterways clear, be able to enforce in a meaningful and humane way, and amending those things, as some of us have been pointing out, but that doesn't get shared very broadly, are these little things that could be mitigated that would help that circumstance. I also think it's incumbent upon everyone, even those there's frayed nerves between county and city maybe right now, is to regroup, breathe for your community, and please come together on working on those treatment solutions where the people who know best to do that can participate. And I think that's a really important part of what we're doing. And the city amending those ordinances, so I would love it if the city attorney and all of you could just sit down and go, what was he saying to us about the minimum? It's like a showdown at the OK Corral where people, thank you. So Julie Wood is our next speaker, followed by Charles Withoon. Hello, everyone. Thank you for hearing me today. I would like to say that what I just heard the last speaker say, I could agree with, and I'm very happy to hear that. People are starting to think about coming together and finding a shelter that has four walls, as is indicated by Boise versus Martin, with a roof, with water. You can't live without water. With toilets, you can't live without them. With electricity, you can't charge your phone and make your appointments without electricity. We have to have these things, and there's really no leeway. There's no leeway between it. So I asked the city council, will you consider paying for these things? Will you make these concessions, like water, toilets, built shelters? I don't know if you will. You have been asked many times before, and you refuse to budge. I don't know if you're going to go to that judge with any will to change things. I sure hope you do. And you're keeping the most basic elements of life from the homeless, water, toilet, shelter. I just keep saying this. We've got to have these things. And in fact, I demand these things, and I think that the lawyers on the side of the homeless should be demanding these things too. You refuse to change your unconstitutional sit-lie ordinances that our city attorney wrote and says that he will not enforce to the extreme of the law. Luckily, the judge said, oh, no, well, you're not always here. But the next guy comes along and starts enforcing that you can't sit, lie, or stand, and there's no place for you to go. We've got to get rid of this. I don't know why you're sitting on this. You have to change it. And so I think that the judge demanded that these be removed. Your actions and inactions are actually ethically abhorrent, except for the one person who's working on behalf on this council, and she knows who she is. You make it impossible to negotiate with you. You make it impossible to negotiate with you. You have sort of extremist party lines is the only thing I can think. It's like our way or the highway, and it's like the insurrection has reached Chico, and it's scary to me when we have a government that we can no longer have discourse and take care of people, because not taking care of people is not helping our town. It doesn't solve anything. It does not get people off the closet. It doesn't help our businesses. We still don't know what to tell our children when we see homeless. They have to have a place to go. And then that will solve the problems. Until you do that, you'll be failing every single person in this town. And it needs to stop. Thank you. CHAIR DELLA LEONG. Charles Withoon followed by Tim Lynch. TIM LYNCH. Mayor, Councilman, staff, thank you very much for this opportunity. Twenty-two homeless people dead in 12 months. CHAIR DELLA LEONG. Many of them died on our sidewalks. One right across the street in front of the Chamber of Commerce entry. This has never happened before in my life. The relatively sudden onslaught of the situation has some people calling it a crisis, the supervisors among them. Exactly what am I talking about? Not Ferris wheels, but shelter crises. What does it mean to the woman who was ten minutes late? Couldn't get into the shelter? It meant being raped. To the elderly homeless I talked to, it means likelihood of frequently being robbed or beaten. I am haunted by the memory of an elderly homeless man I chanced to see on a sidewalk barely able to crawl. Stripped to his shorts, his face and his crotch bloodied. After a run in with a few young thugs. I'm sorry. You think I dramatize. I dare you to get to know some homeless folk or to watch the movie Storied Streets on Netflix some night. The movie ends with a quote I'll paraphrase. The question is how long are we going to let the homeless languish in life threatening conditions before we see that proper shelter is a much better deal for all citizens. And the answer? We'll say more. more about us than it will about them. It's a better deal because campgrounds and tiny home villages are cheaper than the current plan of police work and emergency room visits by a factor of about 10. It's a better deal because campgrounds and tiny home villages, the net effect is less desperate people on the street. It's a better deal because research shows that the vast majority of people given stable shelter get their lives together in about 6 to 24 months and graduate on to positive placement. They become taxpayers instead of a tax burden. It's a better deal because it is in line with the wisdom and the ethics of our most important spiritual lesson. Love thy neighbor because it's a better deal. This is your opportunity. Be leaders. Lead us to a better deal. With liberty and justice for all. Thank you. Tim Lynch, followed by Lisa Currier. Good afternoon, Council. It's been a long time. It's good to see you in your faces for the first time for some of you. I'm not in some of the conversations that you guys are in and some of the committee meetings that you guys are on, so I don't know what things are being talked about towards... solutions for our community. What I do know is that as an outside observer, I have noticed for a long time that everybody seems to get to this point where they have ideas and they want to go with that plan, whatever their plan is, and they don't pay any attention to anybody else's ideas. And that happens on all sides of the issue, whatever the issue is we're talking about, whether it's homelessness, whether it's addiction, whether it's... response to COVID-19. And that's not what government is supposed to be. Government is supposed to be about finding the best way forward for the most number of people. And we have this polarization in our country and it's sort of seeped into our community of left or right, but the people's work happens in the middle. And those of you in front of me, I think, could do with remembering that from time to time, but also those behind me and around me need to remember that as well. And I don't like to come before you without offering concrete solutions, but unfortunately I don't have any today, other than to say that I encourage all of you to think about the best way forward, whatever that means. You know, we have to help people, right? We can't let people die on our streets, as previous speakers have talked about. We also can't let them pollute our streams and our waterways. And, you know, another thing that people don't think about either is that right now, because of court cases and all that stuff, you know, there's things that the city could do that the city can't do. And there's also things that the city could have done and they didn't do. So it's a complicated issue and it's a complicated subject. There's a lot of things that go into it. And all I can remember is that, you know, one of the biggest issues that's constantly escalating right now is that one of the biggest issues that's escalating right now is that one of the biggest issues that's escalating right now is that one of the biggest issues that's escalating right now is that one of the biggest issues that's escalating right now is that one of the biggest issues that's escalating right now is that one of the biggest issues that's escalating right now is that one of the biggest issues that's escalating right now is that one of the biggest issues that's escalating right now is that one of the biggest issues that's escalating right now is that one of the biggest issues that's escalating right now is that one of the biggest issues that's escalating right now is that one of the biggest issues that's escalating right now is that one of the biggest issues that's escalating right now is that So we need collaboration with the county. I know that's been a sore spot. But also with the state, because they have funding for this. And if they have the funding, we should be finding it somehow. And I appreciate the time. Thank you. Lisa Currier, followed by Julie Three. Hello, everyone. It's nice to be here face-to-face. You know, I agree with a lot of what people have said. And here's the bottom line. The bottom line is we need to get to know our neighbors. We need to have some humanity. You know, I like what Lori said about looking after our mentally ill folks. You know, the county and behavioral health through MSHA funds are looking at a new program called the REST program, which will take over for what Laura's Law was. And they're looking at implementing that to help our people with mental illness out on the street. Well, we don't understand. What we don't understand is that how many people are actually suffering mental illness on their street, PTSD, depression. I mean, I'd be out there a week, and I'd probably be in a psychosis myself, to be quite honest with you. I just couldn't bear it. I think that we're not looking at it from a humanitarian state of mind. You know, even Judge England, on Friday, was so disappointed in the fact that I think this is where he beat up Mr. Ewing, asked him five times, you know, when we're taking the sweeps about sit and lie ordinances, there was a veteran with his uniform and his honor badges from being in war. And they were in a sweep. And he was very disturbed by this. And it was worth less than $100, according to the people doing the sweeps. We do not know what prized possessions these people own. When my family lost all their homes and everybody, up in paradise, and even when I got evicted because my son was in psychosis and the landlord decided to, you know, you need to go now, and we were homeless for a minute, you know, the fact remains is that a tent, a sleeping bag is less than $100. That's all legitimate for anybody to come by and sweep. There isn't any real, we need more service providers. When I went out to, the ludicrous place by the airport, the obscene, horrible tent, the big giant water jug was in the middle of the sun, along with all the waters, with armed guards. I mean, are those the same guards that killed Scott Rushing? I mean, Tyler Rushing? Are they? Why are we having armed guards out there? Not one service provider out there. We need to look out. We don't realize how many children, elderly and mentally ill folks are out on this street. We don't know that, you know, I've personally paid in over $200,000 for Social Security. I can be out on the street over there just like the rest of them, you know, all the people out of paradise. I paid in. I paid my taxes. Don't bitch that I'm homeless and I'm not paying my taxes. I'm sorry. It's not true. Get to know your neighbors. Julie Threatt followed by Lynn Beliante. Hello, Councilman. It's been a little while since I've been here, too. I first want to also thank Cami and actually all of you up there, because I know you're doing everything you can. You're getting a lot of information on this homeless, what do I call it, resting environment. There's about a zillion names. Homeless resting environment situation. And you get a lot more information and a lot more emails and a lot more things than anybody in this room can think about. So for anybody to come up here and think you're not responding or there's new ideas, you're getting them all of them. So I come up here to say I trust all of you. You all have different perspectives. At the end of the day, you're going to know what you're doing. You're going to know the legal aspects. And you're going to know the right thing to do by this city. And I do think communications is a big issue. I know that when I've been watching these meetings, people are saying the same thing. And it would be great to either have one reservoir of information, whether it's a website or some place where we can see exactly what kind of has been proposed. And I know that gets into maybe some legal issues. But it's always about communication. Because I'm like, people come up here and I'm like, we talked about that. We saw that. But it's something that maybe could be of help. The other thing is a reminder of what is a city funded to do. And a city is not funded to maybe feed and give shelter and water to everybody. I know elderly people that live in very dilapidated housing over off north. I bring those elderly people waters. They don't have air conditioning. Yeah, they may have a roof over their head. But it is a fire hazard and it's in a bad part of town. So am I going to come up here and say you all need to provide them with the water? No. That's why us citizens and our churches and our service providers, that's what we give money for. We give money to and that's what we expect of the citizens. Just like the campfire. We went out there or the breakdown of the dam. We ran down to the Elks Club. We started going around to CVS. Giving a lot of food and gallons of water. And having people come in there with their sleeping bags. That's what we did. We didn't ask the city and demand the city go and solve the problem when we knew all of those residents were rushing up here. And the campfire. Steve Murray had a great organization. We all were down there supporting him. I'm running up there and grabbing a dog and bringing him to the VCA. Because I have that capability. That's what we do as citizens of a city. We don't expect the city monies to be used. We have limited funds. Safety, security, roads, bridges. That's about all we've got money to provide. Somebody posted that they were down here at the hands gathering cases of water because the city wasn't providing it. And I'm like, no that's great. We'll all bring cases of water down there. That's what we're supposed to do. That's what we do as citizens of a city that we live in and that we care about. And the stocking thing. I don't know how to stop it. When I first moved up here six years ago and I started helping with different communities and different issues. I started to do my peaceful protesting of the syringe exchange program. I got doxxed. I didn't know what it was. My name is plastered everywhere. I'm a volunteer at different places. That's all I do. They're like, we found this lady. Her husband passed away. Oh my god. I told my daughter who's in 20. She goes, mom that sounds like the bullying stuff I did in junior high. Don't you guys have some kind of mediation process? I'm like, no. We're just adults and this is what we do. So if there's any way to get rid of that. And thank you, Cami, for all your service. And again, thank you all up there for doing the best that you can. Lynn Bellante followed by Patrick Newman. I'm here to talk to you tonight about the issue of residential wells going dry at some of our homes. And hoping that you council members could work with the board and the other agencies that are part of it to come up with a plan sooner rather than later. I live out in Orchico. I have not run out of water yet. My well is 100 feet. I don't think I'm going to make it until December, but I might. I'm trying to be proactive and I had a big tank delivered to my front yard today. I made the incorrect assumption a few weeks ago that I would be able to get it filled similar to residents in Orland if what I heard was on the news was accurate. They get city water filled into their tanks at $10 for every thousand gallons. I've made some calls. There is no such plan in place in Chico. I even called Cal Water. The cheapest I can get mine filled that's going to be filled Thursday is $150. And the other quote I got was $275. I can't afford that very long. So I'm not even hooking it up. I'm going to have to have running water. And maybe I won't run out. I'm just trying to be proactive and have a plan in place. I'm not hooking it into my house. I just have a hose. I'm going to try and save part of my backyard. I told my kids we can camp out in the house. We can do that. But some people are not going to be able to do that as easily as I can. And I'm certainly not going to be able to afford to fill up my tank at those kind of prices very many times. So I did reach out to Cal Water. They said that's correct. There's no plan in place at present in Chico or Butte County. They had me call Butte County Water Resources. And I heard back from somebody today. And they said that the Board of Supervisors needs to declare a water emergency situation. And then a plan would be put in place. So I guess I'm asking you council members if you can work with other departments, the Board of Supervisors, to get a plan put in place sooner rather than later so that when people's wells do run dry, and some of them already have, if they can get a hold of tanks in their yards, that they can get them filled at a price they can afford to pay. And I am going to attend a drought task force Zoom meeting next Tuesday and the Board of Supervisors meeting on July 20th. Because I'm not sure who does what. I'm kind of new to this. I'm trying to learn about it. I spent 21 years putting my backyard in. I'm letting my front yard go. But I'd really like to say part of my backyard because I just put so much into it. But anyway, so if you can do anything to help with this situation as soon as possible, a lot of people would appreciate it. Thank you. Ma'am, if I can ask you, do you live in the city or the county? I live on Michael Way, which until a year and a half ago was county. I was four houses from city. And I was annexed in September of 2019. So now I'm city. Okay. I'm not near enough to any city water lines. I know they're coming down Eaton Road, but, and there is a development across Eaton Road on the other side. But I went and talked to the guys out there today. And they're not laying the water lines down Eaton Road. They're just doing that development right there. And they're hooking up from Morseman. So I don't think that's an option real soon, at least for the streets where I live. I think it's a good idea to have those three streets that are north of Eaton Road. Okay. If you could leave your information with the clerk, I'd appreciate it. Pardon me? Could you leave your information with the clerk so we could contact you? Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Who's that? Our last speaker is Patrick Newman. Can you put your mic in the mic? Just my cell phone? So we continue on in denial. So we continue on in denial. In denial of the fact that we do not have enough alternative affordable shelter for people. Housing that's humane and sensible. We keep acting as if that's not true. And our actions show that. So last October, city staff prepared a whole report on the airport alternative. We stood up here and many of us talked about that. We talked about the fact that it was inhumane. It didn't fit best practices or anything like that. The whole thing was recycled again. In a letter to the editor, I called it the new Andersonville, which is really what it is. You're impounding a bunch of people on a tarmac, on a lava cap. Inappropriate for 99% of the people on the street. And yet there it was, all the city staff. Time went into that. Whole creation out there. The judge saw through it. I'm amazed he was as kind as he was. Somebody mentioned our storage laws again. They're flatly unconstitutional. The way they're written. They're so vague. They can mean anything. A woman with a stroller and a diaper bag could leave the stroller and the diaper bag on a bench and walk over with her kid to play in the fountain. That's storage on public property under our laws. They're absolutely ridiculous. And all of those ridiculous laws we have are citation and misdemeanor. So in theory, this woman could be put in handcuffs and taken to Butte County Jail for leaving that stroller there. That's how vague and ridiculous these laws are. I find it interesting. I finally got a hold of the Marabat report, which I've been trying to get for three years now. That was paid for by the Jesus Center. That has been the blueprint of the city. No transparency. But that's available now, finally. And I'll try to get it out as much as I can. We still need those 24-hour toilets back that we've lost, that the city council voted to put in place, that have been removed. I received an email from the city asking friends on the street and other organizations that are providing food and clothing and sleeping bags and tarps and toiletries and tampons and everything else people need. To take everything out to the airport. The absurdity of that, when the people who are on the street, the most desperate people, the poorest people in our community who do not have access to shelter or housing, are desperate for those items and need them. And they live in the fabric of our city. And this city held hands with the Jesus Center and engineered the elimination of our only soup kitchen and our only access point for clothing for people on the street. It's true. It's an absolute fact. We can sit down and talk about it. I'll go through the whole history any time. I followed it inch by inch. It was part of the memorandum of understanding between the city and the Jesus Center which came out of the Marbutt Report. So anybody who wants to know more about this, contact me at chicofriendsonthestreet at gmail.com. There's a lot more detail to all of this. Nothing can be covered in three minutes. Thank you. Mr. Newman was our last speaker. Thank you. All right. We'll move on to our regular agenda. Declaration of Council Vacancies. Actually, we have a public hearing. Did I skip a page? Sorry. I'm not ready for my report yet. That's what happened. Sorry. All right. Public hearings. Zoning Map Correction Ordinance Number 2534. And I believe we have Mr. Amba. The director is. All right. Thank you, Mr. Mayor and council. Yes, this is a correcting ordinance to replace the correctly colored map with the wrong colored map. And we're recommending that you open the hearing up again and then close the hearing, take it under consideration, and introduce the ordinance for adoption. We have to go through this again. We'll come back again for adoption later on after this. That's our recommendation report. All right. Any questions? Okay. So we'll open the public hearing. Do we have any speakers on this item? We do not. All right. We will close the public hearing. Entertain a motion. Move approval. Second. A motion and a second from Vice Mayor Reynolds. Okay. Madam Clerk, if you would. There is a motion and a second to introduce the following ordinance by reading of title only. Ordinance of the City Council of the City of Chico. Amending Ordinance Number 2534 to correct zoning map Exhibit 1 for the property identified as Assessor's Parcel Number 002180200. Council Member Brown. Aye. Council Member Morgan. Yes. Council Member Tandon. Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds. Aye. Mayor Coolidge. Aye. Carries 5-0. All right. Now we'll move on to the regular agenda. My apologies. Item 5.1. Declaration of Council Vacancy. Clerk Kresser. Thank you, Mayor Coolidge and Council. At this meeting, you're being asked to formally declare two seats, the seats of former Council Member Huber and Council Member Denley vacant due to their recent resignations. Once the seats have been declared vacant, you will then need to decide your options and how do you fill them. The Charter of the City of Chico, Section 406 outlines the process for the two options pertaining to Council vacancies, which are to either call the City Council or to call for a special election, or within the first 30 days of any vacancy, the Council may, in lieu of calling a special election, fill the vacancy by appointment of a person qualified to be a candidate for a City Council member. In order to qualify to serve as a Council member of the City of Chico, a citizen must be a registered voter in the City and must be 21 years or older. If being considered for a district position, then that person must also reside in the district in which they are, they would want to be serving. And this will be considered for a district position. In this particular situation, former Council Member Huber was serving at large. He was elected in 2018. And so his vacancy can be filled by a qualified candidate residing anywhere within the city limits as long as they are a registered voter, 21 years of age or more. Council Member Denley was elected to specifically represent District 3, so there would be that added requirement for her replacement to actually reside in District 3. So the Council's options. You have two. A special election. If the Council wishes to call for a special election, staff will work with the county elections official to determine the scheduling of the special election based on the requirements that are set forth in the election code. There's been a lot of talk in the community about consolidating our special election if one was called with the recall election for the governor. That has now been scheduled for September 14th. Unfortunately, on Friday, we had a meeting with the governor. On July 2nd, the recall election was cited and they set that date. However, it forced cities to have only a four-day window in which to call for consolidation. So we've already passed that window and we're unable to consolidate in that. As noted in the report, the county estimates the cost for a standalone mail ballot special election at over $363,000. Okay. Thank you. As part of the research that went into the staff report outlining Council's options, staff identified that since the inception of this community and the creation of it, there have been 33 vacancies, whether those were from resignations or from deaths while serving in office. And of the 33, only one was actually determined by an election. It wasn't a special election. It was close enough to a general municipal that that position was filled with that. So 32 vacancies were filled by appointment by the Council. So the appointment process, when considering whether you as a Council would want to move forward with the appointment process, it's recommended that the Council discuss updating the supplemental questions as needed. It should also be noted that due to Councilmember Denley's vacancy occurring in the first half of her term, the appointee from District 3 would hold office only until the general municipal election that's scheduled for November of 2022. The voters will then decide who will finish out her term of office. The appointee to replace former Councilmember Huber will serve until the end of his term, which would have ended in 2022. Council, in the staff report, you were provided with the APMP 1044 that was created in 2012, partly due to the fact that there was the last vacancy filled in 2012. In 2011, former Councilmember Bob Evans was appointed by the Council to fill a vacant position with two years remaining on that term of Larry Wall, who went on to become a county supervisor. At the time, 18 letters of interest. There was not an application process. It was just letters of interest from individuals asking to be considered for the appointment were received. So after that appointment process, because we did have 18 individuals, we had to make sure that we had a process that the Council could understand and take part in and be created. So that's the process that's described in APMP 1044. Should the Council move forward with the appointment process, it's recommended that the Council update the questions. The questions that I've identified in the staff report were created in 2011. They may still be relevant to the current process. If they are relevant, or you may want to update them with more items that are pertaining to what's currently going on in our city. It's entirely up to you. Please note that the policy allows up to two people to be nominated by each Councilmember for each position. And all interested citizens who qualify, and by qualifying, we verify that they are a registered voter at the address that they have provided, which meets the election code. And that is our way of confirming that they are eligible to run for office or be appointed. So with that, it is required that they be in attendance at the meeting in which you actually conduct the interviews. It's critical that they be here. So in addition, there is a schedule, and if the Council wants to look at the schedule that I've provided and do any updates, we can do that at the meeting. And I'm available for any questions that you might have. All right. Questions? Just a quick question. Have there ever been two vacancies at one time on Council? Yes. There were two different times, one in the 1800s and one in the early 1900s. And two Councilmembers, for some reason, resigned at the same time. And they were actually appointed the same night that they did the interviews. It was very interesting going back into the historical aspect of our city. Thank you. You're welcome. All right. What's our policy on signage? Does it have to be at the back, Sarah? For signage, it has to be against the back wall so that it doesn't block other people. If you want to hold the sign, you have to go to the back. Sir? What's the sign? Hello? So... Yeah, it just has to be against the back wall. Sorry, we haven't had that one in a while. I forgot. All right, so any other questions for the clerk? All right, speakers on this item? We didn't get any additional ones, did we? Okay. So we have nine speakers. All right, three minutes. Okay, Nicole Nava, followed by Lori Harris. And if you can queue up after, if you're the second speaker that I call, go ahead and stand in the aisle. So, Nicole Nava. Thank you. Good evening again. So I just want to reinforce the email I sent to you all that would ask that you please just appoint two members from the qualified applicants that will soon follow, I'm sure. And I understand people are polarized on that topic as well. This wouldn't be Chico, I guess, if we weren't polarized on something. So what I think and hope is that we can find someone, who is willing to weave together sides and land where people can agree, find things to collaborate on, start working on the business at hand. There is a tight timeline that was in the attachments provided. Thank you for the report because I think it's very important for those who are listening, who want to throw their hats in the ring to understand you need to move fast and start thinking about what you can bring to your community and be able to articulate it well. I know that I, for one, am still looking for people who want to hold people's hands, people accountable that can be humane as well. I'm also looking for people who are dedicated and passionate about remaining in Chico, hopefully, and live in their district if they're supposed to or live in the city of Chico, Incorporated if they're supposed to. We all have commitments that we have to stick to that sometimes aren't fun. And it's years that you guys are in it. And thank you all for being willing to serve. And I do mean every single one of you. Thank you. You all bring some things to the table. I, I, really hope again to underscore what I said earlier that we just start pivoting a bit. We've been, you know, I think that all of you have in your way been trying to respond to what everybody wants and trying maybe not to overdo and spend too much of the city's money. And some feel like maybe you underdid, but I get that it's difficult when you have other entities that are also supposed to be as part of the solution like the county or service providers. So I also would like to speak broadly to that. I'll try to go to the council or the board meeting and speak to this as well. And this is to service providers too. Like there's things you can do. People are super energetic and they keep coming at council and going out and taking things. And maybe it's time to shift and fundraise and find a new energy to harness to pivot forward that some of us can also get behind. I just, I do think there's a way forward. I love this community. I know so many of you, I know some speakers came out a little harsh and I want to say, not all of them have seen the things that you have done independently that I have. I've seen you out in your community helping individual people, helping groups of people, helping underprivileged people, all of you in your own way. And so I think that if we can pivot and just understand we do have these people here to serve us and we do have options and let's figure out what those are. Let's move forward together. I hope a bunch of us can go to the council or the board meeting with the county. I think that will be really more beneficial to us for a lot of what we speak about here. Thank you. Lori Harris, followed by Catherine Posey. Congratulations, Debbie. You did a great history report. Thank you. That was fabulous. We have a historian in our group as well and she had already found these same things out, except the two resigning on the same day. Now I think that's pretty interesting because we have a prayer group that meets every Tuesday morning on Zoom and we pray for about five counties that are all in this area going through the same things. And one of the things we pray is whatever is hidden in secret be shouted from the rooftops. Don't you love scripture? It never comes back wrong. God always prevails. So in this little four-day window that we've got that somehow we can't elect a new city council members, I'll bet you there's something like a dispensation that could be granted in our situation. Especially if enough people get upset about not being able to vote in the ones that they want. When people choose their own friends and colleagues and patting someone else on the back that they owe a favor to, it doesn't always look like the application process really has the best interest of the city at heart. So please consider that we need to ask. We have a lot of people. We have a lot of people that want to see justice prevail. We want to see integrity, honesty, and people who aren't afraid to pull back the covers and let other people see what's going on. Because it'll come to light anyway. Katherine Posey followed by Bill Monroe. Hi. So I do want to also just jump on the end of Lori's comment. This idea that there was only four counties that were elected, and that's not true. And that four days seems a bit strange. And I wonder who made that rule up. But that's one thing to look into that. Why was there only a four-day window to add on an election? I do want to say that I think it would be really helpful for the community to give the public a say in who their elected officials are if you guys have an election for these two vacant seats. Now, Debbie mentioned that there were a couple other times when we had two. But those were quite a few years ago. And I think it is a unique situation that there are two open. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I know that there has been talk about the idea of those filling the seats maybe being past council members or mayors. But one thing to ask, is that the best option? Because the city, I think, deserves members of the council that won't be swayed by special interests and aren't motivated by money and power. Sometimes that seems a little bit unrealistic, but I don't think I think Chico can do that. So the question I'm asking is, as you think about this, what are you going to do? Well, one of the pieces that's going to happen soon is that soon as soon as the vote's released and go forward, we want to hold our government officials accountable for following through on their oath to the Constitution. And making decisions in line with the people who elected them. So the city needs council members who will identify and oppose waste, fraud, corruption, and mismanagement. So bringing the people in to do that, I realize that it costs a lot more money than it does to do the appointment. but I still think it needs to be considered. Our money gets spent in a lot of ways that we don't like. Maybe the money gets spent in something that we do want. Thank you. Bill Monroe, followed by Lisa Currier. Yeah, hi. When I signed up to speak, I was thinking that we could combine the election on September 14th with this. Are you sure it's not four business days, perhaps? And not just four days? Just saying. Might want to look into that. But that being said, the state of California has been forced to spend over $275 million on a recall of the governor, that election, the one that's on September 14th. I think that it would be money well spent for the city of Chico to spend the $363,228. For a special election, if it can't be combined with the election on September 14th. That's all I got. Thank you. Thank you. Lisa Currier, followed by Julie Three. I agree. I think that we should pay the money and do the election for the people to be able to say. So, former Councilman Delaney is my district. And, you know, I'm hoping that someone, good will come out of it. I don't want to see everything shift to one side or the other. Let's have a fair election about it. I also would like to see people. I was very disappointed in the fact that not many people stood up for Scott, for former Councilmember Hoover. He did nothing wrong. He asked well in advance. Said he wouldn't go if it wasn't going to work out. Bought his ticket. I don't think we're having the backs of our fellow council members. And I think that y'all should be doing that. We should be a family and a team. And if we're going to act like a team and quit fighting like, you know, jerks, you know, it would be really nice if we would stop doing that. I also would like to know, essentially, who in fact also knew that former Councilman Delaney had a... I want to know. Who on this board, on this staff, any of this, who else knew that? Why was it not brought up previous? You know, I would really hate for a mother with four children to break the law and go to jail. I don't want to see anybody for that to happen to. I want to know who supported her. Who led her down the road? Who led her down the garden path, this young woman? She's not stupid. Okay? She had her participation in it. But I also want to know who else was involved. We deserve to know that. As a city, as constituents, and I think that, you know, blambashing, posting Scott's family's address online, and all the other things. Everybody's been abused in these areas. We all know it. From both sides, we all know it. So, Sean, I'm not saying that we need to put on a show of words or whatever. Sean made it very clear. But, you know, I just got to say one more thing. And that's when we went to the court on the other day in front of Judge England. Sean, I looked out of the window at a 14-story building, and I saw the Ferris Wheel. Julie Threatt, followed by Dean. Hi, y'all. So, I thought there was another option where we could combine this with the actual general election in November. But since that's not the case, I think that there's just, I think you all, we vote you all in. So I think for good, bad, other thing that you got to make decisions on, I stopped at every one of the four territories and you were not in my districts. But I did everything, I spent money for you all and I absolutely worked hard on a democratic process to vote in or support those that I thought I wanted up there on the dais. So I again respect you. I don't think there's enough time to actually do an election. I think again it would be great if we could wait until November. We're all going to be caught up in this governor's race and again there was a recall so that is what prompted that whole thing. But we don't have money. We don't have the money in the city. We're caught up in all the lawsuits with all this money. We want more money for the homeless. We want the money for this. I mean unless the citizens behind me want to send money in for a special election, great. But otherwise we don't have the money. We don't have the money in the funds to support this. And we all voted you in. If you didn't vote these people in, then you should be voting and you should be going out there for the next election and doing your job. Otherwise it's the cost. We don't have enough time to actually go through and meet these people and vet them out. You all can do that better than we can. And again, the focus is not going to be there. This is a democratic process. Let's be clear. You all again are our democracy. We voted you in. I think you can make the right decision. And I did one thing I forgot last time was to give a shout out to Chief Madden. I said to the GPD, further Chico, coffee with the cop. It was fabulous. It's fantastic. I encourage you all to go out there. You actually get to meet them, see them, look up close and personal where their stuff is on their gear. And so thank you very much for that. Dean, followed by Jessica Giannola. Thank you. All I have to say is that I don't understand why you people up there are the ones that get to decide on who we get to bring into the City Council. I think it should be everybody in our community that decides who sits up there and makes the decisions for our community. We don't agree with everything that all of you say, but I think that we need a voice in this election for the two city council members that are going to be sitting up there for us as a community. It seems like when I sit back here and I watch you and I look at each one of your faces and I can tell that a lot of you don't care what the citizens have to say. Like your minds are already made up about what you're going to do and how you're going to do it. And it doesn't matter what all of us as citizens of Chico have to say about this. So I hope that you will take this into consideration. And I think that all of us need to make a vote on who sits in those chairs that are making the decisions for this community. Because some of the decisions you are making and we are all watching are not in our best interest. And one of them is the homeless. I know I'm not supposed to speak about that because I'm supposed to be speaking about the election. But I'd like to know what you are going to determine. To put in front of us to vote on. Are they going to have conservative beliefs? Liberal beliefs? And we need to know who you are and how you're going to pick these people to sit on those chairs. So I hope that this goes before all of the citizens of this community. And not just you. Because that will not be the right thing to do. So please consider what we are all saying. And we will be listening to you today about this subject. Thank you. Jessica Giannola followed by Grace Marvin. Council. We have two open council seats now. It's not because it's a general election year. But as a result of constant doxing and bullying and sneaky underhandedness of members of our community. Our city needs leaders that we can trust. And recent events continue to prove how little trust many of us have in the decisions and actions of our council. We need to see respect and understanding by our council. The last time I spoke up here I walked away frustrated and feeling disrespected. And other speakers that I've seen standing up here were also feeling disrespected. There were faces and talking and not paying attention to the speaker. We all see it and feel it. We are citizens of Chico. We're not the PAC members who fed your elections. Our voices matter. Not the investors out to take from local neighborhoods. Our people matter. And you're failing us miserably. We do not have faith in you as majority. And your ability to choose representatives is impartially. Our faith is completely broken at this time. As you continue to support ordinances against our citizens that violate their rights. You've wasted countless precious funds on inaccessible emergency sites. The council majority currently appears to be bent on a war against our various citizens of Chico. Combined with insensitive designation of some American rescue funds, we just have an overall lack of trust in your decision abilities at this point. A special election may cost $363,228 versus the $1,500 for you to handpick a representative. Elections may be costly, but they are the shining star of our democracy. The people are getting fed up with the corruption that we see before us. We are a diverse city with extenuating circumstances that require leadership that is more in tune with our reality and the needs of our city as a whole. Even though the chances are up in the air as to who will be elected in a special election. At least the two chosen will be chosen by the people and not by you, just the council. Thank you. Enough is enough. Please. Please do what's right by our city and allow our city to choose who sits beside you. And hopefully they will live in Chico. Thank you. Grace Marvin is our last speaker. Greetings city council members or remaining city council members. Our city is in very sad shape with two resignations and with conflicting views of how to deal with the homeless. It seems to me that if you choose to make council appointments instead of a far more desirable election for two council members, you should appoint persons who have compassion for the homeless, who will at least promote our meeting CDC guidelines on treating the homeless. Moreover, for those Chicolins who do not want compassionate help for our homeless from our city, let's consider why helping the homeless will benefit all citizens and why we need compassionate council member replacements. If we do not have sufficient health care for the homeless, the new COVID variant and other diseases will certainly spread to neighbors and relatives of all political persuasions, especially the unvaccinated. Moreover, providing the homeless with well maintained toilets and water for proper hygiene and regular waste disposal in addition to healthy food and clean water will help promote their health. To further protect their health and thus ours, we also need to make sure that in the living spaces our city selects for the homeless, these should not include places where extreme weather conditions physically harm people, and that they are not protected by the law. Especially the elderly, physically and mentally disabled, and those already diseased. Furthermore, since most members of our cities do not want the homeless to stay homeless, the city along with the assistance of federal and state funds needs to help provide a variety of accommodation types that allow for easy access to social services, food and drug stores, and medical assistance. Last but not least, how soon can transitioning away from homelessness occur? Last but not least, how soon can transitioning away from homelessness occur? Last but not least, how soon can transitioning away from homelessness occur? Last but not least, how soon can transitioning away from homelessness occur?

Last but not least, how soon can transitioning away from homelessness occur? Last but not least, how soon can transitioning away from homelessness occur? Last but not least, how soon can transitioning away from homelessness occur? Last but not least, how soon can transitioning away from homelessness occur? that fosters independence for all. We need council members who will recognize all our needs that the city can help me. Thank you. That's our last speaker. Mr. Mayor, could we put the Master Chief on the spot and ask her to address the election question just so we can put it to bed? Yeah. Sorry, Debbie. That's okay. Thank you, Council Member Morgan. I'm happy to respond, and I was grateful for the questions because it helps clarify it for our community. So first of all, it wasn't my interpretation. This actually stemmed from the Lieutenant Governor's proclamation that set forth the September 14th election. And in addition, there was legislation that was passed where a local government entity that previously called a special local election may consolidate that election with the recall election if all the following conditions were met. The special local election was called prior to June 15th. The original date on which the special local election was called is not more than 30 days before and not more than 30 days after the date of the recall election. And then the call to consolidate the special election with the recall election of the governor is issued within four days, and it's days. It's not business days. This is in the proclamation from the date of issuance of the Lieutenant Governor. Okay. So that's the Lieutenant Governor's proclamation. In addition, election code 1605, section F, clearly outlines for special elections, and in particular, our mailed ballot elections, and the city of Chico, when it conducts a special election, can hold it via a mailed ballot. So that criteria doesn't fall within that window to consolidate. Regardless, if we did consolidate with the governor's recall election, let's just say that. Let's just say we were able to do that. The cost would still be around the same, if not more. Because remember, the $363,000 was an estimate only provided by the county clerk's office. There are a lot of different factors. If you recall, our regular election, which we had budgeted $90,000, actually came in well over $200,000. The reason it was reduced down to the $160,000 was because they gave us a $60,000 credit that they got from a grant. When I questioned the county elections official regarding the increase in cost, because we didn't budget for it, she indicated that we had several measures. In addition, we had districts. And then on top of that, we had 10,000 additional registered voters. And the cost that is the base cost is based on X amount per registered voter. So it went up. Substantially. When we had the last special election, which I believe was in 2011, for Measure A, it cost the city $150,000. There isn't any way it wasn't going to double, if not triple, coming forward 10 years. So that is why the election code spells out when you can hold an election for a special. And that's in Section 1605, Section F. If anyone wants to go to that. In addition, the governors or the lieutenant governor, when he did his proclamation, or they did, I believe it's she, did her proclamation, it spelled out any criteria to consolidate with that. And it made it very difficult for local jurisdictions in order to consolidate. And when we say consolidate, that would have meant that we could have perhaps saved a little bit of money because there's already an election going on. So any other questions? Any other questions I'm happy to answer. So you mentioned the June 15th date, so we would have to have known by then, correct? Correct. And we didn't receive the first resignation until June 21st. Okay. So unless we could travel back in time, there wouldn't be a way we could do it anyway. Correct. All right. Thank you. Any other questions for the clerk? So I have one more. So you said of the 33 elections, that's dating back to our inception as a city? Yes. And was the one that was actually... So is the one that stands out from that, is that Colleen Jarvis? Oh, actually, so in former council member Colleen Jarvis, she passed away while in office. Right. And I believe she might have had eight months, maybe a little less than that, left remaining on her term. At the time, the council could not agree. They went through the appointment process. And it was a 3-3 split vote. And so the council chose to just keep that seat open. And the reason that occurred was because the election law is specific. If it's within eight months or six months of a general municipal, Ms. Jarvis' term was coming to an end, then they don't have to call for a special election. By the time you got it scheduled, you would already have a general election that was being scheduled. In addition, one thing that I do want to notate is that it was mentioned that the governors, you know, this is a general municipal. In September, that is not. We never have an election in September. So that's a special meeting, excuse me, a special election being held. So it's a little difficult. It's more difficult to consolidate with a special than it is with a general municipal. Okay. Okay. And Jit. Jit Cancer, I believe, and that was actually her dying wish. She did. She passed away while serving. Now, is that when they had the rotating mayoral ship after that or was that previous? No, that was before that. And I believe that was when, let's see, that was in 99, because one of the newly elected council members passed away. Right. And then for a while, the council couldn't agree upon a mayoral, and so they rotated the mayorship for about a year. Yeah. Okay. All right. Thank you. Any other questions? And I'm correct in saying that we need to accept the resignations first, correct? Right. I would ask that the council take a formal motion declaring two seats vacant as the first step. So I'll make a formal motion declaring those seats vacant. Second. I have a motion and a second. Okay. Just a second. I'm sorry. It's hard for me to type in the same time. Okay. I got you doing double duty here. I know. Okay. Council Member Brown? No. Council Member Morgan? Yes. Council Member Tandon? Yes. Excuse me. Vice Mayor Reynolds? Yes. Yes. Mayor Coolidge? Aye. Carries 4-1. And then I would ask that you decide whether or not you want to call for a special election, or if you would like to hold the appointment process. And if you do go with an appointment process, pursuant to the charter, which the charter allows and sets forth that you can either hold a special election or, in lieu of that, appoint, it says it has to be done within 30 days of declaring, as you just did, the seats are open. So starting today begins the 30-day window of that appointment process. I have a quick question. Should we move to a special election? What's the timeline on that? I don't have the exact timeline. I know that it can't be heard any earlier than, you know, X amount of days, and then there's just this formula. I would work with the county clerk's office to bring that back at the next meeting in terms of when the election would be held. Well, I'll make a comment. The circumstances of these two resignations, I think, demand better of us, better than four or five people appointing two applicants to serve in these roles. I don't take or recommend a special election lightly. Obviously, it is very costly. But the only people who are qualified to select their own representation are the voters of Chico. Two questions. How can we ensure the public's trust in this time of turmoil if we make their decision for them? And how can they trust those appointees knowing that they couldn't use the most powerful tool that they have, their vote? I think it's fair to say that public trust in government is low across the board and across the political spectrum. I don't feel comfortable pretending to know what's best for them in this scenario. For that reason, I won't support an appointment process, and I hope for your support in that effort. These circumstances are unprecedented. It's a unique situation, and we owe it to the people to allow them to use their power and their vote to decide what's next in this process. I'm ready to front the cost to that end. They should be able to trust us to do the right thing. Okay. So, do you have a comment, Mr. Marnie? Yes, sir. Fire away. So, I appreciate... I appreciate Ms. Brown's comments. I am not concerned about the money. I am concerned about the bloodbath. If we go to a special election that will take, I don't know how many days, 90 days, 30 days, everybody came up here and talked about incivility and how bad it is all of a sudden. It's not all of a sudden. It's gone on for a while. I'd be surprised if you could find people that run. I think you would see 30, 60, 90 days, whatever it is. It would be the worst... It would be the worst political climate this city has ever seen because everybody is poised for a fight right now. I am unwilling to put the city through that. It has nothing to do with the dollar amount. I'm going to keep going. So, what does that mean? Well, if we don't have a special election, we go to an appointment process. I can only speak for myself. So, we need to stop the incivility. We need to decrease the polarization. Okay. We need, if anybody is listening, applicants who have... some knowledge of how boards work. Elections, as everybody on this dais will tell you, are personality contests. Now, they have nothing to do with whether you're good at governing or not. Vilch. Some of us have proved that, myself included. We need people that can govern right out of the gate. So, if somebody had experience with boards, applicants who have some level of experience with municipal government, it might be helpful if they had no political agenda and no future intended political agenda. So, if somebody has a political ambition, those are the things that I am going to look for in applicants that apply. I'm not looking for Facebook heroes. I'm not looking to polarize the city anymore on the far right or the far left. I need mature, level-headed adults. And they exist. And I think we can find them. I think we can find them that will make 80 to 90% of the population think, you know what? Okay. Those people are willing to serve for the next... 17 months. It's okay. Because otherwise, we go back to the however many months. Blood bath. People talked about the PACs. There's PACs on both sides. They're rude. They're vicious. They do whatever they do. All kinds of them. And then, you know what we do? Ten months later, we start it again. The city can't handle it. And I won't support it. Money aside. All right. With that, I'll make a motion for appointments. All right. I have a motion. Do we have a second? I'll second it. But I also just wanted to make a quick comment. We are council members that are in charge of a $140 million budget to oversee up here. I think having people that are mature and have served on boards before and been involved in our community is extremely important in this time. I am listening. For those that say you're not listening, I am listening. I listen to every single person that comes up here. I try to make eye contact with every single one of you. I may or may not agree. I don't... But I listen to every single person that comes up here. We have a process that's been set forth in our charter. It's been done 33 times and 32 times it's been appointed. So I think it's appropriate that we continue that. This was just updated in 2012. So it's not like this was something that was set up 200 years ago and has never been revisited. It was even... It's been revisited in 2012 and I don't know what the majority was in 2012. I don't know what it was and it doesn't matter. If this is something that we want to change for the future, then that's something that we should probably put on an election at a future time and we can vote on at that time that anytime there's a vacancy, then we do it that way. But we have it set up in our charter. This is the way it's set up to go. So I'm in support of doing that for this time for our community. All right. I have a couple of comments too. So it... And Council Member Brown... I don't actually respectfully disagree. I think the precedent is clear. The precedent shows that the city has done it this way since our inception. And there has been times when, you know, we've had two council members out before. So I think in terms of doing this, the precedent is clear in our community. I think the pathway is clear. I think the cost aspect is clear. And there was a very good article the other day in the editorial section of the local newspaper that talked about... talked about some of the issues that Council Member Morgan and Vice Mayor Reynolds talked about as well. But, you know, I think it's very important at this point in our community. And unfortunately, what hasn't necessarily been demonstrated here today is that we need to clear away the nastiness behind these meetings, behind the people who represent this. And if anything, we've seen the damage that can do to personal lives and on both sides. And I would tell everybody that you need to moderate your tone and be respectful and speak to people like you would like to be spoken to. I hear a lot of people talking about how we'd like to do unto our neighbors as we'd like them to do unto us, but yet stand up here and say things that are quite the opposite in ways that necessarily wouldn't be respectful or considered respectful. You know, I always do it and make a point of doing it as though my father's watching me. And what would he say about my comments? As I say things in the public forum. And I think that's important that we need that or having my children watch me. And what would they say? Yes, certainly you can fight the good fight and make your points clear, but keep in mind that we're all people and we have emotions and feelings moving forward. So the people we need to get will be strong people. I'm definitely going to support this. I think it's the way forward. I think it's clear. And I think the precedent shows that this is the right way to do this. So. Council Member Tan. I personally believe that we should try to not do an election as well. And I mean, we are all members of the community. All of us who are up here, we have vested interest in our community. We want to make our city better and we'll try our best to appoint the people who do not have an agenda in their mind too. Who want to look for the betterment of the city. So. All right. Clerk Presson, can you take the roll? Council Member Brown. No. Council Member Morgan. Yes. Council Member Tandon. Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds. Aye. Mayor Coolidge. Aye. Carries 4-1. Mr. Mayor, sir. Yes. I have the floor again. Please. I know we have to get to adding additional questions if that is the desire of the council. I have some questions. I will ask some of those before we get to that. If I understand the city clerk correctly, the application process will open tomorrow. It will close some amount of days after that. We'll be back here on the 20th of July to interview the applicants. Is that correct, Madam Clerk? That is correct. Following the current schedule, two weeks after the 20th, which is August 3rd, which would put us inside the 30 days, we would make the appointment. We would make the appointment on that night, which would mean, I don't know how many applicants we're going to have, but let's say there's 20. 20 people would have to show up on the August 3rd ready to govern that night because they don't know who is going to be appointed or sworn in. So my second motion of the evening is going to be to ask for a special council meeting on either the 26th or 27th of July where we actually make set appointments. It gives us a week to consider. The applications, the interviews, if somebody wants to meet with somebody, and that will give the new council members a full week to prepare, read an agenda, understand how our meetings work, visit with the city clerk, so on and so forth. So when they come in and are actually sworn in on August 3rd, they're ready to go. So that was a very long but appropriate, I think, motion. I'll second. I would respectfully ask that if that takes place, it should be done. If it takes place on the 27th, the 26th, it's my 30th birthday. No way. We're so much fun. It's very fun to be here. I did not get an invitation. All right. So which date was that? 27th. So it would be one week after. It would be a normal Tuesday night, but it would be 27th, July 20th. And I'm assuming that's like a friendly amendment, which if I get an invitation to the party, I'm willing to accept. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. just didn't know if the council wanted to add any additional questions. So what change up the what questions do we have currently? So the general ones in the policy said state the reason why applying including qualifications for this office. So attached to the application would be these three questions. What do you view as the three most significant issues facing the city? What are your proposed solutions? And then the third one was considering the current economic climate. What is your realistic vision for Chico in 10 years? And then the and actually that was attached and then additional questions that were included in the policy which at the time the council when they were discussing this they recognized that future councils would need to change the questions to reflect the times that were or the you know the situations that were occurring. Near and long range 10-year perspective for the community. Quality of life challenges and opportunities. Community leadership and interpersonal skills and community fiscal health and resource issues. So I believe I attached in the staff report a copy of the application. I just didn't know if there were like three questions you would really want everyone to answer. So a couple of specifics. Do we do we have in detail out there board service or community service? Yes. So that's completely detailed you know I've served on x commission between this year and that year that kind of thing. Yes let me pull that up real quick. I mean yeah I guess I could list it under qualifications for this office. One thing that I'd like to say which actually this might be the right time to say it is if you are considering applying please understand that the job of a council member is not limited to these meetings. You are I think I have 10 committees. I think some of us have four or five. You do have jobs outside of this realm. You do have other meetings. You do have meetings with city staff from time to time to be brought up to speed on certain issues. You have other meetings where you may have an entire I've been the chair of air quality before and that takes hours and hours on top of the regular job too. So this is something that people need to consider. It's not just simply sitting up here at the dais twice a month. Thank you. Thank you for saying that Mayor Coolidge because we are going to have to bring back your list of appointments because there were substantial appointments for both council member Huber and Dinley and so those will need to be redistributed and may need to you know be looked at in terms of everyone else's schedules. So if you look at the council vacancy applications general information name of employer occupation and I and I want you to know that just like when a person comes in and takes out nomination papers I'm going to have to verify that you're registered to vote at the address that you provide me that that's what guides us when we allow people to take out nomination papers. Now this is an appointment process so it's a little different. You don't have to go out and gather signatures. However the same rules according to the election code still apply. So you will need to provide your address. It has to be public. I mean it's public information if you're either going to be appointed or you're running for office it's public information and the only thing I have to go by will be your address that you provide me at the time you take out papers or when you turn in this application. So anyway so email address, home phone, cell phone. You have to verify whether you reside within the city limits of the city of Chico. You're 21 years or older and that you're a registered voter and then if you're applying for and want and you're not a registered voter you have to go to a local office. I'm interested in in fulfilling the term the first half of the term for councilmember Dinley. You're going to have to prove you reside in district three. Again that position will then go up to vote. I'll be placed on the ballot for a two-year term in November of 2022 in order for the voters to put in someone to represent them for the remainder of Cammie Dinley's term. It says how long have you been a resident of Chico? Do you have previous experience as a council member? If so where? Dates of service? When was the last time you voted? At the last in 2011 that came up because people wanted to apply and council considered some of those individuals and they had never voted before and the council felt that that was something that should be on there. Have you served on a city of Chico board or commission and if so name them. And then um what's really really important. Last one. Last one. Last one. Last one. Last one. Last one. Last one. Last one. Last one. Last one. Last one. Last one. Last one. Last one. Last one. Last one. Last one. Last one. Last one. Last one. Last one. Last one. Last one. Last one. Last one. Last one. Last one. Last one. Last one. thing I do before I submit any of these applications to you for consideration is verify that they meet all the criteria for which they're applying. We redact, we're required by law to redact anything, so your personal information, your address and all of that would be redacted when placed on the city's website or when you get the electronic version of the applications in order to provide privacy on that. So they sign it, it has to be a wet signature, they can't just submit this electronically, I need that because in order for me to be authorized for my staff or my deputy to go and verify it with the county, I have to have a valid wet signature to do so. So then on page 204 it says state the reason why you're applying, including qualifications for this office. This is the current application. And then it also says then what do you view the most, the top three issues. Considering the current economic climate, the third question is what is your realistic vision. So in order to meet the timeline that we've been given with the 30-day appointment process, I will need to update this tonight or first thing in the morning and get it online for our citizens to access as well as to pick up in my office if they want to fill it out. So you don't need us to necessarily tell you every single detail, you could just go back and see. I can do that based upon the recommendations we might have? Absolutely. I can edit this. If there's anything that you don't want, if the third one, considering the current economic climate, what's your realistic vision for Chico in 10 years? What year was that? This was in 2000, it had occurred in 11, but the policy was adopted in 2012. I think you could drop that one. So if you want to replace that with something else, it's up to you. Just the vision for 10 years. Again you can leave it just as it is. And then I am good to go for tomorrow. Ms. Preston, am I correct in assuming we can ask questions of applicants that aren't listed on this document? Absolutely. So all of you have recently experienced and several of you have done it several times in terms of going through the recruitment process for board and commission members. When you get a three-minute time factor, this is not tied to that. That is why this will be the only item we bring to you are all the applicants because this is a very serious, not that the board and commission members aren't, I'm not saying that. However, this one will take a little bit more time. You are absolutely entitled to ask them additional questions. You can also ask additional questions of board and commission members. It's just that the council in the past hasn't done that. So it's really your process. Thank you. And it's the opportunity for you to really vet them. And again, they are required. If they're interested in applying, they can't say, well, I can't make it. They have to be here in order for you to be able to talk to them directly. Thank you. I think some of the nuances of individuals' applications will elicit different types of questions. So I appreciate that. Exactly. All right. Vice Mayor Allen, did you have a question? No. I'm fine with all of the questions that are on there. I'm just... I'm wondering if we shouldn't just add a page five and have it say, considering the current unhoused environment, what would your realistic, you know, and let people... Because that's a big concern for a lot of our citizens. So to let them address that specifically, that would be the only thing that I might add. Yeah. Yeah, I can see that. And getting any kind of voting history, what's our legal ramifications of doing that? You really can't. Really can't. You can't get it. You can't get that. I mean, you can check to see in the last one, but you can't... Be able to ask them if they voted? You can ask them. I'd just like somebody who's participated in the process. I think that's important. So... Yeah. I mean, we have... Did you vote in the last election? Correct? Right? Mm-hmm. But we can't do a history? No. Okay. All right. Any others? Nope. Is that enough direction? That is enough direction. And then just to let the public know, and for anyone listening, we will do a press release tomorrow. We will add the application as soon as I get it updated, adding that one item. We will add it to the homepage and make it so that people can easily access it. They do need to print it off. Once you fill it in, it'll be a fillable PDF form. Sign it. Print it off, sign it, and then do your supplemental as well. And then bring that to my office, and you can mail it as long as you think you can meet the time frame. And they would be due to us on... Is it the 15th? July 15th by 5 o'clock in our office. So you can drop them off, or you can mail them. All right. Okay. And then I will let the council know that the agenda will be out a little bit later, just in order to allow them a little more time. And once I get all the applications in, we don't know if we'll have five or 50. And so that'll give me enough time to adequately put together the agenda packet to get it to the council for the 20th, for the meeting on the 20th. Judging from how many phone calls I had, you'll have 50. Okay. All right. So nothing further on that item at this point. We'll take a short recess. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah, so maybe we could detail out for folks how much we actually made. They can look it up. All right. All right, we will re-adjourn. All right, item 5.2, presentation and consideration of a resolution adopting the local... Re-adjourn. Did I say re-adjourn? Re-join? Re-start? Un-recess? Oh, it's been a night already. Okay, so, yeah. All right. I was on vacation. Welcome. Hi there. My name is Cole Pfeiffer. I'm a senior planner with Headway Transportation. Thank you for the opportunity to talk to you today about the local road safety plan. We've been working on for... I'm not sure. I can talk a lot louder if you want. Okay. Okay. Well, the local road safety plan. I don't know if it's on yet or not. Let me know if I'm blowing you out. The local road safety plan, what it is, is really the local version of the state strategic highway safety plan. That one looks at the state roads. Local road safety plan looks at local and rural roads and gives agencies an opportunity to identify, analyze, and prioritize roadway safety improvements based on data, based on the past five to six years of crash data. What you do is... You analyze that data and develop countermeasures in what is called the four E's of traffic safety. Engineering, enforcement, education, as well as emergency services. And these local road safety plans not only be in great ways to prioritize your safety needs, but they're also going to be required for future safety funding grants, the HSEP Highway Safety Improvement Program. So they're certainly important to get more funding in the future. The way that you typically develop a local road safety plan... Is to get some buy-in, not only from stakeholders, but from the public. And take a couple of bites at the apple as far as data. Identify what the issues are, some countermeasures, and then drill down a little bit more to identify some specific locations and how to address those. The first step that we took to put together a working group of stakeholders... This group, as you can see, is comprised of members from the city as well as agencies around the city. This group... Helped to formalize and establish the vision mission for the plan itself. And then helped to guide some of the analysis and projects. And you can see the vision and mission statements here that help to guide the document. Because it's a data-driven plan and document, there is a ton of data in here that I won't dive into all of the nitty-gritty for. But I'll give you some of the overarching highlights. We analyzed six years of data, crash data. And... First and foremost, the thing that we saw kind of rise to the top is that pedestrian safety... And it's not unique to the city of Chico specifically. But pedestrian safety in the city of Chico is a little bit of an issue. So crashes from pedestrians and vehicles represent about 4.6% of all crashes. But about two-thirds of all fatalities on the city of Chico. So that was an area that we wanted to hone in on. Especially with about half of those crashes and fatalities happening within... A crosswalk and an intersection. We also identified that driving under the influence, unsafe speeds, as well as some confusion about traffic signs, signals... Were some primary collision factors for a large majority or large portion of crashes. And then intersections are certainly an area to focus on with about three-quarters of fatal serious injury crashes happening there. So we identified kind of at a high level some focus areas that we wanted to focus on. And we brought these items to the public. Now conducting a public outreach... Effort during COVID was a bit interesting. But we actually got a really great response online. We developed an online survey and an interactive map that allowed people to drop a pin specifically where they're having a safety issue. Categorize that based on one of the identified focus areas. And then add their comment. We also added functionality to allow people taking the survey to vote on other people's comments. So it allowed us to add some weight to how much of an issue different safety... Concerns were. Like I said, we got a really great response. About 700 completed comments. A lot of dots on the maps. About a thousand different votes on those. What we heard from citizens were that the most important safety concerns that they had were... Intersection safety, distracted driving, and then bicycle safety, pedestrian safety. We had asked them to categorize and rank which of those focus areas were the biggest focuses. Can I interrupt you for just a second? Of course. Is that typical of other cities? That's pretty typical. Yeah. We see that. You know, it depends on the city. But usually, yeah. Intersections where you see other people and can collide with them. And then the worry of distracted driving. I think we're all worried about that on the road. So that's the first and foremost in people's minds. And then bicycle pedestrian safety is usually at the top. So, yeah. Right on par. Taking a look at all the crashes that we were seeing and kind of what the issues were, we developed what we call a countermeasure. Toolbox. Now, this is a collection of engineering enforcement and educational countermeasures that we believe represent the most applicable countermeasures for the city of Chico based on what we're seeing. It's not a comprehensive list of everything out there, but we think it's the most applicable. In the engineering countermeasures that are brought forward, because the local road safety plan is really tied to grant funding, we broke out which of these. These are eligible for the H-CIP funding, which are not. I also broke it out into signalized intersections, non-signalized roadways, and the like, because there are a lot of countermeasures. And this is further detailed in Appendix D, the full toolbox there. Some examples for the education enforcement countermeasures. Really, first and foremost, we put together a safe routes to school plan. That was something that we identified being kind of a need across the board. It was agreed upon. We had the working group as well as an issue. There's a lot more in there, but don't want to get into the nitty-gritty. Having identified countermeasures that are applicable, now we needed to identify where those are going to happen. It's not really possible to identify how it will happen in every single specific one. So we wanted to identify the areas with the highest and greatest safety need. We did that with the crash data, and there is more than a copious amount of information in the back of the data. But it identifies the three intersections that we drilled a little bit deeper into. We're Esplanade East, 3rd and Mangrove, and then 8th and Main Street. And we picked those because not only did they have the highest need, but they also were not being addressed by any other ongoing safety. And just a little local lexicon, Esplanade. Sorry. I apologize. No, that's all right. It's all right. Just be careful how you say Ammon, too. I will. But those were the ones that we identified for there. And there are, this is just kind of a collection of the tables there. But we identified based on the annual societal costs which locations had the greatest need for those locations. For segments, we went through a very similar process. And we identified 20th Street and North Avenue as being the segments. And we identified the locations with the greatest need. There were a couple other that had a slightly higher societal cost. But those were largely due to the very short segment lengths. And then the small number of crashes being applied over that. So we pulled forward 20th Street and North Avenue. That segment will also be addressed by a Caltrans project coming up shortly. And then the idea is to address the other locations that were identified as having safety need through a systemic project. Similar to this segment. So we're going to go ahead and do that. And then we're going to go ahead and do a little bit of a look at the citywide systemic safety program. Which is addressing about 60 different locations across the city. And then here is just an idea of how those marry up pretty well. So it's a little bit hard to see. But in the orange, you'll see the locations that are being addressed currently by the citywide systemic safety program. And then in the green and the blue are the locations that we pushed or brought forward and identified through the local road safety plan. So they dovetail very well. Making sure that we're not double working on anything. But we're not just looking at a single location. Again, with the systemic approach, those locations that we didn't have the chance to really drill down deeper on. The approach going forward with those would be to use the counter measure toolbox as well as the FHWA risk factors. The Federal Highway Administration. They have risk factors identify when an intersection or roadway has an increased risk for safety risk. The idea would be to go out and identify what risk factors are in those locations. And build a system. And put together more of a systemic approach. A systemic grant application. And this is just a representation of those that we, those counter measures we think are probably most applicable in a systemic approach. Now as far as getting this actually on the ground, we've identified a number of different grant opportunities. As I mentioned before, the Highway Safety Improvement Program, H-SIP, is really the one that's focused on first by and large for safety improvements. However, there's a number of other grant opportunities from the ATP for safe routes to school, multi-modal aspects and the like. Or for enforcement through the CHP has a new grant available to supplement enforcement activities. And then NHTSA, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration also has some grants available. That's something we identified as being a need to increase and have some focused enforcement with that need to obtain that grant funding. As far as implementation time frames, we identified some ballpark implementation time frames for counter measures. But really there's a ton of information that we went through here. And with the focus areas and whatnot, it gets a little confusing. So we put it all together in what we call a focus area strategy table. So this answers the question of, okay, if we are going to address pedestrian safety or intersection safety in this example, this table is kind of your one-stop shop for everything in the project. So we put it in the plan that addresses intersection safety, who the responsible parties would be, the implementation time frames, performance measures, monitoring evaluations, and then potential grant funding to be pursued for those options as well. This document is intended to be a living document updated every four to five years. So as you go back and update that, having that table there will make it quite easy to go back, check what's been completed and what has not been. An illustration of the table. So that was a lot of information for you. But the next steps would be to get any and all comments from you here tonight, incorporate that into the document, and then go forth and pursue some grant funding to address safety. All right. I think it's a lot of great information. So thank you for that. So do we have any questions? I have a question. Are there speaker cards? Oh, we have one. Oh, we can talk to the speaker. But we can do questions first. I don't want to do my questions. All right. Okay. Well, we can do questions after, too. Does anybody have any questions they want to ask first? I'll go. Okay. What is your name, sir? My name is Cole Piper. Cole, that was a fantastic presentation. Thank you very much. You actually made that interesting and dynamic. That's good. I appreciate that. Are you familiar with Director Dowell? Because when he presents pie charts, I'll just let you work it out with him. Okay. Thank you very much. He wants pie. Okay. So he wants pie. Thank you. Mr. Oddboney, do you have anything to add? No. Great job, Cole, and I guess I owe the council a pie. We'll get more pieces now. Too early. Too early. Too soon. Too soon? I'll just add that, again, this is all premised on a lot of these grant funding opportunities that are coming out, and the requirements now are requiring this local road safety plan, so we're trying to strategically plan these. gear ourselves for those opportunities in the future as those opportunities arise. And again, it's premised on data and looking at that collision data. So again, a great job by our consultant and our team and looking forward to implementation. All right. Yeah, thank you for the amazing presentation and report. I know that you can't base these decisions on how people feel or if they're, you know, maybe there isn't collisions, but there's a lot of anxiety in certain parts of town. But, you know, we get plenty of communication. And I recently got some communication in the neighborhood I live in around that 6th and Esplanade crosswalk leading to Enloe. There's back and forth with those employees from the buildings across the Esplanade. And I'm just curious, I think one of my thoughts when I was reading through this is, will those ideas not be included in the bill? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. into, you know, these projects which are being prioritized by collision data. And was there a part of the public process where we took in that type of information that maybe the data to support the fear isn't there, but that there's a lot of anxiety on the part of folks who are frequenting those areas? Right. Certainly. That's one of those, that's a very good point. It's a hard part in safety planning because you need data to support, hey, we need to put data in place. And so, you know, we're not going to put data in place. We're not going to put a safety thing here, but you don't want that data because it means someone was hit and there was a fatality or serious injury perhaps. In the plan because we got such a strong response, we were able to take the comments for each focus area and do a heat map for all of those. Some got more dots than others, but the pedestrian and safety focus areas got a lot throughout the map and those are in I want to say Appendix B of the map of identifying what those are, identifying how many votes each one got. So there are some that got a lot of votes, but they don't really have the crashes behind them. Those can be addressed through kind of a systemic application where if you have one that has an intersection, for instance, it has two that have similar characteristics. One of it has had ten crashes and two fatalities and the other hasn't had any You can apply the same strategy at both to say even though we haven't had any crashes at, you know, this other intersection, there's a really good chance that it's just a matter of time. So that's where you can take those risk factors to a walking audit and identify and say we're gonna proactively address that, those safety concerns. So that's kind of one of the ways to address areas that are a little bit unsafe but haven't had a number of crashes. So got it, thank you. I appreciate that. Ms. Troutaboney, we have the Esplanade update, sorry, coming in 2023. That'll address some of those issues, yes? Yeah, many of those issues. And I do want to say specifically at 6 in Esplanade, we coordinated with Enloe, and they put up the funding, and we will be installing one of the rapid flashing beacons at that intersection so that we can provide that. Thank you for that. I guess government working quickly. Yeah, that was fast. Request granted. All right. Madam Clerk, we have a speaker. Yes? Thank you. Patrick Newman is our one and only speaker. I spent 10 or 15 years working on roads as a surveyor along with storm drains and sewers. Thank you. and stop signals and striping and all those kinds of things that go into making the traffic flow and that system work. Other than the 10 or 15 years I spent working in social services kind of capacities, hence some of my interest in homeless issues, but roads are easier. Roads are an easier subject. Except that in Chico we have this disease where we've been really irresponsible about collecting revenue for the last 10 years. And so when we talk about safety, road safety, we're looking at putting this grant funding on top of a system that's essentially falling apart. And the city's acknowledged this. I've heard the reports. And we're talking about hundreds of millions of dollars of technical debt, backlogged repairs of infrastructure that are not happening. That means that in a decline, in a declining city, which there's no clock. Okay. I'll try to keep it short. Well, no. You've got to help. I can't. Unfair. Unfair. I've got to be able to watch the clock. I'm pretty good at that, but I can't do it if I don't have a clock. Okay. I know those are costly, too, probably. Okay. No. Not a minute and 30 seconds. Okay. Thanks. Grant me another minute or so, if you will, and I'll forget about the clock. Okay. So what happens when your infrastructure falls apart is you have an inherently unsafe system. And when you have a declining city, and we're seeing this more and more, everything is done by lawsuits. So more and more, the city is sort of like being attacked as an organism by more and more litigation. Because we haven't collected sales taxes, as 99% of other cities have for the last 10 years, we're underfunded on our pensions by $160 million. We're underfunded on infrastructure, by $200 million or so. So if you start getting this grant funding and throwing these safety devices and fancy little clicking things and little lights for people. Okay. You're putting, it's ritualistic, and you're dropping a sort of safety pageantry on top of a system that's essentially failing. The other day I saw them painting a stop bar and the word stop on the street, but the pavement under what they were painting was absolutely deteriorating and failing. So I know what it takes to build roads. I know what it looks like when roads are falling apart. Somewhere way over 90% of our roads are falling apart. Once you start to see cracking and you start to see water working its way into those roads, they begin to buckle, and if you drive our residential streets, that's what we see. So this disease of looking for superficial, you know, kind of things that might appeal to the public and maybe some grant funding here and there and stuff, it might be a distraction from the fundamental issue, which is that Chico is a failing city until we get ahead of this. And because we've failed for a decade to do this, it's going to take decades to get out of it. So I'm trying to bring a reality check here to this. Thank you. All right. Entertain a motion. Resolution. Move to approve. Second. Second. We have a motion and a second to adopt the resolution. Madam Clerk? Council Member Brown? Aye. Council Member Morgan? Yes. Council Member Tandon? Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds? Aye. Mayor Coolidge? Aye. Carries 5-0. All right. Item 5.3, Hope Street Coalition presentation. Vice Mayor Reynolds, I believe you had something first. Yeah, I just wanted to thank my fellow councilmen. I'm here for voting unanimously to have Mr. Webster come and make a presentation to us tonight. Mr. Webster has extensive knowledge and sought after skills in navigating homeless solutions and communities. His understanding of the federal government while working at HUD, the role of the state, county, and last but not least, the city government, is knowledge I believe that could possibly help the city of Chico in our future endeavors. So with that said, I look forward to hearing more from Mr. Webster about his Hope Street Coalition. Well, good evening. I'm Mayor Coolidge, Vice Mayor Reynolds, members of the council. It's really my privilege and honor to present to you and share with you a little bit of my background and some of the observations I'm making on this really challenging and complex subject that's not just gripping the city of Chico but cities all up and down California and actually all over the country. My name is Paul Webster. I'm the founder and director of Hope Street Coalition. And what I'm really here to do is just to offer my help to the city of Chico in understanding and overcoming hopefully some of the challenges regarding homelessness. Hope Street Coalition is a new grassroots advocacy effort that's focused on the intersection of homelessness, mental illness, and drug addiction. And we stress and focus on this. This population, for a specific reason, and that's because it represents those who are the most vulnerable. It represents those who are experiencing the most significant suffering on the streets. And it also represents the population in individuals experiencing homelessness that is increasing the most and driving the national increase in homelessness. So when you look at HUD data and you look at how we're doing in the city of Chico, how they differentiate between sheltered and unsheltered populations, and how that contributes to homelessness in general, what HUD is declaring is that the increase in unsheltered homelessness is driving the increase in homelessness generally. And when you look at other data sources, particularly the Policy Lab study from UCLA, you see that the unhoused mentally ill and the unhoused addicted are a significant part of that unsheltered population. So focusing on that allows decision makers to better understand how to help those populations that are perhaps a little less vulnerable, that have a little more resources, or things like that. So we're focusing on the mentally ill, the addicted, and the, I should probably do this whole start slide thing. Sorry about that. There it is. Okay. Good. Thank you. So what we do is we do fight for the unhoused mentally ill and addicted, and we try to serve communities through coalition building by coming alongside communities, coming alongside business groups, faith groups, and the public to increase their awareness and to promote information that help them drive better decisions about homelessness. One of the things that I specifically like to focus on is the things that are known, that is the law and the regulation and the approaches that are already in place right now. A lot of folks believe that homelessness is kind of this kind of ersatz, kind of what can we do to solve this? But in reality, there's so much regulatory work that's going on, there's statutory requirements, there are biases in the notice of funding availability, and there's statutory considerations to be made, both at the federal and the state level, that impacts localities like cities like Chico. So a little bit about myself. I have a master's in public policy from the University of Southern California. I recently served as a senior policy advisor for the Department of Housing and Urban Development. I was, I've done a lot of different things. But all of them focused on public policy. I've worked at the program level as vice president for a homelessness service provider that was focusing on homeless families from vulnerable populations. I also worked in the United States Congress as the chief of staff in the United States House of Representatives, and at the state level in the assembly and in the California Senate. So I think I've touched all the bases in terms of local, state, federal, in terms of public policy and regulation. So one of the things that really was interesting to me when I was at HUD, I was struck by the lack of pushback that Continuums of Care and also municipalities or regions make when they saw that the regulations and the programs that came down from either the federal government or the state were not working in their areas. They were being given tools, being given tools that weren't having the desired result. And so the more that I started looking into the data, the more I started comparing data, because what HUD does a lot of times is they will compare one year over the other. They'll basically say, oh, you know, homelessness increased by 2%. But they often fail to look at the trends. And so what I've done here is just pulled up, it's actually a six-year, but a five-year Continuum of Care trend in terms of data. And what you can see is you've seen about a 25% increase in federal Continuum of Care awards for Butte County Continuum of Care. You see a 123% increase in the point-in-time count. You see an 8% increase in the subpopulation of chronically homeless, a 57% increase in the mentally ill who are unhoused, and a 20% increase in folks who are experiencing homelessness who have a self-reported substance abuse. The reason I bring this, I compare the data this way, is because it really gives you an idea of how the funding is working. Are we seeing homelessness increase? Are we seeing it decrease? Are we seeing it stay the same? I think here this illustrates that we're seeing increases in funding, but not having the desired result of a decrease in homelessness in the Continuum of Care. So just to give you a sense of comparison, I decided to put a comparison of what we're doing here locally in Butte County and then compare that to the state of California. You can see both levels of government have seen increases in Continuum of Care funding. We've also seen increases in point-in-time count, in chronic, and in the subpopulations. So there's some interesting changes, particularly in terms of the point-in-time count, One thing I know is that between 2016 and 2017, there seems to be a real jump in how the Butte County Continuum of Care carried out at point-in-time count. And that's really important to understand, to know how programs are working, and whether or not the data is actually corresponding to the programming. But the bottom line here and the reason for this slide is basically to show that what's happening here in Chico is not unique. It's happening all up and down the state, and for the most part it's happening all up and down the West Coast and often in other parts of the country as well. So what I'm hoping to do and what I'd like to offer the city of Chico is really three things. Help them formulate a strategic plan on homelessness because it's important in this contention issue to understand what the limitations are that the city can do with respect to law and regulation, but also have a bit of a plan to know what's in and what's out. If the community can agree that certain things in addressing homelessness are in, and we can agree on that, then we can work together. And if we can at the same time agree what's out, that is, what is the responsibility of the state of California? What is the responsibility of the federal government? It allows you to direct resources and action at the appropriate level. One thing that I like to bring up is the issue of mental illness. And the federal policy with respect to mental illness has real intangible consequences at the local level because of the way that states are not reimbursed through Medicaid for psychiatric capacity in beds. It impacts how you're able to offer treatment and whether or not those individuals that are suffering on the street are able to actually find a place where they can receive appropriate housing and treatment or if they will continue to cycle back into the streets, into hospitals, and into perhaps jails or other kinds of incarceration. That's an important policy consideration to think of from a municipality's perspective because it has real tangible impacts in terms of how you determine where you want to go, including the entirety of mental illness, addiction, housing, and other issues that impact homelessness. The second thing that I'd like to really focus on is this raising awareness of homeless policies and data. The, you know, I've been following from a long time and I've been looking from afar at some of the city council meetings and noting some of the public speakers and everybody's got an idea about homelessness. Everybody has got an opinion and an angle in what they think is appropriate or not. But a lot of times those suggestions are just outside of the bounds of what a municipality can do. They're either prohibited by law, there's exorbitant funding that are attached to those things, or there's regulatory restrictions that prohibit those ideas from really coming forth and being really realistic alternatives. So by allowing the public to understand and educating the public, you know, and I thought it was interesting just following the lawsuit, you know, one of the things that I think the judge commented on is, you know, the city needs to do a better job of educating its constituencies about what is within the law and what's without the law. Well, I'd love to take that on because I think I have a certain perspective and expertise. That might help. I don't say I'm going to make any promises or miracles, but I think that more information is always better than less. And having accurate information, particularly with respect to law, policy, and data, in my view is always a good thing. The third thing I'd like to do is recommend various city actions. And there are certain things that are within the jurisdiction and the authority of the city of Chico that can be done to help facilitate and advance the policy. And advance the goals of the strategic plan and advance the goals of the city. These things are never without a lot of fight and a lot of controversy, but I do believe that there could be some opportunities in formulating very specific actions. For example, I know that there was a particular group that was contracted with the county to do some outreach and do some statistical work. And they were able to do some surveys to find out what's going on with the homeless population that are unsheltered. I think those kinds of things can also be carried on to some of the various homeless service providers that receive authority to do what they do through conditional use permits. There's opportunity there. So I'd like to explore that. What do you mean by that? What do I mean by that? Yeah. What I mean by that is there's opportunities. So, for example, I think last council president, there was a presentation, there was a presentation, or last council meeting, there was a presentation by the continuum of care. And there was a question that said, can the city ask various questions so that they can get underneath some of the data? And the answer to the question is unequivocally, yes, the city can. Now whether or not they want to make that a part of the operations and the survey of the continuum of care, which was explained at that meeting, that it would cost significant money to have the vendor rejigger its HMIS program, could be. But you could also do those same things internally within the authority of the municipality. So take some of that opportunity, take some of that authority as the city, and say, look, if you're going to do business in the city, we want to have a little bit of skin in the game. We want some feedback that's going to help us make our decisions about what is best and whether or not, because at the end of the day, my hope is that people want to know, is homelessness going up? Is it going down? Or is it staying the same? And I think that by using some of the tools at your behalf, you can find those things out. And these are simply ideas that I have that are recommendations, and the council may agree with them, they may disagree with them, but that's just one example. So, so those are some of the things that I have. There are things that I'm presenting and suggesting, but I do think there are some ways that the city can step out, make some changes, inform the public, increase awareness of some policies and the data, and go about the work of formulating a strategic plan so that we understand what's the light at the end of the tunnel, and what's in and what's out. A number of years ago, when the Continuous of Care was starting, there were a lot of homelessness advocates that promised, within 10 years, we're going to end homelessness. Well, that just simply hasn't happened. But the same policies and the same approaches and the same regulatory framework is still in place. I'm not going to make any promises about what this council could do, or what the public could do to reduce homelessness. I think that's a long-term solution. But it's important to be able to have the kind of expertise, the understanding, and the objectivity to be able to offer certain strategies, certain actions, and certain plans, so that the city can have a better handle on exactly what it is they want to go, and how that meets with the community, and kind of have a guiding star so that you know that, as you bring it up, as you bring in new council members, as you appoint different people, there's certain policies and certain direction that the city has agreed that they want to go. So, in conclusion, I really appreciate the opportunity to present before the council. Thank you so much for allowing me to share some of my ideas and some of my expertise, and I'm perfectly open to questions at this time. All right, questions? No? Yeah, I actually have a couple questions. Council Member Brown? Have you supported the development of these types of plans in other cities? I have. Where? I have in my hometown of Vista. I'm from North San Diego County, so I've supported, I've spoke, I've engaged in the city of Vista. I've also done so in the city of Oceanside. I've been involved from a federal level in providing recommendations to, you know, whether it's Little Rock, Arkansas, or Sonoma County. So, you know, some of it is formal, some of it is less formal. Sure. So, yeah, I have, I've been very familiar with not only the strategic plan, but the interactions between counties and cities. You know, it's interesting, in certain parts of the country, the city council and the county, they don't want anything to do with the Continuance of Care. They're basically saying, look, you know, that's the entity that deals with those federal fundings, but we don't really want to have anything to do with that. It's an interesting model. Here in California, it's one that is very focused on coordination and collaboration. So it's different wherever, you know, in terms of the places that I've spoken with in the past. Sure. I think, so have you developed a strategic plan before, or done just more? Well, I've developed strategic plans and strategic reforms at the federal level, and those, you know, those kind of went through the bureaucracy, particularly with respect to the response to COVID-19 and how homelessness programs would at the federal level. Yeah. But, you know, Hope Street Coalition is a very new entity. So we incorporated earlier this year. So, you know, in terms of Hope Street Coalition as a legal entity doing that, you know, just, you know, very anecdotal, very casual. But yeah, this would be a, you know, this would be an exciting opportunity for me because I'd love to be able to help and see if there's opportunity there. Sure. Just a couple more questions. Certainly. You talked about in your presentation what's in and what's out as it relates to this plan. How is that decided? How is that decided? Well, I think part of it's decided is understanding the law. You know, we know that here in California, we're under the Ninth Circuit Court, under Martin v. Boise. We know that there are certain things that are in and certain things that are out. For example, under Martin v. Boise, municipalities are prevented from enforcing certain city ordinances if there's no beds available at shelters. So that's obviously in, right? Other things that are in that may not be, you know, common knowledge is the issues of county funding for addiction treatment or state requirements with respect to how state dollars are used for the provision of various treatment and services. Those are other things that are in. What are out? Well, you know, for example, there's lots of interesting conversations going on about everything from tiny homes to, you know, transporting people back to where they came. You know, I'm not suggesting tiny homes are out, but I'm just saying that these kinds of things, you know, for example, HUD doesn't fund tiny homes, and they won't fund tiny homes. So we know that that's out when it comes to continuum of care dollars. So if there's a push to move for that kind of a housing intervention, then it's going to have to come from some other funding source. So those are what I'm talking about. As people understand the regulatory and the legal framework, they're better able to make those kinds of decisions. Thank you. I'm sorry to interrupt. You're welcome. All right. Further questions, comments? I have some comments, but I'll wait until after. Okay. We have public speakers. Yes, we have three speakers. Three. Okay. Three minutes. Nicole Nava, followed by Patrick Newman. Good evening again. So I might have missed the frame-up of that conversation. I was very appreciative of Mr. Walker's information, but I wasn't clear if he was, like, a consultant that could come in and then you guys can agree, and, you know, then we lay out and get to a down and dry, dirty plan that works, or whether that means, like, how we would approach the county or service providers, et cetera. So that being more clear would probably be great for the public for more participation. I'm hopeful about all this, but, like, all of the slides, I kind of had expected a little more meat and potatoes in the slides, so I was trying to track, because a lot of that I knew already, of course. A lot of us have been researching, as have you. And so I'm... I'm hopeful and I'm sure there's a lot more behind it, given the speaker's experience. And so I think it'll be great to see some follow-up. I think all of these topics are things that we all have been saying are so germane, that there are things driving homelessness and looking at why people are out there and struggling and aren't connecting to services. What can we do to change that? What's the silver bullet? And, you know, again, I just feel like there's so many opportunities, you guys have a base level thing you've landed on already for a partial solution. I feel like it's a partial solution because there's so much more. And you heard from the judge that for our situation in Chico, we're not quite there yet. That was obvious. Otherwise, he would have done something. And he doesn't want to be the one to do the something, but he will, was very clear. So what can we do to move the needle to where we need to get it to serve this community? And I think you're hearing people giving and taking here a little bit. And so it's kind of up to you guys maybe to take this leap and to figure out what can we do? Are there some funding source opportunities that, like, just didn't resonate? Are there people willing to donate? I've heard about donors for the BMX, donors for this, donors for that. Where are those folks? Can we plug in somewhere and just shore up some of these things we're missing to kind of get there? Because these folks are human beings. They have moms, pops, daughters, sons that want them, and we want them home too. And even those that don't have somebody, they have somebody who cares. They do have their community out there. And so, like, what can we do to flip it where they believe in themselves and what can we do to get them there? So I hear a lot of people saying I'm humane and I can do this and I can do that. And I think, again, the service providers, maybe take a step back and look. There was some things the judge pointed out that are kind of problematic, like you get to stay this long, then you have to exit, then you have to come back in. Maybe some folks didn't know that. There's some where maybe was religion, was religion mandated, was it not? That precludes some people from feeling they can participate. Are these things that we really want to hang us up? Can they come forward and, like, eradicate those? Let's come together, as I've been saying. Thank you, Speaker. That was great. Patrick Newman followed by Jessica Giannola. I try to follow homeless issues as much as I can, and I saw this on the agenda. So I went online and tried to get some background on Mr. Webster and his program. So probably the most useful piece of information I found was an interview with Mr. Webster and Dr. Drew. He's a well-known talk show kind of host, I guess. I don't follow Dr. Drew a whole lot, but it was an hour and a half, and it was illuminating, I think, because it gave me a pretty clear idea where Mr. Webster is coming from. I suggest you watch it. It will probably give you a better idea than what we've seen here tonight. I don't know what these plans look like. I haven't seen one. I don't know what this organization is doing, because it doesn't seem to have any track record. What I got out of the interview with Dr. Drew was that Mr. Webster seems to believe that we do not have a housing shortage or a housing deficit at the core of our problem. But that lots of mentally ill people have fallen onto our streets. And that what seems to come through in his thought process is that we need large congregate shelters to house the mentally ill and get them off the streets. There was discussion of the Lanternman Act from the 1960s and 70s, the Lanternman Acts, which were really a thrust on the civil liberties and human rights for people who are mentally ill. And trying with the pharmaceutical revolution in our mental hospitals, we were able to, at least in theory, place a lot of mentally ill people in the community again. And this worked really well with developmentally disabled folks. I worked 10 years with that, doing independent living skills. What wasn't addressed is the fact that we utterly failed to support the mentally ill population that was institutionally ill, and that was institutionalized in California when it came to placements in our communities. So yes, that is a large percentage of the population, including a lot of people with brain injuries and a whole raft of other issues. But there's a horrible 40-year failure to provide reasonable accommodations and housing for these people and to support them well with social services. So that hybrid problem right there is a lot of what explains why we have this on the streets. Now the answer is not to go back to pre-Lanternman era, where we just sort of use this authoritarian model, strip people of their rights and start reinstitutionalizing them. Another thing that's not addressed when I hear this talk is who's going to pay for this and what kind of quality of care are we talking about? We're talking about very expensive care. Anyway, I'm down to 15, 13 seconds. So I think that there needs to be a whole lot more exploration of what's going on here. And I'm kind of confused about what's going on, but it doesn't align with what I know about homelessness at all. Thank you. Our last speaker is Sarah. This is Jessica Giannola. So like the previous speaker, I also did some research on who was speaking tonight and came across, I think, the same video. So it's something worth watching. I'm going to assume that the goal of what the previous, what the presentator, the presentating person is aiming for is treatment before housing. Like not having a housing first type model. And I can tell you with the dangers in that, if you have an individual... Jessica, hold on one second. Clock, please. Oh, I didn't even notice. Thank you. Sorry. Go ahead. Okay, sorry. So if you have an individual who is suffering from untreated mental illness or addiction, withholding the housing piece is not going to get them recovered. Or in a process of recovery. They're still living in a state of fear in survival mode. So their brain can never even get to that point. So I want to just make sure that we're still focusing on people, human beings, need to be housed. That's their safety. They have walls to help protect them from what's outside. And the people in the house experience a lot of trauma. And in Butte County, we have 75.6% of people, 75.6% of adults here who have experienced at least one aspect on the ACEs score. And California is one of the highest in the country. We have a lot of trauma here. Throw in the fire and we have a lot of people who are, who apply to needing just basic counseling. That should not be the preventing measure of getting housing. I do have concerns with the Hope Street Coalition presenting a model to you that you might adopt. Just because there is no... There's no supportive proof that what they're suggesting is working. When you want to adopt a model, you want to look at research, where it's worked before, was it independently fact-checked? And there isn't anything. The only thing I could find was their own publication saying it worked. So we need to really be careful with what kind of models we're adopting when we're looking at resolutions in Chico. Let's see what else I put down. Put some notes down. I know HUD is an important piece for housing in our area because we have a high poverty rate too and people are dependent on public assistance for housing. AHV funds, we have emergency housing vouchers that can help with that that has less restrictions than basic Section 8. If we could advocate for more Section 8 funding, that would really help us at People House. Sorry. Just seeing if there's anything else. I wanted to stay on it. I don't know. I just really object to the forcing of treatment before housing aspect, which seems to be what their program is about. The rest is just the same repetitive stuff. That's the idea. Thank you. Thank you. All right. What's up with the report? I had a couple of questions. Mr. Webster, maybe you could address a little bit of kind of maybe what the process would look like for Chico because this isn't a one-stop shop fits all. What worked in Vista or what worked in Ocean City is not going to be the same as what works here. So if the city was to consider doing something with Chico, how would you communicate with the citizens? How would the process go just to give the city a chance to do something? And then what would you do to give them a little bit more to create this strategic plan? Yeah. So thank you very much for the question. I put together just a set of recommendations that would include kind of public forums to provide input and to engage in public awareness so that we're all kind of like talking on the same sheet of music just with respect to regulatory policy, law, that kind of a thing. And then from that and other types of conversations, conversations with fire, with police, with the local medical hospitals, medical county, understand a little better in terms of some of the statistical data. Some of the things that I'm very interested in is how many 5150 holds occur in the city? How many 5250 holds? How long is the duration? How many psychiatric beds are available in Butte County? How many psychiatrists that address the situation? How many psychiatrists that address public psychiatric capacity are available in Butte County? Are there any treatment, are there any addiction treatment programs? How are those met within the continuum of care? What happens when somebody is picked up because of a 5150 or if somebody is nodded off and EMS rolls up on them? What's the statistics on those things? How many people have died in Chico per year? Who are experiencing homeless a month? Those are the kinds of data, those are the kinds of questions that I think we need to be driving. Also things, I understand that there was a request from, I think it was from Mayor Coolidge last council meeting about where geographically in Butte County is the money going? What programs are the money going in? And what's the spend out rate for those things? I think those are legitimate questions so that people can actually understand what is the cost benefit analysis? You know, in response to some of the speakers, you know, yes, there is more money at the federal, state, and local level than ever before to address the needs of people experiencing homelessness. Never in the history of the United States has there been fewer resources than now. That is a fact from HUD and it has to do with the financial resources and also the housing capacity. So why, if there's more resources than ever before, if there's more capacity than ever before, is homelessness increasing? Those are the kinds of questions that I would love to dig into at the local level. And we need to do that by having some interviews, having some conversations, presenting those in public forums. And then the next part of the process is identifying what some of the recommendations could be. Formulating and having people contribute to what a strategic plan could look like. What are the priorities? There's a very different objective when you say our objective is to house people versus our objective is to end homelessness. Those are two very different things. And we have two very different objectives. Because we know that there is a significant number of folks who are unhoused here in Chico and other parts of our state that are rejecting services. They're rejecting housing. Why is that happening? What are the things that when we have a surplus of resources that we're not able to direct to those individuals that are in need? So that kind of a process. A very iterative process. One that's focused on local data. One that's focused on data beyond the economics. There's a couple of interesting narratives that take place in homelessness conversations. It's not just here, but it's everywhere. It's a national narrative. And one of the narratives is that people are homeless because they can't afford the rent. Okay. Well, we have more resources than ever before, more housing capacity than ever before, more rental assistance because of the American Rescue Plan and because of the CARES Act than ever before in the history. But yet homelessness is increasing. Those are really interesting questions. And they're questions that come down from, they're policies that come down from the federal government. So reviewing those federal policies that come down from the state of California, reviewing those state policies, and making them, making them aware at the local level and say, you know, like I said before, are these policies that are advancing or are they hindering the city of Chico to do right by those folks who are suffering on the streets? So using this kind of iterative process, using this kind of data-based process, and in response to the one speaker who said, oh, well, you know, I'm presenting an approach or a program. That's not what I'm doing. I'm just simply saying, let's engage in a conversation about this and let's work together to figure out, based on the parameters of what happens at the federal, state, and local level, how can we actually come together and find a path to move forward? So I'm not endorsing any particular, I will say one thing. I think that it is absolute, absolute poverty in our country, in our state, and at our local level, that for the unhoused mentally ill, there is a policy, and it is called tragedy before treatment. I'd like to flip that around. I'd like to flip it around so it's treatment before tragedy. I think that helps people suffering on the street. It helps communities. It saves lives, and it improves communities. So that, I mean, I'm kind of getting out of soapbox here. But I think what it is, it's just a really iterative process. One of the interesting things that I find in the communities that I present to and I talk to, and when I connect the dots between the lack of psychiatric capacity in our communities, and homelessness, people are astounded. They don't understand the barriers to get people treated. And it's not a, and it's not a housing ready, it's just treatment within the appropriate context. Whether that's a congregate care facility, or whatever is appropriate, for clinical outcomes. Those are part of the puzzle pieces that are missing. And we've got to figure out how we can include those components in the solution. So my process is really, it's very iterative, it's very data driven, it's very interview driven, it's very collaborative. And then it's a matter of recommending. What is the city council's priorities? What are their goals? What are their objectives? Once we get to that, then we can actually figure out, you know, is there a plan? The plans that I've worked on in the past, some elements are adopted, some elements are rejected. It's a democratic, and it is a council led process. And I'm just hoping that maybe there's an opportunity to consult on these things, to give you just a little bit of additional knowledge, additional awareness, additional experience, so that Chico can actually navigate their way out of some of these challenges. I hope that answers your question. All right. Any other questions? No? Yes, ma'am. I think one of the things that have held us back the most, or at least that has been the most frustrating for me since I've been here, and we've talked about this in staff meeting and everywhere else we go, is that there's never been a plan. We're always putting a Band-Aid here and a Band-Aid here, and we're fixing this and we're fixing that. And even with the litigation that we're in now, even if we come to an agreement, solution, whatever on that, that doesn't change where we're at as a community. So I would like to direct staff to see if there's a way to have this public input, to have this process, to have a partnership with Hope Street Coalition to see if we can get some sort of a strategic plan for our community. I just think it's something that if you don't know where you're going, then how do we know if we're getting there and if we have any markers to tell us whether we're getting there or not? And I think having some of these community meetings, having these conversations, having everybody in the room is something that maybe could be healing and we can find some places that we can come together on. I know we've gone through two homeless solutions coordinators and we haven't been able to do anything with that. So I'm willing to give it a try if my counsel so supports. Is that a motion? Yeah. Go ahead. Council Member Moore. It sounds like, I don't want to put words in the Vice Mayor's mouth, are you asking staff to perhaps reply to a proposal from Hope Street Coalition? Yeah. Because we don't have one. We don't have a proposal. I didn't want to put them on the spot and be like, all right, how much money are we talking about? Yeah. I could. I would say the direct staff to engage with Hope Street and see if it's something that's affordable. I'd be interested in that. I mean, I think the staff are very interested. Interesting. I think some people did their homework to fight back against some of the things he said. But I'll support the motion of staff reaching out to Hope Street Coalition and seeing what that could look like. But it's got to come back to us for approval before we spend any money. Okay. Any other comments? I just wanted to thank Mr. Webster for coming here and presenting the ideas with us. And so we have heard a lot in the past many years. And despite all the resources that have been spent on homelessness, it's increasing. And there's nothing that I've heard so far, so I would be willing to see a proposal from Hope Street Coalition. And see if we can make it work. And maybe the leaders used to go that way, too. All right. Madam Clerk. Was that a second by Council Member Morgan? I thought it was. Was that a second, Council Member Morgan? Clarification, which I received approval on, and then a second. Yeah, I didn't hear you say a second. But I trust you. What? I know. What? The guy from USC in the room. I could see why you would trust me. All right. Oh, I just. Okay, never mind. Council Member Brown? No. Council Member Morgan? Yes. Council Member Tandon? Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds? Aye. Mayor Coolidge? Aye. Carries 4-1. All right. Thank you. Next item is yours. Clerk and President, item 5.4, Board and Commissioner Appointments. This very. very quick. Obviously, we were going to be bringing back the Boards and Commission appointments for the remaining three boards, Airport Commission, ARHPB Board, and as well as the Climate Action Commission due to the resignations. And because on the Climate Action Commission, the appointments are individually made, I wanted to let the Council know that as soon as you make your appointments and after August, perhaps we will bring those. Board and Commissions back. Well, we will. We just need to have a full Council up here. So I just wanted to let you know it hasn't been forgotten. It's just it was going to be on this agenda, but due to the resignations that the Council is facing, we felt it was best to hold off on that until we could bring it all back. All right. Thank you. Okay. Moving on to number six, Reports and Communications. Following Reports and Communications. Items are provided for Council's information. No action can be taken on items under this section unless the Council agrees to include it on a subsequent agenda. Item 6.1, Council City Manager's Report. Mr. Warren. Yes, Honorable Mayor and City Council Members. Just four quick items. One is that I wanted to make sure that you knew that we purposed to pull off the strategic planning item that was going to be at this meeting. Obviously, down to Council Members. I know you need two Council Members additional to you so that we can pull that together. So Deputy City Manager McCarthy will be bringing that back at a later time, just making sure that you and the public are aware of that. A couple of other things I wanted to focus on. Two departments. One, I just am continuing to be amazed by Director Ottoboni and his team. Currently has seven capital projects underway. It was highlighted recently on the radio. And I think that's a good thing. I think that the public doesn't hear it enough how much work and due diligence is being conducted by the department and the team that he has. Twenty-six million dollars. It's probably the most we've ever had ongoing at one time in the city's history in capital projects in the city over the summer that we're going to see start to get off the ground. So good job. Excellent work. And I just wanted to commend you and make sure that the public's aware of all of the work being done there. In addition to that, Fire Chief Standridge has been pulling off miracle after miracle with his team in the fire department. Obviously, we had our fire here in the park. But he's also got crews out on a couple of other fires that are raging in the north state. And so I just want to commend the fire department, the men and women of that department, and Chief Standridge for keeping it together here as we're helping a lot of other folks outside and also taking care of our own house. So commendations to the fire department. Great work. And then finally, a lot of folks are aware of the fact that we've got a temporary solution in place for a resting site. For those that are out there. Those that are houseless. I just want to make sure that folks know that there are people utilizing that space. And as of 4 o'clock this evening, there were five RVs and two tents out there. So I just want to make sure that the council and the public are aware that that is available for those who are houseless. And the basics are out there. You've got restroom facilities, hand washing facilities. You have a covering area. You have a space for people to be. And so I just want to make sure I'm hearing from those that it isn't being marketed enough or it's not being heard enough out there. So under my report, I wanted to make sure and just highlight the fact that there are some folks out there and the space is available. We would encourage people to be there. So if they need a space to be. So with that, that concludes my report. Thank you very much. All right. And yes, definitely to staff, well done on all those various aspects. But that funding is huge. So thank you for that. So all right. Item 6.2 is the annual diversity action plan update. Informational only. Monthly funding. Financial report and budgeting monitoring reports. Informational only. And then council member requests presented to AP and P1010. Council members may verbally request an item agendized at a future meeting. After stating what the item would be, a majority vote of the council is needed in order for staff to agendize. Council members may also submit requests in writing. Any requests? Seeing none, we'll move on to item 7. Council recess. Recess in the conference room 1. But do we have any public comments or council disqualifications on any of the items? I don't have any speakers. No speakers. All right. Any council disqualifications? All right. With that, we'll move into closed session. Thank you very much.
