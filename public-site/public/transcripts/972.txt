 All right. Debbie, are we ready? Okay. Okay, call this meeting to order. The regular City Council meeting of the Chico City Council, May 4th, 2021. And we'll start with our invocation by Police Chaplain Burkett. Thank you, Mr. Mayor, Council. Lord God, we just ask you to be present here today to guide. Guide this meeting. Guide all those that are attending. And the decisions that need to be made, they're made to honor the city and our community. Lord, we just ask you to watch over everyone here tonight and bless those in attendance. These things we pray in your most precious and glorious name. Amen. All right, if you could please stand and join me in the Pledge of Allegiance. Show your name, please. Show your name, please. Show your name, please. Show your name, please. Show your name, please.

Here. And Mayor Coolidge? Present. Okay, we're going to start with two proclamations. National Small Business Week proclamation. Melanie Jasset and Katie Tomer, if you'll join me down at the podium. It's fine. Hello. Hello. Nice to see you, love. All right, I'm going to have the proclamation. All right, we have a proclamation for Small Business Week, May 2nd to May 8th, 2021. Whereas America's progress has been driven by pioneers who think big, take risks, and work hard, and the small business community is the very core of our nation's identity and prosperity. And whereas small business owners and main street businesses have energy and a passion for what they do, from storefront shops that anchor main street to high-tech startups that keep America on the cutting edge, small businesses are the backbone of our economy and the cornerstone of our nation's promise. And whereas when we support small business, jobs are created, and local communities preserve. They're unique culture. And whereas the President of the United States has proclaimed National Small Business Week every year since 1963 to highlight the programs and services available to entrepreneurs through the small, U.S. Small Business Administration and other government agencies to celebrate the resolve and ingenuity of small businesses, entrepreneurs, workers in the communities across the country. And whereas the city of Chico supports and joins in this national effort to help, America's small businesses do what they do best, grow their business, create jobs, and ensure that our communities remain as vibrant as they are today. Now therefore, it be it resolved that I, Andrew Coolidge, Mayor of the City of Chico, on behalf of the Chico City Council, do hereby proclaim May 2nd to the 8th, 2021, National Small Business Week, and urge each individual in the community to patronize the small business, shop local, and support Chico businesses. Many thanks. Show of hands, please. Show of hands, please. Show of hands, please. Show of hands, please. Show of hands, please. Show of hands, please. Show of hands, please. Show of hands, please. Show of hands, please. Show of hands, please. Show of hands, please. Show of hands, please. Show of hands, please. Show of hands, please. for being intentional in patronizing local businesses through the Christmas holiday and take out Tuesday and really making an effort. It really did make a difference. So as we continue to recover our local economy, we ask that you continue to support businesses in Chico, namely restaurants especially. They've been hit the hardest. So thank you for everything. Well, we did everything that came, sir. We appreciate the recognition on behalf of the Dan Can Chico Business Association. It was a rough year, but we're bouncing back. And we do very much appreciate our partnership with the city and all the community that has stepped up and really come downtown and made this happen. The market starts Thursday night. We're thrilled about that, seeing everybody. See you downtown. Thank you. Well, thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. All right. Richie, you want to come on down? All right. You get to receive this proclamation for all your hard work as well. So whereas in 1872, Sterling Morton proposed to the Board of Agriculture of Nebraska that a special date be set aside. Okay. So, he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed food for our homes, fuel for our fires, and beautify our community. And whereas the National Arbor Day Foundation has recognized the city of Chico as a tree city for the 37th year. So, Richie, I would just like to say you do an amazing job out there planting trees in this community and taking care of our urban forest, and we truly appreciate it. This guy, I know for a fact, knows some hard-bought trees than anyone I've ever met, and I learned a lot in just a short time finding along with you the other day. So very welcome, my colleagues, and thank you for coming along on March 12th when we celebrated California Arbor Day. And City Manager Mark O'Neill, to be out and about, thank you for coming along on Friday when we celebrated National Arbor Day with the students, wonderful students, of Parkview Elementary School. We spent the entire morning with the first graders and third graders. We planted lots of trees, and the kids had such a great time. So lots of thanks to Kelly Staley and Chico Unified School District, for helping us put that event on, and we hope to see that event happen every year, as well as all the community events that we have going. We did just finish a new tree inventory, so we know exactly how many trees we have in the city right of way. We also know how many vacant tree planting spots we have as well, and we have over 9,000. Thank you. It's a big number. Thank you. We're doing everything we can to close that gap. We'll never plant them all, but if you have a vacant spot outside your home, if you feel that you need a shade tree, please get in touch and reach out to our partner, non-profit partner, the Environmental Council. You can call 891-6424 or email them, and we'll get you set up with a shade tree, because it's truly, it's important, because we live in a hot city, so we really need that shade. So thank you all. Thank you. Thank you. It's a really big community effort to get those streets in the ground. And then later, actually this month, we'll be starting the Urban Forest Master Plan. So that'll generate a roadmap which really helps decide what Chico will look like in the future. We all know there's many problems that we're working through in Chico. Housing is one of them. But let me tell you something, what the house looks like on the outside is as important as what it looks like on the inside. You know, the streets and the communities where we live are vitally important. And we want to do everything we can to increase the current appeal of our homes and communities. And tree planting is not the only thing that we can do, but it's a big part of really providing beautification and all the benefits that Mayor Coolidge read out of the proclamation. So thank you. Please get in touch and volunteer. And if you want a tree, give me a call. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. All right. So a few notes about public participation. This meeting is being conducted in accordance with executive order N2920. Public participation and attendance at the meeting. Masks are required. Citizens are allowed to attend the meeting in person with attendance limited to 50% capacity and designated seating. All feedback there. All right. Face masks are required in order to attend the meeting and address the council in the council chamber. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. set outside in the lobby. Audio will be available outside for those choosing not to sit inside the chamber. Public participation prior to the meeting. The Engaged Chico Civic Engagement Program was made available for citizen input on individual agenda items prior to the meeting. Engaged Chico commenting closed at 430. Council has been provided with a hard copy of all comments received in this platform. Remote public participation during the meeting. The public may view the meeting on Comcast Channel 11 via streaming video found on the city's website. And also please note if you'd like to fill out a speaker card for each of individual item. I'll be saying this for every item just so we remind folks but please fill out that card prior to that item being called. So as a note item 5.4 and item 5.7 have been tabled off the agenda for the time being. So we'll move on to the consent agenda. Thank you. Item 2. The consent agenda is for those items routine and nature and can be enacted by one motion. Do we have any speaker cards on this item? We do have one speaker and that's Ruth Sarnoff. Okay. And then are there any no? Well let's take the speaker first and then we'll move on. It's Ruth Sarnoff. There she is. Welcome. May I clarify? Hold on for just one second. So I would recommend that she since there is a shield there in front of her that she raises hers. Okay. Yeah we're just having a hard time hearing you. Okay. I will speak louder. I'm asking you to please put this consent agenda item in a kind of language that people can understand. And I would like a clarification of what this particular consent agenda item, what we're consenting to because it's not clear. And I've looked at the, at the, yes and it's just not clear. So could you clarify please for me and for everybody else? And I may or may not speak depending on what you're approving here. Okay. Thank you. So Mayor Coolidge. Go ahead. Let me just quickly address that. So on the consent agenda all items that are routine in nature are placed on there and there are staff reports that are available to view that describe each and every single item and that consent agenda can be enacted in one motion. And I didn't hear Ms. Sarnoff mention which one, which item she did. Did you have a particular question about a particular item there? I am questioning the lack of information on your agenda here. So actually. There's always places to go that people need some kind of context to know what an agenda item is about. Is it consenting to another laying in a bunch more concrete somewhere? Is it a consent agenda to allow for more, six more items? Is there a committee to set up? I don't know what it is. I have no idea. Sure. So the items are listed by their title and then a brief explanation is listed below and then there's more information online that details out the info, the, each item. As a general comment here on this, I would say that, that one of the things that also is never an opportunity to really speak on except in, in, in the general public comment. One thing that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that is welcome. It doesn't create a little safety block. So I will tell you, we have done that in the past. I think during COVID, it was, Madam Clerk, it was just police chaplains, correct? Because of the COVID restrictions and because police chaplains have to go through the process over at the PD, they were allowed to come in or asked to come in and they were gracious about that during COVID so that we would still have an invocation. We're getting ready to do a recruitment. We do a broad recruitment. We always have. We have a broad array of different religions represented in that process. So that is underway and since this is their first meeting that we've actually allowed people to come in or invited them to come in, that's just the beginning and so we're working on that. Alright. Thank you, Ms. Smith. So the answer to context for what the consent is on this consent agenda for two is there's no answer to that, right? Well, there is. We posted online as well as other definitions. Okay. Thank you. Alright. And again, if you want to put in a speaker card, we're going to be doing business from the floor next. So please put in a speaker card if you're interested in speaking on that item. Do we have any no votes or disqualifications by the council on the consent agenda? May I entertain a motion? Thank you. Second. A motion and a second. I believe it was Council Member Brown with a second. Madam Clerk, if you could take the roll. Let me get Vice Mayor Reynolds in there. Council Member Brown? Aye. Council Member Denley? Aye. Council Member Huber? Aye. Council Member Morgan? Yes. Council Member Tandon? Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds? Aye. Mayor Coolidge? Aye. Carries 7-0. Alright. Business from the floor. Members of the public may address the council at this time on any matter not already listed on the agenda with comments being limited to three minutes or as determined by the mayor based on the number of speakers. The council cannot take any action at this meeting on requests made under this section of the agenda. How many speakers do we have? Let's see. We have 18. What's our... limit for 18? Was it two or... 45 minutes is what we have for... Yeah, why don't we go two and a half? Oh, can't be two and a half. It's a little difficult. I mean, I actually... We had talked about 15 to 20 being two minutes. Okay. So two minutes. Two minutes. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. So our first speaker is Ruth Sarnoff followed by Sasha Sarnoff. And if when I call your name, if you could actually move towards the center aisle, that would be great as long as you can maintain a safe distance. I sent all of you a piece of... Ms. Sarnoff, if you could speak up. It's very hard to hear you. I'm sorry. Okay. I will speak louder. Thank you. All right. I sent all of you on the council and a number of other people as well information about the water crisis here in California and Chico, in the country, and frankly, globally. So I wanted to say to you today that the... Show your name, Show your name, Show your name, Show your name, Show your name, Show your name, Show your name, Show your name, Show your name, Show your name, Show your name, Show your name, Show your name, Show your name, Show your name, Show your name, Show your name, Show your name, Show your name, Show your name, Show your name, Show your name, Show your name, Show your name, Show your name, Show your name, Show your name, Show your name, Show your name, issues dealt with. I don't see any kind of direct help to homeless people in this area that's not mostly provided by volunteer help. So I will tell you there is, I have a list of all the people that are employees of the city and I can tell you they are all, almost all, are almost three figures if you figure benefits. And it's not an accident that it's that way. It's that way because we now have a privatized country. That is a! And it's really a privatized world because it starts all the way to the top where you have the IMF and World Bank. And you just have a few seconds left. And then it moves all the way through. And it is the privatization that is putting all the resources and the money and wealth Thank you. So, we have, we have, we have, we have, we have, we have, we have, we have, we have, we have, we have, we have, we have, we have, we have, we have, we have, we have, we have, we have, we have, we have, we have, we have, we have, we have, we have, we have, we have, we have, we have, we have, we have, we have, we have, we have, we have, we have, we have, we have, we have, we have, we have, we have, we have, we have, we have, we have, we have, we have, we have, we have, we have, we have, we have, we have, we have, we have, we have, we have, we have, we have, we have, we have, we have, we have, we have, we have, we have, we have, we have, we have, we have, we have just stand right in front, and then Mike's there. Where do you think everyone? From behind the mask, which I feel this whole thing is completely illegal. I'm here with my mom as her caregiver, and this, making me wear this to come into a meeting, we have no peer-reviewed signs for this. Nothing. Nothing. Where did this come from? If masks were relevant, we'd been wearing them years ago for every flu that happened. We haven't, and there's no new research about it. So I want to read something here. Per the science, respiratory virus transmission is an airborne affair, not via saliva or nor fecal. Viral particles are only moved as aerosols, that if one adopts the evidence of viral germ theory for infection, such as respiratory illness, are transmissible when viral particles are exhaled, inhaled in aerosol form. Aerosols are exponentially smaller than imagined filtration achieved by all non-sealed dust and N95 masks. Only hospital or industrial closed-breathing filtration technologies actually filter aerosols and thus viruses. Understand that any particulates in the viral, in the nanoparticle size, are not a virus. The science is well-founded and very clear. Propaganda, fear, porn by CDC and Fauci is equally clear and not based on science. The medical profession must always follow the science, not the propaganda. And so should the city, and so should the county, public health. This is a joke. This is propaganda. That's what these masks are. It needs to end. Thank you. You're welcome. So our next speaker is Donald Friedenberg, followed by Harrison Pratt. Hi, my name is Donald Friedenberg, or online, I'm known as Donald Robert Lee. I'm the founder of Chico Homeless United and the driving force behind the Chico Homeless Coalition, the unionizing, and the organizing movement here for the homeless. The agenda item I was going to speak on was apparently crossed off, so I'm just going to give you a little bit about myself. I'm born and raised in this town. I grew up here. My birth certificate says I'm in the hospital. When my grandmother passed away, I lost my job at 13 years, and I've been homeless ever since. Services have decreased in this town, and homelessness is pretty much being criminalized. We are not asking for a lot. We are asking for a place to be. The 70 at Comanche have pulled together as a community. I live at Comanche. I'm amongst those people every day. Today, I noticed the dumpster had been downsized. That won't reduce your trash problem. If anything, that will make it worse. Showers are still an issue for us, and that is because of the negative light that has been put on the homeless. I will admit there is a small percentage of us that don't care, and that will refuse housing, but the rest of us didn't. I can tell you right now, me personally, I was never approached by Torres or Task Force with the offer of shelter services through Torres. There are some serious issues that need to be resolved. In the last meeting, I spoke to safe organized spaces or camp downs, which you would call a sanctioned camp down. There's a project in Richmond that's been very successful, and I've been in contact with the guy who started that, Daniel. I think you can make it work here if you give us a chance. As the unhoused community, to show you what we can do when we pull together. And that's all. Thank you. Sorry about the time. Sorry about the time, yes. So Harrison Pratt, followed by John Cassidy. All right. Over the course of the last few months, since this current city council took seats of power in this town, I've personally gone out and witnessed a series of law enforcement actions that are a clear violation of the constitutional rights of the unhoused citizens of this town. And, you know, I take personal issue of this. I have struggled in this town to keep a roof over my and my disabled mother's head. And it's hard. The jobs in this town and the wages have not kept pace with housing prices as per city law. And I think that's the policy we've been gentrifying this town by only producing upper middle class housing. So our city government and the developers of this town have created this problem of homelessness because they price a lot of people out at the market. And your response to it has been to criminalize their existence and violate their rights. Now I've witnessed the Chico PD violating the rights of the unhoused. I've personally documented it. And now we have the ASA and the ACLU considering a lawsuit to go along with the lawsuit that legal services in Northern California have already filed. And so I think as we talk about solutions moving forward, first of all, the city councilors need to actually recognize that when you took a vow of office and took a vow to uphold the Constitution, that includes all citizens, including those that don't have housing. That's everybody. That's all of us. And then furthermore, I think as we move towards solutions, we should fire the city attorney, Vince Ewing, who gave you guys this poor legal advice that this would be a legal strategy because it was obviously flawed. And I would like to see some type of mechanism put in place for when y'all violate people's constitutional rights in this town because right now I don't see it. Thank you, Mr. President. So John Cassidy, followed by Rob Berry. Mayor Coolidge, Vice Mayor Casey Reynolds, Councilman Sean Morgan, and the other city council folks that I have never met. I'm the CEO for Sierra Central Credit Union. We've got 20 branches from Redding to South Lake Tahoe over to Roseville, California. And we have invested over $6 million in the Chico market over the last several years in our facilities. And I'm here tonight because one of our Sierra Central Credit Union team members, three weeks ago on a Wednesday morning at 8.30 a.m., was attacked by a repeat violent offender in our parking lot. I want to repeat, at 8.30 in the morning, this gentleman was highly strung out and has a long criminal past. Thank God one of our other team members drove into the parking lot at that time and was able to scare the attacker off. Otherwise, I probably would be talking about a dead Sierra Central employee. This is serious stuff we're dealing with here. I'm here tonight to applaud the majority of this council for trying to fix Chico. I've been coming to Chico since 1977 when I started college. It's an idyllic city, and it's about time things turn around. And what you're doing is you're on the right path. You can't have employees of businesses that invest in your community murdered in parking lots at 8.30 on Wednesday mornings. Last year, with the potential street violence that threatened Chico, we had to bear the brunt of it. We had to bear the cost of boarding up our windows of all our facilities. When we opened our new branch in January of 2020 out on East Avenue, kitty corner to Pleasant Valley High School, the second day we were open, we had a man walk in, stripped down naked, and sit at one of our desks, and he wouldn't leave. So there's more going on here than people are being told. There's some serious issues that you guys are dealing with. And I'm here tonight as CEO of a $1.3 billion institution that makes millions of dollars of home loans and consumer loans, and car loans in this community every year to support this economy. I can't have my employees killed when they're in the parking lot at 8.30 in the morning going to work in one of our facilities. Does that make sense? Thank you. Mr. Cass, can I ask a follow-up question? Absolutely. I'm over here. I'm assuming your employee is okay. He's doing better now. Did you hear from our police department? Your police department reacted swiftly, arrested this gentleman. That's why I know about his criminal past. It's extensive. He shouldn't be walking the streets of Chico. He certainly shouldn't be allowed to attack people at 8.30 in the morning. And, yeah, my employee, thank you for asking, is doing much better. But it was very, very touch and go. Thank you for speaking, sir. Okay. I'm going to leave my information with you guys, if I can do that. Okay? Thank you for your time. Keep up the good work. Okay. Our next speaker is Rob Berry, followed by Mary Kay Benson. Hello there. What a segue that is. So I'm here. I prepared to talk about the item 5.4, which has been pulled from the agenda, so I'm going to talk a little bit about it here. The very mention of homelessness entails a caution response, either homeless hater on one side or homeless enabler by others. There are those who believe in enforcing community standards equally for everyone. Others believe that some are already victims, and imposing community standards only increases their own. Some believe that the homeless should be made as comfortable as possible through charity, while others believe comfort is a state which must be earned. Those fighting for community standards, like the gentleman that just spoke, are also the ones fighting for a better life for the homeless. While advocates argue we should simply strive to make homelessness more comfortable, some believe the homeless are helpless victims, while others say they are mostly victims of themselves. Some believe disrespect for community standards is excusable, while others believe in equal treatment under the law. Here is a line from Robert Lupton's book, Toxic Charity. Because we are a compassionate people, we have been evaluating our charity by the rewards we receive through service, rather than the benefit received to those served. It is time that we re-evaluate our charitable enterprises through service. on the basis of how they contribute to or detract from our community standards. That is the only way both the community and the destitute can advance out of the state of suffering and onto a path of improving the quality of life for everyone, homeless and community alike. Thank you very much. Master Chief, before we go on, is that barrier there so people don't approach the podium from behind you? That is correct. So if the rest of the audience could realize would like you to walk down the center of the aisle, there's a barrier there. Thanks. Thank you. So it's Mary Kay Benson followed by Charles Withoon. Good evening, City Council. We stand on occupied, unceded Mechukta territory who had no homeless people. They also ought... are still trying to teach us and offer solutions that can build habitat from biodegradable materials. I also stand with our homeless humans and their proposed solutions to participate in and co-manage any overnight parking spaces, campgrounds, micro-shelters, and tiny houses as we must all now work together to get shelter. I am opening my heart and mind to absorb their experiential wisdom and insights. I hope you will all do the same. One way we can begin is to drop the preconceived ideological prejudices contained in pet phrases like, quote, service resistant, unquote. I have a homeless friend named Grace who has multiple serious medical conditions. She has a life threatening condition. I had to call an ambulance for her more than once. She was recently kicked out of the Torrey shelter for leaving her false teeth in a glass of water and not put into a sealed container. She cannot get back in now. She should be in skilled nursing facilities, but her insurance won't permit it. Other homeless friends are veterans from Vietnam to Iraq. They have PTSD and cannot stay in Torrey's or any congregate shelter. There were 21 beds open last night in the Torrey shelter. For those who can pass the high threshold of entry or higher for re-entry, 21 beds are not enough for the hundreds who are unsheltered here every night. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. So Charles with whom followed by, just a moment, followed by Robin. Good evening. Good evening. Thank you for this opportunity. I'm reminded of the NLO spokesperson who stood up in front of the news not too long ago and said that in that 12 month reporting period that she is referring to, that NLO saw 3,800 homeless visits. More than 10 a day. What happens some night when somebody you love needs that emergency room? It's raining cats and dogs. You get them in a car. You get down there. They're hoping to find an open door and a doctor. And what you find instead is the back of the heads of a dozen wet people. And if they don't get dry, hypothermia sets in and could be fatal in about three hours. This is a colossally ineffective use of very expensive emergency services. It has been proven that it's cheaper to take care of basic needs than to spend money on emergency services. Leaving somebody on the street can cost $30,000 to a city. Per person per year on up. And housing them can be $6,000 in a tiny home village. You ought to see the tiny home villages in Eugene. Not only do they have amazing tiny home villages, you know, they've got one in Marysville. They've got 14 little community safe spots that have between 1 to 18 little micro shelters. I would like the City Council to look at micro shelters and see if we can't have that be a reasonable place for people to get shelter. North State Shelter Team is in the middle of building two right now that are up to California emergency standards. Also, I would appreciate it if the City Council would look at North State Shelter Team's safe car park proposal that I have mailed to most of you. Thank you very much. Robin Engle followed by Larry Halstead. Thank you. Good evening. We've seen the repeated desecration of democracy under this Council's leadership. It's been over five years, I know some of you weren't on Council, but it's been over five years since we democratically voted with the vast majority to bring commercial cannabis to Chico, for one thing, and then we got a promise that it would be back on the agenda on April 20th. Which would have been the appropriate time. We need to see it back again on the agenda. That's just one small point I wanted to make. The little circus act about rescinding the shelter crisis resolution, which thankfully turned out to be non-democratic in the eyes of the law and many greater funding sources, was also this dismantling and dismissal of democracy. What's the word? We're demanding, I'm demanding on behalf of the community that we see that again on the agenda before that resolution becomes moot in June. And when I listened to a recording of Mayor Coolidge speaking to a group publicly about how he has five Council members, I am personally offended. Democracy is not represented. That was giving a big symbolic... I don't know. I don't know. Flip of a finger to Scott Huber and Alex Brown, but not only to them, but to the thousands of people in districts two and three. That was a serious violation of democracy. The worst of all is that hundreds or over a thousand of our community members are being left for dead or being encouraged because they have no other choice to supposedly leave town. And you won't even accept a trash bin, Mark Horn. You won't even accept a trash bin. You don't accept a donated trash bin at Comanche Creek. You'd rather have pictures in the media about people being trashed. Thank you. Missing. Thank you. Laurie Halstead, followed by Jessica Giannola. Good evening, Mayor, City Council, staff, and the public. Just a couple weeks ago, I celebrated one year of being a resident of this city. And when I came here, I was a resident of this city. And I came here in April a year ago. I came here as a political scientist, as an activist, as someone who's a credentialed member of the media, and studying the issues of homelessness already because I'm also a campfire survivor, and I was working on generating reports about this, specifically for the PG&E victims. But you cannot separate the PG&E victims' homelessness from the general homelessness. You cannot separate the PGE victims' homelessness from the general homelessness. You cannot separate the issue of homeless from police accountability and police abuse. And so what I've seen, and I saw it from the very beginning, and I've been calling it out on that. I spoke, you know, it's sad that I'm coming here six months later when you're finally opening it up and giving us our rights to redress the council again. But when I came here four times, the last time was on election night, and I brought up the issues of homelessness. I'm sorry. I don't want to talk about the fact that you were under a mandate by the governor to create solutions instead of fighting things like Simplicity Village, you know. And I also brought up the issue of the police accountability that had been developed under Riverside, the shooting of Tysha Miller. And I mentioned that you guys are in the dark ages about this. This is a war on homelessness, and I just want you to know that some of us have not been asleep. Some of us know what you guys have been doing. And I don't want to talk about the issues of homelessness. And you know, when the lawsuit got filed in the TRO, that's when things started happening. And so, you know, I believe that, like Martin Luther King said, you know, the moral universe is long, the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends in the direction of justice. And I think you guys are about ready to seize it. Thank you, Ms. Rauch. So Jessica Giannola, followed by Kevin Thompson. Hi, council. It's good to be back in here. I'm a member of the Council of Council of Councils. I wanted to commit the ad hoc committee for just the way it's going so far with the housing. I'm watching it and I'm seeing the connectedness and I appreciate it. I appreciate Councilman Tandon and Mayor Kilwich and Scott Huber. You guys are doing great with communicating with the people that you've had on your panels, the guest speakers. I like that you're having different ones because you are getting different. I'm glad that you're having different ones because you are getting different. And I think we're seeing a lot of different voices without the fear of being attacked. So there are real feelings are coming across whether they be informed or just how they feel. And so I think we're seeing opportunity where we can agree on a lot of areas and where we think as a community, we need to take our housing crisis steps in helping people identifying needs that the camps could have locations. I think locations should be multiple. I think it should be three. I think it should be shared throughout the districts so that we're not weighing heavy on one. I think because our issue right now is so intense that it won't be that way forever. It's that way now. And just that we should share that the districting and the spacing to get a handle on the emergency situation as we grow more housing opportunities. I think it's unfortunate that we did have litigation to bring us to this, but it is what it is. And at least there's conversations happening now. I would like to see more in the community happening, more accurate information so that people really understand what's going on. Like the unfortunate story earlier with Sierra Central, homeless people aren't criminals. That was the stance taken as thank you for taking care of the issue. Well, the issue is homelessness, not criminals. That's a separate issue, both important, but we can't combine the two and assume a homeless person is a criminal. And then I'm out of time, but thank you. Thank you. » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » » Hi, Mayor Coolidge, Vice Mayor Reynolds, and city council members. My name is Keisha Hills, and I am the senior administrator for a nonprofit called the Warville Southside Community Improvement Association. I know a long name, but we're better known for the Haven of Hope on Wheels project. So I just wanted to share a little bit of information about that, and I'll hand it over to Kevin Thompson, who is the founder of the nonprofit. So Haven of Hope on Wheels provides hygiene services in the form of showers and laundry through a custom mobile unit that is outfitted with three restrooms. We currently have two of these units, and one has an ADA restroom with a ramp for individuals who are confined by a wheelchair. So since 2019, we have been providing these services in various locations throughout the city of Warville, and most recently Paradise, Compow, and soon to be in Berry, Creek. We have a very simple intake process that not only allows us to gather pertinent information about our clients whom we serve, but it also allows us the opportunity to disarm and engage with individuals who would otherwise feel uncomfortable interacting with service providers and those who desire to help these particular populations served. And since we have begun our program, we have provided thousands of showers and have washed multiple loads of laundry. Also, during the PG&E shutoffs, we have made ourselves available to Butte County residents. So I know we don't have much time, but I'll let you have the floor. Just a second. So once again, we want to just thank you for giving us this opportunity, this warm space, just to share those services that we have available. And I had the pleasure of sitting on committees with Sean and a few more of the members. I'm just meeting you all. But what we're proposing is that you please consider just Comanche Creek if we could possibly offer our services. One day a week, a few hours a day. And health and safety is a big issue right now with the hepatitis breakout that we have in Butte County now. So we're going to ask that Haven of Hope come up in your conversations in the end of the season. So thank you once again. Thank you. Patrick Newman, followed by Diana Dress. This is the first time. I've had a chance to talk to this council. It's been seated here and I appreciate having a chance to speak with you as always. Some of you will remember me up here yammering away seven or eight years ago. Mr. Morgan, still awake. And some, for some, it's a new voice, I suppose, but you probably know where I'm coming from. At the root of this, we might as well just keep reminding ourselves that we have a housing deficit, according to Ed Mayer in our county, of about 4,000 to 6,000 affordable housing units that are missing. We have 500,000 people on our streets in America. It's roughly the number of affordable housing units that we're missing. So we have a kind of deprivation of housing. And because of that housing availability, this results in a certain kind of poverty. And that's what we call homelessness. And that kind of poverty is a very visible poverty. And because living without housing is so chaotic and so insane and so degrading and so hard on the physical and mental being of a person, we associate that kind of poverty with all kinds of things that we tend to demonize. We tend to conflate this together with criminality. And... Disgraceful. Disgust. The bottom line is we have failed to provide, and it took us 40 years to dig this hole, we have failed to provide the housing that we need for our people and the services to go with it. If we can't start with that premise, we can't be on the same planet with anything. Because we're starting with denial. When you deny that there's a shortage of housing, you go into blaming people. And that leads to all kinds of other things and all kinds of other responses. So two minutes is available. We have a very short amount of time, but that's it for tonight. Thank you. See you again. Diana Dress, followed by Alexander Smith. I have a seven-generation family history with Chico. I am the matriarch of five living generations as I speak. I take grave issue with the masking that needed my family members. I am personally exempt from wearing any kind of face covering. However, I've been relegated to the back of the bus to speak, which is further discrimination. Would you tell someone in a wheelchair you have no right in a public meeting because you are disabled? Your rules are unwarranted, unethical, and illegal. You are a false authority, and you are making a mockery out of science. We do not breathe our own waste, just like we don't consume our own excrement. Masking, especially children, is one of the most important things we need to do. It's criminal. It's actually creating brain damage in the hippocampus part of the brain, which can never be restored, even if you breathe full oxygen again. The effects are documented and can be fatal. However, we're deploying them anyway. Where is your medical license? You are practicing medicine without a license, which is against the law. Your rules do not supersede federal law. You cannot require me to restrict my oxygen as a condition of illness. You are not entitled to this meeting. This is attempted murder. Your requirement of me to undertake the medical intervention of restricting my oxygen is a violation of this state's law. Further, I have the right to refuse any medical treatment while still maintaining my right to services, privileges, goods, and facilities as protected by Federal Law 28 CFR 36.202. Social distancing? This otherwise known as social isolation is a human rights violation. It's on par with torturing other war crimes deployed against enemies of war due to successful psychological destruction. You are hereby notified that the state and federal laws make it a crime to deny the rights of an individual. You can be arrested for this crime and be held personally liable for criminal and civil damages, including … Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Our next speaker is Alexander Smith, followed by Leslie Johnson. Hello, City Council. Unlike the last speaker, I am not here to talk about the masks. I am here to talk about the issue of homelessness. I am a student here at Chico State Campus. I pay money. I pay $16,000 a year for an education that is supposed to get me a college degree. I also have many classmates who can say the very same. And those students, 43% of them are housing insecure. 43%, according to a 2019 study after the Camp Fire. Not only this, but 13% of them have experienced homelessness in the last year. I am asking you. No, I am begging you. To come up with a solution for this homelessness problem. Because there are students in the streets. There are students living in their cars. Who are asking to be at least housed while they are paying monumental fees to this university. And if these students, if you are not willing to house them, they are not going to pay your businesses. They are not going to pay the small businesses. That were worshipped at the beginning of this meeting. These are students who are the backbone of this economy. And I ask you to please deal with this problem in a humane way. Instead of kicking people off the streets. Kicking people out of where they are supposed to be. In order to have this idea of safety and security. That this town needs. But does not need through this horrible system that you have devised. I ask you this right now. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Blanck. Can you please keep applause to a minimum. We do not applaud after each individual speaker. Or make any noise thereof. Leslie Johnson followed by Damon Allen. Hi, I'm Leslie Johnson. Good evening. I'm here. On the issue of campgrounds. But not just campgrounds. But specifically one possible micro shelter kind of option that you might want to consider. And I wanted to tell you about Conestoga Huts. It's certainly not the only way. I won't say it's the best. But it's something that we've heard about recently. And thought was really neat. And a good possibility for being a step up from a tent. If we didn't want tents. But it's a quick. And cheap to do. So a Conestoga Huts shelter is. If you picture a covered wagon. Like from wagon train. And that sort of hoop design. But without the wheels, of course. And when I brought some. I brought some pictures of it. Maybe they can be handed out. Around. Just so you can see what I'm talking about. Because I don't have any projection or anything. But they're about 60 square feet. With a 20 square foot porch. Overall 6 by 14 feet. And 8 feet tall. The great thing about them is. They have a door that locks. So you step up onto this porch. And it's a very. It's small. But it's big enough to stand up in. Two people can sleep in it. It's about $2,500. And people can build them. And we just recently heard from a friend. A former Chicoan. Who's in Eugene right now. And sent us an email. And kind of inspired us to think about these. We have read about them before. But in Eugene. They have several community. They call them safe spot communities. And this organization. Chico. No not. What are they called? Community supported shelters. They have a bunch of volunteers. They build them in. In component parts. They throw them together. And they oversee these campgrounds. But they're not. You know. They're different kind of camping. So I just wanted to share that with you. Because it's interesting. And one option to consider. So that's it. Thank you. I hope you get to take a look at the other ones. I'll look at the copies of the pictures that I handed over. Thank you. We will pass those out. Damon Allen is our last speaker. Good afternoon. My name is Damon Allen. I would like to address the need for better roads. As well as bike lanes. This is considered a biking town. Yet very few roads are maneuverable. Even for cars. I have friends who have been hit. Because there's limited sanctioned space. For us to ride. As a college town. Not everyone has access to a car. So we should at least have access to safety. Build better roads. We definitely don't need roundabouts. Put that back towards the people. Keep this town alive and thriving. For the students. And if masks are so important. Why is there two people in here. Not wearing masks. On your team. Thank you. Again. If you could not applaud. We really appreciate that. Just in terms of the amount of people that are in here. Showing our concern. Showing our concern. Showing our concern. Showing our concern. Showing our concern. Showing our concern. Showing our concern. Showing our concern. Showing our concern. Showing our concern. Showing our concern. Showing our concern. Showing our concern. Showing our concern. Showing our concern. Showing our concern. Showing our concern. Showing our concern. Showing our concern. And again, if you're interested in speaking on this item, please fill out a speaker card at this time. Thank you. So good evening, Mayor Coolidge, Vice Mayor Reynolds, and members of the council. I'm Katherine Mathis, the accounting manager for the City of Chico. And tonight I'm introducing a resolution to update certain fees from the city fee schedule. After the agenda was posted, we noticed that two rates needed to be changed in the staff report. So I'm showing you my mistake highlighted in yellow. That's a visual aid. The fees in this visual aid are the same as those presented to the finance committee last week. The fees and charges of the city are reviewed and adjusted each year in accordance with city policies. This annual evaluation ensures all the fees and charges of the city are aligned with the cost to provide fee-related services, except for those fees which are legally limited, market-based, or subsidized by council decision. Our fee schedule has 1,053 fees. One hundred and seventy-eight of these fees are administrative fines or municipal code violations. They're meant to be punitive. They're not service-based. So those aren't adjusted any more. They're meant to be paid annually. Two hundred and forty-nine of the fees are reviewed for reasonableness by the city departments and adjusted, if needed, by a memo. Those requests are documented in Exhibit A. There are new fees that are being requested. There's a suspension, I believe, of one fee, a couple fee increases, and several fee decreases included on those memos. And then a summary of the requested changes has been included in Exhibit A, and it's been enlarged. So, hopefully, Mayor Kulich is more pleased with this one than the Finance Committee's version. Six hundred and twenty-six of the fees are increased with an inflator specified in the municipal code. This includes the development impact fees, which are studied and detailed and adjusted to actual every few years in the NEXUS study. In the intervening periods, the development impact fees and other city fees are increased by an inflation factor. This year, there were two inflation factors that increased. One was the construction cost index, which increased by 2.55 percent, and that's based on the engineering news record. And then the other index that increased is the CPI, which increased by 1.68 year to year. Other benchmarks used by the city did not increase this year, so those fees will remain the same throughout this next year. And then I'll reevaluate them at the end of next fiscal year to determine. Notice for public hearing of the development impact fees was published in the local newspaper two weekends ago, and those are included as Exhibit B. So the resolution includes both fee adjustments requested by the departments and the increases to the development impact fees. So I'm happy to answer any questions, and if you have specific questions about the department request, Brendan and Eric would probably be available for those. All right. Any questions from Council? All right. No? No? It's so easy to just look left and right. It's all over the place. All right. Madam Clerk, do we have any speaker comments? We do have one, if you would. And I didn't notate that, but if you could open the public hearing for that. Oh, yeah. Correct. And we have one speaker, which is Ruth Sarnoff. Okay. We will open the public hearing on this matter. Ms. Martin, if you want to come forward. Okay. Thank you. Show your name, please. Show your name, please. Show your name, please. Show your name, please. Show your name, please. Show your name, please. Show your name, please. Show your name, please. Show your name, please. Show your name, please. Show your name, please. Show your name, please. Show your name, please. to the people here to know what it's about and who is going to gain from this and who is going to lose. And I can't figure it all out, and I have been writing recently, so I don't research as much as I should. But I see more documents than most people do, and I don't understand what this is all about. We're all not used to looking at financial things. We're not used to looking at how do you stash or hide money. We're not used to all these different kinds of things. And it's time that you use plain language and just say, this is to help what? It's a consumer. Whose consumer are you talking about? And who's going to benefit? That's what needs to be in there. It's contextual. It helps people understand. This is what we're talking about. Shall we give them? I mean, we. We can all look at how much big CEOs get, and we can look at how the stock market goes up, and we know which way money is floating. And it's not to all the people. And I can tell you, having been on counting homeless, that the count is nothing compared to the actual size of the homelessness. People hide on the nights when homeless. And they're not going to be confronted. And I'll tell you, the census, there was no outreach. And you might think of something that's mobile, that goes out and is out where people can get registered to vote. And do all these things. Be part of the census. You want money? Okay. We'll have money. But let's just have some money that's spread around. And we'll lose a lot of money when people aren't counted. So why don't we start counting people, but why don't we count all of the people, including all the poor people, and black people, and brown people, and indigenous people who have taken care of the land for so long? Why is it that we can't get some straight talk? This is a time of extreme crisis for water. I can tell you that right now, Lake Amador, which is owned by PG&E, and PG&E is a franchise, and people here ought to teach and have a workshop on franchises. Thank you, Ms. Sinehoff. Global parent companies that they raise. So I would remind speakers that they need to speak and address the topic, which has been agendized. All right. So at this point, we'll close the public hearing. I entertain a motion from council. Move to approve. I have a motion from Vice Mayor Reynolds and a second from Council Member Denlay. A resolution of the City Council of the City of Chico amending the city's fee schedule, amendment number 344 fee schedules, 11.010, 21.010, 21.025, 21.035, 40.030, 50.010, 50.020, 50.300, 30.30, sorry, 50.040, 50.050, 50.6060, 60.020, 60.130, 90.10. Well, you know, I'm being official. I thought I'd go faster than that. All right. Madam Clerk, take the roll. Okay. Council Member Brown. Aye. Council Member Denlay. Aye. Council Member Huber. Yes. Council Member Morgan. Yes. Council Member Tandon. Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds. Aye. Mayor Coolidge. No. Okay. Carry 6-1. All right. Regular agenda. I have a presentation by Chico Bello. Sir John. I'm going to have to come up here some. Come on down. All right. Try to do this without my accent. It's coming up. Just need to close out the report. . . .! Showed you, he doesn't know he's going to touch my PowerPoint skills, too. Okay. Good evening, everybody. I'm John Pearson, the EG with Chico Vallow. Been there about 18 months, long enough to just kinda get my feet wet before COVID hit. So, it's been an interesting time. I'm here to talk about the Adopt-A-Path program, but, I'm going to give you a little bit, just brief, in case you're not familiar with who we are. Most people know Chico Vallow, because of the water, he's got water, he's got water, he's that we had, we had to cancel that for the first time in basically 40 years in 2020. And because of that, you know, five to 7,000 people didn't come into town for a weekend and kind of changed everything, not only for us as an organization, just as, you know, that was the only source of funding, but also gave us a lot of time to think about what we're doing, how we're doing it, and that there's a need to diversify. And so a lot of kind of what I walked into within Chico Velo, there were some different skeletons of programs and different things that kind of existed. One of them was the Adopt-a-Path program. So this working with the BikePED working group during those monthly meetings, as well as Green Dot Transportation Solutions, kind of put together what is in essence, a kind of like Adopt-a-Highway program, but for bike paths in Chico. So what we initially did is we took eight of the class one paths around Chico. Class one path is kind of like your Cadillac thoroughfare. It's, you know, you're going to take a bike and you're going to walk around the street. It's off the road, it's paved, it's, you know, not around cars. It's really what people, if you're commuting, but also if you're walking or anything else, you're probably going to go to those first. So what we decided, let's pick the great eight paths. Let's get some groups together that kind of around Chico anyway, you know, Sierra Nevada, Clean Canteen, kind of through their ethos, like doing this type of thing. And then Chico Velo were kind of the admin and administration side of this program. So we brought those groups together. We figured out, you know, sectioned everything off, who could adopt what, you know, who could own each of those and kind of built this program out. And we really did it during 2020 when there wasn't anything on our eventing side going on. But because of that, we had a lot of false starts. You know, you had stay at home orders and then opening up and then back and forth, and then we hit the winter season. So it didn't really happen last year. So we have launched this in 2020. And what we've been able to do is we've already had five different path clean days, including the city's spring clean day, we had different groups out on that day. And within this program, then people basically through us, they adopt that section and then they're in charge of it. So what we've kind of determined is at least every quarter, each group goes out, they bring in their own volunteer groups, they clean up the path, they work with us through the city to get the bags picked up and everything else. And it's pretty, I think popular just because a lot of people, you know, Chico's a pretty friendly bike town anyway. So a lot of people want to do that. They want to put things forward. Seen some really great stuff also with Chico State, trying to kind of re-own that path along the railroad tracks behind those fields over there. It's gotten a pretty bad representation and reputation of it. So they're trying to really bring some heart and soul back into those things. So with this comes a little notoriety. So depending on who sponsors that path, we've got some custom signs that go up with city information, as well as the organizational information. So you can see just like if you drive down the highway, who's adopted it, their logos out there. So I think it's a good partnership opportunity, both for the groups that have adopted it, but also then, you know, to increase the kind of this quality of life, as we're out there, as we're walking, as we're doing things to make sure that then it just looks, feels is a little bit nicer as we're doing it. One thing is yet to be seen. We don't know exactly how the cadence or everything's going to happen. I mean, Chico State obviously hasn't had all the total population of those students back. So we'll just see. And I think by the end of the year, we'll have a much better idea of how we can continue to kind of roll out this program. I miss any details on that. I don't think so. So I'm just going to give you a quick kind of rundown of some of the other programs that are going on. I'm going to give you a quick rundown of some of the other programs because they all kind of dovetail together. So one of this, so the adopt a path program is really kind of the urban bike path part of this kind of the sustainability, the wilderness part of this is our trail works program. So this has really been a really successful partnership, not only with the parks and rec department with the city, but also kind of growing our region outside of just kind of Chico proper. So we are probably the number one stewardship group that is doing trail maintenance and trail rehabilitation. And we're also doing a lot of the urban bike rehabilitation within upper bidwell. This has also led to, and I'll get to that at the end, a whole nother project that we're working on. But with this, now we're giving people opportunities, not only for hikers and bikers, but families and also all kinds of recreation. So as we do open up this region, we're kind of bringing this kind of facilities and, and draw for people to come in for tourism and different else, as well as, you know, just the locals. We have another, I think, pretty familiar program, the bike valet. Now that we're back at the farmer's market, a few other things, I think that's a really great feature. And then we've done a bike pump program for schools. So over the last two years, we put six pumps into local schools around Chico. We just got another grant this year. So we'll put an additional six pumps into local schools. So by the end of 2021, we'll have 12 pumps with an educational program to kind of keep people out of the cars, keep kids commuting on bikes. So I think a really nice way to, you know, we all saw people during COVID go to the bike, bicycle, cause it's physically distance, it's healthy, it's safe. If we can keep people doing that, it's great for the environment. It's great for our health. It's great for the community. So I think it's real positive thing that on that. And this is kind of what I just mentioned, but through our trail works program up outside of Butte Meadows, outside of Jonesville, we are building a project that builds 40 miles of mountain bike trails, equestrian trails, meadow restoration, wildflower education opportunities. So it's not just in kind of the city proper, we're trying to do it as much as we can on the outreach. And this project actually works with several different communities. So by the end of this, you'll be able to ride your bike literally from Chico all the way to Downeyville on, on trails and everything else. So it's really great way to open up this region, but also keep people on bikes and everything else. So ran through a lot, but you know, shifted gears a little bit from the last couple of things. So questions, comments? Great. All right. Thank you. All right. Do you, council have any questions or no? All right. Hey, thank you very much. We appreciate it. Appreciate all you guys do as well. Thanks very much. All right. With that, we're going to actually, I had a request for a 10 minute break, so we're going to take a quick, short 10 minute break, and we'll be back. All right. All right. Just waiting for a few council members, so we can get back in. If somebody wants to just grab that door for them, maybe. Yeah, that'd be great. Thanks, sir. Thanks,ysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysys I'm sorry, I didn't mean to get out of place. No worries. All right. So we'll move from recess. Item 5.2, consideration of the sale of successor agency-owned property to the city of Chico. And I believe we have Mr. Ottomoy. Yes. Good evening, Mayor, Vice Mayor, and city council members. Item 5.2 this evening. Good evening. You are functioning as the city council, but also as the successor agency to the former Chico Redevelopment Agency. So as you know, we received a grant last year to widen Bruce Road from Highway 32 to Skyway. We're in the design and right-of-way acquisitions phase. So the existing owned property there on Humboldt Road, at the corner of Humboldt Road and Bruce Road, requires acquisition of some of the right-of-way. In order to complete the improvements within the public right-of-way. So an appraisal was performed, and the fair market value for the right-of-way acquisition is presented here. With your approval as the successor agency, we have also coordinated with the Butte County Consolidated Oversight Board for that on May 27th. With that approval, then we would obtain the right-of-way, and the taxing entities would receive their portions of that. That revenue share from that acquisition. That completes my report. I'm available for any questions. All right. Questions from Ms. Sautterboney. Am I right? Thank you. Thank you very much. Madam Clerk, do we have any speakers on this item? Yes, one. Bruce Sarnoff. Ms. Sarnoff, if you could approach. Thank you. You know, the airport has been a source for a long time. And many, many people have spoken to it. It's not the wave of the future. First of all, if you don't believe me, in the salt water coming up in coastal counties around the world, everybody else in the world is knowing about it and talking about it. So if you want to not hear that, it's okay. But the history of that whole situation there, for a long time, I thought it was a little airport. Then I was on a shuttle one day that went the wrong way when I was at Peg Taylor. I was a patient because I have a heart implant. Anyway, so I realized that there's also a big manufacturing thing going on up there. And then I came back after the air was so bad in the summer of, I guess it was like summer of 20, that I was away from the summer. And when I came back, I learned all the things that had gone on during the summer. And I realized the military is very, very involved there. And we're five miles, we're literally five miles from where the crow flies to this downtown Chico here. I'm talking about the capital project up there. The Bruce Road construction is, excuse me, If you look at what's going on up there, over time, it is not a sustainable situation. And the use of the last water, everything in I sent you stuff today, you know that it's drying up up here. It's so dry that there's no water at all. It's like mud holes. If you want to ignore the fact that, you know, that tourism and selling a lot of cars up in Corning and using, where is it there? The place that all of the, it's always something that's a moneymaker. It's all about money. There's enough money. There's just not enough sharing of it. And it's incredible that we can't talk about things as a total issue. If I'm out of time, I'm out of time. I take it. Thank you, Ms. Sarnoff. We just try to have the speakers speak to the issue at hand and keep on that subject. So if you could do that for the next item, I know you have a speaker card submitted for everything, but if you could speak to those items particularly, that'd be the best. Thank you very much. Madam Clerk, how do you want us to do this? So act as the successor agency, act as the successor agency, and then move into the council action? Right, and we can ask our city attorney if it can be done in one motion, acting on behalf of both the successor agency and as the council, or if he would prefer an individual motion. It can be done in one motion. That's what it is. All right. We'll entertain a motion. Second. All right, we have a motion by Mr. Warren. Second. Second by Vice Mayor Reynolds. And that's a resolution of the successor agency to the former Chico Redevelopment Agency, as well as a resolution of the city council, the city of Chico, proving the sale of certain real property easements to the city of Chico for Bruce Road Reconstruction Project. And I will not read the APNs. Thank you. Yeah, it's not required by the Brown Act to read the resolution titles. That's what Mr. Sorenson used to tell me, so. Okay. All right, let's . Yeah. All right. Could you take the roll? Okay, Council Member Brown? Aye. Council Member Denley? Aye. Council Member Huber? Yes. Council Member Morgan? Yes. Council Member Tandon? Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds? Aye. Mayor Coolidge? Aye. And Mayor Coolidge, may I make just one comment? Please. And it's in regards to the public comment and the public input. So, the Brown Act, it's a resolution, The Brown Act is specific that the agenda has to contain the item, completely detailed information as to what that item is. And so we follow that here at the city of Chico, and we make sure that the annotations clearly indicate with staff reports. And by the need for any item to come up on, I guess that the Brown Act is specific that you're to address the matter that's before you. And that's why those annotations exist. So I just wanted to let you know, it's really to be in compliance with the Brown Act that the speakers speak to the item that's at hand. And under business from the floor, that is for anything that is not already listed on the agenda. So that's how it's spelled out in the Brown Act. Just wanted to help the Council. All right, thank you. All right, so, and if you are interested in speaking on item 5.3, please fill out a speaker card and get that to the clerk. Item 5.3, Community Benefits Agreement and Development Agreement Comparison. Mr. Ewing. Thank you, Mayor Coolidge, Honorable Vice Mayor Reynolds, and members of the Council. To all who are assembled here today, both in person and virtually, I'm Vincent Ewing, the city attorney. At the City Council meeting on March 2nd, the Council requested a legal comparison of a Community Benefits Agreement versus a Development Agreement for commercial cannabis. The report before you compares both types of agreements for commercial cannabis businesses. A Community Benefits Agreement is a legally binding contract between a city and a property owner or developer seeking a right to build or a conditional use permit to operate a business in the city. A Community Benefits Agreement is effective for the term of the use permit. A Community Benefits Agreement also requires the developer to provide specific benefits to the local community or neighborhood. In exchange for these benefits, the city agrees to support the proposed project. A Development Agreement is a contract negotiated between a project proponent and a city that governs land uses allowed in a particular project. The underlying allowable uses in a Development Agreement must be consistent with the city's zoning laws as well as the general and specific plans of Finney. A Development Agreement is commonly used in conjunction with other land use requirements, it's common to see a project proponent apply simultaneously for approval of a conditional use permit, zone change and a Development Agreement. Anyone with an interest in property may enter into a Development Agreement with the city for the development of a property. Development Agreements have three defining characteristics. They allow greater latitude than other methods of approval to advance local land use policies in sometimes new and creative ways. They allow public agencies greater flexibility in imposing conditions. They allow public agencies greater flexibility in imposing conditions and requirements on proposed projects. And they afford project proponents greater assurance that once approved, their projects can be built. You have the report before you. The Council will provide further direction to the city attorney or staff to conduct further research on any discussion, any item discussed here or receive and file this report. That concludes my report and of course I can answer questions. All right, questions from Council? Council Member Brown? You have a few questions. Thanks for the report. I'm just curious in your research of other experience with other communities what direction regulated industry is taking. It looks like community benefit agreements and funds are kind of that direction, but I wanted to get your sense of that. You know, I haven't done a survey of all the different communities, say let's say California for example. But so I would say anecdotally that the policy decision on the whether to enter into a DA or a CBA really depends on the policymakers for that particular community. So some communities enter into DAs and some enter into CBAs. As you can see in the report, the DA can have the features of a CBA as well. So it really just depends on the community and the policy direction of those who are on the day. Thank you. Yeah. I'm definitely a fan of the community benefit agreement. You know, it's legal. I think it would eat a lot less into staff time to move those things forward. But if we wanted to go in that direction, what would be the steps to incorporating it in our application process? In other words, what kind of additional research or steps would we need to do to get this going? So I would suggest that we get direction from Council for staff. That would be myself, the City Manager's Office, and the Community Development Department and Public Works to work on those on such an agreement. And of course, you would need, when you say you have an interest in moving forward, of course, you would need a project proponent, right? So that would be a starting point. So if there's someone who has an interest here and the Council has an interest in going that direction, I could bring back in working with the people that I've just mentioned how that could look. But without a project proponent, it's, I mean, you have the general outline before you now. Got it. How does the actual fee or fund portion of the agreement work to address some of the impacts that you listed in your report? I guess what I'm asking is how would we establish a fund and identify which program that fund would support? So for that, I would suggest getting back to you with the answer to that question, but I also would defer to... I would also like to ask my community development planning development colleagues across the well here who may have a handy answer to that question. And if not, we can certainly get back to you with an answer. Not to put you on the spot. Can you please repeat the question? I apologize. The question is, how would, if we were to go with the community benefit fee, or the community benefit agreement and fund direction, how would we do that? How would we, what would be the process to addressing the fund, or to developing the fund, and how would we establish any fees associated with it? What programs the fee would support, or the fund would support? Honestly, that's a pretty big question. I'm not personally familiar. I'm more familiar with development agreements, and so I would think we'd have to look into the area. I mean, I really don't have a clean, single, simple answer for that. Let me help. Yeah, please. Thank you. Sure, absolutely. One of the things that, as we've looked at this, the community benefit agreement seems to make more logical sense as it relates to this type of fee associated with this type of use. We would have our finance department create that fund, and whatever those designations are as to what community benefit is defined as, that the city council desires it to go to, then we would hold it in that account in order to put it towards those objectives. And so, similar to a development agreement, are these unique from applicant to applicant, or do we have some sort of baseline level? Yeah, what staff would likely recommend is that there's a baseline level, because if city council authorizes four permits, then all of them are on a level playing field, basically. So you're not giving an advantage to one over another, saying, hey, you're going to help with this issue, and you're going to help with that issue. We know that there's going to be a percentage that goes into this, and that whole percentage in its entirety, with however many permits are granted, then goes into whatever those community benefits are. That's very helpful. Thank you, Mr. Brown. Yeah, absolutely. All right, Mr. Morgan, you have something? So this is probably a combined question for the city attorney and maybe the city manager and the finance department. So in finance, we talked about the potential revenues and taxes and different communities that had taxed and kinds of taxes and all these things that went forward with the DOPE ordinances and things. So if we move forward with the – and thank you, by the way, for your opinion on the community benefit. That was helpful, right, because it's just like we could go on forever. So that was helpful. So as we move forward to get the applicant process starting again, I just want to make sure I understand. So it sounds like we need someone to come and give us a project so we can move forward with it because we don't have one. Right. But that doesn't mean the person applying for it necessarily ends up having their application approved. Right. That's correct. Okay. And then on top – so those two things have to happen in town. At the same time, with the community benefit agreement, we can move forward with a sales tax measure on cannabis. But here's my question. Do we need to? Would that be an additional tax or would the tax do away with the community benefit agreement or would the community benefit agreement stay in place until such a time that a sales tax was passed and if the sales tax wasn't passed, would still keep the community benefit agreement, right? Because if we're going to destroy the city with dope, I want to make sure at least we get the money for it. I can help there. And it's a good logical question. One of the things that as we looked at this, you know, you're looking at bringing the community back and doing a lot of things, a lot of initiatives that we've been looking at comprehensively. And I'm talking about organizationally. We were down in a situation where financially we were fundamentally broken. We're getting back there. I know that there's been dialogue with regard to potential tax. Now whether or not that proceeds, that's going to be ultimately up to council. We're coming back to the finance committee in May to talk about sales tax and other types of taxes of that nature. This last month we came back with the cannabis component, which you referred to. So just from, and we haven't had the comprehensive dialogue, but from a perspective of how do we make sure the community moves forward in the most logical fashion possible. If we did a community benefit agreement, as is being shown here today, that would stay in place until such a time that it's logical to put a cannabis tax on the ballot. If it's more logical to put a sales tax on prior, then you shouldn't put a cannabis tax, at least staff's recommendation, and a sales tax on the same ballot. So that's what I would recommend. So if you do put a community benefit agreement in place, that would stay in its course all the way through until such a time that a cannabis tax goes on. And then you can make a determination, well we don't need the community benefit agreement anymore, we've got this tax, assuming the community. So if we didn't put that tax on the ballot for two years or four years or eight, we still get the benefit? Correct. Thank you very much. So I have a follow-up question to that. So let's say that the cannabis tax actually went on the ballot, let's say in four or six or eight years and failed, but the community benefit agreement would still remain in place? Absolutely. Okay. And I have a follow-up question. And is it typical or is it possible that that fee, assuming that, or if by chance we don't pass a tax in the near future, could that community benefit agreement be adjusted, that fee be adjusted as needed in the future? That's a great question too. You know, one of the things that we've been doing, we've been talking with ourysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysys now, they have the ability to go and adjust it upward. And so at least the applicants know that the city council would like to see it somewhere in here, and then you make the determination as to where you want to be on that amount. So yeah, you can adjust it as necessary, as long as it's within that legal agreement and the applicant knows and acknowledges that that's the case. So go ahead, Ms. Roy. So what's interesting, when we talked about that in finance committee, I was wary of it because I'm just like, wow, the community or the cannabis shops, however it was, it's like they're going to agree to a range. Why would we do that? We've heard a couple times tonight from the audience, but oh, you know, after the money or this or that. So I actually followed up with your new management analyst, Angie Dilg. I said, why do they do that? And she said, part of it is the benefit to the city to make sure we're getting whatever it was we wanted. But the other part was, on the research that she did, if you go too high with the tax or the agreement, you push everything into the black market and you lose it all. And that's why, to Mr. Huber's point, it's important to be able to be able to move that lever just a little bit. So great, great question. I just want to explain to the audience why it's not about us trying to maximize, I mean, part of it is trying to maximize revenue, but also try not to push people out of something that's now designated legal so they go back to the black market and it's all for naught. Okay. I actually have another question along the same lines. So if the original agreement, I mean, if you did a benefit that said it's from 5% to 10%, but a future council could come along and say, change that to, you know, 3%. Could it not? Yeah, if you, I mean, you've got an agreement with these individuals, you'd have to go back into negotiations. And that's more of a legal question than I can, I would like to bear. But I'm assuming you would have to go in and amend those agreements for everybody. And that would be a negotiation. But I think Vince could better answer that. I mean, they can be amended by a future council, correct? They could, depending on the timing. So if the agreement is entered into by council action here, it's funny, I was just having a conversation about this off record, you know, based on the council's existing policy in order to bring something back for consideration. And a vote, you have a policy based, called a motion for reconsideration, which is based upon parliamentary procedure. So there's a period of time and there's also a criteria. You need to be on the majority side in order to do that. So let's say hypothetically to your question, you entered into an agreement today, there was an election tonight, and the council changed tomorrow. You couldn't change that action of the council within a period of a year. All right. I think that answers my question. So, Council Member Brown, go ahead. Just another quick question. My understanding is that these agreements, should the consequences outweigh the benefits of a certain business, could be changed, rescinded, et cetera. Is that kind of insurance in place? Typically, again, we're in speculation land because we don't have anything before us. But you're typically... If you're in a typical agreement, you're going to have a modification clause that allows the parties to modify the agreement or to adjust it as you see fit. Another typical clause is your jurisdiction, which laws apply, and so on and so forth. So it's very rare that you're going to have an agreement, particularly at this level, at a city council level, where you cannot modify it. However, I will stress that if you enter into an agreement based on council action, which you would need to, you are going to be restricted by that action. You can't just turn around the next day and change it. Of course. Yeah. And the other side knows that. Great. I feel like I have one more question I wanted answered. It's gone, but if it comes back, I'll let you know. All right. Any other questions? Mr. Huber? So I'm a little unclear as to what the process to move this forward is. You need an applicant to work with to be able to apply this, or how do we move it to the next step? My recommendation would be just to direct staff to do just that, to take the next step in terms of this analysis. I do know from looking at the record that there have been some other meetings and some analysis on this issue. Mr. Orme and Mr. Constantine presented to council some more in-depth analysis on taxes and numbers and comparisons of different communities. So my recommendation would be to direct staff to do just that. And my recommendation would be, if you don't want to report and file, is to provide direction to my office and to Mr. Orme's office to move this forward, if that's what you want to do. I guess we need public input before we do that. Say that again? I guess we need public input before we do that. Yes. Yes, we do. I remembered my question. All right. Council Member Brown. It's back. It's back. Mr. Orme, you mentioned the four businesses. I'm assuming you're referencing the retail dispensaries. Yeah. Would this community benefit fee fund agreement apply only to the storefront retail or all cannabis businesses, all types of operations? Good question. I'm familiar with them for the retail. I'm not as familiar with for, I'm assuming this would be the delivery services? Delivery, manufacturing, testing. Distribution. Yeah. All the approved uses. I think that there. It seems to make sense that it could encompass all of those. It could. So maybe if we give some direction on that, we can specify. That would be interesting. I think they're by right in the ordinance, those other ones. So there may be some minor modifications to our ordinance in order to make that happen. But we can have a look into that. Anything to add, Mr. Ewing? No. My answer would be similar to that. Okay. That is, those are the different uses. Or types, ways the businesses can operate. That's consistent with state law and also with where you may be going with this. And then, of course, you can define what you're going to allow in your community from this level. You don't, you're the deciders on what you're going to allow. Thank you. Yeah. All right. Any other questions? Madam Clerk, how many speakers on this? We have six. All right. All right. And our first speaker is... Bruce Sarnoff, followed by David Peterson. Ms. Sarnoff, do you have... So, on the cannabis issue, please. Yes. I assume a lot of this is to do with the taxation issue. And it is my understanding of taxes, that parcel taxes, sales taxes, certain types of taxes are what we call regressive taxes. They don't really help people that need to be helped in a community. It's a type of taxing. It seems to me like since most of the funding for what this city does is pre-funded, and there's no real... People doing work here except volunteers, you probably need to raise some money. But this is not really a way to do it. So, I also wonder about all the people that really would like to have really clean use of marijuana here for medical reasons and to be able to have organically grown and not for the sake of marijuana. So, there's a lot of profit to be made in it. But I'm not sure it really benefits people. And I would really like to know if there's a... I'm not sure if there's a summary of some of these things. If there isn't, maybe there's a summary page. And maybe there's some delineation of the important features in the agreement. Because I've had to do an awful lot of reading of classified ads, which are really how cities and everybody else today, here in Chico, is... It's like you're making sure what you're doing is legal by your standards, by your records. And it's that problem. Because it's unreal to think that a lot of people are going to research these issues if you want to do everything. If you want to do everything behind closed doors, you have the opportunity probably to do it for a while until the water crisis hits you in the butt. And then you'll know that you should have listened to everybody and not just those that agree with you. Thank you. David Peterson followed by Kelly. And I am not even going to say the name. Thank you. Thank you. Good evening, Council. It's good to see you in person. I appreciate the time to come out and talk to you. I had all kinds of stuff I wanted to talk about, but it sounds like you guys are headed in the right direction, so I'll keep it short. The benefit agreement is the way to go. Just vote on a benefit agreement fee. Some of the things I was concerned with, particularly just in the discussion that the city attorney kind of put out, is actually some of the questions that Council Member Brown had, regarding the additional opportunities for benefits. I just want to remind everybody that within the application guidelines that we were provided, we as applicants, it was specifically stated in there that you will provide a benefits and investment agreement or a plan within the application. So that's what kind of makes us competitive against each other. There's only four licenses, as we all know, and there's going to be 10, 20, who knows how many applicants. What makes it... What makes it beneficial for the applicant to be competitive are these options. It allows us to get creative and think about what the city needs most, get in tune with what's happening around our area, and tailor our benefits and investment plan that's required to fit the city. And if we start addressing all of these things specifically in an agreement, then you're kind of taking that away, from the applicant as far as like their ability to compete against the other applicants. It's going to be tough enough. I'm sure there's already going to be applicants that have additional percentages of gross sales receipts that are being donated back to good causes, the city, whatever they decide. But I think it's just important to remember that moving forward. What I would like to request is that somebody... Somebody make a motion to adopt the benefit fee agreement and kind of move forward with like a 2.5%-ish gross sales receipt back to the fund that you guys were talking about earlier. And then just keep in mind also, there was very specific verbiage inside the application guidelines to each applicant that we will acknowledge that there will be a tax or benefit agreement or some sort of fee structured at some point in time. So it's not like it's a surprise to us. We've already accepted that and we should be able to move forward, at least with the application process right now, simultaneous while developing the agreement, whichever you guys decide to go with. Excuse me, sir. I have a question for you. You spoke about the applicant retaining the ability to propose some of the community benefits as part of their... Right. ...proposal. Right. Can you give some examples of what you're talking about? I'm not quite sure what you mean. Well, not to give away what I'm doing. No, you don't have to give me your specific ones, but just some examples of what those look like. Right. So we could suggest or volunteer our time to be part of a cannabis committee within the city of Chico, which we don't have already. We could volunteer time to organize city cleanups. We could volunteer time to give back to the community in any sort of fashion. We can volunteer our own revenues in some percent to any type of service. So I'm trying to keep it vague. I'm actually your applicant, the only one that got one submitted. I'm sure you all know. You get my emails. Sorry. All right. Thank you. So Kelly is our next speaker, followed by Jessica. Thank you. And then we have Dr. Mackenzie. Hello, Council. Thank you and Mayor, everyone for attending in person. My name is Kelly Chisano. I am the director of a dispensary in Diamond Springs near Placerville, California. Me and my wife are the two only owners. We're small mom and pop, but we're one of the 10th bigger businesses in our surrounding area, competing with Home Depots and a car dealership. We have just worked with the city of Placerville and gone through there. They're about two years ahead of you guys. So I would really recommend reaching out to Cleve Morris at city of Placerville. We've done two years of this and exact same questions, exact same things. So I won't go into details. But the city of Placerville ended up landing on was a community benefit agreement and a DA because they wanted to be able to do some certain zoning stuff, keeping certain zones out, which is getting to different departments. But that's more the way it is. And then they did do the land use part of it. Then they did do the CBF. So they created a fund where we all will be paying a baseline percentage so that one applicant isn't getting charged with one bigger problem or bigger percentage, per se, to an applicant. They all kind of are on that same level. But then the city decided on a percentage. And then each applicant is going to be a part of a committee so that we're all able to work with the city finance so we can get our specific projects or community benefit. Sounds like homeless shelter, help, whatever, community service, getting to those people, obviously, is an issue here. I love the Adopt-A-Path. And we do Adopt-A-Highway. We do Boys and Girls Club. This is just our other shop that doesn't require a community benefit program. This is things that we've done because we know we opened in 2011 and we knew that we needed to be a good player in the community because it was, you know, it wasn't state mandated everywhere. And we were working under a gray area of, and we're a small community and we're very, it's a very conservative community. And we went in very medical, very professional. And our cater to 60 plus is our crowd. So we're not dealing to the kids that are trying to get high for 20 bucks and get out of there. We're dealing to people that have medical needs and want to talk to somebody. Like the gentleman before, I don't want to go into details about specific community benefits, but fixing roads, fixing paths, park benches, parking lots, parks, these are all cadet programs. These are all things that I heard. So then we all get the little play in it. Like he said, we get to feel like we offer up things to it and we were involved with it. Yeah, we work with local food banks, sponsor terminally ill patients, and have tried to be a member of our community. We've moved that we needed to be because they didn't have the laws and the council behind us. And my doors are always open. My phone is always open for anybody, questions or comments. A tour if you guys would like, and cards, I don't know if I can leave those. Thank you. I have a quick follow up question for you if that's okay. Yeah. Can you tell me if what you've heard us talking about here today is between that 2.5%, 5%, whatever. Is that similar to what is happening for you guys in the community? I mean, I think it's a public knowledge. I don't need to hide it either. They did vote for a tax. What they did is they did the vote for the tax before they did even an application process. Because they said if the people don't want it, we're not going to push something through that the voters don't want because they don't want to even pay tax on it or they don't want to hear, you know, because it's only the cannabis participants, purchasers that are paying the tax. No community member, if you're not purchasing cannabis, is not affected by the tax. So then as they, you know, we tried to make it clear to them that we're going to make it really simple so that it was very understandable and there wasn't a bunch of other cannabis things on the ballot to be like, oh, vote for the cannabis thing. And there's three cannabis things. So now which one is, my friend told me vote for the cannabis thing. But the, so they did that and they, they're in the, the community benefit is it, it's at, I think it's at 2%. And then they also have a 4% tax. So they voted in a 4% tax. The city voted that in and then they, their community benefit equals 2% of gross. Revenue. So then we can put it, that would be at the end of the year, we have to have donated to the fund up to, you know, it's hard the first year because we're still just building it out. We don't have doors to do a first year, but at the end of the first year, we're supposed to put the next year square up to, and they've got it all written, you know, they've got all the details and you guys have all the control. You can make it a sliding scale is exactly what they did as well. They did from 1% to 15%. They're like, oh, we're going to do it. We're like, hey, it's never going to go, you know, eight's really going to kill it. So like you're talking, but then it just gives for whatever reason, if you feel like you're not getting enough money because the dope's killing your city, then you know, you can fund it or, you know, whatever. Like it's. Great. Thank you. I appreciate that. Thank you guys for your time. So Jessica McKenzie followed by Curtis Bartle. Good evening folks. Nice to be back in council chambers again. Okay. So a couple of things about community benefit agreements. Most commonly across California, what most moderate sized communities have done is one of two things. They do a community benefit agreement that says, hey, y'all to get your license, you got to donate 4% to a nonprofit every year. That leaves the decision up to the applicants and the licensees to where that community benefit money goes. The other one is, you know, the one which we're talking about more, more of the conversation seems to be about, which I prefer is one where you put the money in a bucket and there's a governing body that gets determined to decide for the city where those aggregate funds go. That kind of makes sure that let's just say all of us cannabis folks really loved Kiwi farming. And we said, we all want to spend our two and a half percent, 3%, 4% on Kiwi projects, as opposed to a body that says, here's what the community needs. That really is a community benefit as opposed to benefiting the choice of every applicant separately. So I would strongly recommend that you put together something that puts all the money in one bucket and that it's uniform across all the entities. Another thing, since oftentimes community benefit fees sunset upon the passage of a tax, it seems realistic then that that should cover all retail, not just storefront retail, but delivery retail as well, because both of those would or should likely be affected by a tax on sales. So I don't think it should be the four or however many, it ultimately ends up being just the storefront dispensaries. I do think that it would behoove us to move on both items simultaneously, both items being let's commit to the development of a community benefit agreement, a process, whatever that's like. I encourage you to look at what the City of Hayward did. They did a really excellent job. And also open up the applications. I had heard from someone that there was some concern that somebody might be ready to get a license and we hadn't finished doing the community benefit fee agreement yet. Not likely to happen since the window is 45, 45 days and then after the 45 days is over, now you start evaluating and reading and ranking and going through that process. That's weeks, maybe months. It's unlikely that you would get to the point of needing to issue a license before the community benefit fee came into being, but you could always postpone if you needed to. In any case, I'm just happy that this is where we are now. It's been a really long haul. I'd really like to see you guys get the, let's see, quick. Ooh. I don't know how many jobs and how much money you could bring in, but I'm going to quit. Thank you all. Thank you. Curtis Bortle followed by Katie Maple. No offense, but for point of record, it's Curtis Bortle. It's with an O, not an A. So just for record, so you guys can have the, you know, your documents straight on your minutes and whatnot. Anyways, Curtis Bortle, great to hear all the discussion that has been occurring today. It certainly seems very productive and it definitely, I get the impression that everybody has really taken the time to attend. I'm just looking forward to the next attempt to understand and grapple with this issue as we move forward. I know plenty of people would have liked to see this come to bear a little sooner than now, but you know, better late than ever, I always say. I think Council Member Brown brought up a couple of really great points or questions in terms of the merits between a DA and a CBA. I assume everybody is smarter than I am, and so everybody knows the difference between uses that are allowed by right and allowed by permit, et cetera. And being as that CBAs are uses that are included in uses that are allowed by permit, you already have, you know, in your ordinance, the uses that are allowed by permit for cannabis. So it's kind of already included, already a part of what you already have existing. And I don't think it would take too much additional leg work for the city manager and the city legal attorney to kind of put together something that's very well thought out that fits into your existing, you know, ordinance that you approved back in September, October timeframe. And so with that, I would also like to echo, you know, some of the previous speakers' comments that, you know, I do think that this is something you can do in tandem with resuming the application process. After attending several of these council member meetings, you know, I'm convinced that you guys' staff is very well equipped to handle a wide range of dynamic issues and that this is kind of, this is like really low hanging fruit for them. So with that, you know, my take would be to encourage the, to resume the application process. While working on this, you know, CBA. And I think all the applicants will be very happy to hear both of those things and more than happy to work with the city to negotiate or agree to the CBA that, you know, has the potential to stay or terminate at the approval of a tax. So thank you guys very much. Have a good evening. Thank you. So Katie, Katie Maple is our last speaker. All right. Hello. Good evening, Mayor, members of the council. My name is Katie Maple. And I'm the vice president of government affairs and compliance for Perfect Union. We're a fully unionized cannabis company based in Sacramento. We started our first dispensary there about 10 years ago. And now we operate retail shops in 11 jurisdictions throughout the state. And the reason why I'm here is just to share some information. I've been participating in this process for about two years now and been following how it's going. We currently have development agreements and community benefit agreements in different jurisdictions. We have DAs in Turlock and Riverbank, which are both in the Central Valley. And we have a lot of other organizations in the area. We have a community benefits agreement in Morro Bay. The rest of the jurisdictions, we do have taxes that were placed on the ballot. So it just totally depends. And based on my experience, I think that there's jurisdictions tend to actually prefer the development agreements and the community benefit agreements because they allow flexibility, not only for you guys, but for us as well. So we can go into a negotiation process with everyone and say, hey, this is what we're thinking of doing in terms of community benefits. This is what we're thinking in terms of our gross receipts tax. Is that something that we want to do? And one example that I have is right now I'm currently in the process of renegotiating our renewals up in Riverbank, and we're negotiating our community benefit agreement there because they set the rate very, very high. We were having some trouble making ends meet in terms of the retail shop, and now we're doing something lower, and it benefits them as well because we're also helping out with some nonprofits there. So I think it just adds some flexibility because it's not all about money. We do have a position in our company. Her only job is to work with different nonprofits, do the big check presentations, do community cleanup days, work with the community. So there's a lot of different ways to do that. We go to neighborhood association meetings. We just make sure that we're involved. And so I think that bringing cannabis in the community doesn't have to be a scary thing. It can be a really good thing, and we've seen this happen all over. Like I said, we've been in Sacramento for 10 years. We have an incredible relationship there with the city. And actually, my favorite one is Marysville, a small town, about 10,000 people. We opened up our dispensary there almost two years ago. They did not want cannabis there at all. The police chief was completely against it. Everybody was against it. They did their zoning in such a way that the only location we had was the neighborhood. We could go within the dump. And so we actually worked with them over the course of a year to change that. And now we have such a great relationship with them that the police chief calls me almost every other day. Hey, can you send me the video footage from this car that drove by or something else? So I think there's a lot of opportunity to do good. I would also say that there's a lot of folks that have been waiting to participate in the process. So we've currently been paying on our building for about a year and a half now. And we're just really looking forward to participating in the process. And I know we're not alone. So I'm really glad that you guys are having this discussion. We look forward to really working with you. Thank you so much. Thank you. All right. Council discussion or questions? I'd like to make a motion. Okay. I move to direct staff to come back to council with whatever is needed to implement a Community Benefit Agreement and fee for direct revenue from cannabis businesses operating in the city of Chico. I'm assuming that includes the retail dispensaries and deliveries. and that we reopen the 45-day application period for cannabis businesses as we work to incorporate that process. It sounds like we're already talking about a sales tax elsewhere, which is going to come back, and so I would have included that, but it sounds like that process is already gone. I will second that motion. Okay, we have a motion on seconding discussion. I actually have a question, if I may. So, Mr. Ewing, how often do both of these things actually correlate and take place? Can you do both? So just making sure we're crystal clear, that question has nothing to do with the motion? No. Okay. Just making sure we're clear, since we're on the record. Yes. Okay. Could you ask the question again? Yeah, so how often, in your knowledge, are both the community benefits agreement and development agreement done simultaneously? My knowledge is anecdotal. I'm aware that they're done together, and I'm aware that you have a combination, a community benefits agreement, a DA, and several other features to the request of the applicant or the project proponent. So, again, that's anecdotal. I haven't done a survey. Sure. Yeah. All right. Thank you. So, no further discussion. Madam Clerk, can you take the roll? Council Member Brown? Aye. Council Member Denley? Aye. Council Member Huber? Yes. Council Member Morgan? No. Council Member Tandon? No. Vice Mayor Reynolds? No. Mayor Coolidge? No. It fails 3-4. I'll make a new motion. I make a motion that we would reopen the application process on June 1st, that we remove manufacturing, distribution, and testing operations from consideration, at this time. I get the move that we crawl before we run. Reduce the number of retail sites from four to three, and consider tying a points awarding system to the community benefits and investment part. So, there's 400 points available. So, for instance, you could do 40 points would be awarded for each 1% of grocery seats up to the next year. So, that would be up to the 5% of grocery seats to that applicant. So, those willing to pay a little bit more would get a little more preparation in that particular part of their application. So, that would be my motion. May I ask where this recommendation is coming from, just so I can get a better understanding of the logic there? So, the logic is I would like it to go back to finance if needed, and to give our city attorney time to be sure that they're getting the money. So, I would like to make sure that we're ready to go for the June 1st. We have a lot of things going on right now, specifically a court date coming up in two weeks that are pretty important. So, I'd like to make sure we have everything ready on that. The manufacturing distribution and testing, again, I'd like to crawl before we run. I know that people are very, very interested in having dispensaries, and I've seen, I agree that we've been kicking this down the road for a long time, and I think we need to move forward with that part. I'm not as familiar with the other areas, so I'd like to weigh in. And I think we have a lot of things going on right now. And I think three dispensaries for a city of our size at this time is more than enough at this point. And in the application process, there's benefit points given, or preference points or whatever given, for what they are doing in their application. So, for those that are willing to agree to donate more or pay more, they should get more points on their application consideration. »» Thanks,ysys. »» Thanks,ysys. »» Thanks,ysys. »» Thanksysys. »» Thanksysys. »» Thanksysys. or do you mean don't talk about how to get fees out of the other stuff at the moment? I think when we move forward with the others that there should be fees on all of them. I think it should be across the board. I think that's pretty much the feeling that I've gotten from Moves. Okay. But I would like to get our dispensaries up and going. And I'm not saying never on the manufacturing, distribution, and testing, ever. But can we get this one part taken care of first, get our dispensaries going, and then... Okay, so then my follow-up question to that is for Mr. Ewing. Can we bifurcate those things? So if I hear the Vice Mayor correctly, she's wanting to get the dispensaries moved forward with the people that have applied for those things. Well, only one person's applied, but the people that are paying rent and doing all these things, assuming they're going to get it. And can we put trying to figure out what to do with the community benefit agreement? With the manufacturing and distribution and all that stuff aside. I mean, is it possible to do it that way, or are we creating more work? It's possible, but I also have a follow-up request of the council and Vice Mayor Reynolds. And that is that you move to direct staff to prepare a discussion and action item for a future meeting versus making a motion to take action at this meeting. Because the work that you described in your motion... ...needs to be done. So I would ask that you respectfully make a motion to direct staff, that is me, City Manager Orm, and staff to prepare a discussion action item on the things that you want at a future meeting versus taking action on the motion as you described it. I believe that sounds perfect, but can we just make it a date certain of the first meeting in June? Yeah. Yeah, I mean, yeah, just again, I just, we're looking, I'm looking, I'm respectfully looking for direction to prepare a discussion and action item at the June 1st meeting. So I would amend my motion to be to a direct staff to do what I had mentioned earlier to prepare to bring back at the June 1st meeting. Okay. And then just for the purpose of clarification, and I'm going to lean on my esteemed colleague here, Clark Presson. Did you get all of that motion? I actually believe I do. And I did want to... I would clarify that it would be taking the retail sites from four down to three. Correct. Can I ask a point of clarification? Did you say that deliveries would be on the list of things that we would continue moving forward with? Non-retail, just delivery. Yes. So, that was a great question. Hold on, Mr. Morgan. Yes, sorry. Mr. Huber, go ahead. So, Vice Mayor Reynolds, I'm looking for a way to be able to support your motion. I could be in agreement with just about everything if you were to, number one, specify that we weren't permanently taking off those other manufacturing, etc., etc., etc., off of the list. And then, if there was a motion to move those off the table, but they would still be... It would just be delayed, the rollout of those, number one. And number two, if you would stick with four rather than three dispensaries. But everything else I can live with. So, I'd make an amendment to your motion that essentially stated those two things. That we made clear that the other items were not permanently off the table, and that it amended it back up to four dispensaries. And then I could support it. So, before you accept or deny Council Member Huber's friendly amendment, there's a follow-up question to Council Member Brown. If you left it at three, we're putting everything else on the side, retail, manufacturing, whatever, like inventing new strains of marijuana. That's what you meant? Or no? I'm talking to... And here's the reason I ask. Okay. Okay. I understand. If we don't have a specified ordinance allowing for distribution, companies outside of Chico, by state law, can deliver in our town. Is that correct? I'll take your word for it. I think staff might have an answer for you specifically. Distribution is part of the supply chain. Manufacturing is part of the supply chain. So, anything coming in, the dispensaries that we're allowing to operate and deliveries, would have to go through manufacturing and distribution. So, you're looking at them going to an outside community for those products and us having no benefit in the form of jobs, revenue, et cetera. Okay. Is that what you're asking? No, but I appreciate what you said. What I'm asking is this. Vice Mayor Reynolds. So, to move forward with the community benefit agreement, direct staff to look forward to coming up to that to do three dispensaries. And as Mr. Huber asked, we're going to put everything else... on the back burner, not forever, but just until we can get there. My question on that one, were you leaving retail delivery as part of that or not? And the reason I ask that is because if retail delivery is left off of us moving forward immediately, all we're doing is letting outside communities do it anyway. So, if I understand, I think you left that out. My friendly amendment would be everything that you said, but include retail delivery by the three. People that may get the licenses anyway, because that's coming in right now anyway. All right. And I apologize. I did not specify that. I'm just seeking clarification. With that license. So, I thought that they would already be doing that. So, I didn't believe I needed to say. So, yes, delivery would be included. Thank you. And to Mr. Second the motion. Okay. And to Mr. Huber's amendment. I agreed and stated earlier that everything is not off the table for future, but I would like to stick to my three for right now. All right. Well, then Mr. Huber's amendment will not be in it. So, further discussion? Madam Clerk, you take the roll. Okay. The motion by Vice Mayor Reynolds is seconded by Council Member Morgan. By Council Member Morgan. Yes. Council Member Brown. I'm going to vote yes. Yes, but I have just a quick comment I want to make on it. I don't agree that this is walking before we're running. I think we've been crawling for years and years. Other communities have blasted ahead of us in terms of how to do this right. So, I don't agree with that assertion that we were rushing into anything. I want to see this move forward. I'm glad that there's some desire to take some steps. And so, I am going to vote yes on it. Okay. Council Member Denley. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. aye. aye. aye. aye. that. Item 5.5, overview of Airport Commission Climate Action Commission Architectural Review and Historic Preservation Board. Thank you, Mayor and Council. At your meeting of March 9th, you directed my office to conduct an additional 30-day recruitment for the Airport Commission Architectural Review Historic Preservation Board, as well as the Climate Action Commission, because we had we didn't have a large number of applicants to choose from. So that was conducted. In addition, you also asked staff to bring back an overview of the roles and responsibilities of the three mentioned advisory bodies. So before getting into the overviews of the roles and responsibilities, I'd like to, first of all, update you on that recruitment. So we did run additional ads substantial ads, and we received in four applications, with only three being actually valid. So, actually, I was just informed that the fourth one did come in. In order to qualify to be considered, they have to be a registered voter residing in the city of Chico, and 18 years or older. So, we do have four, with one additional advertising, which is, you know, advertising advertising, advertising for the Airport Commission to actually three additional applicants for the Climate Action Commission. So what I want to go over very very quickly is just to remind you as it's been some time since we've gone over this information. For the Airport Commission we have that as a five-member board and there were two positions that needed to be filled. So we at this time have four applicants for two positions. Larry Waugh had applied, it was his second choice, but he was appointed to the Planning Commission, so that leaves you with four to choose from on the Airport Commission. And in regards to the ARHPB Board, we have five members on that Board, three positions need to be filled, and with Lindsey Pullen being appointed to the Planning Commission, that leaves you with, let's see, two, two, four, five, five applicants for three positions. And please note, we didn't receive any additional applications for ARHPB. There is criteria that's associated with that board, so that is a board that is a little harder to recruit for. The Climate Action Commission has seven members. We needed five positions to be filled. Four of them were the four-year positions. One of them was a two-year remaining term. And so for that, we have nine applicants for five positions. So I just wanted to kind of give you that broad overview of that recruitment process. You know, I don't know. This was the most difficult time. I've spent more money for this biennial recruitment for 2020 than I have probably ever in my 21 years here. I don't know if it was COVID-related and just, you know, the situation that we were facing. As a community and everything, I just, we didn't get a lot of applications in. It took a long time. So I'd like to just provide a quick synopsis of each of the boards and commissions and talking about estimated cost, and then I'm going to turn it over to the department head who actually supports and provides, you know, all of the staff, the staff reports and everything for each board and commission. So you have the airport commission. It's comprised of five members. As I mentioned, there's five members. And according to the Chico Municipal Code, it meets on a quarterly basis with an average of an hour and a half to two-hour meeting. Special meetings have been held in the past. However, they weren't in, I didn't include special meetings in the cost analysis. So cost estimates for the quarterly meetings, which includes staff time for preparation of staff reports, agendas, minutes, attendance at meetings, videotaping of meetings, and live broadcast on Channel 11. And other associated costs for the meetings are approximately, you know, $6,000 each year. And that's just for four meetings. Costs can go up substantially depending on staff resources needed to research, potential commission requests or directives, and then to prepare the staff reports or possible presentations. So at this time, I'd like to ask Eric if he would like to address the council and provide you with just a quick overview of what that commission does for him. Thank you, Clark Preston. And, Council, thank you for the opportunity to speak to you tonight. My staff and I support the Airport Commission. They meet on a quarterly basis. As Clark Preston advised, it's consisted of five members with four-year terms. Some of the typical agenda items are, you know, some land use items, a lot of lease-related items on airport property for both aeronautical and non-aeronautical uses. Airport Commission has authority to approve leases 15 years or less. And note that does take up quite the majority of Airport Commission agendas. There's over 85 hangar spaces alone on the southern end of the airport property. Items concerning the FBO, the fixed space operator and filling operations, FAA regulations and requirements, managing our Part 139 requirements for commercial air service, ultimately something we hope to ramp up here pretty quickly, is our commercial air service pursuit. Any sort of airport-related agreements, airport-related economic development, they approve. They report on to Council as a recommendation the Airport Capital Improvement Plan, the ACIP, that's required to be submitted on an annual basis by the FAA. They confirm the City Manager's recommendation of the Airport Manager. And kind of, like I said, the majority of what I kind of surveyed, some of the last two years' worth of staff reports, it was very, very heavy surrounding lease approvals and lease reassignments. And one of the heavy lifts that they just completed, took a couple years' worth of work, was updating the airport lease policy. And the really objective of that is to sustain the airport fund fiscally long term. So they do quite a bit of work, make recommendations to the City Council, and take some of that public interaction and multiple discussions on several items off the Council's plate. And my staff and I enjoy supporting the Airport Commission. Okay. All right, so on to ARHPB. Again, it's comprised of five members, and it meets up to two times a month when needed. It's estimated that on an average, this body may meet like 15 times a year. Cost estimates for 15 meetings a year are at about $22,000. But that number could go up if more meetings were needed. In addition, should additional staff time be needed for staff reports, costs could be higher. This estimate covers the time for four staff meetings. Staff members and associated costs of the facility. And please note that these meetings are not televised nor recorded, so it did lower the cost for this board. However, there are costs that I did not include and didn't get because this is an approval board of some part of the planning process. And so there's notices that have to be published. There's advertising costs as well as postage to notify. There's 300, sometimes a 500-foot radius of everyone needing to be notified. So those numbers were not included in this. They also have mileage that's charged to deliver the agenda packets to the board members. That part, the mileage, I don't know what that might be, and that wasn't included in this report. So I would ask that Brendan Veague, Community Development Director of Planning and Housing, to provide the council with a quick update on. Thank you, Debbie, and good evening, Mayor Coolidge, Vice Mayor Reynolds and council. Sorry I'm a little hidden here in the bottom corner. So I want to quickly address that cost associated with that. It's not general fund. That's generated fees as it relates to application fees. So just a little overview I wanted to share. Design review boards like the City's Architects Review and Historic Preservation Board are quite common for cities the size of Chico, and especially for communities that really value a quality built environment. The board's review process provides a critical understanding and provides a critical venue for project assessment, as well as, this is important, public involvement. And again, the focus is on all major new commercial and multi-family residential projects. As provided by the city's code, the board has significant latitude in determining whether a project adequately meets adopted city standards as well as design guidelines based on a series of findings. The key things are the project's character, scale, quality design consistent with the city's design guidelines and development standards, and also is the architectural design of the proposed structures, including all the elevations, materials and colors, visually compatible with surrounding development. So this is kind of the rub about the Architects Review Board. This is a very subjective process, and that lends itself, in my position, I believe, to a body of appointed citizens to discuss those key design features. Again, I want to emphasize that community engagement takes place at a noticed public hearing, which is critical. It's critical to an open and transparent city process. So the board ultimately considers a staff recommendation at a public hearing. So I want to again highlight that often there is applicant resistance to meet city standards. Not all the time, but sometimes. There's also the need to address what can sometimes be very intense community pressure regarding a new development proposal. And a good example for me is the Esplanade and Greenfield project, which was recently before you as part of an appeal. And again, I believe these matters are best adjudicated by a council-appointed panel of five volunteer citizens. Again, I have heard suggestions that the board could serve as an appeal board for staff decisions, and that is reasonable, of course, but my experience tells me that it's best to get those appeals to council as quickly as possible, because that's the process. They're going to appeal to one board. They're ultimately not going to stop appealing, whether it's the applicant or a resident, until it gets to the council. And I want to highlight sometimes that's not where it ends either. It can often end in litigation. So to address similar concerns, that I've heard recently about, several years ago, about applying standard application fees to smaller projects, staff did go through a very involved process to develop new categories and fees, including staff-level minor and major reviews for things like existing building remodels, downtown façade updates, subsequent phases of a development, something that would look similar to what was already approved, and other minor design efforts. So I want to highlight, that we're always open and looking for ways to push decision-making down to the lowest reasonable level, to save time and money, and again, not only for the applicant, but to properly utilize very stretched staff resources. I'm always open to feedback and suggestions for improving the city's entitlement process. So again, I'm looking forward to hearing anything you might have to say. I do believe, ultimately, though, the key to a successful site design and architectural review process is first choosing effective board members, and ultimately that's your responsibility. This is the middle of a complete mitigation process, and I think it's important to recognize that the board is responsible for the implementation of the project, and that's the board's role and function. And then, providing training and dedicated oversight and consistent guidance, and that's my responsibility. I currently think we have those pieces in place, and I don't believe there's any need for major changes to the board's role and function. Just some quick statistics. Again, once a project is deemed complete, an application is deemed complete, we get them to the board within two to three weeks. In 2019, as Debbie alluded to, there were 15 meetings, there were 20 projects, 21 projects brought forward, and there were 21 approvals. In 2020, there were 12 meetings, there were 19 projects brought forward, and again, 19 projects were approved. I'm available for any questions. All right, let's hold off questions. Do we have climate action? We do. Then we'll take questions. Okay, so the Climate Action Commission, as I mentioned, is comprised of seven members meeting once a month. Cost estimates for this body are around $17,000 a year for the 12 meetings, which covers staff time for preparation of staff reports, agendas, minutes, and attendance at meetings. Facility and television, televising costs have also been included in that number, and Director Veague will also, he will provide an overview of the Climate Action Commission. It's a newer commission. That was recently approved by Council. And again, thanks, Debbie, for the setup. It's also, it is paid for through more general fund. It's not applicant fee driven. So I just want to highlight that through the city's general plan, the city has in fact prioritized climate action, adaptation, and resiliency. And so in order to support those efforts, in 2019, the Council established a new standing commission. That's the Climate Action Commission. After having an ad hoc sustainability task force, that functioned in one form or another for the previous 12 years. So it's not a new concept having a board or a commission that's focused on sustainability or greenhouse gas emission issues. Again, the commission does meet once a month as opposed to bimonthly. The primary functions of the commission are to prepare and recommend for adoption a comprehensive long-term climate action plan, or CAP, is a quick acronym, to monitor and measure the successful implementation of the CAP and evaluate reductions of green energy and greenhouse gas emissions, and also to advise the city council on how to accelerate Chico's progress towards achieving the CAP's goals, including through community awareness, education, and participation in the city's programs. The majority of the commission's efforts over the past 15 months has been focused on development of the climate action plan update, including reviewing greenhouse gas emission forecasts, strategizing on thoughtful virtual outreach, and receiving updates on the outreach that we've done, developing draft measures for incorporation into a CAP update, identifying funding strategies for CAP implementation, quantifying draft measures to ensure Chico can meet its goals, consistent with state goals, and also reviewing draft CAP chapters. The commission has also been involved in the development of strategies for mitigating anticipated local impacts of climate change into the city's general plan, which is a requirement of state law. Their involvement in that effort will likely increase over the next year. They've also met with several city departments, and other agencies like the Butte County Association of Governments, to discuss both underway and future efforts consistent with their charge. Two weeks ago, the commission hosted a community workshop on the quickly evolving topic of building electrification, which is also a proposed measure in the draft CAP update. Once the CAP is ultimately adopted by council, there will be significant work to implement the plan and coordinate with other agencies and partners, and I believe the Climate Action Commission is the appropriate body to vet those efforts. I'm available for any questions. All right. I believe Vice Mayor Reynolds has a question. I just had a quick question. I'm not sure if this is something that's even possible or ever been thought of. Would there be a chance of combining Planning Commission and AHRPB, since it seems like that's one that we have a hard time filling? Would that save any money and or time, headache, energy? I'm aware of models where the Planning Commission can help with that. One thing, Chief, is that, you know, with ourysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysys architecture, engineering, design. But that would be something that could be done, the combination of those roles. So then maybe to follow that up, would we ever allow somebody to serve on two commissions, that they could be on the Planning Commission, and maybe if their qualifications qualified, they'd be on the AHRPB, and that might be a Miss Preston or City Attorney. Well, I will state that one of the Planning Commissioners is always selected as the alternate in case we do not have a quorum for the ARHPB. So definitely they do a little bit of crossover. I would probably... Our charter and the code does not specify that they can serve on more than one, but it doesn't say that they can't. So I would have to ask our City Attorney to weigh in on that, if he would be so kind. Sure. Thank you, Claire Preston. Those are the... Vice Mayor Renner, those are the documents that I would look to also. And then, again, anecdotally, there are smaller communities where you just don't have a lot of people. So you have people on the Planning Commission who are architects, and they're looked to serve on the architectural review boards for those communities. But I would also, to Claire Preston's point, I would look to the governing documents to give you... to give you a definitive answer. I just want to add... I agree with everything they said. The way they meet is quite different. The Planning Commission serves similar to you. They look at things like subdivisions, use permits. That site design architecture review, it's very hands-on. The meetings are in the afternoon. There's a lot of engagement with the applicant's architect or engineer. They look at colors. They look at fenestration, articulation, a whole vocabulary. And, you know, it's... It's a different kind of format than the Commission. They kind of get hands-on. Great. Thank you. All right. Any questions to my right? Okay. I actually have a question. I think it's for Debbie. So how do we advertise for the Commissions? Is it just newspaper? Yes. And we do send out press releases as well, but it's mainly been ads. And I think they're... Like, is it a quarter page or a... I mean, and we run them a series of days. I know that's dictated by the law. Right. And so we run them, you know, we hit different days. Sure. And we just... We hit it through the... But it runs in the print edition, correct? Correct. Yeah. And it doesn't run on the online editions? I think it does go through the online. Oh, okay. Absolutely. Oh, that's good news. Okay. I was going to say. That's what I just wanted to make sure that... No, because so much is online anyway, but that is part of it. I wanted to make sure about that. The second thing is, can we have somebody... You said somebody who's on the Planning Commission is also interested in the Airport Commission. I believe it's my commissioner. But can they serve on two commissions? Do we have any rule or... Well, I think that what the city attorney just said, we would have to go and look at the governing documents, Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. And then the municipal code specifically for those. I think that you have to evaluate that. I know that we've had conversations in the past about, you know, like for the Airport Commission, if you have a person that has an interest or a conflict of interest in terms of a business or a hangar or a business, does that person, can that person serve, you know, on the Airport Commission when they're making decisions that could impact them? So, you know,ysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysys and I would like direction if you would like for me to bring you the applications that I do have I can bring those back at the next meeting and you can make your appointments I think that we've had some very very devoted plan you know commissioners on the various boards that continue to serve even though their time is up and they will continue to serve until the council makes those choices but it is you know I'm sure that if you want if you would prefer to wait to hear from the city attorney as to whether or not they can serve on more than one board what would the criteria be what would that look like what kind of process would that be then we would probably delay but I think that's what we're looking at right now and I think that's what we're looking at right now making those appointments until you could hear back from from from staff on that so it's up to whatever whatever the council wants to direct us to do I would move that we bring it back at the next meeting and then I don't think it would hurt to have that information brought back to us we may or may not use it but at least we can have the question answered so if we run low on a recruitment at some point in the future at least we know the answer to that but I would say bring back the applications that we do have at our next meeting okay and I forgot and I apologize when I'm making a presentation it's hard to remember I'm supposed to be the city clerk and we do have one speaker so and that would be no that was me I so Ruth Sarnoff all right this is on the airport commission climate action commissioner architectural review yeah I think I know that one I think it's 830 8 and I've read it and I know all about it commissions traditionally were the oversight for what other people might be doing now it is a way of guaranteeing and rubber stamping and paying and and some paying people to do what you know you know I would like to serve on that commission can I plan can I make the application because I know a lot about what's going on up there okay I know that the military is up there that the military has been there for a long time I know that you function with a with a document that's over a hundred years old I know that the history of hazardous waste sites here in California in reuse I have seen and I have studied all those documents that some of the documents show where all the military bases are in California most of them are dirty sites because they are not used to the the right now right now right now right now right now right now right now right now right now right now right now right now right now right now right now right now right now right now right now right now right now right now right now right now right now right now right now right now It was at the airport that they trained two groups of people that were naval for the carriers, you know, the small planes. They had training. They had instructors, and two of them crashed, and everybody died. And I have the articles about it, and I'll show you. And that story was buried. And lots of other stories are buried. And if you don't read Associated Press, and if you don't follow what's in the classified, you don't know what's happening. There's just a lot of ways that people cover their tracks. And I refuse to not speak up. And that there's been a long history of people opposing the airport and what it means. It's a very difficult situation. It's a very difficult situation. Thank you. Thank you. And as a note, too, I would say that our commissioners are not paid. All right. Council Member Reynolds, do you want to remake your motion there? I'll remake my motion that we bring back at the next meeting, the applications that we do have for consideration. And then for staff to look at future... And for staff to let us know for future what is legal and what our charter says. and what we can do in the future. All set. Madam Clerk, can you take the roll? Council Member Brown? Aye. Council Member Denley? Aye. Council Member Huber? Yes. Council Member Morgan? Yes. Council Member Tandon? Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds? Aye. Mayor Coolidge? Aye. Carries 7-0. All right. And with that, we're going to take a short break. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. All right. Item 5.6. Discussion on alternative uses for CDBG-CB1 funding. City Manager Mark Arm. Sure. This item was asked for from Council Member Denley, so I'll pass it over to her. All right. So back to the original intent, is just to basically find out more about what the possible uses are for CDBG-CB1 funding. That way, you know, we can make the best decisions of whatever casts the widest net of benefit. And so I would be interested to hear more. This report is a lot. So I don't know if Ms. Demers is available to kind of give a brief summary here. Sure. Marie, would you be so kind? Thank you. Sure. Good evening, Mayor. Vice Mayor, Council Members. So the CDBG community block grant, as you can see from that memo, there's a wide range of eligible options. It essentially follows the normal CDBG, but the CV funds have to be used to address COVID, any kind of related issues around COVID. There can't be a duplication of benefit. So if there's funding from another source, then the CV funds can't cover it. So it's got to be basically a gap, a gap in funding. These funds are federal funds. They come with a lot of regulation. I was very brief in the memo because it's all the volumes of information. So I tried to outline just kind of some basic eligible activities, what we have done so far with the city's approval, and then I think we've approved already. As I outlined in there, we had looked at the Carmichael site for a navigation center, the townhouse motel that fell through. We since have been working with CHAT, basically to kind of backfill maybe some of those beds so that there would be, they're looking at six houses that could house 22 people, which are definitely, could be COVID related. So that's a good thing. There are many other, we're also looking at rental assistance possibilities, although the state has come in. We're trying to analyze that. We've been reaching out to property managers. The city is invested in numerous multifamily projects. So it's probably in our best interest to maintain that asset. So that's another possibility. Like I said, the state has stepped in and done some rental, they're doing a rental assistance program, but there may be some gaps. There's also, there's also possibility for backfilling things like utility payments, because if people don't have their utilities on, they can be at some point when the eviction moratorium is lifted, then they could be evicted for not having utilities on. There's numerous other things, other public services, assistances to businesses. That one is, that one is very tricky. We've had a really hard time. We've tried a couple things here just with our allocation. It's very labor intensive and there's a lot of tracking. You have to track everybody that's hired for years. So what we've found to be beneficial is to support the small business development center so that they can assist people and give them, you know, technical support, training, workshops, all kinds of things like that, help them write business plans, that kind of thing. That's been pretty successful. What else? I mean, they have, you know, we could construct a facility. I don't think that's really realistic with the amount of money we have or the time, but those are all eligible activities. All right. Any questions? I have a question. When do, what's the timeline for making the first steps of decisions for these funds? To not lose them? What's the timeline look like? So the clock is ticking. Early on back in May, I believe it was, of 2020, that was that first allocation that you see on the first page of the memo. We do need to move by probably sometime in July because August, by August we have to submit the plan to HUD, the amended plan. Yeah. All right. Any further questions? Mr. Huber? Yes. Thank you, Ms. Demers. What's the standard process or protocol for attracting proposals or what's the process about how we go about determining or knowing which things we may want to choose from? So obviously initially it was, hey, we got to get this, we knew that a lot of our organizations that we already provided funding for were suffering and needed to get funds right away. So we just basically made the proposal. We reached out to them. We made the proposal. And then we brought it to council. In a normal, I mean, often it's at the staff level kind of looking at different what's feasible. Because that's the biggest thing is, yes, we have this whole menu. But what's really feasible within the timeframe that we have. And where are the gaps that we're seeing in the game. community. So, you know, an ideal world it would be you put out an RFP or, you know, yeah, a NOFA, basically, to solicit proposals. We're in a little bit of a crunch. But, I mean, if you have ideas, we can certainly, you know, look at those, pursue them, see if they're feasible, see if they're eligible. So, would it not be outside of normal procedures for counselors to propose things to you? Would it have to come from the council? Could it come from individual counselors if we wanted to have you consider things? Sure. Absolutely. Either way. Yeah. Okay. Thanks. All right. Council member. I'd like to check on if this fund is going to any business support agencies. I know you mentioned that rather support some agencies will help the businesses. I'm sorry. I didn't hear that. Some part of the fund could be used for helping small businesses. I know you recommended to provide it to some agencies who could help the small businesses. Could you name a few that we could use? Yeah. So, what I mentioned was a small business development center. That's through Butte College. So, what they do is they offer all kinds of workshops, one-on-one assistance with small businesses, and they need to be lower income, you know, business owners. That's who they would help. If we were to go to some kind of an individualized business program, we would have to come up with a complete policy and procedure. Okay. Thank you. And then in that instance, then we would put it out to, you know, basically offer the funds up and have people apply for it. So, what I understand is that you'll fund their operations? How would they, so they cannot help the individuals with the funds? Individual business owners? No. They provide technical assistance, basically. Okay. Yeah. So, no financial assistance for the businesses? No. It's not like it's not a business. Although they're suffering from the COVID and it is for the community benefit. But there is nothing we have for them, right? We don't have a program like that right now. Some larger jurisdictions have ongoing business programs to assist small businesses. We don't have that. Okay. I would like to see something like that. Just Aaron Rogers. Just wanted to check in and verify. Thank you. Yeah. Mr. Mayor? Yes. So, one of the things, and I think that Ms. Demers referred to it earlier, is on the CDBG in particular, those funds, very stringy. A lot of strings attached. And a lot of businesses would rather stay away from those funds because there's so much reporting requirements and everything else. Staff is looking at potential options as it relates to business help and support in the relief funds that are coming forward that were passed by Congress. And so, just know that's coming as well. So, I just want to make sure and remind you of that one, too. So, for whatever that's worth. Thank you for verifying that. You bet. I have a further question. Council Member Denley? I just had one quick one just on that topic of Ms. Tandon. Have we reached out to the Chamber of Commerce at all to partner and see if they have any leads on small businesses? I know they've been working closely with the businesses since COVID on relief. Have we tapped them at all on this topic? They actually engaged us early on. But basically, we would have to come up with a program. And that was the piece that was challenging. All right. Council Member Brown? I feel like early on, the previous council allocated money to the, oh my gosh, I'm losing it, three core for small business, for loans. Is that accurate? And could you overview that? They weren't loans. They were grants, like little mini seed grants. I tell you that that was very challenging and difficult. And we have not continued that. That makes sense. And I think also what you may be recalling, I see it going on in there, is that there was a, another option that city staff was going to back loans up for the more riskier loans because of COVID. That program fell through. It never came to fruition for a number of reasons. But council authorized doing it if it could work, and it just never ended up working out. Okay. Thanks for the update. Yeah. Vice Mayor Reynolds? I was just going to say I would like to hear more about the possibility of doing the emergency utility type fund. If we could get some more information back on that. And when you said July, all applications need to be submitted by July or funds need to be expended by July? So it actually is August, but I would want to bring it in July so that we can get in. But funds expended or just the plan brought back as to what? The plan. Okay. Yeah, 80% of our total allocation has to be spent by June of 2023. Okay. And then the full amount by June of 2026. But it can be spent quicker than that too. Oh, sure. Okay. And can I, given the situation that we're in right now, can any of this be used towards any type of a sheltering, resting area, camping, any of that? Any of those type of? So it could be used for services provided. So like case management or even, I mean, it could be, if it's a COVID-related situation, you know, it could be supplies. And definitely any of the oversight, you know, basically it would be a public service. So it could be qualified to that. All right. I had a question sort of along the same lines, maybe for the city manager. Or maybe Marie. But along the same lines as Vice Mayor Reynolds' question, given the situation that we don't know what's going to shake out with the lawsuit, would there be any wisdom in setting aside for as long as we can? I know we don't have much time to set anything aside, but setting aside for the possibility that we may have to use it in part of what we need to do to resolve that situation. Yeah, as Ms. Demers alluded to, as long as we have a plan back approved and submitted to HUD by August, we're good. Looking at the agenda or the calendar, typically we go dark the second meeting in July, if that's Council's desire. If it's not, then we'll be here on the second meeting in July. So if you're really looking at bringing something back in July, it would be that first meeting in July with a plan. And so I believe that over the next month, particularly the first meeting in July, we'll be able to do that. And so I think that next week or so, we're going to have a good idea as to what potentially that could be used for. And so obviously a lot of those conversations will be taking place outside of this meeting, but absolutely that's an option. All right. Do we have any speakers on this side? Yes. We had Ruth Sarnoff, but I think she has gone for the evening. Leslie Johnson. Hello again. I wanted to come back and kind of update and check in with the Council because the Council had approved 182,000, that grant that was discussed previously, for CHAT to secure the townhouse motel. And that turned out to be a moving target. We could not settle on any sort of a lease. So we're going to have to do that. And then we're going to have to do a little bit of a planning and planning process with them or a purchase. We were kind of trying for both. So as an alternative approach, we developed a plan, a project for essentially extending a program that we've been doing for almost two years, which is to bring unhoused families into housing and work with them over a course of up to two years, it was in this previous, based on this previous grant cycle, to try to help them get into stable, secure, permanent housing. Because our feeling is that families with children, they're going to have to be able to get into stable, secure, permanent housing. And children are one of the most vulnerable populations in terms of the negative impact of homelessness on those people. We don't want homelessness to become a generational thing, to be continuing. So we don't want children to be in that situation. And we have looked on the coordinated entry program. There are still a lot of families with children that are homeless. It's hard to maintain good sanitation, good health practices. A lot of times homeless families are either doubled up with other families, temporarily, or they're in situations where they can't really maintain good health practices. So we would really like to at least get the families that are in homelessness into housing. So this, that is how we would use the funds. We did submit that plan, developed in consultation with Ms. Demmer's office. We've been able already to help with this HUSH program, is what we've called it, to help about 18 families. And by the end of this grant cycle, which ends in September, which is next month, almost all of those people have transitioned to permanent housing. Which might not sound like a lot, but it's actually really challenging to bring people out of homelessness and get them established in a situation where they're not going to return to homelessness. It takes a lot of intensive case management, because they have to get an established income stream, get some good tenant trainings. And so that's what we've been working on. And we do have a budget and plan. We would be able to get probably 8 to 10 families that we could work with and get into housing. Hopefully some would come in and then some would, you know, move on and then we'd be able to bring in more. So we would like, we would try to get about at least 6 to 8 houses. And hopefully there'd be some turnover. So that would be how we'd use the funds. That's our, that's our offer and our proposal. And I know you've probably seen it, but I wanted to just sort of highlight that and bring it, bring it for you. Thank you. Leslie, I think it was briefly summarized in the staff report what your proposal is with these, but not, not extensively to my knowledge. Would these folks that you would be providing housing for be directly come from the street and then into housing, from shelter environments into housing? What would that kind of look like? We would probably use a coordinated entry list, which ranks people according to their, the vulnerability and the type of housing they're in. And then, you know, the necessity for getting them housing more quickly. So that's what that HMIS system is able to do for us. And we would take people from that list. So they could be in a variety of different situations. Some, if there are people that are outside in the street, you know, in tents and stuff, we would, they would definitely go to the top of the list. That's just really bad, you know, really unhealthy situation. Kids have trauma that can be, you know, lifelong. It impacts their, them psychologically. Thanks, Dr. Schiff. You know, actually, I may have missed a communication, but if you could forward that proposal, I'd appreciate the opportunity to look at it. I don't think I've actually seen it. Oh, sure. I will do that. Should I send it to everybody? I think that's probably a good idea. Yeah. Or you can send it to the city clerk and she can distribute it out. Okay, I'll do that. Thank you. Anything else? All right. Thank you. Thank you. Madam Clerk, any more speakers? Okay. This time I'd actually make a motion that we, at least at our next meeting, review all aspects that the money can be used for in regards to our homeless population or housing or anything along those lines that falls into that particular category, so we can have that to review at least at the next council meeting. That be inclusive of the proposal from CHAT? Certainly that could be inclusive of the proposal from CHAT. I'm definitely more interested in what the funding can actually go to and the specifics behind it, including all 800,000 of it. I would have a friendly amendment to your motion, and would you be willing to second it? Fire away. If we could include hearing about emergency utility assistance programs as well. Sure. I'd second that. All right. We have a motion and a second. Further discussion? Madam Clerk? Okay. Can I just say something? Yes. Council Member Brown? Aye. Council Member Denling? Aye. Council Member Huber? Yes. Council Member Morgan? Yes. Council Member Tandon? Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds? Aye. Mayor Coolidge? Aye. Carries 7-0. Thank you. Thank you, Ms. Demers. All right. I lost my place. Here we go. 5.8. We did table 5.6. 7. So we did table 5.7 as well. So 5.8 confirmation. All right. And we'll move on to the next item, which is the City Clerk Employment Agreement and Job Description. Mr. Ewing.

This is professional municipal clerks week, and so I just want to congratulate her and her team of professionals and just say that we're glad that we do have an honest and professional city clerk, and so I just want to congratulate her on a job well done for so many years for this city, and I hope she continues to do so for many years to come, so it's great to be a compatriot of hers. So with that, that's all I've got. Thank you. Thank you. All right, monthly financial report and budget monitoring reports are for informational only. Council member requests pursuant to AP and P10, AP and P1010. Council members may verbally request an item be agendized at a future meeting after stating what the item would be. A majority vote of the council is needed in order for staff to agendize. Council members may also submit requests in writing. Vice President Reynolds. I just have one quick request that I would like to get on a future meeting, and I will follow this up by email, but we are upcoming on districting, and we're going to need to be able to putting out an RFP for a company to run us through that, so I'd like to get on our, if not next, for sure the next one after that conversation. All right, I'll second that if it's a motion. Well. Yeah. Do you want to make that a motion as well? That is a motion. All right. To bring it back. Okay. We have a motion and a second. Council member Brown. Aye. Council member Denley. Aye. Council member Huber. No. Council member Morgan. Aye. Council member Tandon. Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds. Aye. And Mayor Coolidge. Aye. Carry 7-0. All right. All right. All right. I also have a request. So I'd like to have a discussion, and staff could bring this back at the next meeting. That would be excellent, but it has to be two meetings, I understand. A discussion about the Community Travel Bank for the Municipal Airport for acquiring flight service. And I'll make that a motion. Yeah, so to have a discussion about the Community Travel Bank for the Municipal Airport. So we've already received DOT funds of $500, half a million dollars to assist in acquiring flight service. So, with that, with that, with that, with that, with that, with that, with that, with that, with that, with that, with that, with that, with that, with that, with that, with that, with that, with that, with that, with that, with that, with that, with that, with that, with that, with that, with that, with that, with that, with that, with that, with that, with that, with that, with that, with that, with that, with that, with that, with that, with that, with that, with that, with that, with that, with that, with that, with that, with that, with that, with that, with that, with that, with that, with that, with that, with that, with that, with that, with that, with that, with that, with that, with that, with that, with that, with that, with that, with that, with that, with that, with that, with that, Madam Clerk. Okay. Council Member Brown? Sure. Council Member Denley? Aye. Council Member Huber? Yes. Council Member Morgan? Aye. Council Member Tandon? Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds? Aye. Mayor Coolidge? Aye. Carries 7-0. All right. Thank you. We're going to adjourn and close sessions. And as I get noted, for the record, there were no speakers. And were there any council disqualifications? My apologies. Do we have any speakers on this? No. No. Okay. And any council member disqualifications? No. Sorry. Now I'll turn in to close session. Thank you.
