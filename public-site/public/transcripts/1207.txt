Anyone wishing to address the council on any matters listed on the agenda should first complete a speaker card found at the back of the chamber. Once completed, turn your cards into the city clerk and the speaker cards are taken in the order that they are received. Once the first speaker begins, no additional cards will be accepted on that item. Our first item up tonight is a presentation from Matt Teague, the superintendent of the California State Parks. And this is a Bidwell Mansion update. Sorry. Good evening, Mayor Reynolds, Council. I appreciate the opportunity to present this and keep the community updated on the progress of this tragic event. It's coming up. There we go. So I provided a similar update a week and a half ago at the Bidwell Mansion Association's annual meeting, which the public was invited. We had about 150 in attendance. Most members, but some public. I've added a little bit of a list. I'm going to go ahead and give you a little bit of a summary and update to this as far as the incident is concerned. Next slide. Or do I have a? Perfect. Thank you. So just to recap, and I'm sure everyone is familiar with this, initial response to this fire on December 11th, about 0200 hours. At 0316, chico dispatch received the reports. We originally had a report on the fire. We originally thought the fire was near little chico creek or the children's playground based on the dispatch and the incoming report. We found out later it was the bidwell mansion. I'm sure you have seen chico fire's interviews on the mansion being fully engulfed by the time the response was fully deployed. I will just jump to the end. Chico fire really began arriving on scene and attacking the fire at 0323. We had a report on the fire. As far as the origin and cause, we have been working diligently with a great team, cal fire office, state fire marshal who is leading the fire origin and cause investigation with the sacramento sierra regional arson task force and chico fire. As far as the suspect identification, tracking and arrest, california state parks with chico police, cal fire butte county unit, university police department, fbi butte county district attorney. We have a report on the fire. And as you all probably know as well, arrest was made on january 2nd which we all appreciate the efforts of this team and how fast we were able to make this arrest. Moving on to recovering. And I'm going to stop there and kind of acknowledge the team. I personally arrived on scene about 0330 hours. hours. Just a huge appreciation for our local partners and I think this is a testament to the tragedy and events we see in this county and the city and with the park fire just as recent as this summer it is always amazed me as many incidents I have been involved in and how quickly we collaborate with our partners. Within five or ten minutes chief deputy zinko approached me and we were plugged in immediately. I want to shout out a thanks to deputy chief zinko and the battalion chiefs on site that night and wagner. As far as the investigation I have worked hand in hand every day to the point of the arrest with fire marshal from chico fire Paul ricketts and raul gonzalez and marshal. Chief gov chief aldridge and all the command staff and officers that led to this arrest. State parks could not have done this without them. Eric guffs from public works another one within 15 minutes Eric and I were already talking about how we will deal with this the day of. It' s an inspiration to see how with the site planning. We don' t know a lot of what the future holds right now. The district attorney' s office has asked us to hold the site and not interfere with the crime scene as we call it until February 15. At that time we should gain access back to the site where we can really start our structural assessments damage assessments cultural put this puzzle together to find out where we will go as far as that planning. These are the things I will talk about what we do know and that' s reestablishing public access that will be a component we are already discussing however the safety and security of the site that will be challenging. We have a visitor center that is still on site we have an exhibit we have a theater to designate the national register of historic places in 1972 it was designated as a national register of historic places that' s a key component to state parks and that' s going to define how we move forward. We will work with the office of historic preservation using the department of interior standards which we all abide by when it comes to historic preservation. Once we unravel the where we stand as far as treatment options whether restoration reconstruction memorialization those are the things we will be talking about. Working with the public and the stakeholders that' s the obvious one we are already working with one of our consultants out of our headquarters department to do a work order basically on that public outreach and engagement piece. Current building codes that really applies to whether reconstruction is possible. Review the general plan we have a general plan from the mid 80' s at the park we will review that and see what is still applicable for this park even after this event. Then obviously the one that everyone talks about is financial and staff resources going forward. This is just a very broad overview this is similar to what we saw at big basin I don' in the park it was our first park in the state park system in 1902. That whole park burned from the czu fire in 2020. They have gone through a very robust reimagining, revisioning and planning process and it' s still underway and they still have not yet started the major redevelopment. Here at bidwell mansion we' re looking at site stabilization we are still in that initial recovery or incident response mode we are still in We have the cleanup damage assessments, stabilization, site security. Right now we' re working on improving or taking down the original construction fence we have a 24 hour contract with ag security right now on site. Our hope is to get a more secure what we' re calling a midterm we don' t want to call it long term midterm fence that is much more secure where we can relieve the work to do at some point which I think the phase one we' looking at at least a year. Phase two park planning historic preservation treatment options interim park ops plan interpretation enhancement additional park use opportunities park infrastructure operations and incorporating indigenous knowledge into whatever that plan may be. This is really the core of how we move Phase two implementation. Phase three implementation. We don' t know how long this process obviously it' s a long term process for recovery on this incident. This is just a quick example this was from big basin state historic park. We will soon have another example as the palisades fire took most of topanga state park and the historic park. We lost a 54 room historic hotel that was built by william hurst in that fire and we also lost the original ranch house of will rogers. I hate to say it' s the norm these days but we' re going through a lot of tragic historic cultural resource losses in our department and this planning process is becoming not so unique. We will continue to work on What we look at as a renewed state historic park at the mansion is acknowledging that long-standing community support that' s obvious from the first five minutes of the fire. The community is showing up this is obviously a very emotional incident. Reestablishing its essential role in the community updating and enhancing interpretive programming that' s where we look at the optimistic side of this we can see the impact of this. I think we have a chance to really enhance and customize that interpretive program for our local schools and tourists and public visitors. Reengaging with the tribal partners we have entered memorandum of agreement with machupta tribe we have already had a very strong relationship with machupta on other projects in the county. We have met with them and they are in full support of this planning process engaged in incorporating cutting edge historic preservation practices. I will end it with resources. Here' s our state park contact. Our district office is over at lake orville. Right now we have established we have already had established the California state parks foundation they have been a partner for over 30 years with state parks. They immediately developed a bidwell mansion recovery fund and it is on their and donations can be accepted there. And then bidwell mansion association we are still working with the bidwell mansion association to see what their capacity is as far as receiving donations. I foresee bidwell mansion taking on smaller donations that can help interim operations or interpretive program where the state parks association and possibly enter agreements to accept those but as of now these are the ones we are established. Thank you. thank you for the update. any questions? I do this may be obscure. I actually used to work as a maintenance aid located at bidwell mansion and I have a very distinct memory of vacuuming the basement and it was just layers and layers of who knows what from the building. During that day I remember that there were some fragments found on Chico high school campus and downtown and just such a large structure fire burning for so long with who knows what kind of materials. I am wondering if there are any questions about the building and the health implications on the community that we' re aware of especially since I know it did take some time for that barrier to be created keeping people back off the scene. I would answer that by saying it' s probably the materials normal to a lot of structure fires. I think there' e a give and take there' s probably hazards material with industrial commercial properties that would be used to create t know the specifics of what those materials became airborne and went into the city. Obviously an old building it has lead paint and had lead I don' t know as far as the extent of public hazard as far as at this point or I would probably defer to fire to fire personnel to come and work on the building difficult to distinguish what this building looks like as far as hazards material compared to other structure fires. It was a 12,000 square foot building so there' s a lot of material. what I' m hearing is there' s been no reports of anyone having any side effects of smoke? not that we know of. thank you I appreciate that. thank you so much for coming I' m sure we' ll see you again. thanks for the opportunity. next presentation is wildfire readiness which was an item I asked to come last week by our fire chief Mr. Standridge. good evening mayor vice mayor council members. I appreciate this opportunity to talk about wildfire readiness it' s at the forefront of everybody' s minds given the park fire and the catastrophic fires in southern california and unfortunately it seems to be a reoccurring annual event throughout the year. this is timely to talk about it as we' re trying to plan for our we are going to do going forward what we want to address as a community and fire department and as a city. wildfire resilience is really a three-legged stool and I made that up by the way so there' s no actual three-legged stool in the lexicon of wildfire resilience but you can use it by the way. it entails three significant areas independent of each other. effectively effectively! podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem! podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem department and as I go forward I want to acknowledge I have battalion chief Mike wagner in the audience today he' s here as an adjunct to answer any questions he' s a 26 year member of the fire department he' s been very active in the wildfire realm and has been on most major incidents over the last 10 years to include firemen and firemen in the wild fire realm including the wild conclude but not excluding some of the other fires a car fire camp fire dixie fire park fire and then the eaton fire most recently in socal. He' s held multiple positions throughout his career in the wildfire ranks and that includes his latest as division chief. Did I get that right mike? s also been put in charge of helping execute the community wildfire protection plan we have in place that will be talking about in a moment. He' s helping advocate and then work with our cooperating agencies and partners to help us meet the needs of the community through that cwpp. So when we talk about what we' re now realizing is we' implementing a new norm and so we need to do something different and one of the foundational elements of understanding our new norm is conducting a comprehensive assessment of wildfire risk to the community and the adjacent areas and then adapting our strategies to meet the goals of the wildfire resiliency school. Again as well as response which is two components is capability and capacity. Just made up a new word by the way. So we lead into two salient documents one is the vegetation fuels management plan that was ushered in under public works operations and the parks department with linda hermann championing it. It was put into effect in implementing that plan. The plan is a And that is strictly for our areas that the city owns by way of open spaces greenways waterways and the parks. Following that I initiated the community wildfire protection plan and I want to be really clear that the plan itself is specific to the city of chico but it does not supplant either of the two. We roll this information into the county' s plan but it gives us an opportunity to look at our community in a very holistic way and at a much more granular level than we are able to at the county cwpp level. I will talk a little bit about both of these but I will focus most of mine on the cwpp as it is a very broad and comprehensive The key to our success relies upon our ability to collaborate with agencies and departments within the city. We have a very tight relationship and are continuing to build on those with the butte county fire safe council, cal fire butte in particular, the united states forest service, the parks department internally, chico pd for evacuations, and the building department and code enforcement. We have a very broad and comprehensive plan to help us ensure we are meeting the needs and expectations and requirements of the code for building. So while land urban area fire or urban fire assessments are the key to us understanding how volatile some of our areas are within our city. We identify areas of potential high intensity for wildfire and fire protection. critical rates of spread. Identify critical ignition points where fires could spread into the city. Identify places where larger region scale larger regional scale wildfire activity has a potential to spread into the urban areas. And that I will take a moment to talk about. We have a very robust relationship and response model under the mutual That is the area from the east side of the city from the south of skyway all the way up towards the airport. That is an area we mutually agree it is in our best interest to send a very robust response to get ahead of it in order it doesn't either encroach into the city or moves out of the city up into the foothills. treatment projects on fire behavior and spread. So really what we're talking about is how do we identify those areas that are at highest risk for spreading fire rapidly and either into or away from the city. And it's predicated, the assessment is predicated on three aspects, topography, fuels, and weather. And I won't get into much detail or any detail on this, but these are the factors that help determine how volatile that fire behavior can be in any given place. One of the areas that we struggle most with and creates the most challenging aspects is wind. And I say that because we have some areas that are susceptible to winds, north-south winds, as well as upslope, downslope, specifically in the park and on the east side of the city. With our modeling, especially with respect to the CWPP, our consultant, Deer Creek Resources, did both the vegetation management plan as well as the CWPP, did the analysis on it, wrote the document for us, and they got into a lot of granular assessments of areas where specific wind patterns, topography, and fuel may increase it within the heart of the city, the danger of wildfire. And we're also working with the city to identify the best way to address that spread. So out of the vegetation fuels management plan, there were a number of priorities that were identified with goals and objectives. And some of the tools that we utilize here in the city, there's a wide toolbox that we have available to us. And these are some of the more prevalent ones we lean into. For sure, the thinning and mitigation work that's done by hand, and the the We have a lot of tools and machinery that can help us clear out areas of high density with volatile vegetation. The goats have become a very popular aspect of the wildfire mitigation toolbox. First of all, they're fun to watch and second of all, they're amazingly effective. And like anything else, they have their limitations, but they have their uses and we use them virtually every year. We're able to get grant funding to bring them in. They are not a cheap animal to bring in in that mass number. We do dozer lines or extend existing dozer lines, maintaining them as breaks in the park. So we help segment the park in a way that allows us to get defensible space and fight from those areas that give us refuge and allows us to get more tools that we can use to protect that area and potentially burn it back into the fire. And then lastly, something that's near and dear to our department is a prescribed fire. Fires we do annually. And we work very closely with the parks department to identify areas that we would like to focus on and then we do the burn plan and then execute it and have our resources available along with other regional partners that come in and assist with those park fires. Last year we did two. Usually we always do the airport and then the last couple of years we've done the front hundred or couple hundred acres coming into the park from manzanita. So the CWPP is a regional park that we're replicate. The difference between that and the vegetation management plan is complementary. The vegetation management plan is strictly with respect to the parks, waterways, city owned properties that we want to maintain. But then we have areas that are susceptible that could be identified as problematic for residents, businesses and other structures and things of high value. And what it does is it looks at it at an individual lot perspective as well as numerous lots put together that are within that pattern of the topography, wind behavior and so forth that could cause issues that we want to get ahead of. And it gives us an opportunity then to look at the To identify through this process areas that we may want to focus on with respect to education and outreach, independent mitigation work by homeowners, business owners and the city itself depending on the nature of the properties. And this is what it looks like at a closer level, at a parcel level, those areas that are highest risk and high risk to be identified. For the vegetation management plan, two major goals and I won't go into the objectives but it is to minimize fire risk while protecting ecological values and then goal number two, not goals number two, goal number two, restore and maintain appropriate fire return intervals in chico's park lands. And those sub objectives are what then tie into those two goals. Thank you. And because this is a document that sits under public works I will let them speak to anything if you have any questions associated with that. I just threw you under the bus there. Our cwpp goals there are seven of them that we identified when we built out the plan, describe and assess the greater chico area's general wildfire risks, simulate fire behavior in the area, identify and identify specific wildfire risk related to habitat, habitat, habitat, habitat, habitat, habitat, habitat, habitat, habitat, habitat, habitat, habitat, habitat, habitat, habitat, habitat, habitat, habitat, habitat, habitat, habitat, habitat, habitat, habitat, habitat, habitat, habitat, the final finale. Under the solutions and proposed projects they fell in those seven categories. I' m going to go through these rather quickly because I don' t want to waste too much of your time so you have an opportunity to ask questions either myself or battalion chief watner for any operational questions you may have. I' m going to go through the information and planning activities. m going to spend a moment on this. This is one of the areas we could enhance significantly and it ties into the parcel to parcel engagement with our community with respect to how we help them build more resilience and sustainability. strengthen their resiliency and harden their structures so it helps create better ability to withstand that kind of behavior. Wildfire behavior. Reducing structural integrity by strengthening building construction standards enforcement. The state is going more aggressively to creating more s important to note that when new buildings are coming online where they' re in high risk areas that wou we standards or wildfire interface fires or code requirements will be mandated. That was the case with the valley's edge community under the eir it was required that the entirety of that community would from a fire department standpoint and creating defensible space around your home and there' s a lot of ways to do that even on an urbanized home environment. Suppression capabilities and public safety fire protection access water systems and then just the response model that we utilize both in the mtz area and effectively effectively! effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively this will come up tonight as you may well be aware. So where are we gapped? We have those three legs and I'll address each one in mitigation. There's direct funding and grants that are available that we need to tap into and we do frequently through the state and the county. But there are other grants that we could potentially get a hold of. Firewise designations of certain communities. We have one in Chico and that's in Piccoline neighborhood and WUI building standards and increased fuels reduction. Outreach and education. This is one area that I'd love to see us be able to expand on and having someone dedicated to that role of reaching out to communities and to the community. And I think that's a great point. community members and communities, smaller communities, neighborhoods to help enhance the mitigation and the hardening of those communities and making it more resilient. Addressing high risk parcels and then weed abatement is another tool that we use in the city to help reduce that potential. But it's also an opportunity to work with a property owner to maintain those properties in a way that helps reduce that potential. effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively and then overlapping incidents. When we have a big incident, be it a structure fire or in this case vegetation or wildland or urban interface fires, we dedicate a lot of resources. A minimum of four engines are dedicated to those incidents. Therefore, we strip the city of other resources that are still needed to run incidents outside the incident that's going on in the city. So we have incidents where we're overlapping and we typically don't have enough resources necessarily to respond to every emergency, so we have to triage those at times. And then call volume hazards and risks that are associated with our community outside of wildfires. And then just the population growth itself. As we continue to grow, we need to continue to assess what kind of response model we want to achieve. we want to achieve from a policy standpoint. So that is the last couple. I've got two more slides here. So some of the past and current projects that we have either completed or are underway, the parks department has facilitated 125 hazard trees on 10 mile house road, removing them and taking them to the park. And we have a plan to get them out of the park so they don't create snags and other issues for us. Pre-attack line for dozers, creating a wider break for us at bloody pin trail from highway 32 to Annie bidwell trail. Pile burning, we've done two prescribed burns this last spring. And then we've developed a wildland pre-plan that helps us not only operationally, but it's the basis by which we do evacuation. So we're working on that. And effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively bear hole lindo channel fuels reduction fuels reductions in general upper middle and lower park and then increasingly use prescribed berms when appropriate we do have limitations that we have to be mindful of and there's a small envelope by which we have to maintain when we're doing prescribed berms but they're an invaluable aspect of our mitigation work lastly i just want to get it on your radar screen cal fires uh in the process of or they should have already uh disseminated the local fire hazard severity zones for all municipalities or most municipalities in the state of california it will have a significant impact on chico i suspect in which case we'll be bringing that back to you uh for your adoption it has to be adopted as accepting the maps into resolution and then it will be you we're going to be assessing what kind of implications it will have on our community and how we want to address some of the high risk areas that may be identified that we didn't identify through our cwpb or the vegetation fuels management plan. That concludes my presentation and i' m happy to answer any questions you may have. do we have any questions from council? we have a question from the community development committee. Mr. Winslow. we gave a similar and good presentation to the ad hoc growth and community development committee back in november and one of the things that was brought to my attention there is how much some of our edge communities were built before we had these wwe standards that the state mandates now and so they' re really not as resilient as they would be if they were to be built today. we have the one firewise community in chico little chico creek is what it' s called and i pulled it up and includes the whole dill mill neighborhood. other people who feel like their neighborhoods are not as resilient as they were in the past. if a firewise community is in danger and the neighborhood is potentially at risk how do they start the process of becoming a firewise community? they can contact us or mike you' re probably better suited to answer that question than i am. thank you. i' m throwing mike under the bus. good evening. any community that' s interested in becoming a firewise community there' s a whole website and organization dedicated to walking them through all the steps they' ll need to address and work through to become firewise. once they meet the firewise community they' re going to be able to meet all the standards and they can become certified and it helps their community be more resilient and more safe for their residents. that website is buttefiresafe.net is that the one i found? no if you type in firewise communities on the internet it' s going to take you to a whole host of resources that will teach you what it takes to be firewise and i haven' t looked it up in a while but i know that firewise communities they have a whole website that you can go there and it will walk you through what you do how you do it who you contact and how you get there. effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively! I didn' t answer your question. it' s nfpa.org. that' s what I find. you google fire wise and you find it. thank you. another great resource is the butte county fire safety council. they' re very helpful and they will help fire wise communities with getting grants and walking them through that process as well. they' re a great resource and we' re embedded in that and I' m happy to say chief wattner is an active member in that group on behalf of the city. any other council members? council member ober. I' m going to thank chief standard we did not give you a lot of time to put this comprehensive report together so I appreciate the effort and I also like the stool analogy that' s well done thank you. we had a couple other questions from the council member. council member van overbeck. thank you. chief very well done. I want to thank you again for keeping my house from burning down during the campfire. I did it all by myself. your command vehicle was in my driveway and somebody' s hose was in the swing. thank you. this was a great place to start. we obviously can' t do this without you. I would like us to think about what the most likely scenarios are. re going to talk later about campfires in the parks and lindo channel. just make sure we' ve thought through what the strategy is to deal with those whatever we can do on the front end for mitigation all the things you talked about but focused on the real high probability scenarios in our community which are unfortunately mainly in my district on the east side. these are long-term expectations in our community. we have a lot of! we modify our priorities within the context of the ones we have identified that we want to move forward. sometimes it doesn' t work out to do prescribed burn for example. we might pivot on something else or we find a really good envelope to burn in. we' re flexible that way. but it does require resources, time, energy and money no matter how we do it. there are communities that have developed interesting and really effective ways to help spread that cost out over a period of time. marin county is one of those that has a really robust mitigation program. but again it' s tied to property taxes and sometimes that' s not necessarily a popular approach but there are some models out there that we can certainly look at and see how those might benefit our community and fit our needs and our appetite for what we need to do. anybody else? i heard you say clearly that maybe a dedicated role for outreach and education is something that we could look at in the future? yes i would certainly advocate it. it' s something i' ve talked about in the past. effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively aren't quite that expensive. Okay, good. Yes, they're pricey, but what we're saying is we obviously want to make sure we continue to add to as necessary to meet our needs and goals. And the type threes are a very useful tool for us, for sure. All right. Thank you very much. Thank you. For pulling that together in just a quick seven days time, six days. All right. Consent agenda. All matters under the consent agenda are considered routine in nature and therefore can be acted with one motion. Do we have any speakers on the consent agenda? Mayor? We need to do the closed session report. I'm sorry. Can you do our closed session announcement for me, Mr. Lamb? Yep. Good evening, Mayor. I was so excited to get to consent. Good evening, Mayor. City Council. Tonight, the council recessed in closed session. All council members were present for closed session. Item 2.1, this item was not, not discussed in closed session. This item was pulled prior to closed session. Item 2.2, City Council discussed this item in closed session. Direction was provided. No final action was taken. That concludes my report. Great. Thank you very much. Now we can go to the consent agenda. Do we have any speakers or council disqualifications? No, no speakers. Quick question. Yes. Did we have minutes under that today from the last meeting? They weren't because of the timing. That's good. Okay, great. They'll be on the next one. Perfect. All right. So, do I have a motion? Motion to approve. Second. Move to approve in a second. Mr. Preston. Okay. Just a moment. All right. Council Member Goldstein. Aye. Council Member Hawley. Yes. Council Member O'Brien. Yes. Council Member Van Overbeck. Yes. Council Member Winslow. Yes. Vice Mayor Bennett. Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds. Aye. Carry 7-0. All right. Public comment. Members of the public may address the council at this time on any matter not already listed on the agenda. And within the jurisdiction's authority, the council cannot take any action at this meeting on these requests made under this section of the agenda. How many? We have 12 speakers. All right. Two minutes each. Okay. All right. And I'll call the first two speakers. And if you could line up in the middle aisle, that will help. All right. our first two speakers are Frank Rebellio and Nicole Nava. Good evening, counsel. My name is Frank Rebellio. I reside at Fort Presley Court here in Chico. I'm appearing before you tonight as a new citizen with agreements with the Chico Building Department. I feel I'm not the first one to be harmed by the department in the manner in which they function. Here is a brief overview. I was contacted by code enforcement regarding unpermitted modifications nine months after the purchase of my home. The house I purchased in 2022 has three bed, three bath, and three car garage. I was told by code enforcement their file showed three bed, two bath, two car garage. Staff, code enforcement staff came out and although would not comment, it was clear there was never any modifications or remodel while inspecting the home which was built in 2019. I asked, what do you do, where are the plans that you're referring to that speaks to that floor plan that you're referring to? I was told by code enforcement staff that the department does not require to store plans beyond two years. In my mind, in today's technology, that data consumption for a set of plans amounts to a grain of sand on the beach. Note the building department files have a completed inspection sheet, final sign-off, and occupancy permit, but no plans. I was then asked by the department to review the plans. I was then asked by the department to review the plans. I was then contacted by the building department administrator. The administrator required a set of plans to satisfy the violation. My response to this was, no. Why? So you can delete them in 24 months? I did reach out to the original architect and they did not have plans for my home. I also contacted my city council representative. I also contacted my city council representative. He was enthusiastic and initially willing to assist, but came up empty after speaking with the building department official. But came up empty after speaking with the building department official. And although he stated he was familiar with matters of this nature, went on to speak, at which point I said, but came on to speak, at which point I called him out on it. He was contradicting himself to say that at the least, I was very disappointed. After legal interaction and my reluctance to bow to the initial demand, the bureaucrat was willing to accept simple drawings to settle the matter. the bureaucrat was willing to accept simple drawings to settle the matter. Sorry, Mr. Rogallo, that' s your time. Thank you. Thank you. So Nicole Nava followed by Mary Beth Wurthner. So Nicole Nava followed by Mary Beth Wurthner. Good evening, council. The reason I wanted to come speak during this part is to talk about community. is to talk about community. And I had said some time ago that I really miss the partnership that the community used to do way more with the campus. In particular, Chico State. And we had some events that would really be centered around that. Like I've talked about the quad, there were parades, there were all kinds of things. We still have parades, but it's kind of like these siloed things. And I think it would be wonderful if you guys could reach out to university administrators and such and try to figure out ways we can start finding things we all can agree on. And I think there's good opportunities for that. I know there might be people that have issues with things that were related to Pioneer Days, because of differences of political opinion, right? But we can still all appreciate and respect and educate. So there's opportunities to still have some of those events, have everybody lean in and have the education about what was not so great about those times and things where people were resilient and worked together in those times. So I've really been missing that for people. When my kids were young, they were kind of on the outer end of having some of those things. But when I was young, we had a lot of that. And I feel like it made this community tight. There's too much that is pulling people apart. And so if we can start finding those things we can land on together, I think that would be brilliant. And I also want to just do a quick PSA for some awesome local resources, such as things like Vectors, Liberty Commons. These are like MPOs doing really good work. And so if Salvation Army, their adult recovery program, so if people want to get involved and people are looking for places to plug in and donate, give, volunteer time, things like that, I encourage you all to reach out. Thank you so much. Thank you. Mary Beth Werthner, followed by Tracy Vincent. I normally don't make it a habit to speak back to speakers, but since four of us today were at the DCBA annual meeting, I will say that our new president Perez was there, and there's lots of conversations happening about a lot of things between the downtown and the downtown. And we have Choose Chico coming up on March 1st, and we have 900 potential students coming to visit Chico. So there are a lot of those conversations happening in the background, and we'll work on getting that out there further. But I just wanted to throw that out there. Mary Beth, thank you. The Chico sewer plan has extremely serious problems that need to be addressed. The first problem was the protest vote. A voting scheme foisted on the public to ensure that the city's public vote was guaranteed a win for the city's plan without a single person in Chico actually voting in favor of it. The process was a sham. I can't emphasize this enough. The second problem is unmetered volumetric charges. Common sense tells us you can't get an accurate measure of volume without a meter. Trying to substitute a theoretical equation for a mathematical measurement has created a host of problems, resulting in inaccurate billing and overcharges. High winter averages are being fabricated. People are being charged for irrigation water. New tenants are being charged for prior tenants' usage. Unoccupied buildings are being charged for usage. Winter averages are based on Cal Water billing dates instead of water consumption as defined by the plan and stated on every bill. The third and certainly the most disturbing development is the city's unethical manipulation of fixed commercial rates. Conveniently excluded from the proposal to be voted on was a definition of EDU and how it's calculated. So Chico business owners find themselves being charged exorbitant rates as much as $700 a month and the city refuses to explain why or how they've arrived at these changes. The city is not being transparent to the people of Chico and how their sewer fees are being calculated. And nothing is being done to correct the inaccurate building and overcharges. No wonder Cal Water drops city billing like a hot potato. Thank you, Mary Beth. Tracy Vincent followed by Tom Werthner. Madam Mayor, Council members, kind of going off what you said, Madam Mayor, I appreciate the time that we get to address the council. I think that's great. But we really don't have a mechanism to get feedback. And I was wondering if maybe on some of the topics, I know obviously not all, there could be a mechanism maybe like in the minutes or something addressing some of the things that we talk about. For instance, I have a question about what we talked about last week for the stormwater management. For the people that weren't here or didn't know the south side of town, we had a cease and desist issued concerning the management of Lindo Channel many years ago due to the lack of the upkeep on the channel. It's now filled with sediment and increasing the risk of flooding and especially when we get increased runoff from the burn scar. Also with 100 year storms and then rain like we're getting right now. We're already having minor flooding due to increased water in the channel being too high and the storm drains cannot actually flow into it. Back to the cease and desist order real quick. The order was given due to environmental concerns. Well, what about the environmental impacts of illegal camping, trampling, trash, human waste? What about the environmental impacts of the flooding and fire risks and safety to all of us? Per the report, the cost to repair the channel to get it back to flood water storm control readiness will be about $7 million with the cost being procured by us at approximately $500 per parcel. If we can't find a way to defer some of that cost back to the state because they caused us to be in this situation to begin with, what else can we do? And have those 15,000 parcels on the south side of town been notified that they may need flood insurance? You did have one other thing to talk about, the CCA, but real quick, we are being held captive by PG&E. And CCA is great, and I love it, except on our bills, we actually get charged a fee for the people that do CCA. And so I was wondering if some of those extra charges we have from PG&E, will we still get those if we switched to the CCA? Thank you. Thank you. Tom Werthner followed by Jeff Hill. Okay. Chico City officials say they are dedicated to keeping costs and customer bills as low as possible and that their sewer plan would better reflect the actual cost of the service to each customer. Neither are true. I opened a Cal Water account while my rental was unoccupied. Water was exclusively used for outdoor irrigation. My actual sewer usage was zero, but I was billed at a winter average of 6.64 per month, as if an empty house could send 5,000 gallons of wastewater into the sewer each month. Based on the city's equation, the winter average for my residence came to 2.25, but I was billed at a winter average of 6.28 per month. So my rental was billed over six times more and my residence over three times more than my actual usage. Family and neighbors report similar problems. How many of Chico's 30,000 sewer customers are being overcharged every month without their knowledge? City officials need to concede that their attempt to charge by volume without a meter cannot be done accurately or fairly. If that wasn't enough, enormous fixed rates are being imposed on business owners through EDUs. Yet it's interesting that the letters EDU appeared in the tiniest print on the proposal without any clarification of what it meant or how it would affect business owners' fixed rates. The sewer proposal itself, its voting method, and its implementation are all deeply flawed and completely non-transparent to the people of Chico. Thank you. Thank you. Jeff Hill followed by Charles Withoon. Thank you. I just wanted to address the council with a similar situation. I'm a business owner of the city of Chico. This is my bill and we believe that we've identified the issue as the fixed charge. It says sewer fixed charge right here. This is your proposed 2023, January 17th, 2023. And if you flip to page two, I would love for the council to estimate what my bill should be because of... If you estimate what the bill should be according to this, your paperwork, it's about a 16th of what I actually pay each month. I am being billed, as of now, $848.46. And the actual sewer usage charge is $157.94 of that. The fixed charge, again, is $710. I believe the issue is the fixed charge is extremely high. We were asked for how this EDU was calculated. We haven't received any information back. I've talked to you guys publicly, privately, and we still haven't come to a resolution. I would love for the council to make this transparent to the rest of the public on how we came to this issue and see what we can do. We can do it or resolve it. I'm not asking... I will pay my fair share gladly, but this is more than fair since my bill has gone up several hundred times as I've told every single one of you, and I'm telling you again, this bill is 400%, 350% more than it was. And I can prove it going back as far as you want to go. So thank you. Thanks for your time. Wait a second. Mr. Hill? Mr. Hill, before you sit down. Is this your... Residence or business? Business. Okay, and what's the business? It's a restaurant. Okay, thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Charles Withoon, followed by Nancy Park. Good evening, staff, council. January 28th, North State Shelter Team delivered to city staff documents that had details of managed campground ordinances, including effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively Now it has 50 tiny homes that are becoming code compliant. The village has its own 24-hour security, and the local government provides no funding. Dignity Village funds its operation through grants and a wide variety of micro-businesses over the years. Their IRS 990 documents show over the last three years they now have excess funds of over $18,000. That's a successful program. It turns out our most valuable resource is our people. Given the opportunity, proper co-management, proper shelter, formerly homeless people can become a community asset. We all have goals in common. Let's work together to get them done. We can do it. Thank you. Thank you. Nancy Park, followed by Robin McCollum. Kind of following up on Charles, I urge you all to agendize a discussion of managed campgrounds for unhoused people. I think it's time that we finally kind of looked at this idea. I don't know exactly how much it has cost for four years of the city sweeps of people camping in public places. I do know it's in the millions of dollars. Let's take that money and set up well-managed sanitary campgrounds. As Charles said, it has been done in quite a few other cities. I see such campgrounds as a vital piece of solving the issue of homelessness. They would be a sensible addition to the great work already being done at the Torres Shelter, Safe Space Winter Shelter, and the North State Shelter Team. In closing, it's finally time to have a public discussion about this. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Robin McCollum, followed by Jeannie Thatcher. Good evening, Council Members. Citizens of Chico should not feel threatened by homeless people, fear of the unknown. Stereotypes of druggies and thieves affect their view of all homeless. None of us should fear each other. Homeless people are victims of an economy that neither supports nor includes them where housing and wages are grossly misaligned. Personal catastrophes such as accident, illness, disability can cause them to fall into economic desperation. Disasters like the Camp Fire or imagine the recent fires in LA can do the same. We can't just make these problems go away. We must deal with it effectively. And chasing homeless from one miserable refuge to another is not effective. If we want them out of town and the neighborhoods, we must find, create a place for them to be. What's been done to them is not enough. What's been done so far is ineffective and costly for all. I believe that the city should lead on behalf of housed and unhoused. Both have an interest in this. Two sides of the coin. And should lead the way to a solution by providing camps that are acceptable to all. There should be two types and as many as necessary for the large number of homeless with provisions for adequate sanitation and safety. The first type should prioritize seniors and adults. The second should be for troublemakers. They should be self-governing to manage day-to-day chores and have the ability to report and eject troublemakers, drug dealers and thieves. The police can and should enforce laws against disturbing the peace, violence and drug crimes committed in the camps and reported by the camps. Personnel in the camp by the community. These are our people, mostly blameless. We've all failed at some time, whether we're at the top of our game or the bottom. These are someone's baby, mother, father or neighbor. They're doing the best they can under the circumstances they need. It's time. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Jeannie Thatcher, followed by Bill Monroe. And you can pull the mic down towards you. You can pull the mic down towards you. Thank you. Yes. Even my big shoes don't. Okay. So we're on the topic of homelessness, which has been going on and on and on. And we know that the approaches we, the city has been using with I'm sure the best of intentions are not working. There, I read today about Lord Salisbury, who was the prime minister of the United Kingdom in 1900. And he said that the most grievous error in politics is clinging tenaciously to the dead carcass of failed policies. You have plenty of experience this year, folks, to know that what you're doing is not working. And so, and it's very expensive. All these lawsuits and moving people from place to place and the cleanups that have to follow. Just endless. It goes on and on. And what? This, and I'm a very conservative person when it comes to money. I'd hate throwing my money away from doing stuff that's not working. The least expensive way to manage the problem that's conceivable is a managed campground. Charles Withune has researched this for years. He's been dedicated to it for as long as I've known. And he knows exactly what will work. And all kinds of volunteers that do all the things that the city doesn't have to do. You have the cleanliness. You have the homeless people out of our faces, which some people can't stand to see. And they have food. And they get help so that they can actually maybe get out of that situation. We treat animals in our animal shelters better. We would not leave an animal cold, shivering, or in pain. Because we're starving and starving in our streets. Plus, everyone won't fit into these rows of beds in the homeless shelters. They need a place to keep their pets. Thank you. Bill Monroe, followed by Lori Monroe. Hello. Mayor Reynolds and Council. I'm Bill Monroe. I live at 234 West 4th Avenue. And I am the corresponding secretary for the Democratic Action Club of Chico. Thank you. I'm Bill Monroe. It's come to my knowledge that you all received an email from someone who misrepresented an email that I sent out. And I have seven copies here that I'd like to give so that you can have that for your reference. We conducted an activity with the 80 or 100 people that read our meeting. One of those, there are, let's get all the ideas on the wall. And under different topics. The topics were as threatening as, what actions can we take individually or as a club to promote the institution of democracy locally and globally? Topic two, what actions can we take individually or as a club to combat the current administration's agenda? Meaning Trump. Topic three, what topics do you want to learn about this year? And. What local organizations should we collaborate with or learn from? So there are like four pages of yellow stickies that went on to these four topics. That was not an agenda as it was presented in the email you all received. There was no agenda of those items. It was. Whoever wanted to come up with an idea. They came up with an idea. Voter registration. Oh my. And so just to be aware. And so I have copies for you all if you want. We'll take them. Thank you. Lori Monroe is our last speaker. Hello, council. I want to talk to you about the unhoused again. And last summer I was here and reiterated the statement of the grand jury that Chico needs a plan. And Chico still needs a plan. I would like to share one story that I have learned in a conversation I had with an unhoused person in one of my volunteer jobs. This person was at that time living in the Lindo channel. I'm sure they aren't any longer. But said that they had been approved to live in the tourist shelter. And but had been clear to the person doing the assessment on them that they would not be willing to live in congregate housing in a room with lots of other people. And that that was not something that they could do. And so was unable to become approved to live in a room with lots of other people. And so was unable to become approved to stay at the pallet shelter or genesis or at any other place where that person could refer them. And so this is another situation where there is no plan. I think that there needs to be more choices for people than the choices that are available. And in that manner the plan would aim toward getting people not sleeping in our public places. And so I think that that is a very important point. I think that the idea of having a public place where people can't sleep in public places is not a good idea. As it is to say people can't sleep in public places doesn't make sense because we have no place the city has no place to send them. So please consider agendaizing a discussion of the suggestions from the north state shelter team. thank you. thank you. all right. item 5.1. timeline for the fiscal year budget 2025-26 budget. barbara. good evening. thank you, mayor, vice mayor, members of council. to continue our conversation from our last meeting we had kind of a two pronged ideas about how to go about our budget process for this year. the ultimate goal is to provide you with a formal proposed budget to be approved by the second meeting of june to be adopted so that it is enacted before the budget is approved. it is a budget that is going to be passed into the council's hands on the first of july. it is going to be passed into the council's hands on the first of july. historically these workshops or delivery of this information has been surrounding a council meeting either by extending a council meeting by doing it over a daytime time period or we have over a period of years split up the presentation so they are provided to you in the evening. during a regular council meeting time. going back to many years we typically did the proposed budget gave it to you to provide to you and gave the workshop to you in the first meeting in june. in the past couple of years we moved that up so there' s more opportunity for you to consider and then if there is any desires for further conversation about what is in to see in the last couple of years it' s been the second meeting in june we have provided you that information. I think it' s important to consider the proposed budget that is given to you is meant to be a culmination of what we believe we' ve worked on internally with the staff and through the city manager' s recommendations are what we have council and the city over the next year with the resources that we have. When we say that if you want to make a change at that point there is we have to take from something else that' s generally because what we do through the process is look at all the resources available and make decisions to recommend allocations based on what' s available so everything is used. If there' s changes it' s just a little bit more difficult to deal with than if we address it earlier in the process. That comes to the second part of our conversation last week where if you all do want to have that conversation and address what those priorities are then perhaps it' s better served in a strategic session or a priority session from you all. I' ll turn that over to miss presson and I know she has more mayor for asking me to do some research and my deputy director absolutely went to town on this and identified numerous consultants who could come in and do strategic planning. One is even local. Not the ones we have used before but someone new. It ranges anywhere from 10 to 15, 20,000 to upwards to 45,000. Almost all of them provide a They identify and speak to the needs and then do follow-up. They attend the meeting. They help you identify priorities then you or goals for the city as well as prioritizing those items that could then be encompassed in the budget. The one that is local did indicate that they would prepare the final documents and bring you back a finished report that lists out those priorities in the order that you determine as a body. We had strategic planning sessions on the weekends. We identified or the council identified goals. Didn't really come up with the priorities. I would leave it up to the council if you want me to continue to pursue this and we just get something scheduled. Any comments from council? Yeah. I think this seems like an overly complex and expensive way to approach this. I don't know why it' s not as simple as each council member takes Ms. Martin out to lunch and says here' s what I' m concerned about and she rolls it up and we have our meeting. I very much am in favor of doing one meeting so we get in budget mode and we knock it out as opposed to breaking it up. I' m not sure. ve been to a million of these planning sessions and everybody goes in all excited and you write all this stuff up and nothing ever happens. I don' t think we need to go through that process. That' s just my opinion. I always have one but it may not be right. do we have other council members that have an opinion on that? my opinion is in alignment with I think we need to make changes to express what sort of priorities we' ve identified through our work in the community and what people tell us and have an opportunity in a meeting like this to recommend as a body which of those we prioritize. I think it' s a little bit simpler than the whole strategic planning. I think if we want to keep barbara as an employee seven people telling her what their podem effectively need to do able to determine which is important and if you' re number five is my number one is she supposed to determine that? I don' t think it' s going to work. I would be interested in hearing more about having an actual strategic planning session where we do the hard work and the community has the opportunity you mentioned that how important it is for the community to have time to feedback this would be a public meeting where the community could see all the work that' s being done and the s my opinion. just to clarify I' m not opposed to a special meeting on it. I think hiring a facilitator sounds like a lot but maybe it' s worth it. I' m open to it. well you are the mayor. seriously I think I don' t have a strong feeling about it. I think we can all state what our priorities are pretty easily and somebody can write it down on a table on the wall and we can walk out of there going to be able to do what they are without paying $15,000 or $50,000 to a facility? I' m definitely not looking at paying $50,000 to do something. If there' s somebody local that we could do it for a reasonable price I would be interested in hearing more about that. It is something that we have budgeted for four years and it' s in the council budget. I will state that it affords the the opportunity for the public to participate and at least, and whether they make comments or not, they're here and they can, it's transparent and they're part of the process. So that's my main thought on that. But it can be any way that you want. Most cities do some sort of strategic planning every couple of years. We were just at the league meeting and obviously El Cerrito was, one of the city, the city manager from El Cerrito was speaking on the importance of the, the, they were having a Saturday meeting on February 1st and they were talking about what they were hoping to accomplish out of it. So I think that there, it can be, it can be very informative and it's, it's a great way because not only do you establish the priorities, but you rank them so that you know when you're making budgetary decisions, how does this meet our priorities? Is it, you know, and, and we would start including that in the, in the actual staff reports. This item has been budgeted and it meets priority number one or four. It was always something that we look to do, but we were never able to prioritize since, I think the last time that was done was in 2013 when obviously we didn't have a lot of money and we were really concerned about for the finances. And so they're on the walls in this, in this council chamber where the four priorities that council had identified. And it was always, it was always a very, very important thing to be able to get the money out there to be part of the conversation. I think Vice Mayor Bennett had something. I think we can accomplish this as simply as possible. I think spending the amount of money that you quoted seems a bit high and perhaps somebody locally could be affordable. But I think it could be simple. We can all definitely come to terms with ourselves on what' s reasonable and what' I think it' s reasonable relative to this next budget fiscal year. And I have no doubt we could all get this accomplished fairly quickly. I' m in favor of it. We haven' t done it for a while. I remember the last one. And we have three new councilmembers. I think this would be a good opportunity to share our thoughts. councilmember o'brien. I would agree with that. I' m not for unnecessary meetings. But I think with new councilmembers and really it' that will be an opportunity not just for us but for the public to weigh in I think there' some value in that I think it will come down to the right facilitator we don' t want to spend too much money on something like this but we want a good one that will be able to do this in an effective manner I would be in favor of that as well. can we leave it to the mayor to decide how she wants to handle it and work it out with the city clerk? and then bring it back to the next meeting? absolutely yes. do we need a motion to do that? no. do we have this is on time okay sorry. barbara did you have anything else on time? just as far as the one day workshop are we still looking for how we did it last year with the second meeting in may does that work for everybody? that' s the crucial thing for us to get our calendar going in terms of getting the process so I want to make sure we get that hammered out as quickly as possible. I think I heard we got consensus last time the second meeting in may like we did last year was good for everybody? okay so we' re good on that one and then we will do we have any public comment on this? we do we have one michael buchanan. hi there I' m here in support of the ordinance the proposed ordinance to permanently close tiger buchanan. effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively Thank you, Madam Mayor. So every year my wife and I drive down to Southern California and we stop at little towns. And one of the things I always look at the downtowns, but also how do they deal with parking? And so one of the things we've observed is that post-COVID, a lot of towns have started to provide the first hour, sometimes it's 30 minutes, sometimes it's 75 minutes, but some time, free parking time in their downtowns, they encourage people to come down there. So, you know, you have time for a quick lunch, you have time to pick something up for a store without having to pay for parking. So as an experiment, we had free parking between Thanksgiving and Christmas, and it was very well received by the local business people downtown. And. . . So I would, I propose, ask to be put on the agenda that we provide one hour free parking in downtown in the two hour zone. So that is the, roughly the zone between Salem and Wall and First and Fourth. There's about 10 blocks. So the 10 hour zone would still be at the normal rate. And there would be free parking on the weekends and free parking before nine in the morning and after six in the evening. So I would say that we have a pretty straightforward, you know, our downtown is in need some love, need some help. And I think this is something that could provide some incentive for people to come downtown. And I'm hoping the council will support it. Okay. Do we have any council, other council member questions, discussion, questions for Mr. Van Overbeck? I certainly have questions on the item, but I'm feeling like this might need to be something that's a staff report if we move forward. So perhaps I should hold some of those. And I'm sure we've got some public comment too. Council Member Hawley. Just for clarification. So you said one hour free parking only in the two hour zone specifically? Correct. Okay. Thank you. All right. Do we have? We do. We have five. Okay. Okay. Tracy Vincent, followed by Greg Scott. Before we do that. Okay. Okay. So I'm going to provide a report on the financial impact. And do you want to do this after the speakers or before? No, if we have that now. I didn't. Is there a report for that? I don't recall that being part of this. No, we couldn't direct that because this is the first discussion. We would have to direct staff to come back with that. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. When we did, I guess just for the best info we have, when we did the free parking during the month of December, that was like $50,000 for the month. Was that right? Yeah. Sounds about right. And this would be less because people still paying for some parking sometimes, right? True. Yes. So looking at less than $50,000. Per month. Yeah. Per month. Okay. Yeah. And of course, December typically runs high. So other months are usually not quite as high. All right. First speaker. Okay. So Tracy Vincent, followed by Greg Scott. Greetings again. I'm Tracy Vincent, followed by Greg Scott. I'm sure I'm going to get some flack for this, but I say no. I just don't even really see why that would be a thing that there's free parking within three blocks of everything. The cost to park is very low. If you're handicapped, you get to come for free, which is great. I'm not arguing about that. That's wonderful. And I do think it would be difficult to manage. And I don't know that it's really going to help the businesses because if you only get an hour, you're going to rush back. You're not going to want to window shop or anything. You're going to want to go to a parking lot. I just think it's better for that. And I would actually think we could raise prices just a little bit. Because rather than that, I'd rather increase the price that it costs and have maybe little stickers or whatever for certain people. Maybe you're not handicapped, but you're older and you have a difficult time getting to that particular business. So I say no. I don't really see a need for it. And I think it would be very hard to manage. Thank you. Greg Scott, followed by Jesse Horgan. Thank you. Good evening, folks. I don't know how hard we manage. We have license plate readers. But anyway, the experiment in November, December worked extremely well. I don't have hard data because the sales tax, I don't think the sales tax information has gone through. I believe it was less than $50,000, but I think the sales tax offset a big portion of that. But anecdotally, every business that I've worked with, I've worked with a lot of people. And every business that we talked to saw an increase from Thanksgiving through Christmas. One-hour free parking is a really relatively simple thing to do, as Tom explained. And I think, like I said, every business that I talked to at our annual meeting this morning and every business I talked to this morning were all in favor of it. So I would strongly urge us to do something in that manner. manner. Thank you very much. Thank you. Jesse Horgan, followed by Bruce McLean. Good evening. Let's see. I'm a parking professional, parking and transportation. This is my 25th year managing parking and transportation. I have just started as the parking services manager for Chico State last year. So I wanted to talk about free parking and how it's sort of counterintuitive. It does not follow a sort of logical path. There are some benefits to free parking, an hour of free parking or all day of free parking, but those benefits go to a lucky few people who manage to get the parking spaces. When you add free parking, it increases the dwell time for those few people. And it also increases the amount of parking space that you have. So I wanted to talk about that. So I'm going to start with parking. So parking is a good way to increase the amount of time people circle and search for parking. So there's really good studies about this that anybody can look up. Feel free to contact me. I'd love to talk through this with anyone. Studies has found a 30% increase in searching time, driving around, looking for close parking when you increase the dwell time with free parking. When there's increased dwell time, that means there's fewer customers for businesses. The whole point of having parking is to increase the dwell time. So I'm going to start with parking. The whole point of having paid parking in a downtown is to have turnover. So you're giving people a chance to get to those close parking spaces. And the target that most, you know, anyone who's a parking professional that's worth their salt will tell you is an 85% occupancy rate. So there are one or maybe two spaces per block that are open. So somebody who's circling can get in and find parking spaces. This is a good way to increase the dwell time. So I'm going to start increases turnover, reduces frustration for people looking for parking. So there are some goals I would recommend. One way I think of it is to have tiers of parking. There's free parking in the outer zones, which we have a good supply of already. Then there's general parking, which is closer. And then there's sort of a premium parking, which is right in among the businesses that turns over quickly so people can get in and out, find parking. If you are willing to pay for the extra parking, you can have the closer parking space. And all of that funds your needs for parking. So you need repairs, you need signs, you need maintenance, you need painting, striping, et cetera. So one interesting anecdote that I wanted to add about this is I've seen the celebrated author. David Sedaris and Laxon Hall twice. Last time I went to see him, someone asked him what his favorite thing about Chico was, what he liked about coming here, because he comes here quite often. He said what we have here is a downtown that still feels like a downtown. That's time. Thank you, Jesse. Thank you. Bruce McLean, followed by Leanne Powell. Hi. I wouldn't have chosen to come and speak in favor of free parking after the expert has just spoken against free parking, but I had no choice. During the 90s, I spent a lot of time working with downtown businesses because I worked at the Chico News and Review newspapers as sales representative, and our advertising base was downtown. So I was very interested in how to promote their businesses downtown. And I do remember when I was a kid, I used to go to the Chico News and Review newspapers to podem effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively! effectively effectively I remember hearing about a jeweler, a notorious jeweler, who used to like to park right in front of her establishment. She's no longer in business. And that she was a reason many people wanted to continue the paid parking. There were a lot of other reasons. But I know that in another job that I had selling outdoor advertising from Yuba City up to the Oregon border, that Chico is the only town that requires paid parking downtown. Now, I've seen recently, take that back, Redding has added in, but not in their central core. It's in their periphery of downtown that they have parking. Okay. If you've ever gotten a parking ticket downtown, you kind of feel like you've been punished for coming downtown. And that punishment remains in the back of your mind. It's not a pleasant thing. It's not the money, but it's the whole process. You don't pay to park anywhere else in town. And I would be very supportive of having free parking downtown, period. I don't know how much it costs to collect the money. I don't know how important. That element is. But I think having a robust and prosperous downtown that doesn't penalize its customers by charging money and occasionally also having to pay parking tickets. Thank you. Thank you. Leanne Powell. Leanne Powell. My name is Leanne Powell. And I own a business downtown. And I just want to say that I am appalled that anyone would think that an hour of free parking is, I guess I'm saying that wrong. I guess what I'm saying is I agree with Tom over here. We do need an hour of free parking. I have a kiosk outside of my business. And I will tell you that I get to help people on a. I have a weekly basis on how to navigate the kiosk. And I know for a lot of you it's not a big deal. It really isn't. But we have a lot of people that come downtown and there's a massive anxiety over the parking kiosk. And so, like I said, I get to go outside my door quite frequently. And I will. I would say nine times out of ten, I will actually put their license plate on my app and I will pay for their parking. Whether or not they're going to be shopping in my business or not. Just because they're so anxious. And then sometimes I'll walk them through. And I'll show them the actual kiosk and show them how to do their credit card and all of that stuff. So, anyway. And some of those people, they only want to come in for an hour. Maybe to my shop or run across the street and get some pizza or whatever it is that they need. So, that hour would just be amazing for people to come downtown to not have to deal with the kiosk and all of the anxiety that comes with that. And I will tell you, I see it on a weekly basis. So, I am a huge advocate and support Tom. And I think that effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively Before you sit down, you may change your opinion of me after this, but the people parking would still have to use the kiosk. Otherwise, we can't enforce the time. I get that. I get that. I just think that the one hour would just be super helpful. I mean, it just really, really would be. I have a lot of customers that come in and they want to shop for a gift and whatnot, and they don't even need a full hour. But I just, yeah, I'm not opposed. Well, I am opposed to the kiosk. That's a whole other story. But anyway, we're not addressing that. But I love your idea, and thank you so much. All right. Is that our final? She was our last speaker. All right. Any council member comments after? Ms. Goldstein? Okay. One thing that I heard that I really liked from one of the public commenters was the idea of a tiered structure. And I will admit I'm not the most familiar with how our current parking fee structure looks. I know we have the timing difference, but I don't know if the fee is different in those different zones. Maybe a staff member could elaborate if we do have a tiered fee structure currently. Sorry to be on the spot, Brendan. Yeah, no problem. Yes, we do currently have a tiered rate structure. The premium downtown parking zone is $1 per hour, and then the non-premium, the quote-unquote economy lots are $0.50 per hour. That was based off of previous parking management plan updates and the 85% occupancy rate concept. Okay. Thank you. One thing that I've heard from talking with constituents is that, and from my personal knowledge, is the areas like 2nd Street, 3rd Street, Main Broadway, right in the core of downtown are so impacted full all of the time, it doesn't seem that there's a lack of people going there and driving. Right? We're not going to have a lot of people going there, but we need to manage the parking better. Whereas the areas more towards Salem and Wall Street or just towards the plaza, you'll see a lot more open spaces. And it seems as though we could be encouraging people to park in those spaces. So if we were to pursue this, I would really want to make sure that we're not going to further congest parking in the core of downtown and focus more on the areas to the edge or maybe like the parking lots and garages. So that's my... I would consider first hour free in those areas. Council Member Winslow. Yeah. So the point of managing parking is about rationing it, right? And the question comes down to not like should we help business, but like how is the park, what parking structure is best for business? And we're used to people complaining about paying for parking because right now you have to pay for parking. If we were to have one hour free, the other question is will we, it would be so hard to find a parking space that people will have to drive for longer and then people will have to drive somewhere else and they have to walk for longer. And then what's more of a deterrent? Is it paying for parking or is it having to walk further away from further away? And I think that it wasn't apparently really bad to do it in December. That's a good sign. I mean, it's kind of a sign of like downtown's not that popular if parking is free and it's not a huge issue. That means you don't have that many people coming downtown. But if we're in that sweet spot right now, then maybe it's a good idea. We might find that business booms in a few years and then we do have more of a rationing issue and we actually want to return to... We might have to pay for parking if we were to explore this. In any case, I think that like a little more analysis from staff is needed and I think we're at the right place to request it and then consider it a little further down the line. Council Member O'Brien. So I don't mind waiting until maybe we get the sales tax revenue back from December comparing this past December to the year previous. I think there's probably some wisdom in doing that. But I'm hearing from the businesses downtown, from the DCBA, they want this. That tells me something. So from that standpoint, I would... I would support it. And speaking to your comment, Leanne, I almost ran on an anti-kiosk platform when I ran for council. I thought it would be very popular because I know a lot of people who are not happy with those. I get that. But I think maybe waiting until we get that sales tax revenue report back might be prudent and then I would support that. All right. Vice Mayor Bennett. So... So... I'm going to listen to the business people downtown, the DCBA. It was very successful over the Christmas season and I would certainly endorse and support another experiment as Mr. Overbeck, Councilor Overbeck, suggested. I think it's time we support downtown. We can do whatever we can to help support and encourage business activity downtown. So I definitely would support this. Mr. Van Overbeck. I did really like the idea of a trial period that one of the business owners talked about. But I do want to recognize that correlation doesn't always equal causation. Of course, there was a huge increase in sales during the holiday period because it's the holiday period. And I think every store, no matter where they're located, experiences that increase. And we also have to consider that was during a time where... The entire student population was out of town, therefore also not taking up that parking availability. So I do want to be really cautious of the risks included. As one speaker said, a lowered turnover and increased time scanning for parking. And risks also include students parking there for, yes, a 50-minute class. I know it sounds ridiculous, but I was a student somewhat recently. And that did happen. And I think it does happen quite frequently. With that being said, I must recognize that generational gap in using the parking systems. It does exist. And the business owners lived experience. So I would definitely be in favor of a trial period. Mr. Van Overbeck. Your turn. could I address a couple of comments that people made? Let me start with Ms. Hawley. So we can put this in place and at any time we can undo it. Anytime the council decides. So we could say let's do it for a year or six months. But we can always undo it. So I don't know why we should set a trial period. But I'll go with the rest of the council. Ms. Gold... Councilperson Goldstein, I want to address a couple of her things. So I spent a lot of time with this whole parking issue. And I'm misfortunate enough to actually have read some books on it. I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to answer that. I'll read the first one. So the first comment was concerned about the turnover. So remember we have an hour that' s free. Whether you pay for that first hour or it' s free for the first hour, it' s not going to impact the turnover. If it were just free, then it would impact the turnover. People wouldn' t have an incentive to leave after the first hour. The way parking, so the reason people have time limits and fees is to get those spaces to turn over. So the problem we have in downtown is that not enough people are going downtown. And yes, between about 11 o'clock, 10.30, 11 o'clock and 5 o'clock, that 10 block core is fully parked. It' s 85% parked. That' s the definition of fully parked. But as soon as you get a couple blocks away from downtown, you get a couple blocks away, as you mentioned, in wall or salem, there' s plenty of parking. When you get outside that 10 block core, it' s only 40% parked, even during those peak periods of time. This is the parking study that was done in 2019. So yes, people will either decide I' m going to walk two blocks, which is how far you have to walk if you went to the mall, or I' m going to keep driving around and hope I get lucky. But I think we need to do something to show downtown that we support them. There' s a lot of enthusiasm. I was at that meeting this morning. There was universal enthusiasm for doing this. And I hope I can convince the rest of you to go along with it. council member winslow, go ahead. can I ask you a technical question? Why would people still have to use the kiosk? We did like the 15-minute grace period originally or something like that whenever we installed it because we knew it takes people a second to get to the kiosk. there' s a grace period. effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively if you' re there after an hour and you haven' t paid you' re going to get dinged. they have to know you' re there and they have to know you' re longer than you' re supposed to be. can you elaborate on that? on which part? if they have to be hit twice in order to get a ticket is it a requirement in order to people use the kiosk? I think that' s part of the nuance of this type of request. it' s not an exact science to that point using license plate reader technology essentially the first time it passes by it' s a virtual chalking of that vehicle based on its license plate. as folks know the circulation time of the parking enforcement ranges from 30 to 60 minutes. we coordinate and manage parking for the city and the engineering department but obviously we have onm as the collections aspect and work through the police department with the parking enforcement. we coordinate with them that circulation time again can range from 30 to 60 minutes and depending on if they' re getting out issuing tickets citations that type of thing. it could be up to 60 minutes where that first virtual chalking even occurs. the second time around where that one hour has been exceeded now you' re just up to maybe two hours is really that one hour of free parking. we do have limitations with our software of two forms of software one is our ips technology which is the smart meters and the kiosks and we use the passport for the app. our technology ips is limited in what it can do it' s not capable of issuing one hour free parking whereas the passport app does have that capability. we have a lot of limitations in the logistics of our software program. I might recommend if the council wants to consider this rather than doing maybe a one hour free parking use the time restriction of the two hour parking as the concept of enforcement to create turnover. therefore it would just be free parking. that way it' s just using simply the virtual chalking and the lpr technology for the enforcement not necessarily the rate paying. there would be a lot of limitations in the logistics and communicating to the public of signage and how that one hour free works. so I think there would be some logistical concerns in that aspect. I will say in terms of revenues for the premium downtown parking that represents 43% of our revenues in the downtown. that pays for our operational costs. the parking fund has been operating in the red the last several years depleting the reserves in the account. we have a lot of we have a lot of revenue in the downtown. that 43% equates even this was 2024 numbers. with one month free parking in the downtown this past Christmas. with that in the account it was $356,000 in revenue for that downtown premium parking zone. from a fiscal standpoint there would likely have to be back fill of those lost revenues in order to cover our operational costs. I' m quick. I have a quick question. I haven' t gone yet. with having 14,000 students taking class one block away that' s my biggest concern. but are we asking for it sounds like we really need a staff report back on this. I don' t think that we need to know the capability of it. can we do this and come back with recommendations. I think we really need to understand the financial impact of this before we can so are you asking us to pass this tonight or to have staff bring a report back on this. I' m going to ask the staff to come back with the financial impacts and also the operational impacts of enacting one hour free parking in the two hour zone downtown. I' ll second that. all right. first and second. council member goldstein. aye. council member holly. yes. council member o'brien. yes. council member van overbeck. yes. council member winslow. yes. vice mayor bennet. yes. mayor reynolds. aye. we have to take a quick break and be back shortly. let' s come back up and bring her back in and bring her down. all right. item number 5.3. council van overbeck. your request for a potential emergency ordinance. okay. thank you. thank you. so again I was down in southern california last week. people were really traumatized by the fires. driving back thinking about what are the scenarios likely scenarios that could cause a really catastrophic fire. so there' s no secret that homeless people start campfires. you know for the reasons that when I go camping in the mountains I start a fire to warm up and cook. but they' re starting them in places that with dry vegetation. not dry right now but will dry in a few months. and the particular concern are areas like bidwell park, behind tichert ponds and especially lindo channel that are surrounded by houses. so you get somebody that starts a fire for whatever reason spreads to the neighboring vegetation. and luckily it hasn' t happened yet. but it' s a matter of time before it gets to the houses nearby if we have a windy day and we have a real problem. so I thought maybe I' m being alarmist so I bought the fire chief a lunch and said tell me what you think about this. tell me what you told me. tell us what you told me. we had a fire fire yesterday. well that was yesterday. I almost forgot. I am in favor of anything that will help us reduce the risk of wildfires. and there are certainly areas within the heart of the city that are much more receptive to that kind of activity. I was with when the judge newman came out did the tour of the city. I had asked him point blank when we were in lendo channel. and we were next to an encampment and asked him if we could enforce what were the parameters for us to enforce on the heels of the dixie fire just blowing up. and unfortunately his response was nothing. and that' s unfortunate because we do have a lot of activity that happens in some of our waterways and park areas that are susceptible to that. and in those areas that are I would absolutely endorse and be in favor of limiting if not eradicating any type of activity in those areas in particular living conditions that would contribute to open flames and potential fires escaping from the warming and cooking fires. so one of the questions I asked you is how often this happened and how many fires you put out last year and as I recall you said the fire department was called 40 times for fires that were caused by transients. it' s been a significant number. it' s about that number but I' d have to get the 2024 numbers for you to be accurate. but we' ve increased the number of fires related to encampments significantly over the last four or five years and I' ve provided that information to the council members in previous years so I can update that and get it over to you but yes quite a few. so the number one responsibility all of us sitting up here have is to provide for the safety of this town. that is the number one responsibility and in my judgment this is a huge threat. we' re still governed by the settlement agreement at least for now. and so in looking through the city code section 2.68.30 gives the mayor the authority to declare an emergency. and so right now we don' t have an emergency. the only emergency we have is potential flooding but in three or four months things are going to dry out. we' re going to have dry vegetation. we' re going to have homeless people building fires and if we have any sort of compromising conditions like wind we' re going to have a big problem. so I would like to ask the city attorney to give us a report on whether this is something that we can do as a council to give the mayor authority to declare an emergency. sure thank you council member van overbeck. mayor city council after the request from council last week I did do some research on this issue just to provide context regarding the authority and where this authority comes from what does it really mean to declare it and what limitations are on these authorities. so basically as council member van overbeck said the mayor or the city manager as director of emergency services may declare a local emergency. so what is a local emergency? it' s the existence of an emergency within the city and the conditions of which or are likely to be beyond the control of the service personnel equipment facilities and resources of the city. so what does it allow you to do if it' s declared depending on the facts of the situation an emergency can be declared. what it does allow is it allows the city to promulgate orders and regulations necessary to protect life and property. our code has a reference to curfews and designated boundaries that' s what' s listed in our ordinance. it also allows the city to receive and provide mutual aid and assistance and it also suspends procedures and contracting and expenditures in response to the emergency activities. what is notable is the timing and duration of the declaration of local emergency. the initial declaration if it' s done by the mayor or the city manager can only last up to seven days unless it' s extended by the city council. if the city council were to extend it then we have to reconsider the need for the declaration at least once every 60 days thereafter. so our code also prohibits once it' s declared individuals and people are not allowed to or forbidden prohibited by any lawful emergency services rules or regulations you cannot violate those you cannot obstruct or hinder or delay any member of the city' s emergency service organization during the local emergency. if there are violations of the emergency regulations that' s a misdemeanor punishable by county jail for a period not exceeding 12 months or a $1,000 fine or by both. the big question is with respect to having the war and settlement in place and also the question that was originally posed which is can we prohibit and ban camping. there is significant overlap between what' s being proposed and what is currently contained in the war and settlement agreement. currently there' s no case law that really deals with the review of emergency authority versus an existing settlement agreement in light of the fact that there is significant overlap but you have emergency findings. the law is not clear on that. as you know the settlement agreement currently requires the city in order to enforce its anti camping ordinances it has to go through that 17 day noticing process in order to enforce any of those anti camping ordinances. what that includes is camping, storage of property in public places, property removal, camping, entering and remaining in waterways and lodging in any building structure or vehicle pursuant to the penal code. it also has provisions that talks about analogous provisions to the local or state law. to the extent that there' s a direct conflict between any of our emergency regulations and the settlement agreement that issue will likely be resolved in court. however the protection of public health, welfare and safety though through a temporary legal local emergency powers is definitely a considerable public interest that I believe needs to be weighed in light of the settlement agreement. so that is a legal issue that eventually the court will have to decide whether emergency local powers trump the settlement agreement terms especially if it' s only for a temporary duration. can I clarify a point? I' m only talking about banning camping in areas that present extremely high fire risk. this isn' t a blanket ban on camping it' s in areas with extremely high fire risk. correct thank you. to that extent it would still apply just because we have a city wide the settlement agreement is city wide so in those sections of the city that would need to be declared an emergency it would still overlap with the settlement agreement. so what the emergency services authority still allows the council and the mayor to do it still may enact any new laws that are not directly covered by the settlement agreement in addition the city can also enforce its existing laws that are not covered under the anti camping ordinances there are provisions in our code relating to fires starting fires or having fires in certain areas of parks greenways or open space which currently is prohibited that' s not covered under the settlement agreement terms under the anti camping. so we could emergency regulations could add on top of that and provide an urgency and immediately begin enforcement of that under that authority it' s not covered. there are other provisions in our existing code relating to rubbish and garbage and other things that are not covered under the settlement agreement. the city has to be considered for enforcement whether it' s through the emergency declaration or outside. however I did want to note the limitations on your power it is limited to seven days and then requires council to extend it and presumably make additional findings that the emergency is existing at that time. thank you. thank you. are there any council member questions for mr. van overbeck before we take public comment? I' m guessing. how many speakers do we have miss preston? I believe we have let me see it' s not going 16 two minutes each okay I' ll call the first two speakers and then we will I' m going to call the first two speakers and then we will move to the next speaker. first yes to 5.3 it' s a small start. I was going to share a nonpartisan experience of living near the park with encampments across the street overflowing with trash, daily fires violence, damage to our park and the lack of public safety due to homeless and other social distancing. I am going to get political because what we have is an extreme difference in philosophy ruining a once beautiful community. some conservative members may be ready to act boldly. I wish we had some old school liberal members as they would be bold too. we have a few extreme leftists who advocate for the rights of less than half of 1% of chico to supersede the rights of 99.5% of us. the dems literally have had a majority in california since 1996. many of those years a super majority. ask yourself to address homelessness why haven't they advocated for the feds to add lots more section 8 vouchers or create a similar state program. why not fund and build 24-7 sobering centers long-term mental health and substance and alcohol abuse recovery residential treatment facilities. well it' s because the homeless pays their buddies and their buddies donate back to them. it pays MPOs, NGOs and allows billions to go unaccounted for on our homeless and their families. effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively have something to say that you should heed. And since the federal judge hasn't ruled, I say let's buck up and maybe take a penalty of a few million to save millions. Thank you. I'm going to use customers in the chat room first, please. Thank you. Oh, buck up. Okay. Mrs. Garcia, followed by Kim Dietz. Sorry, my ears. I got a cold. Hi. I vote, I hope the city council votes yes on 5.3. Thank you to the police, first responders, and to the council members that still have common sense. There are several that don't, and I don't know how you got there. But anyway, losses happen when the leaders don't protect law-abiding, tax-paying citizens. Making excuses for the law-abiding citizens is a mistake. The homeless that break the law and don't follow rules, costing the city money, playing whack-a-mole, is insanity. This, you can give five hours of free parking, and until you get the homeless under control, nobody wants to come downtown. And that's a shame. The poor people that have businesses down here. I want to ride my bike in the park. I can't do it because there's people with pit bulls that chase after you. It's ridiculous. I'm appalled at what has happened when I called my person that is in my district, and they did not call me back. I gave them many phone calls, and finally they called me back after I confronted one of their friends. This is sad that he doesn't take this serious, and I just really think that we need to do something about it. I'm appalled at what has happened when I called my person that is in my district, and I just really think that we need to do something about getting that homeless under control. This is affecting the people that pay taxes, the people that want to enjoy the park, the families that want to come downtown that don't want their kids exposed to what's going on. If you just get it taken control in the parks and the fireplaces and downtown, you'll be doing something. So please, try and come to some kind of a conclusion to do your job. And as far as you, Mr. Winslow, you're very distant. That's time. Thank you. Thank you. Kim Deeds, followed by Tracy Vincent. Hi. My name is Kim Deeds, and I have been a resident of Chico since 1982. I'm a graduate of Chico State University and the owner of several small residential rentals. Additionally, I volunteer on the city's CDBG CAC committee as my way to give back to the community. I have owned a home on Vallambrosia Avenue since 2011 and have seen the dangers of Bidwell Park fires. In 2021, I stood before the city council telling you about a transient fire that burned directly in front of my home. I called 911, and it took over 30 minutes for the fire department to get to the fire due to the terrain and to the lack of entrance into the city park. I'm a resident of Chico State University and I have owned a home on Vallambrosia Avenue fire that burned directly in front of my home. If it had been windy that day, we would have had a major catastrophe. Given the high fire risk in the park, I've taken significant proactive measures to make my home as fire resistant as possible. I know that it is not a question of if the park will catch fire, but when. Therefore, I believe that the city has a duty to its taxpayers residing near the park to enforce a no camping measure to minimize fire risk. I support the emergency no camping measure and urge the city council to vote yes on it immediately. We don't need to wait until summer. The safety of my home and my family is at risk if this measure is not passed. I also request that the city council consider no overnight parking on the Vallambrosia side of the park. This would help minimize the campers that go in late in the evenings. I also want to tell you right now that I've lost insurance on three of my home. I've lost my home and I've lost my home. I've lost my rentals last summer or last year and today I got a notice from my insurance agent that another rental is at risk. Insurance has doubled and I was told that they're not issuing policies in Chico right now. If your house is over 1960, built in the 60s, they're not issuing policies. None. So we need to be proactive. Thank you. Thank you. Tracy Vincent followed by Ryan McCollin. McMullen, sorry. Thank you. Hello again. So obviously I think we are all on the same page or at least the book is open and we are each covering the same page. Everybody here tonight is correct. Everybody. The homeless people each have an individual story. I have all this stuff. I can't read. Every one of them is different. So everybody in this room is correct. And all of these people need to be addressed individually. What I think would be great, I don't know if it's possible. I don't know exactly how we do it. Open town hall meeting. Everybody there. The resources that help these people. Us. Everybody there. I'm not going to point fingers at you. This is an us. This is an us problem. This is our entire city. These people need help. Period. Basic Maslow's hierarchy of needs. If they need a ticket home, we send them home. If they need medical, mental health. podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem We get them that. If they are clean and sober, we have some sort of, this is a big picture thing, can't say it all in two minutes. Big picture thing, clean and sober, you need a place to live. I will give you a room. You can mark my words on that. We need a governing body to help control this. Everybody in this room is correct. These people need help. I will help. We need to do this together, though. The pointing fingers, the taking sides, I've seen it all. I've read it all this week. This is not a sides thing. This is an everybody thing. I don't know how we could do it, but I would really like us to see if we could do a town hall meeting and bring everybody together to actually fix the problem. Because all this other stuff will be on the side. We need to work together to do this. Thank you. Ryan McMullen, followed by Chris Vogelman. Mayor and council members, thank you. I wrote something down. I think I'll fly off the cuff, though. Since I heard a lot of new information. I'm not sure whether the emergency ordinance is going to work. Here's some thoughts flying back and forth. I do request that we figure something out. My wife and I bought a home that directly borders Tigard Ponds last February. I feel duped. We bought that home after clear outs had already happened. We walked around the ponds and the bike path. We thought this is a safe neighborhood. It is not. Months later, tents start rolling in. My wife, who is a campfire survivor, she was a teacher at an elementary school in Paradise, evacuated children, fled Paradise in flames. And now we are living in a home where three months ago I called in a fire in Tigard Ponds. Fire department came out and they said it's a warming fire. We can ask them to put it out. And there's really no further action. This is a problem. Every single day she's looking over at the ponds. Our 10-month-old son is at home. We're walking the neighborhood. A month ago we were almost attacked by two dogs. This is a major safety concern. And this needs to be at the forefront of what you all are thinking about, however you decide to come at this problem. Is it a fire risk? Is it a safety risk? Is it a property risk? I don't know. That's your job. You're our elected officials. I will note I find it comical. I took a photo of this. Right at the entrance of Tigard Ponds there's a sign put up by the City of Chico that says, welcome. Protect your parks and greenways. Follow all regulations. No smoking. No camping. No alcohol or glass containers. No fires and dogs on a leash. Every single one of those is being violated. Please do something about this. Thank you. Chris Volgemann followed by Nolan Lupp. I'll go first. I will turn it over to the good evening council. I am chico local came here in 1965 with my family in 1984 class of pleasant valley high school and a resident of heritage oaks which is ryan's neighborhood. There are at least 20 to 30 homes I would say that directly border the ponds that are right up to the ponds themselves. The heavy foliage the trees all of that. They are in direct fire risk. I may be a block or two away. But we have seen what happens. We have seen it all in L.A. recently and palisades. Yes there have been some warming fires. They get extinguished. The fire department comes out. We have had two fires in the last five years. We have had two major fires there in the last five years. Where the tents went up. The trees went up. There was a plume of smoke hundreds of feet into the sky. Had it been a windy day we would be the palisades. We are here talking about fire safety. That is where we are going to keep it. We can go on about the drug use. The trash that is flowing into the creek. The buckets of feces and everything else that is just horrendous down there. Clean it up time and time again. I have been on several cleaning exhibitions with environmental and other agencies. I have even cleaned up places encampments on my very own with my pickup truck and load the back of a half ton pickup with garbage from one site. Not multiple. It is a festering mess. It needs to be taken care of. Thank you very much for your time. Thank you. Nolan Lepp followed by Michael Buchanan. Good evening council. It has been a while since I have been here. Echoing quite literally what everybody else has said. I bought my house over by Tiger Ponds about five years ago. Just like someone before me had said I feel a little duped. Now I bought it before this whole thing kind of went south. But it is a little different. My wife used to run on the ponds. I used to ride my bike through there. I thought it was a really nice place. I am not going to get into everything that is down there. We all know. We are focused on fires. Besides coming out of work in Merriam Park a couple of years ago and seeing this giant black plume of smoke directly where my house is. Yeah, that was a little disheartening. And then to see it happen again a year later after we cleaned them out. They weren't allowed back. And then they cleaned them out. And then they came back again. This is a clean on number five. In case anybody is counting. We all are. So this is becoming a huge fire safety issue. Obviously there is a ton of foliage around there. It is not just Tiger Ponds. Councilman Tom has got a very good idea of what he wants to do. I feel like there is a very good way to do it. Um. Yeah. As far as fire safety goes. I paid a lot of money for my house. I worked hard to pay a lot of money for my house. I am a proud owner of my house. I don't want to see it burned down by somebody that doesn't contribute. Doesn't take the shelter space that is provided. And decides to start a warming fire in their multi-story? King Campment that was there? It was impressive. And to watch everything that I have worked hard for go up in flames just because we are not willing to take action. It is a kind of disheartening as a citizen and a taxpayer. Thank you. Michael Buchanan followed by Mike Johnson. Good evening. Thanks for having me back up here. I am going to sound like a broken record. I live in Heritage Oak subdivision. I live on a road called Rose River. There is about four of us. Our home is directly to the pond. So it is our house, the road, and then the pond. There is about 20 to 30 yards between the road and the pond. That is the actual water. That 20 or 30 yards is filled with fallen trees, bushes, all kinds of foliage. There is giant cottonwood trees and oak trees that are in there as well. We have had campers there since COVID. I can tell you all kinds of stories with that. My focus is the fire danger. One day I came home. It was just like late in spring. I noticed smoke coming from some of the bushes. I was kind of curious. There is a little path that goes down there. I walk over there. There is a naked man cooking something on an open fire. It looked like he had a little encampment. I didn't want to stick around. I went back up to the road. I called the fire department. They came out right away and put it out. Every summer as that all dries out and it is literally yards from our homes and that starts to dry out, I just worry about exploding propane tanks which happens periodically. Fires are left unintended because if those trees go up, that neighborhood is going to go up. Those trees can actually, if they fell, would actually hit our homes. That is how close they are. I worry about the fire danger, about having unintended fires there. I just request you consider that with the homeowners in that area. Thank you very much. Thank you. Mike Johnson followed by Ken Dixon. Good evening Madam Mayor. Council members, as the Chief of Staff mentioned earlier tonight, gaps in CFD's fire department response preparedness include the department's capacity to respond to emergencies, especially with shortages of firefighters and available engines during the hot summer months ahead, let alone if we have overlapping incidents. As Council Member Madovarek had noted, our ongoing homelessness crisis includes the risk of fires started in order to prepare food and keep warm overnight, especially so at Bidwell, Lindo Channel, Tigard Pond, across the rest of the city. It's a real problem. As you consider the Councilman's request to respond to emergency response times and into the weeks and months ahead, I would encourage the Council to keep in mind that making meaningful efforts to actually reduce homelessness would have a direct measurable improvement to our emergency response times, to the city's finances, and to the general improvements to the city's livability as a whole. Given the Chief's concerns tonight about available personnel and equipment for the summer ahead, and especially as those shortfalls are not going to be available to us by the summertime, for Chico to be making meaningful efforts to reduce homelessness itself, we would be reducing fire risk and freeing up our firefighters throughout the entire year. That's just some good old-fashioned common sense. Because homelessness response is one of the biggest drains on fire and police response across the city, I'm encouraging the Council to have city staff provide you with a straight-line, cost-benefit analysis of how many millions of dollars that the city would ultimately save, especially towards Chico Fire and Chico PD, by reducing homelessness itself. Remember, the city can create or allow more services than are required by the settlement agreement. For those who say this would somehow encourage people to choose homelessness, that's nonsense. Most people of sound mind and body would never choose that. And I hope that no one here tonight wants to see more homeless people living unchecked in those at-risk areas. As others have said tonight, all throughout the evening, how much response capacity and money would we save by reducing homelessness versus the exorbitant costs involved with the wildfires that we would prevent, and the ongoing expensive whack-a-mole of endless move-along enforcements? How about the expensive Chico Fire overdose responses that we have to continue to respond to if that sobering sentiment that the county provided to us opened up? We will continue to do our best to support the community and the community Thank you, everyone. Ken dixon followed by Eric chisler. Mayor reynolds, council members, manager sorenson, members of the staff, I guess I could say happy new year. Thank you, council members. There is no way I can put into two minutes my feelings and views and years of experience the success and failure our city has seen with regard to the unhoused. I know looking at you, it is probably as mind-boggling as it is to me. And then when I hear various opinions, homeowners with fire danger, it is overwhelming. I think it is a very important thing. I will write a letter because that is a much more effective way for me to put my thoughts together. But I do thank you for putting your energy into this. And I know it is a very, very challenging environment. But I just ask you to stay with it. The recent point in time census is my feeling. I was a volunteer for that day. I think the number is much, much smaller now. And it is becoming manageable. If we have 400 or 500 in the county, maybe we only have a couple of hundred kind of hardcore unhoused people, we need to find a way to get them off the streets into shelters. Tiny homes, some type of managed campground, additional shelters, small scale. So let us put our effort into that. And I appreciate everything you are doing. And I do appreciate even the people I couldn't hear because the microphone only works if you use it. Thank you. Eric Chisler followed by Leanne Powell. Good evening, council. My name is Eric Chisler and I am a case manager at safe space. In order to ensure our public spaces and parks are not used as a shelter of last resort, we need accessible alternatives that align with the reality of where people are at. The fact is not everyone can meet the qualifications for entry to some shelters. Not everyone has access to the same facilities as others. And that expands the social capacity to live in close quarters with others. Some aren't even capable of accessing our own extremely low barrier services for a variety of reasons. Which is why safe space supports shelter options and any additional shelter option that expands our capacity to get people off the streets and securely sheltered. As a case manager, one thing has become abundantly clear to me. The longer someone goes without stable shelter, the more hopeless and difficult to house they become. And I think that is the reason And if we want to see less people on the streets, we need to get more people into housing. That starts with getting them more stable than they currently are. For some, that next step is a house. For others, it's a congregate shelter. For some, it is simply being able to stay put. This is why safe space supports the work of the North State Shelter Team in establishing a managed campground. We have offered to extend our case management services to include such a campground. The ability to stay put and have online access to the services ongoing relationships with case management, vastly improves the likelihood of homeless individuals making it to the next step with housing. For many of the most chronically homeless, this will only happen in an environment they are accustomed to. And for many, that means a tent outside. If we want to do whatever it takes to get our streets and parks clean and safe, we need to make the path to housing as easy and realistic as possible. This is the real emergency. Thank you for your time. Leanne Powell, followed by Mike Bush. I just wanted to say thank you for your time and letting me come up here again. I just wanted to share a quick little I am very much think that this is a very good idea. Two weeks ago, I was driving along the channel. I live over on Filbert Avenue and I happened to see some leaves smoldering right there on the side of the road. I drove by and I thought, well, that's kind of weird. And so I turned back around. By the time I turned back around to the pile of smoldering leaves, it was fully engulfed in flames. I called 911. The fire department was on their way. But myself and multiple other people stopped. And we actually were able to get the fire out before the fire department got there. But it was right there along the channel and right there along 99. And the wind was pretty intense right there. The fire went through the chain link fence and started to get up onto the trees. Anyway, we were able to get it out before the fire department got there. But a gentleman that lived right across the road there, he came running over, an elderly gentleman. And he told me that he watched someone come up out of the channel and actually start the fire. He yelled at the gentleman to stop. The guy turned and laughed at him. And then he turned around and ran back into the channel. So he witnessed the entire, the whole thing. So it was an arson. It was on purpose. I'm just grateful that I was there to be able to help, you know, instigate and make it go away. But anyway, I think this is a great idea. We need to keep the channel cleaned out, Tiger Ponds and the park free from camping because it just takes a few minutes of a fire to start. And then boom, we're going to be the Palisades, we're going to be Paradise all over again. And we just, we don't need it. Thanks. Thank you. Mike Bush followed by JD DiGiovanni. Good evening. I have a short question and a long one. On the emergency side, is it possible that your power under emergency could affect the zoning of church properties so that churches could be a resource, their parking lots, that is, when you're moving people, when you have to move them, could you move into a church parking lot? The long term approach at that same idea is, and this goes to all the taxpayers here, churches don't pay any taxes. They haven't paid taxes since the year 325. It might be, just as the fireman said a little earlier, we've never seen homeless. We've never had to deal with this. Now we do. You keep whacking them, you keep doing this, and it just doesn't seem to be working. Maybe something different would. And that would be cities like yourselves and all others get together and make a rule that if you want to have your property exempt as a church, then you're going to have to help out with the homeless problem, and that means where like a big parking lot could take 10 tents or, I mean there's a lot of thinking along those lines, but it could well be that it's time for the Christian part of our government to step up and use the facilities that, incidentally, I pay taxes that they don't pay for the municipal services they enjoy. I want them to have to have homeless people in their parking lot or in their field if that's the case. I don't see why it can't be done, and I actually think it should be done, and that would pretty much solve a lot of problems. So for Mr. Lamb, that would be looking into whether or not the zoning could be, or a zoning thing could be dealt with. Time, thank you. Thank you. JD Diaz-Giovanni followed by Matt Tennis. Hi there. I'd just like to come out in support of agenda item 5.3, the emergency ordinance. Born and raised here in Chico. Parents lived here for 37 years in the same house across the street from the park. In the past six months since I've been back helping out family, there's been at least one fire that I know of that got out of control that we needed to call the fire department for. So I think this is a good idea. I think it's really important that we protect the park, a real cornerstone of what this community has to offer. And protect the folks who live across here. I think everyone who's stood up so far, have said it more articulately than I will tonight. But I'd like to just come out and voice my support for this idea. Thank you. Thank you. Matt Tennis followed by Miranda Beyer. Good evening and thank you for having this meeting and for all your service. Thank you Council Member Van Overbeck for bringing this issue forward. I spent a lot of time in the park and I have spent a lot of time on what my daughter calls the secret trails back in the brush and the weeds along the creek and so forth. There's a misunderstanding that fires that occur in Lower Bidwell Park are only warming fires or cooking fires. There's a huge category in addition to that that involves two things I can think of. One is drug related fires. I often see like discarded fires that look to me based on things that I'm seeing around them tin foil and so forth that there's sources of flame that have to do with consuming drugs. This goes on a lot in Bidwell Park. Another one this is what you see in the middle of the night when fires get called in which I've called fires in in the middle of the night before. But entertainment fires. I've seen groups of people in the park at night on hot summer nights just making bonfires just because. Council fire. I've seen fire rings impromptu down by Chico Creek. The homeless culture in my opinion largely is lawless. Just a lawless environment where people do things for a variety of reasons some of which arise from necessity as we've heard but some of which are because they absolutely have chosen to live this way. I think it's enjoyable and fun and somehow empowering. It poses a fire danger and if there's something that we can do to minimize that danger then we need to explore that. Thank you. Thank you. Our last speaker is Miranda Beyer. Good evening council. This is going to be a little bit off the cuff because I don't think I have time to go over everything I've written down. I believe it is our duty to protect life and property and I believe the lives of those struggling are included in that. The basic needs of people are food, water, shelter and sanitation. We can focus our energies on protecting people starting with the poorest of us. I don't believe fining or jailing people who cannot afford housing or the capacity to warm themselves is a solution. We can prevent fire risk by providing accessible cooking spaces and warmth. Fire concerns regarding drug use can be mitigated by simply providing rehabilitation to people that have no choice but to get their next hit. Shelter is not available for everybody. There's not enough room in our local shelters for all of the unhoused that we currently have. There are also barriers to entry and those with pets. Some of them a little bit more protective than others have the choice of either giving up their pets or going to a shelter to be put down or to stay on the streets with their beloved companions. This has been a health and safety issue for many years. I've seen feces on the streets working downtown and that is not the fault of those who need to pardon my language, take a dump because we all poop. I urge the council to walk a mile in the shoes of an unhoused person starting from the bottom. How would you become employed? Can you be employed without a residence? My experience is no you cannot. Rehabilitations from the streets is not a realistic goal for most unhoused people. I don't believe that we need to clean up our streets because the unhoused people aren't dirty from their own choice. Thank you. Thank you. That is it. All right. Council member comments. Mr. Winslow. I really want to commend council member Vento-Rick for the creativity that comes in this. I don't know if you were just leisurely reading the municipal code one evening and came upon this or where it came from but I think the idea that we don't have to do the same thing over and over again and we can look at some new tactics is really good. It is a complicated issue and the city has been focused on what is in effect through several ordinances, a blanket ban on camping throughout the city. We make it illegal everywhere, it becomes in effect legal anywhere and we have people prioritizing what is convenient for them and where to go. I think we have to prioritize some areas over others. I see a lot of other cities do it, even cities that are in settlement agreements and of some similar nature. They prioritize parks, near schools, bike paths, these are areas you don't have to leave open. Just like we don't let private property be places where encampments are established long term, we don't let them in the right of way where cars drive, that is never okay. It wouldn't last overnight in settlement agreement or no settlement agreement. I think we have to do this. I think it is important to recognize that the blanket ban on camping doesn't work when you don't have space for people, when people aren't going into shelters. Even when I started doing shelter outreach for safe space in March of 2020 and there were over 50 people camping in Comanche Creek at that time. You may not have seen them as much because they hid, there was more pressure to hide. The reality is when it is illegal to camp anywhere, people resort to places that are more out of sight. Where are those places in Chico? They are riparian areas in the dense vegetation where you have higher fire risk. Beyond fire risk, I would say even more reliable risk is flood. It comes every year. A lot of our parks are areas that naturally flood. We can predict this. We know it will come. The council does a clean up in advance of that with that in mind. I think we could be doing similar things. We had a lot of people camping there and we knew that floods were going to come. They closed it off for environmental rehabilitation. Then we had 12 inches of cake mud on the bike path. I think it is a great thing that people weren't camping there. That kind of nuance is what we need. Really for the last two years on council I have watched them be, this is a quote from sticking to the carcass of dead policy. We have not looked at improvising and changing our code really or looking at ordinance that will focus enforcement on areas that are not effectively effectively! effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively are preventing camping because as mentioned we have high fire risk we have high flooding risk we have environmentally sensitive areas i was on the beck board for years and have participated in many of those cleanups and i don't want to see illegal camping and trash in our parks i also believe that we need to have a very multi-faceted approach to that as some of our speakers brought up. I also like the idea that somebody brought up in theory of maybe there' s a way if we do this as an emergency ordinance that we can expand the idea of some of our partners like churches to provide services for unhoused people as part of our way of addressing this problem and i think we need to have a broader conversation on what else we can do besides just enforcement. Mr. Chair. thank you Madam Mayor. This is not about homelessness nor an end run around the settlement agreement it is about public safety. Our primary responsibility as representatives of our community is the safety of that community nothing I will say again nothing supersedes that responsibility. We support safety by supporting our police and fire departments. That support comes in the form of not only personnel and equipment but also policy. Good policy. I know all too well how important policy is. I will save that discussion for another time. This emergency ordinance is about good policy. from any kind of policy. We owe it to chief standards and the men and women of the chico fire department to give them every advantage in keeping our community safe from the danger these encampments represent in these vulnerable public spaces and neighborhoods. I do not want us a body tasked with the safety of our community to look back and ask ourselves what should we have done differently? That is not a good place to be. Just ask some of our colleagues in southern California. We can't control everything some events are outside our control. We can however mitigate this real threat with good policy. All our firefighters want is a fighting chance. They were given that with the bidwell mansion and the with the bidwell mansion and the fire. It was beyond their control nothing to do with them. It' s the time. Let' s give those firefighters a fighting chance by supporting this emergency ordinance. They and our community deserve that. council member holly. thank you miss mayor. In light or just in response to a lot of members. I think this is not only the political aisle but our lived experiences. I have partook in that moral crusade and I understand all of the points being made. This agenda item I do want to bring it back to what it is an emergency ordinance about safety and the fire risk that these parks bring. What really concerns me about this is what Mr. Lamb was discussing compliance with the settlement agreement. What did stick out to me is when he said that a local emergency would allow for mutual aid and assistance and I' m curious I' ve just never seen exactly how a local emergency looks like if we were to pursue this at a time where a severe fire risk is shown likely when it starts to dry up a little bit. We approve the agreement and I' m curious what the legal risk would look like if we were to do clearances without providing aid or assistance to people who are cleared. I don' t know if the council would like to give any insight or follow-up questions as well. mayor and council can I clarify one thing the mutual aid and assistance that refers to the city receiving aid from other legal risk is for providing aid to other public agencies if necessary. thank you for clarifying I didn' t quite understand that. vice mayor bennett. in my recent campaign one of the biggest issues that people were referring to constantly was fire and I' m district 3 lindo channel. It was a huge, huge fire. I was able to secure $300,000 to perform some fuel mitigation removal on a portion of lindo channel. I understand completely the fear of fire is paramount with the tragedies we' ve had here locally and the l.A. fires it' s just unbelievable what has happened. I will do everything I can within my powers to take whatever measures necessary to help make sure that the fire district to mitigate the potential, the possibility of a fire here in chico. I do support this to the greatest extent possible under the law. I' ll add that. Mr. van overrigg. I want to make a statement that this is in response to council person holly' s comments. We need to assume going to be able to do this but I don' t want to face a group of people and hear a joke in my district for example and say sorry your houses burned down but we were worried that california and other california legal services would object. That' s part of the world we live in. It will happen. We need to do this anyway. Are you ready for a motion? You haven' m ready. From what I' m hearing from Mr. Lamb at this point we do not have the need or the authority necessarily to form emergency. It' s pouring down outside. We don' t have an existential threat to fire today. We do have chico municipal code 12.18.230 on the laws on the books as of right now today that says it' s unlawful to make any fire at any point in any park in our city. Our city attorney clearly told us that we could enforce municipal codes that are on the books. If I was going to make a motion it would say to direct staff to work with the city attorney to operationalize a plan to use our existing municipal codes that we already have that says we can' t have fires and to enforce those and address unsafe and hazardous fires in our parks and enforce any other existing codes that are not currently being enforced. That' s the motion? you said if you were going to make a motion. that would be my motion. that is a motion. can I second that and throw in the dog off leash laws? wait a minute. I thought it was here. this was your item so if I missed anything please. right now and correct me if I' m wrong lieutenant pena too early to go to sleep. Seriously I' m sorry. m sorry. I had a conversation with the chief with chief Aldridge and they are citing people so they show up and say you can' t have a fire here. They put the fire out and the police leave and start the fire again. We' re already doing that. That' s not going to solve the problem is the first thing. The second thing is I' m not asking for a council for you to authorize you to declare an emergency now only to declare an emergency when the circumstances after you consult with the fire chief dictate that we have a danger. you have this in your back pocket. I have a sense that there is some impact to the motion you' re making in terms of focusing on these ordinances aside from the camping ban that people tend to associate with that but are not analogous to anti camping laws like dogs off leash and having fires which still evades me why those haven' t effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively and the fire chief and the in her judgment and the judgment of the fire chief we back up. In the judgment of the mayor hazardous fire conditions exist in bidwell park and pond and lindo channel. I will second that. just a quick legal thing do we need because the mayor can declare this emergency and the council has to validate within seven days that' s my understanding. I was going to say technically under ordinance it doesn' t require council approval to declare the initial seven day emergency declaration. I understand but we' re I think it' s important for us to put a stake in the ground and say this is where we' re going with this. We have a lot of freaked out people in our community that are worried about this. I concur with that thank you tom. I' mayor to re-state the code because you' re accepting what we have on our municipal code. maybe you should re-state the whole thing. it would be for the mayor to use the emergency powers that are already on the code as needed direct staff to work with the city attorney to operationalize a plan using our existing chico municipal codes that we have to enforce and address unsafe and hazardous fires in our parks along with any other existing codes not currently being enforced that can be. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . podem effectively the city manager report? I would like to take a second to give a shout out to our public works department for all the amazing work they did on bruce road. Bruce road is open and amazing. . they coordinated it the contractors did the work but thank you for coordinating all that and by the way thank you for the support. thank you. I will take a second. monthly financial report is received and filed and council member request does anybody have a council member request? I have one. building off the discussion we had earlier and some of the comments we had from our community I would like to agenda as a discussion on ordinances code changes and programs beyond enforcement that council member goldstein can you restate that please? sure and in the future we can workshop this but what I have written is I would like to agenda as a discussion on ordinances code changes and programs beyond enforcement that the city can use as tools for addressing homelessness. all right I have a motion and a second. council member goldstein. aye. council member holly. yes. council member o'brien. I will support the discussion but not anything until we get out from the settlement agreement but yes. council member van overbeck. yes. council member Winslow. yes. vice mayor Bennett. no. all right. we will adjourn to the city council meeting on February 18. thank you everybody. thank you.
