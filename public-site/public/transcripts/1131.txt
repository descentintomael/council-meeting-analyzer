 Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you, Mayor Coolidge, the  City Attorney, City Manager,  City staff met in closed session  with the Council on the listed agenda  items. No action was  taken,  and direction was given.  That concludes my closed session report.  All right, thank you very much.  Moving on to our presentation by Vera Mobility.  And welcome.  I think we have 15 minutes for the presentation.  Can you start, sir?  Mayor, members of council,  thank you for having us here this evening.  I'm here to talk a little bit about  the red light photo enforcement opportunities  for this city.  My name is Edward TJ.  I work for Vera Mobility.  I'm the director of client services.  I've been there and employed for about 17 years now.  My main focus is the state of California  where we have about 25 accounts.  A couple things to talk about with photo enforcement,  specifically to California.  It is violator funded,  meaning there is no upfront cost to the city.  The vendor, whoever is chosen,  would bear all the costs for any permitting,  any equipment,  installations,  any upfront costs.  We do offer end-to-end solution services.  What that means is that we supply the equipment,  we install the equipment.  Based on processing rules that are set up  by the police department,  we would process incidents before passing them over  to the police department for final determination.  Only law enforcement would make a determination  on whether or not a citation is issued.  If they choose to issue a citation,  we would handle printing and mailing as well.  Obviously, we have quite a bit of experience in California.  And then we have positive customer referrals,  which is how we do it.  which is how we do it.  And that's how we ended up here today.  A little bit about what we do.  So obviously in California,  red light photo enforcement  is the primary purpose.  There are other options that are available  in California for bus lane cameras.  If you have a city where you have bus lanes  or people who park in bus lanes,  we can actually put cameras on buses for that purpose.  We have license plate reader cameras.  So if the city wishes to have a license plate reader program,  we can help them with that as well.  And then should it ever become lawful in California,  our systems are ready for the use of cameras.  for speed enforcement.  for speed enforcement.  So it has that capability with the same equipment  So it has that capability with the same equipment  that is installed for red light.  It would just need to be turned on.  A little bit about us.  We are based in Mesa, Arizona.  We have 1,500 employees globally.  We have been in business for about 25 years.  We are also incorporated in California.  And we do have an office in Culver City.  That is where all the California processing,  printing and mailing is done.  So it's all done within state.  Just a quick map to kind of give you a little bit of oversight.  Just a quick map to kind of give you a little bit of oversight  of where we are at.  So there's about 25 states in the United States  that have photo enforcement that is lawful.  We are in all 25.  The most recent being Hawaii just went live last year.  It's a little bit hard to see on here.  But in California we have approximately 25 accounts.  Quite a few are in this area.  We have Sacramento.  We have Redding, Elk Grove, Citrus Heights.  If you go down to the Bay Area, we have Fremont,  Newark, Millbrae, San Francisco.  So again, we have a lot of experience  in this particular state.  So we know the laws and we want to make sure we have a good  program that meets all those laws to make sure that the  city has a successful program.  So a little bit about what happens with the end-to-end  services.  Starting with the event on the street,  there would be equipment installed.  And I'll show you some images of that in a second,  how the images would be captured.  An individual would run a red light.  We would capture three still images.  We would also have a 12-second video showing that incident  take place.  In the video you'd be able to see the red light as well as the  vehicle going through.  When that takes place, it's packaged up into a digitally  signatured photo.  We have a VPN package.  That package is downloaded to our servers via VPN connection  so they know it's not touched in between transfer.  When it gets to our servers, we check that digital signature to  make sure that everything is as it was when it took place at the  incident itself on the street.  If anything is touched, anything on the data bar,  on the image itself, it breaks that digital signature and the  incident is not used.  It then goes through a back office review process.  Before starting your program, we would sit down with the city and  the police department and determine how would you like  your program run.  We would talk about digital signature,  do you want to see squad cars, fire engines,  if there's a funeral procession, all the different criteria that  could come up.  We'll set up rules on what we should do for you to look to  make sure that the incidents we pass through to the police  department are what they wish to see.  The first individual is going to make sure that it meets that  criteria.  They're going to zoom in on the license plate,  zoom in on the driver of the vehicle,  and they're going to enter that license plate into a database so  we can pull up the registered owner information.  It then goes on to a second employee who does a second step  review.  They're going to verify employee number one did the  proper steps as far as making sure it's something the PD wants  to see.  They're then going to look at that registered owner  information.  They're going to look at the vehicle,  is the make, model, approximate year,  correct, color.  They're then going to look at the registered owner,  if it's male, female, is it an age,  gender match to the person behind the wheel.  Process that through.  If it meets all the criteria for the police department,  it will send over to the police department.  They log into our back office, which is where the incident is  currently located.  It's done through any web services, so it can be Apple,  Android, Mac computers, Edge.  Firefox, whatever you might have.  He or she would log into our system.  There is dual authentication, so the officer would have to  have not only their password, but they would have to have  secondary device, be it a phone, app,  something like that, so we know that it is that officer who  logged in.  He or she would look at the incident.  They're going to be able to see the data from the incident.  They're going to be able to see the images, the video,  and then he or she is going to make a determination if they  want a citation to be issued.  If he or she says a violation did not occur,  they can reject that incident.  It's taken out of the system.  There's no further processing.  If he or she does wish for a citation to be issued,  they can click approve.  It would then be processed further.  We would print and mail that citation.  It would be mailed to the registered owner.  We do that within 11 days, which meets California law.  When a violator receives that, they have some options.  They can pay.  They can request a hearing.  They can nominate another driver.  Maybe it wasn't them behind the wheel.  If so, they can go ahead and fill out that information to get  that citation taken out of their name.  There's also a 1-800 number.  That's us.  They can call our call.  They can call our call center.  If they have any questions on why they received the citation,  how the system works, what their options are,  that sort of thing, they can also go online.  There's a web page they can go to to see larger images.  They can watch their 12-second video.  There's facts and questions.  There's also a payment link.  In California, the courts are the only ones  who can collect payments.  So it would be a hyperlink to your court  so they can collect payment.  If they wish to go to court, they can always send  in that court hearing request.  Again, they would go to the court.  They would then have their day in court.  We would provide the officer  with a court package which would have all  the original evidence, the certificates for the site,  the video, the images, et cetera,  so the officer can defend that in court.  Finally, public relations support.  There's nothing to hide here.  We highly encourage cities to do like you are tonight,  have an open council meeting, and then go a step further.  Do you want to put something on your city's web page?  Here's all the locations where the cameras are at.  Here's basic information.  Make sure people know where they're at so they know  to slow down and stop.  That's the whole point of the program.  Something maybe on your social media page.  We can help you come up with information.  We can help you get information  We can help you get information as far as accident reduction,  near miss videos, just general information  on how the system works.  Anything that you're willing to put on your website,  we're happy to work with you to make sure we have  that information available.  On the right-hand side, this is what we call our Halo system.  This is what we use in California.  That's the name for the box.  In that box, you have those still cameras.  You have your video camera.  A 3D HD radar, which is how we detect the vehicles  that are approaching the violation line.  We have a 3, 4, 5 lane intersection.  We can detect each individual lane at the same time.  So if three people run a red light at the same time,  each individual would produce their own incident.  They would each have their own data,  so we know the vehicle speed, what lane they're in, et cetera.  We then have an LED flash.  It's a low light flash so we're not blinding other drivers.  It's just enough to illuminate the intersection  to get a decent photograph.  Again, up to six lanes of traffic.  For the face shot, we use up to a 45 megapixel camera  so you get a nice clear shot of the driver for processing.  This is a single pole connection with the radar.  We do not cut into the roadway.  We don't do any kind of intrusive installation.  So that way, if you were to come through and say do a mill  and overlay or widen lanes or restrict lanes or anything,  we don't have to come back out.  We can simply dial in and reprogram that radar.  So a little bit about how an incident takes place.  As a vehicle is approaching that violation line,  we need the light to be red.  The vehicle needs to be behind the violation line.  We would then take that first foot  and take a second photograph.  We'll take a second photograph of that vehicle  in the intersection, beyond the violation line,  with that light still red.  And then the third image is the image of the driver herself.  Again, there is a 12-second video.  There's also running, so you have six seconds  as you approach the violation line and six seconds after.  So we can see as the individual moving out of the way  of a fire engine, a squad car, something like that.  Is there a reason the individual made that motion  that they made as far as running the red light?  Also, should you choose to take a second photograph  of that resulted in resulted in resulted in resulted in  resulted in resulted in resulted in resulted in  resulted in resulted in  resulted in resulted in  resulted in resulted in  resulted in resulted in  resulted in  resulted in  resulted in  resulted in  resulted in  resulted in  resulted in  resulted in  resulted in  resulted in  resulted in  you're going to see a data bar at the top of the photograph. It is part of the photograph. It is  not added on later. It cannot be changed afterwards. At first, you're going to see our location code.  You'll then see the location in plain English. You have the date, time of the violation. Frame  number five means there was five violations since midnight for that site. Defending vehicle is lane  number three. Vehicle's traveling 32 miles per hour. The light has been red for 0.52 of a second,  and the amber time is 3.74. The amber time is the actual phase time for that particular cycle. It  is not hard-coded, so if that were high or low, the officer would see that and know that the amber  time has been fluctuated at that particular site. This image, what we're looking for is that white  SUV is behind the violation line with the light being red, and again, in the right-hand corner,  you can see we can pull a license plate from that image. Second image we're going to pull. Now,  the vehicle is beyond the violation line. The light has been red for 1.21 seconds, and again,  the amber time and everything stays the same. We would then take an image of the front of the  vehicle.  To show the driver, obviously, they wouldn't have a black box on their face, but for security reasons,  we put that over there. This is what he or she is, the officer, is going to use to identify that  driver. Then we're going to have that 12-second video. Go ahead. So we're going to have a 12-second  video. We're going to see the light go green, yellow. It'll turn red. The vehicle is going to  continue through the intersection, and the officer will be able to see if there's pedestrians on the  left side of the road, as well as cross traffic.  When the officer logs in, this is similar to what they're going to see. So they're going to see an  image of the license plate. They're going to have the driver, the scene A, the scene B. On the right-hand  side, they're going to have that data so that they can compare it to the images and to the data bar  to make sure that everything is correct. And again, the officer is the one who is making that  determination whether or not a citation should be sent out. The vendor cannot send out any kind of  notice without the officer's approval.  For Immobility Live, this is where, should the  license plate be sent out? No. It should be sent out by the officer. So we're going to have a  video that's going to be sent out. And if you go to the city of  Chuse, every intersection can have 24-7, 365 video. So that same video that we used for that 12-second  video, it's HD. It's continuously running. We can use that for dispatch or public transportation,  that sort of thing. It can also be used for further investigations. Let's say you had an individual  who went through a green light but caused a collision at an intersection. You can go back,  give us a date and time, go online. You can pull that down and download it yourself. You can email  it to an investigator, that sort of thing. If you were to have a crime that was committed and a  vehicle went through this intersection, if you know the approximate date and time, you can go in  and pull that video and give it to a neighboring jurisdiction or use it for your jurisdiction,  should you choose. If you do not want that turned on, you do not have to have it turned on.  California is pretty much standard. Everyone holds it for about 30 days and then you delete that out.  This is just a little bit about, it depends on your particular city and your procurement rules.  Your procurement would know how you can go about moving forward the contract, should you do so.  If you do not wish to go to RFP,  there's something called HGAC. You can hop on that. It's basically a procurement where you can go in and it's a co-op group that has already received RFPs from all the different vendors.  They can give you set pricing and vendor responses so you can pick a vendor off of there.  A little bit about that public awareness I was talking about. These are just some samples.  I've seen everything from doing HOA meetings, putting things on your social media, the city's web page,  even putting something in your water bill. Any city services, notice it goes out.  Again, we want the public to know where they're at. We want the public to know that they have a program.  In California, you will by law have a 30-day warning period when you first put an intersection in.  So it gives that a little bit of notice the first time someone commits a violation. If it's within 30 days,  they'll get a warning notice instead of a citation.  But this is just something that even before you start the program, get the word out. Let people know that it's going on.  IHS study, this is just a little bit about why we're here today.  Obviously you feel that you may have a red light running program or problem rather.  And this is what they've seen in other cities.  40% reduction red light running,  side impact collisions went down 68%, fatalities went down 21%.  And then the big one is the bottom for all signalized intersections went down 14%.  And that's what we call the halo effect.  Once you start putting in certain areas where you have photo enforcement,  a lot of people don't know exactly what intersection it's in or which direction of travel you're looking at.  So people just pay a little more attention and you start to see a reduction throughout the city.  Should you choose to go with the program?  Here's a couple of steps that a vendor would take.  First, they're going to go ahead and do some what we call pre-activation reports.  So we've already received some locations for you and we're working on some surveys.  What that tells you is one, could we even construct a system at that intersection?  Meaning does it have enough room in the right of way, that sort of thing for us to put equipment in?  Is there any obstructions, etc.?  And then we look at yellow light timing, average daily traffic counts, etc.  To see what's about 18 months after a system will put in.  How many violations would you see a day?  So you would take that data and you would compare it with the PD's crash stats  to kind of confirm each other that you do have an issue at that particular intersection  that's related to red light running.  Because some intersections may have an engineering issue or something like that  that's not related to red light running that you could also look at.  Should we choose to move forward with the location?  We'd go out there, we'd do drawings, we'd do construction plans,  we'd work with the subcontractors, we'd order equipment.  We handle all of that.  So we program everything, set up in the back office,  we get all the drawings, the subcontractors,  all the scheduling, we work with the city to see where do you want them put in first,  how many do you want to put in at a time, do you want it staggered, that sort of thing.  While we're doing that, we're going to work on your public awareness campaign.  Again, get the word out, let the city know that, you know, so the public's aware this is coming.  And then again, we pay all the upfront costs.  That 30-day warning period, there is no fee.  So that's where we're getting the word out to the individuals.  And then once the 30-day warning period is up, in California it has to be a flat fee.  So you cannot share revenue with a vendor or say, you know, more or less citations are issued,  affects how much the vendor receives.  It's just a flat amount to the vendor, whether it's one citation or a thousand citations.  For California, everything is issued under 21-453.  It is the same as a police officer pulling you over.  So you do receive points on your license, it is reported to insurance,  it is the same fine amount as a police officer pulling you over.  It is legislated in California, 21-455.5.  What that means is these are the criteria that a city must follow in order to have a program.  You have to have warning signs within two weeks.  You have to have a 30-day warning period for any new location.  You don't have to pay attention to 600 feet.  That's for cities that started before a particular year.  You do have to look at your yellow light timing.  Make sure it's certified either by your traffic engineer or an outside firm, whatever you use,  to make sure it's accurate before you start a program.  In California, it does not have to be a sworn officer who looks at the information  and determines whether or not a citation goes out.  It does have to be a city employee.  So it can be a CSO, a public health officer, a public health officer,  a retired officer, I think they're called 960 officers,  where you bring somebody back and let them work.  A couple of cities that currently use non-sworn, LA Metro, they're rather large.  Commerce, Montebello, Los Alamitos, Fremont, Rancho Cordova, Newark, Ventura, just to name a few.  So there's some up in this area and the courts are used to that process where a non-sworn is coming in.  Other special requirements, that's why we're here today, you have to have a public hearing.  So you have to let people know what's going on.  You have to have a public hearing where people are allowed to comment.  You're more than happy to have more than one night.  You can have a meeting where you bring this up.  If you were ever to go forward with a contract, I'm sure you'd bring that in front of council again  and allow people to make comments as well.  That's the gist of it.  I'm happy to answer any questions you may have, anything in particular.  If we don't have the information here today, I'll work forward to getting it for you.  All right, questions from council?  I'll start off with maybe a hard one.  A lot of cities have installed red light cameras and then removed them.  Why do you think that is?  About 90% I've dealt with.  That's the same as the city council.  The city council can change their mind.  There can be different political views on it.  Some people are for it.  Some are against it.  We have some cities, such as Modesto, where they had it to get rid of it,  and now they're looking to bring it back.  It depends on the time.  Times have changed a little bit in the last five years or so about people who look at law enforcement  and how it's done.  And it's hard to find police officers today.  So this is more of a force multiplier.  If you don't have enough officers who do traffic enforcement,  some cities are starting to look at it as a way to supplement that.  Kyle.  Would you clarify a point? First of all, thank you. Great presentation. Very informative.  You said that there's a flat fee per intersection. Is that right?  Yes, sir. So it's what we call per approach, so per direction of travel.  So if you were to, say, do first in Maine, northbound and southbound, there would be a fee for northbound, a fee for southbound.  And that's legislated by the state, you said?  Correct. It has to be a flat fee. We cannot do revenue share, and we can't be, they would call it incentivized, to issue more or less citations.  Thank you.  Mr. Bradd?  What is the average, I'm going to rephrase that, is there a required term of a contract with you, your company?  There's not a required term, but your pricing is going to vary.  So we need to obviously write off the cost of the equipment, because to give you an idea, to put something like this, it could cost us millions to put in a city.  So we usually look for five years as the average.  There is an out in most contracts, so usually there's a fee to buy payoff equipment or something like that if you want to cancel a contract early.  But if you're in a city, you're going to have to pay a fee.  But five years is kind of the average.  If you were to do less, it would probably just cost you a little bit more per month, because again, we're trying to write off the cost of equipment.  So it's a cancellation buyout?  Correct.  Compensation?  Yes.  Okay. Thank you.  Yeah, so what you described, the program services are end-to-end, you said?  Yes, sir.  Do you offer anything where the city could either purchase the equipment or run more of the services in-house?  Yes, sir. If you wish, for example, like in Canada, they buy the equipment.  I'm not aware of anyone in the United States who's currently buying it, but it's definitely an option.  Okay. Thank you.  All right. Further questions?  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  All right. Before we move on to our next presentation, I actually forgot our speaker card announcement.  So anyone wishing to address the council on any items listed on the agenda should first complete a speaker card,  which is in the back of the room there, and turn it to my left, to your right, up here at the city clerk.  And speakers will be taken in the order the cards are received.  And now we'll move on to item 1.  1.8, which is a presentation from economic development update from Jennifer McCarthy, deputy city manager.  Well.  Good evening, Mayor Coolidge, members of the council, Jennifer McCarthy, deputy city manager.  Appreciate being able to come before you today and talk a little bit about economic development  and the projects and the programs that we are working on with our partners for the community in the coming year.  So tonight you'll hear a little bit about Team Chico, Travel Chico,  the city's tourism program.  Visitor center, as well as the status of a shop local campaign.  So before I kick off, I wanted to give you just kind of a little breakdown of what is our businesses look like here in town.  We've got over 4000 different businesses within the city of Chico, the majority of which are small businesses.  As you can see, over 90% actually have 20 or fewer employees.  I thought I'd also provide a little bit of data that shows pre pandemic to where we are today.  You can see our unemployment rate.  It's very similar.  We've kind of had the ups and downs that most communities have being very on par with where the state of California has been.  I also think it's important to look at our labor force numbers, and this is something that includes those individuals that are currently working or actively working to find a job.  So we have seen a reduction in our labor force over the last couple of years, even though we have seen an increase in our population.  For those that are interested in data on the city of Chico's economic development website, we have a lot of information.  We have a lot of information on the state of California.  We do have a link to the California community place based data tool, which has a whole lot of information if anybody wants to dig in further.  So if you can go back to that last one, that's indicative of the state numbers, too, in terms of the decreasing.  That's right.  That's right.  That's right.  We are on par with basically the trends of the state.  So as you look at where we're headed from an unemployment perspective, we are really right on terms with the state.  And then in terms of labor force, what we've seen here, and I think we've seen in other communities, is people are really working hard.  They're making different choices.  It's more expensive, hard to find childcare.  People during COVID went through one person working at home, one person working at the office, and vice versa.  And some people just didn't go back.  So we are seeing what we're seeing in other communities as well.  But that being said, you hear from a lot of our businesses say it's hard to find labor.  So this kind of helps create some of that picture for you.  The first contract I'll talk a little bit about is T-Mobile.  This is Team Chico.  The agreement for 23-24 is for $49,000.  And our contractor is the Chico Chamber of Commerce.  To give you a little background, Team Chico is our economic development collaborative organization.  We have 11 partners that participate actively in this organization.  It was formed back in 2012.  And really our focus is to understand business needs and respond collaboratively.  When the pandemic hit, we had a lot of people who were not in the business community.  And we had to get really what we heard from businesses were we need money and we need people.  And those were the two big items that most businesses were faced with.  But as we're rearing out of the pandemic now, it's important that we look at our business community and we get a better understanding of what's working well, what do they need assistance with, what are some of the struggles that our Chico businesses are having.  So today Team Chico launched a business survey.  People can find a link to the business survey on the website.  They can find it on the City of Chico's homepage.  They can find it on all the City of Chico social media.  And they can also find it on the homepage of the Chico Chamber of Commerce.  Once we have the results back from the survey, it will really help to inform the details of how we're going to move forward with the specific scope of work that will be led by the Chico Chamber of Commerce.  But within that scope, we know that we will continue to work with business outreach where we're going out and we're meeting with businesses one on one to understand what their needs are and introduce them to the business community.  We'll include labor pool development, something that's always really important in our community, business retention, business resources, and certainly looking at what we can do to help with community branding moving forward.  Next I'll talk a little bit about the travel and tourism program, Travel Chico, that is just coming live in these last couple of days.  We have a 23-24 agreement in the amount of $40,000 to work with Explore Butte County on this project.  Before we get going, I wanted to give you a little bit of background.  You may remember that back in late 2021, the council allocated $250,000 in one-time American Rescue Plan funds to put together a travel and tourism program for the City of Chico.  The main goal of that program was to position Chico as a premier spot for travel and to increase overnight stays, which certainly will lead to economic growth in our community.  But as we're looking at it, there's some secondary benefits as well.  well. Certainly as a family travels to Chico with their students, they may see themselves as a future  wildcat one day. Or as a business comes into our area and is traveling and sees the quality of life  in Chico, they may move and think about how they could relocate or expand their business into our  community. So where we have those direct benefits and as far as increasing overnight stays, it's  also important to consider the long-term secondary benefits of this program as well.  We kicked off the planning for this program really with a group of stakeholders. We invited  over 80 stakeholders to come together and provide insight into what makes Chico special as a  destination. And that included hoteliers, it included members from the Mechoopda tribe, Chico  State was there, Chamber of Commerce, local businesses, event planners, and others. We had  really great conversation. And out of that was developed this brand,  Traveling Chico.  The brand pillars for Travel Chico include community, hospitality, ingenuity, culture, and outdoors.  Which coincidentally just happens to spell Chico.  Under that contract, there were several deliverables that were created through Explore Butte County.  And I know members of their team are here today and we really express our gratitude to Nicole Farley,  the director, John Pearson, the project developer, and their entire team.  They put together a website, which is live as of today, www.travelchico.com.  They put together a social media implementation plan for us, brand guidelines, several print pieces,  community map, and also a video, which if luck will hold we'll be able to see.  Well, that didn't run easy.  Okay.  So we're going to go ahead and get started.  resulted in resulted in resulted in resulted in  resulted in  resulted in  resulted in  resulted in [inaudible]  resulted in  resulted in  resulted in  resulted in  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Next, I'll talk a little bit about our visitor services agreement, and this is with the Chico Chamber of Commerce for $20,000.  The city has had an agreement with the Chamber of Commerce for several years to provide visitor services.  And in the past, it dealt a lot of mailing packets and maintaining brochures.  And as the world has changed, those services need to change as well.  So the chamber director and I, chamber president, Mike Egbert, and I spent some time talking about that scope of work and how we can move forward.  And really looking forward to doing a really good job together of helping connect visitors with information on our community.  So some of the scope of work that you see before you here is really involving professional tourism and support services.  So they will work to help as major events come into the area.  They'll help know what's happening with Chico State.  They will be the body that's helping to share out travel Chico programs as well.  Assisting with building ideas.  And they will be working with both Travel Chico and Explore Butte County on calendars.  So we're working towards hopefully having a calendar that shows all of the events in our community in one location.  Not through us, but through Explore Butte County.  And the chamber would help really put together some of that material for us.  So I know that President Mike Egbert is here, and we appreciate their partnership in this.  And finally, I'm just going to give you a little bit of a taste into the shop local.  So we have a lot of interest in this program.  This agreement, again, is $250,000 funded through one-time source of American Rescue Plan Act funds.  And the contractor here is Porter Co.  In 2021, the council allocated this $250,000 of the one-time funds to develop a shop local campaign.  There was a lot of interest in this program.  We had nine responses to the RFP.  Really competitive organizations, and Porter Co. was the agency that was selected.  We implemented a contract with them in June and just had a kickoff meeting with Chico State,  DCBA, the Chamber of Commerce, Explore Butte, and the city just back in last month.  And this talks about, this graphic here shows you many of the elements of that program.  So they will be putting together a toolkit to share with businesses.  This will be a free kit so that we can help businesses market their own business to locals here in town.  There will be some paid meetings.  There will be media that will be part of this.  Promotions, certainly.  A lot of partnerships in a social media campaign, as well as a website.  There's no way you're going to see this, so I will just tell you that we are in the process of kicking this off.  We will have a business meeting at the beginning of October where we share this with local businesses  so that they know how they can participate and shop local and hopefully expand their business as a result of this.  This is just an example of some of the graphics.  That were kind of thought of through this process.  With the it factor, Porter Co. was talking about Chico really has the it factor.  So getting it in Chico is an easy thing.  These are examples of how you can put some of that brand to life here.  So really in summary, the three main programs that we have this year are the Team Chico, Travel Chico, and the Visitor Center Program.  And as I talked about today, the success of these robust programs really has a lot to do with partnerships.  And for that, we have a lot of work to do.  We are incredibly thankful.  This is an example of some of those partners that we are working with.  And at that point, I'm happy to answer any questions you might have.  All right, questions?  I think it looks great.  Okay, thank you.  All right, we will move on to the consent agenda.  All matters listed under the consent agenda are to be considered routine in nature and therefore can be enacted in one motion.  I believe.  We had some notes on the meeting minutes or were those changed prior?  They weren't changed prior.  I didn't really expect that we would be changing the minutes last minute.  There was only a specific point about some order of operations with staff direction in that meeting on James Day.  I was just going to vote no on the minutes.  And then I talked to Ms. Thorsten about looking back at it later about what the specific direction was.  Okay.  Well, excuse me.  If you have a question about the minutes, I'm happy to go back and bring it up.  I'm happy to bring whatever.  Do you know what set those are?  Because I can bring it back and research it and do a verbatim.  Yeah, it's June 6th.  I sent an email and I cited the minute that had my motion in it.  Okay.  So why don't we pull that June 6th?  We'll pull that one out and then I'll bring it back.  I'd prefer that because if we vote them and we vote to approve them tonight, then they're approved.  That's better.  I think you're bringing it up.  Okay.  All right.  Do we have any public comment on the meeting?  We do.  We have one speaker, James Hutchinson.  All right.  Three minutes.  Okay.  This was item 2.1.  Okay.  Speaking about the Emerson neighborhood, I think it's important to note that the  first meeting was in the !  Park is only a small part of what was supposed to be done in that, for Miriam  Park in terms of the recreational facilities. I went out there cleaning up,  I cleaned up at 15 different occasions where I cleaned up after parties that I  take in place there. I didn't mind doing those, to tell you the truth, because a lot of  them were family get-togethers. You could see the paper plates. It wasn't a bunch  of beer bottles, cans, destruction. It was nice, they just didn't clean up when they  left. And there's a school right next to it, Little Chico Creek Elementary, okay,  with other facilities. Across the street from it, you have Murphy Commons, and you  have these new places coming in that I want to get into. But we've had this thing  about Miriam Park where we've backed off on the developing of the Little Chico  Creek area, real development of the little Chico Creek area, and we've had a lot of  the parks, real consulting with the people. Understand that, go back and look  at the Miriam Park again. How far back does it go? 2007, 2005, 2021, 2022, we have big  changes in it. And again, you want to make a change in an incomplete area. You even  admit that this was supposed to be two sections apart, and only one of them is  finished, and you want to turn this over to the City now before we even know what's  going to be done with the other one. That's connected.  Yeah, that's right.  Directly connected to it. If you see the kids out there playing in the time, during  this whole thing with COVID, the whole thing with the campers out there, the destruction  of that area was monumental. I stopped in 2019 in part because of what had happened  with the number of people coming from the campfire, coming down there, and people  living in that area that were abusing the area totally, and there was nothing I could  do about it. I'm asking you to sit back.  I'm asking you to sit back and reconsider and ask, what's the plan on the parks? What's  the plan on the creek? When are you going to do it, and what exactly is going to be  done before you start giving it away? When you start putting it under cards control when  you don't know what the other half is going to be? Make those decisions first, and then  consider it. Thank you.  Thank you.  All right. So, consent agenda, entertainment budget, and then the budget. I'm going to  take a motion, absent of item, well, the minutes of the 6th.  Right. Yeah. So moved.  Second. All right. We have a motion and a second. Madam Clerk, when you're ready.  Okay. Council Member Bennett?  Approved. Council Member Tandon?  Yes. Council Member Van Overbeck?  Yes. Council Member Winslow?  Yes.  Mayor Coolidge?  Aye.  Carries 5-2.  All right. We will now move on to public comments. Members of the public may address the Council  at this time on any matter not already listed on the agenda. The Council cannot take any  action at this meeting on request made under this section of the agenda. How many speakers  do we have?  We have seven.  All right. Three minutes.  Okay. And I'll call the first two names, and if you could go ahead and line up in the middle  aisle, that would be great. James Hedgman?  걸로 걸로 걸로 걸로 걸로 걸로 걸로  걸로  걸로  걸로  걸로  걸로  걸로  걸로  걸로 !  걸로  걸로  걸로  걸로  걸로 !  걸로  걸로  걸로 ! ! ! !  jobs, your economic outlay on this beautiful program attempting to get in. But there's  some directed type of businesses that you can recruit, that you can move in here that  would fit this area greatly. The company I worked for, the laser company, tried to come  in here back around the year 2000, and he felt like he was wasting his time talking  to the Chamber of Commerce because he didn't understand what lasers were. Didn't understand.  What we've got is a construction boom. We've had a number of speakers get up here and ask  you about infill. Is it the ultimate solution? No, but as part of a program, it would work.  Let's talk about what we've got with the Diamond Match Factory. We've got railroad access right  there. We've got open space right there. We have the ability to open up manufacturing  homes, module homes.  Okay.  In that space. And using the railroad for the supply lines that you need to get in what  equipment you need or to service other areas. This would be attractive to a lot of people  because they've seen what's happened around here. They saw the fires. They saw the disasters.  They saw what happened in Oroville. People, if you want to have housing, module homes  are the way to go. You can build component units and actually bring them to the site  and connect them.  One at a time rather than building in a neighborhood that has a number of houses all around it.  Those types of businesses, that would be a perfect business for there. And on top of  it, if you make it, it's an indoor facility. You manufacture these modules not affected  by the weather like our farming and current housing is.  Right now in our housing, we have a bad rainy season. It slows down to a crawl. We've watched  the delays in developments after developments. This circumvents that. And it creates jobs.  Jobs that are here. Professional jobs. Full-time jobs because you don't have to close the site  down. You don't have to put these people out of work for a while because it's raining.  You don't have to have a hard time getting your manufacturing material. It's just one  idea. But what I'm thinking, I've talked about it before. I think it's a good idea. I think  it's a good idea. And it fits here. People would expect it from here because of the  disasters that happened. If we'd had this here, the housing infill at Paradise would  have been easy. It could have gone straight through the process. I'm asking to consider  different ideas.  Thank you. Erica Esau followed by George Boeck.  Thank you. My name is Erica Esau. Thank you for pronouncing it correctly. I live at West  I live at West County.  I live at 1372 Bidwell Avenue. We are on the city side of Bidwell Avenue. I think Mayor  Coolidge is our representative. I'm here to express our block and our neighborhood's  concerns about the homeless who have moved into Bidwell River Park. They have taken over  the one area that was the access for the neighborhood to get down to Big Chico Creek. There's been  quite a problem.  We've been dealing with sanitation. We've actually watched them dumping waste into the  river, into the creek. Lots and lots of trash and a fire hazard as well because it's not  an area that there's a lot of dry grass there. But consequently, we used to go down and clean  up on that part of the creek. And now we just can't do it. And families are not getting  access. I understand that there is a problem with moving any of the homeless. And I do  understand that problem. But if anything, perhaps they could put a trash can there.  That's not really what I want to see, but it would at least be an answer to some of  the problems. We have written to as many members of the council and other representatives,  and they have said that they are not going to be able to move any of the homeless. And,  again, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank  you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank  thank thank thank thank thank thank thank thank thank thank thank thank thank thank  thank thank thank thank thank thank thank thank thank thank thank thank thank thank  thank thank thank thank thank thank thank thank thank thank thank thank thank thank  thank thank thank thank thank thank thank thank thank thank thank thank thank thank  thank thank thank thank thank thank thank thank thank thank thank thank thank thank  I'm not worried about the fact that there's drug dealing that you know doesn't bother me, but  It's the question of safety and sanitation. That's our real concern. So thank you  Thank You George book followed by Bill Monroe  I was going to say almost exactly the same thing that Erica Esau just said so I was simply second what she had to say  and urged the council to do something about the  waste and  sanitation issues that are  current in that  Part of the city. Thank you  Thank You Bill Monroe followed by Nicole Nava  Hi, I'm Bill Monroe. I live on West Fourth Avenue and I was just as an aside. I'm gonna talk about  Airbnb but as an aside I was I was so glad to see that  President Biden's  Rescue plan was  under underpinning most of these big improvements that  The economic development update addressed so that was that was good  the  Airbnb we have a housing issue as these last two speakers have pointed out. We have a lot of homeless people  We also have a proliferation in Chico of Airbnbs  You know what Airbnb stands for?  airbed and breakfast  Used to start out little little small kind of concept that somebody would have  Put an airbed in their living room somebody could rent a space and they get breakfast now  It's a huge business and people own multiple houses and multiple within our within a block of our house. There are six Airbnbs  They are not owner-occupied  Airbnbs one of them our neighbor is an owner-occupied Airbnb. He lives upstairs. He rents out his downstairs to me. That's fine  That's great. That's kind of the concept  but  Moneyed interest have have come in and they're buying up ad use they're buying up small houses  Things that could be used as rentals  things that could be affordable property for people to buy and they're being turned into airbnbs and  I know that in I have a friend who lives in in  Sierra County in Sierra City where they have a population about 200  And and I was saying what's the big issue up here?  And she says I was at a little meeting up there and she says well  The downtown has all these closed up businesses. Why is that?  There there's no place for workers to live  that's a tourist destination spot in the Sierras for skiing and whatnot and  Every housing unit in the place is an Airbnb  so  if  I hope that the council can take up this this  This idea of some regulation on it perhaps saying that you have to be owner-occupied to run an Airbnb  That would help I've already spoken with my counselor at its Winslow about this and I'm appealing to you all to get together. Thank you  Thank you, Nicole Nava followed by Katie Posey  Good evening a few things tonight  first I'm going to talk about the  I want to request that ongoing that this meeting the first one in August every year be maybe moved one day back  I know you have some rules, but it's national night out. I'd be sure be good to be with our neighborhoods  I'm gonna run back after this. So secondly, I've said before that we need some funding for the arts scene and  Floated an idea about the transient occupancy tax maybe sneaking upward a bit  because when we had the redevelopment  Funding go go away. It was a huge hit to that art scene here. And so I wanted to give you some data that I have  That some of the cities have employed  Which include either raising their existing tot or laying down an additional?  entertainment or arts  tourism tot and  So for that transient occupancy tax and the additional in Santa Rosa and they collect sixteen dollars and sixty seven  cents for like an average  type room per night and then they have an additional five dollars and fifty six cents a night per room that they collect  for an art, you know entertainment one and then in Fresno, it's  3281 for the tot and five dollars and forty seven cents  So if you extrapolate that out with you know  The hotels we have here in Chico and other places and you're assessing something like that. That could be a boon for the art scene  and so that's just a little bit of a  One little thing there and then the county may want to consider doing something like that to help out the library  Another thing I just wanted to touch on that on the homeless topic that I've said before about  Sheltering and such I just want to make sure that if we're planning additional things that we want to keep in mind detail planning  execution and transparent outcomes  so communication work products any interactions outputs of those shelters to make sure we understand that our  taxpayer funds are resulting in people actually getting housed to the extent of we're spending millions, you know, what are we doing?  How's it going that kind of thing? And then lastly I just want to touch on really quickly  You have a scenario where people are having septic leaks failures  And this is the county slash state mandating that they hook up to city sewer  I can cost people anywhere from eight thousand up to twenty two thousand dollars to hook up and I'm just not sure you're aware of how many  Households that might be hitting it and if that might start increasing there is a city grant program, but they're pretty stringent  income requirements  And so this is putting people in positions of having to take out loans and things like that of substantial amounts  Equitable to pretty much a good used car  So I think we need to give some thought to that area because of course the whole point is to keep people housed, right?  So thank you for your time this evening  Thank You Katie Posey followed by Curtis Gansby  Good evening council. I hope you're having a splendid summer. I'm sorry that the other two are missing tonight  I'd like you to consider two topics related to how we help the homeless in our community  The first is accountability and measuring success  So how do you measure the effectiveness of taxpayer funded programs for the homeless that are in operation in our city?  I understand the county and the state are major players  But I think you should have a place at the table in relation to evaluating outputs and measuring what is actually working and helping  people in our local community and make that transparent to the citizens at the presentation about the pallet shelter  It was shared that 11 people were placed into next step housing. I'm curious if there had been a projected goal  We know the cost of starting the shelter was over six million. I can imagine there are internal and external audits for the funding  Are you privy to those results? I understand the new Renewal Center will have space for a hundred  I was surprised to learn the magistrate if I'm correct said space cannot be considered in the count of available shelter beds due to the  religious nature of the organization  and  that seems odd especially considering there is a robust history of religious organizations doing more for people in need than many others  I wonder if you can look into determining how the new Renewal Center will factor into what's specified in the settlement  Community response to homelessness is strengthened when faith-based groups are invited to contribute in a meaningful way to local responses  My second topic how can we learn from what is working in other states?  I recognize you're not at the state level, but you do have opportunities to connect with state officials  And though I know your time is limited. I hope you do this specifically  in regard to discussing the homelessness crisis for example our state policies should learn more about a center in San Antonio  I read about recently that is not just a shelter but a transformational campus Haven for Hope launched in 2006 as a public-private partnership  Provides every necessary service under one roof and in one location  Yes  I recognize that in our state this model would have to be creatively funded because of the nature of state and federal funding and the fact  That there's a requirement to be sober that the model utilizes. I think there's a lot of research and analysis out there suggesting  That the housing first model is not always a stellar and successful that some make it out to be I also think it's dishonoring and  Dispatch disempowering to those experiencing homelessness when we have certain policies that suggest that it's a given that they don't have the ability to meet  sobriety requirements or receive mental health treatment or be equipped to work and using the abilities and giftings  They have the study I read said Haven for Hope estimated saved taxpayers nearly a hundred million and reduced jail time  emergency  room visits and courtroom proceedings and the downtown homeless numbers have dropped 77 percent since they opened in 2006  So my two action steps to conclude communicate something to the public  maybe in the next three months about a specific accountability model you might think might work for the shelters and  Reach out to a state lawmaker and dialogue about successful programs in other states for insight into improving the models  We have in our local community. There's already talk in Sacramento Plage County about that model. There's more to say that I don't have  Thank you  Thank you. Our last speaker is Curtis get me  What I have to say is very brief  Keep it simple  Hold up to the it's a big little park safety issue. I pulled up to the one-mile  recreation area and I  Was astonished no lifeguards  through my mind  Narrow as I looked over to damn and it was like five kids playing on the dam  No guardians around  So it's kind of was I was really concerned as home  When the kids could get hurt, you know stop  So I got to say thank you. Thank you  Thank you very much  All right, we will move on to our regular agenda item 5.1 downtown Chico property business improvement assessment increase  We have a report from Jennifer McCarthy city manager. Welcome back  Thank you  All right, good evening mayor Coolidge members of the council again, I'm Jennifer McCarthy deputy city manager  I'm here tonight to talk to you about the downtown  Chico business property business improvement  District and the request before you to increase the assessment for the downtown Chico peabed by five percent  Little background the peabed Chico peabed was originally formed in 2017 and in 2022 they went through a renewal process  That will cover them for a period of five years from 2023 through December of 2027 as a reminder  The main purpose of the peabed is to assist with public safety maintenance and beautification of the downtown area  and economic development services  When the peabed was established  They are governed by what's called a management district plan  Which lays out the course of activities that they will take to improve the downtown area  The city of Chico has an agreement with the owners association to implement that management district plan and with that agreement comes the requirements for certain  Reports the first is called an initial report that is done the first year of operation after the renewal period  But they outline the budget for us and talk about any major changes to their scope of work over the coming year and  Then on an annual basis after that they will continue to provide the council with an annual report  So this year when they came to staff with their initial reports  It did include information on a request for a five percent increase to the property assessments  This was not really a surprise because when they went through the renewal process all of the noticing and the ballots that went to property owners  were not  Talked about the opportunity over the next five years on an annual basis to increase the assessment up to five percent depending upon the need  It is also mentioned in the management district plan  Which was considered during a public meeting and again it was detailed in the initial report by the property business improvement district  They provided staff with justification about the increase that justification included things such as putting funds aside for reserve  Which is a requirement that the city has?  in  Increased costs associated with the block by block  Contract that they have and those are the the ambassadors that you see out cleaning up our downtown area  There is increased costs and communication increase in filing fees and a number of other items that are detailed in your staff report  The impact to the city of Chico  We are the largest property owner within the downtown Chico peabed and pay the largest assessment in  2023 for our property  We paid just over seventy seven thousand dollars and with this five percent increase moving forward in 2024  We would pay just over eighty one thousand dollars in addition to that  There is a general benefit associated with the property business improvement district  And that is for benefits that come that benefit our entire community  Not just a single business owner a single property owner  I should say and that general benefit is also paid by the city of Chico in  2023 that number was almost  Twenty one thousand dollars and with this five percent increase it would be approximately twenty two thousand dollars  So in front of you see the change of costs with the five percent increase moving from ninety eight thousand two hundred and forty eight dollars  that the city paid in 2023 to a hundred and three thousand one hundred and fifty seven dollars basically in  2024  So because of the fact that we were provided justification on the increase in cost and the needs for that cost and because  they went through the process of the  renewal to alert property owners of this anticipated increase is staffs recommendation to consider the resolution and approve the increase in the pivot assessment as well as the general benefit assessment and here in the audience today is also Greg Scott who sits on the peabed board and both he and I are happy to answer any questions that you might have.  All right questions for second for you. All right questions for second for P.B.? Thank you. Thank you. Speakers?  걸로 걸로  걸로 ! ! ! !  걸로  걸로  걸로  걸로  걸로  걸로  걸로  걸로  걸로  걸로  걸로 ! !  걸로 !  Winslow? Yes. Mayor  Coolidge? Aye. Carries  5-0 with two absent.  All right. Thank you very much.  Item 5.2,  consideration of grant of  license to  theorem collected LLC  for encroachment public roadway  at 418 Broadway Street. Can you report  from Mr. Adler? Yes.  Good evening, Mayor,  City Council members. Item  5.2 is a consideration of a  request we received by  Stobel Coffee here in  downtown to install  at their costs a  enhanced  bike rack facility, essentially.  And so the  mechanism to do so would be a grant of license.  So the action or item before you this evening would  approve the resolution  authorizing the city manager to execute  the grant of license for Stobel  Coffee to implement and maintain  this proposed bike  parking facility. So  it's similar to many of the other bike  racks we have in downtown that  are on street. This will be  enhanced and that'll have additional security features  and raised off of the pavement surface.  This area  has a, it's  technically outside of the downtown core in terms  of the parking demand. So looking at  parking is a concern always.  So this would take up a parking stall.  The parking  occupancy rate in this  block is less than 50%.  So from a staff perspective,  we don't have a lot of concern from the impacts  due to it taking up a parking space.  And so for those reasons, we recommend  approval. That concludes my report  and I'm available for any questions.  All right, questions?  It's really simple.  Do other businesses downtown own their own bike  racks, the ones that are in parking stalls?  No, those are city  installed and maintained.  So  Mr. Audubon, why couldn't  they do something similar on the  sidewalk?  There's not enough room to achieve  what they're looking to achieve and maintain  accessibility. But don't we  have, with the  new plan to  revise the street design,  wider sidewalks are part of that? Yes.  So I guess if  they're doing it at their cost, there's no  impact if we decide later to put it on the  sidewalk. Yeah, we've communicated the  intent in the future to bring forward an item  for consideration of what Maine  and Broadway look like in the future.  And so, yes, that would be,  it would be affected by what the ultimate  resolution is that. We're several years away  from actually constructing  any improvements there. So  in terms of investment,  they're several years away from  having any sort of impact and having to adjust.  Yeah, I would just ask that the grant  of license have a short fuse on it. So  if the city decides it wants  to go on the sidewalk, that can happen.  Okay.  My assumption is that it'll be open to public  all the time. It's not just,  for their patrons. Correct. Correct.  Yes. I do understand  that they do have a lot of parking spots  dedicated to them in the back  to where they share it with the Bank of  America. Was there a consideration to build it there  at all? I'm not aware  of that. That is a private parking  lot. And so I know  they're front facing. The rear  parking lot, I believe, access  wise, is only for the  workplace, the rental  of the workplace component.  So it's not necessarily public access.  So I'd assume that would be  the main reason for putting it in the front  because that is the main public access point.  So  I have a question. Do you have another one,  Mr. Wenzel? I have a little comment, but I'll wait  after your question. I'm just  wondering because in terms of the  drawing, I see a tree  spot that no longer  has a tree. Is there a tree there?  I thought there was a tree right there. I don't  believe that one exists currently.  So is it going to be?  We can coordinate with  our colleagues in the operations  and maintenance department to look at that and  potentially plant a tree.  Yeah, there's a tree  great without a tree.  Yeah.  Just a  question. Mr. Bennett.  So my only concern  actually it's not a concern.  My observation  is that it was very difficult to  really have a good idea of what this looks  like. Who's going to be in charge of making  sure that the aesthetics,  are in keeping with  the city's desire  as far as visual  impacts?  Yeah, well, that would essentially be done  through this action with what is proposed  aesthetically.  I think I know where you're going with this in terms  of like an ARHPB type of  review and approval.  That is not a component currently,  but if the council desires, I assume  that might be something you can look  into attaching to the approval.  Well, then,  I would suggest that the council consider  some type of review of what it looks like  because the, as I said, it's hard to tell what  it looks like. It's so dark.  So that would be a suggestion for the council  to consider that we take a look at what it really  is going to be visually.  When you say we, you mean like staff probably?  Or?  Staff.  But, you know, I think that's a good question.  I think that...  I'm open to suggestions, city manager...  resulted...  resulted...  resulted...  resulted...  resulted...  already does a lot of minor staff level architectural review.  That's part of what we do on a regular basis.  So I guess you could have a little subcommittee  because Wyatt West and his department is very knowledgeable  and has been supportive in successfully getting parking,  bike parking downtown.  So maybe a consortium of just some engineering and planning staff could review it.  I would be very comfortable.  I actually printed out the fee schedule  because I was curious about some of the fees with architectural review.  There's a minor staff review, which was a few hundred dollars.  So I'd be comfortable with you, your department, taking a look at it  and making sure, as I know you know,  we want it to look as well as possible in considering cost.  Everything's expensive.  It's not my intent to make it too expensive,  but we do.  I do need to have a comfort.  I need to have a comfort level that it is going to be aesthetically pleasing.  That minor staff is something we attach to the building plan review,  which would probably be part of this process anyway,  so we can do that.  And the good news is we already know that Stobel has a very good aesthetic,  so it'll be easy to work with them.  Mr. Rano.  So I share Mr. Bennett's concern,  but I have every confidence that the staff,  once they understand our wishes and concerns, can deal with this.  And again,  to Mr. Veague's point,  the Stobel people do everything first class,  and there's no reason to think they wouldn't do this the same way.  Yeah.  Mr. Winslow.  Yeah, so when Stobel first opened,  I, like all of us, or a lot of us, were very impressed,  and I went to spend some time there.  And one day early on, I went there at like 6 in the morning,  and so it's very empty downtown all around.  And I was sitting right in front drinking coffee  and looking across the street at the plaza  when a big pickup truck pulled up right in front of me  and then proceeded to idle as they went in and got their coffee.  Which I suppose up to an extent is legal anyway.  So as far as concerns about the aesthetics  or suggesting that maybe the parking would be in back,  I'll note that I ride my bike there,  so I lock it up to the tree cage like anybody else have until now.  And I think that we're a lot better off with a bike rack  in front of those tables and that door,  and it preserves more like the whole beauty of the place.  So I'll definitely support it.  Don't say that until we're public comment.  Okay.  Speakers?  None.  Oh, well, there.  Now you're concerned.  All right.  Entertain the motion.  Move to approve.  Second.  I'll put a motion and a second.  Madam Clerk, when you're ready.  Councilmember Bennet?  Yes.  Councilmember Tandon?  Yes.  Councilmember Van Overbeck?  Yes.  Councilmember Winslow?  Yes.  Mayor Coolidge?  Aye.  Carries?  Aye.  걸로 걸로 걸로 걸로 걸로  걸로  걸로  걸로  걸로  걸로  걸로  걸로  걸로  걸로  걸로  걸로 !  걸로 !  걸로  걸로 !  걸로 ! ! !  걸로  Okay.  All in the last two minutes, right?  Okay.  All right.  Sorry we were two minutes late.  Item 5.3, 2023 downtown Chico High Street and the Plaza consideration.  Mr. Alderman, let's back out that.  Here we go.  Right back at it.  Thank you very much, Mayor and City Council members.  As mentioned, item 5.3 is consideration for the 2023 downtown Chico.  Ice rink and the Plaza.  So a little background context.  We've had two years of operation, first in the winter of 21-22 and second in the winter of 22-23.  In both instances, City funded the initial capital outlay and coordinated the first year.  The City really managed the operations with the second year managing that through the DCBA.  And so the intention was initial capital outlay.  Created an environment, created a community event that brings people to downtown.  Family friendly event through the winter holiday season.  At the time, you know, those projections based on projections of sponsorships, operational income from general admission and skate rentals.  And both years we have operated in a negative balance, not recovering the initial capital outlay.  So in the 2023-2024 budget, revenue or budget for the ice rink was not included.  So we are here tonight for council consideration of funding that item.  The two items associated with the action this evening first would be approval of the supplemental appropriation to allocate $225,000 to the ice rink for the rental of the ice rink components.  I will mention that in the first two years,  we were in the first place.  operational costs were higher we've purchased a lot of the elements the  kiosks sheds the rubber mats a lot of the initial infrastructure like PG&E  infrastructure has all been completed so our operational startup costs are a lot  less moving forward the second action that we're requesting we've been  coordinating with a different operator card they do not have official approval  yet but this action would allow for the city manager upon their board approval  to operate the ice rink we believe it's the best fit for the the program itself  and what card offers as an agency that it's actually a great marriage  essentially to have them operate and run the program and I think there's a lot of  energy and excitement behind that and so that concludes my report I'm available  for any questions  all right questions so mr. Ottoboni two questions so the first one is if the ice  rink does better financially does the some of the 225 that you're asking for  get refunded yeah the intention would be any additional revenues above operating  costs would first come back to the city to make us whole so that we in an ideal  world we can get the money back to the city and we can get the money back to the So that we in an ideal world, we at the end of the year, our capital outlet would be zero. !  걸로  Okay. So the second question is, I mean, I think this is a fabulous thing for downtown and just the little kids excited.  And, you know, all the restaurant owners I've talked to said their business is really good.  So this is clearly an asset for downtown.  It's also shouldn't be surprising that the first few years it's going to lose money.  But is there a plan to make the deficit next year maybe five figures instead of six?  Yeah, we would really evaluate that.  I think after this year, as I mentioned, I think the first two years, a lot of learning curve, a lot of higher initial upstart costs.  I think having CARD as the operator will do a better job of sponsorship.  They have programs already in place.  They've got a lot of ideas to enhance the utilization.  And so the intention long term, I think, would be eventually get the city out of.  Really spending any dollars and be able to pass that torch on to CARD and let them run with them prior.  The program holistically.  So what I saw was that the average daily number of skaters was up, but you had 69 rain days.  So that was a big hit.  But also the sponsorship revenue was half roughly from 21, 22.  So but but you have a plan to make this thing financially sustainable.  At some point.  Yes, those are great points.  I think what we've learned from the first two years is, yes, the first year we had a big contribution from the sponsorships, roughly $120,000.  And the second year dropped down to about $65,000.  I think there's various reasons for that.  But again, working through CARD, I think they have they're working up concepts and plans and an approach with city staff.  And I think collaboratively we can be much more proactive and have.  A bigger reach.  And I think those sponsorship levels could could definitely exceed that first year's amount.  So and again, as you mentioned, the second year average skaters per day increased.  We had one of our wettest winters on record this past year.  And so I think that was a large impact.  Obviously, we can't account for the weather, but we can do our best to adapt.  And I think with all those things in place, it can be.  Much more fiscally sustainable in the future.  Thank you.  Mr.  So from my past experiences, marketing events and I would categorize this as a marketing events.  Many times it takes a number of years before they become self-sustaining or profitable, even a great new.  New.  New.  New.  resulted in 걸로 걸로 걸로 걸로 걸로 걸로 걸로 걸로 걸로 걸로 걸로 걸로 걸로 걸로 걸로 걸로 걸로 걸로 걸로 걸로 걸로  걸로  걸로  걸로  걸로  걸로  걸로 !  걸로  걸로  걸로 !  Nevada activities, I mean, just massive tents.  So maybe someday a consideration could be made  for covering up with a tent,  which would eliminate that downside of it rains again,  we need the water.  So it's certainly not a bad action by the mother nature,  but it does have a consequence.  So I'm just gonna throw it out there  as maybe someday a tent might work out well, very well.  So thank you.  Thank you.  Mr. Wenzel.  I just wanted to make sure I was correct  in clarifying that when, if CARD were to operate this,  money would come in, it would offset the city's expense,  but just for that year after that,  CARD would be taking any profits in the,  perhaps unlikely event that it would turn a profit.  Correct.  Yeah, again, part of the value of it,  I believe from a city perspective is that  we don't have the statistics, but anecdotally,  I think as Council Member Van Overby  mentioned businesses really thrive during the winter season  with the ice rink and operation.  And so there is that other added element to what degree,  again, it's not my area of expertise,  but increased sales tax revenue by the enhancement  of people coming downtown.  Again, the intention all along was make it affordable  so that people can come down  and then they'll wanna go explore downtown,  maybe go out to dinner, buy some treats, buy some holiday,  gifts, something like that.  And I think we've seen that element be successful so far.  All right, I have a couple, do you have money?  No.  No, okay.  So also having some event experience behind me as well.  Yeah, this is very true what Mr. Bennett said,  it does take several years when I do a new event,  it takes probably two to three years,  before the event starts generating revenue.  I think CARD is the perfect fit  because they have the email list  of every kid in town and their parents.  I know I'm still on it,  even though I haven't had my kid in a program  for at least half a decade, I still get their emails.  So I think they're the perfect fit for this, I really do.  And I think they'll do really well with it.  I think this also fits nicely into Ms. McCarthy's,  definitely 걸로 걸로 걸로 걸로 걸로  걸로 걸로 걸로 걸로  걸로 걸로  걸로  걸로  걸로  걸로  걸로  걸로  걸로  걸로  걸로 !  걸로 !  걸로 ! !  걸로  and enjoyed the rink.  So, all right, any other questions?  No?  All right.  Public comment?  Three speakers.  All right, three minutes.  James Hutchinson, followed by Bruce McLean.  Ten idea, by the way.  It was a wonderful one.  If you look to the website of the company that provides this technology for you for this ice rink,  they show all kinds of variations of ways that these kind of rinks have been set up.  One of them was an indoor setup.  Wonderful idea in its own.  But space here would probably be limited in Chico.  But the ten idea, to me, wonderful.  Start in the right direction.  Why?  We're talking about weather.  Weather, weather.  Weather.  This technology.  It can handle up to 90 degrees.  It's up to 90 degrees without melting the ice.  But the rain, as you saw, handicapped it, ruined it.  Sustainability.  Is that sustainable?  What are the weather forecasts for next year?  What are the long-term forecasts?  It looks pretty bad.  And if you look at that and think about what you're putting out there,  what you're risking in a possible bad scenario,  things like the ten idea and other ideas, much preferable.  The other one is, what have we got here?  Anecdotal evidence.  Anecdotal evidence.  We went out and talked to a few people that are our friends,  and they told us this is what happened, and hey, they must be right.  That's not evidence.  Not evidence at all.  You don't have it.  You don't have the evidence.  Weather, again, let's go back to it.  It's a big fact.  It's not a little thing here.  And we have weather forecasts.  We have long-term forecasts.  And they're not good.  You go and look at them.  Go to the company that provided this technology  and talk to them about protection dealing with weather,  what they think might be an ideal solution for it.  They've already done it in a number of places, including hockey rinks,  ice shows where they'd circus away, for instance.  Put on a performance using their technology.  Those types of things, they have it.  Why not use them?  They know more than you do.  I'll guarantee that when it comes to the technology.  You've got to put it out there the way it's meant to be,  the best way possible.  And then you'll make some money off it eventually.  Short term, it doesn't look really good.  It does not look sustainable.  I'm really concerned that you're throwing more money,  actually.  After a bad situation, you're trying to solve it  by changing who's running it.  There's nothing innovative there.  Thank you.  Bruce McLean, followed by Laurie Monroe.  Hi.  Hi.  I used to ice skate as a kid.  I grew up in Michigan.  It was a lot of fun.  I've got nothing against ice skating.  As a matter of fact,  is there still ice skating in the winter up in Paradise?  I don't know.  I think there is.  I don't know if I can ask a question to the council or not.  It's a no.  We can't answer questions.  Oh, okay.  All right.  Well, maybe when you discuss it, you can answer it.  Yes.  I just want to say that I've been disappointed the two years  that the rink has been put up.  The entire plaza was fenced off, including one  of the only two public toilets downtown.  I find that very disconcerting.  I don't think that that's a good idea.  Thanks.  Thanks.  I think that if we want to have ice skating,  and if Paradise is still doing their rink,  that we shouldn't continue to undercut their activity  and their need to draw people to their center.  I think if we're going to spend $225,000 that are not budgeted,  it's been brought up during the comment session  by several citizens that they've got homeless challenges  in their immediate neighborhoods.  It might be a good investment to actually get and set up  and have organized a camping area for campers  where they want to be.  I know Depot Park isn't authorized,  but I think it's a good idea.  But it seems like that's where they want to be.  So if we just stick to the ice rink in terms of the conversation?  Well, this is the use of $225,000.  It's an alternative use, Mayor Kovach.  It's very pertinent.  You can do a lot of things with $225,000.  You can have a competitive ice rink or you can set  up a much needed camping area with facilities and shade and water.  So it's a good investment.  Thank you.  Lori Monroe is our last speaker.  So I haven't ever liked the idea of the ice rink.  Not, well, the idea of the ice rink is fine.  I don't like the idea of spending city money on it  because it seems kind of exclusive.  It's not like Sycamore Pool where anybody can go swim.  You have to pay a fee to go in and use it.  And so I just don't think that's a good use of it.  I also thought it was a little bit mean-spirited of the City  of Chico to do an ice rink when Paradise had been doing it  for years and years, didn't do it for a while  because of the fire started up at 221.  And that's when Chico also started up doing it.  So those are my concerns about the ice rink.  Regarding CARD, we heard that there were lifeguards  at Sycamore Pool.  And there's an article from June in the paper that said  that there wouldn't be, and that's a CARD responsibility.  That's not the City Council's responsibility.  But does this organization that can't find enough lifeguards  to staff their pools have the capacity to do this work?  That's my question.  All right.  Further comment from Council?  Ms. Winston.  This whole ice rink thing has been fascinating.  I have followed it kind of closely a little bit.  A lot of people talk about it.  Originally a lot of people thought this was about running homeless people  out of the plaza, and they hated it for that.  And there was another considerable group of people  who thought the same thing, and they loved it for that.  I think that issue has now sort of settled,  so I would like to look at it.  Apart from that level, the mean-spiritedness,  at least perceived in the city.  When it was first proposed, there were some really  grandiose expectations, just being that it would turn a profit at all.  You said it would turn a considerable profit,  and it didn't happen.  And then when it did, former City Manager Mark Horne said  that the sales tax revenue generation would probably make up the difference,  but was waiting for determination to be made,  as in that information that we still don't have,  as far as whether it did alter the amount of sales tax  that we're getting in the area, and whether that covered it at all.  Also, I found this quote in the ER from March 2022.  Mark Horne said that the costs would be lower in the second year,  which we're also hearing again for this year.  He said, quote,  so it should definitely pay for itself in the next year.  So I think if the city-sponsored ice rink was a good idea,  then it must be a...  Or if it's a good idea now still,  then it was a really great idea back then.  But it's lost $330,000 in the past two years.  By my calculations, that's a negative 63%  profit, even counting in we're getting a lot of sponsorships and stuff,  but also seeing they're kind of falling off,  and I don't know how much hope we can really have  that those are going to be restored.  So what I think we should be doing here  is considering whether leasing the plaza in itself is justified,  not for another operator to put in an ice rink  and try to find a way to make it work,  considering it does block up the plaza from the public  who don't pay money, as alluded to by one of the speakers,  as it's also a competitor with the public,  Paradise, who does still operate their ice rink.  I'll say that they do have a comparative advantage  in terms of temperatures for keeping ice cold.  So that's really more it for Paradise, I think,  than it is for Chico.  It does snow there.  But instead, we're discussing whether it will  allow a car to operate an ice rink at the city's loss.  Meanwhile, again, as mentioned by speakers,  we can't afford lifeguards at one mile.  We could pay people well enough to work at one mile.  That is something that's free to the public.  Currently, a lot of people don't feel comfortable enough  to have children go there.  I'm not comfortable just putting this money out here  and looking at this in isolation  when we do have all the other things to consider.  We could talk about our arts budget or something.  When we have funds like this,  I think this isn't entirely inclusive of everybody.  I think ice skating is great, and I'd love to see  how many people have been able to come down and enjoy it,  and I'd like to see that happen, but I don't think  that we should just be throwing money out like this.  So I would propose the motion that we do allow  card-free ice rinks.  We would like to have a card-free ice rink  for the court or other parties to propose usage  of the closet for an ice rink, but not that we fund it ourselves.  All right.  We have a motion.  We have a second.  I have a question for the clerk.  Madam Clerk, there's two motions here, right?  There's the appropriation and then the card,  having card manage it?  Right.  You could do it all in one motion,  or you can break it up.  Okay.  Thank you.  I move to approve the appropriation as well as  having card manage it.  Okay.  So did you make a motion?  Yeah.  I didn't take that as a motion that we,  which I suppose would be just allowing card to operate it,  but not doing the supplemental appropriation  to fund it ourselves.  Okay.  So I think that you were making a motion.  Did someone second that?  Not as of yet.  Okay.  So let me put that in first.  And it died for a lack of a second.  And then you want to make another motion to approve the supplemental  as well as to authorize the city manager to enter into a contract with card  if they agree?  Correct.  Okay.  Is there a second for that?  Second.  I do have a couple of questions.  Sure.  So we have a motion and a second.  Let's do comment.  Okay.  Council Member Tan.  Comment.  Oh.  Or question.  I got a question.  Yes.  I was just curious to see,  I know we have heard that before that it will affect the sales tax  and we are hoping it had affected it.  When do we anticipate those numbers?  Are we able to get it or is it just an anticipation?  Is there a date by which we could get those numbers at all?  Well, it's more that we can't really put a finger on that specific event  affecting the sales tax specifically.  We do get our, we have gotten our December numbers of sales tax.  It was less than before, the year before.  However, there's a lot of other factors in terms of economics  and that sort of thing that lay into that.  So it's hard to put a finger on the ice rink specifically.  I understand you were all recovering from a big disaster.  For sure.  But I was just curious because that was said in there.  And, you know, on that note,  I'm really surprised that nobody is here actually from downtown,  any of the businesses or anybody to say that how it really affected them  and how great it was for their businesses.  So I have personally went out a few times.  It was great.  I have never seen downtown that busy,  never seen those many kids out there playing.  So from the information that we have right now,  it is very difficult to make that decision because you,  if you visited it, I've never been to,  I have never gone to Paradise.  It seems like too far, too far for me to go for an hour to do the ice skating.  For me, right?  It's when we, like, I don't want to spend, you know,  go four times a year and spend that much gas up and down.  To me, it doesn't seem sustainable.  We do have questions.  We do.  Of course.  Of course.  There are other ways to do, but it's, it's, I'm speaking for me, right?  So from that perspective,  it seems like it's a wonderful idea that we should have activity,  outdoor activities for the kids to do as and when we can.  So I guess we just have to, I mean,  I would like to hear more from the business.  If we could table it and invite some of the downtown businesses to speak  about how it affected them is what would,  I would make a motion to do that.  I think if you tabled it,  they wouldn't have time to raise the sponsorship funds for it.  I think that's part of the issue that came up in finances.  They wanted to, like, they're already past due.  They need to push forward.  May I ask a question?  Yeah.  Why wasn't this included in the budget originally?  We didn't have final numbers from DCBA yet.  And I think if we didn't get some interest from the card staff,  which we have,  I don't think we would be here at this moment.  You know, I'm hoping the card board supports it.  But again,  I don't think that if we didn't have somebody as strong as CARD  stepping up, expressing some interest,  and actually a lot of enthusiasm and a lot of confidence,  we wouldn't be here right now.  All right.  Thank you.  Mr. Brett.  I just want to make a follow-up comment to Councillor Tandon's comment.  I agree with everything you said.  But we only have two years.  And we need that third year to take another look at it,  see how it turns out,  and then we'll be back in the same position next year.  Perhaps not.  But I think we'll be back in the same position making another decision.  But I think that this third year, to me,  is critical to give us enough information for us to make a better decision next year.  So that's it.  Just my comment.  I agree with you on that, too.  And we do also know that DCBA were going through their own struggles.  They did not have an executive officer.  So CARD could potentially do a way better job of running it  and bringing in more revenue as well.  Definitely got a better mailing list.  Mr. Randall, Rick, did you have another comment?  So our downtown, we saw what happened when the downtown deteriorated.  We had homeless people camped in the plaza.  The enrollment at the university crashed by 30%.  That's the biggest economic driver for this town.  The university and the downtown are joined.  If we have a vibrant, exciting downtown, enrollment is going to come back.  You know, I think that this ice skating event was the most exciting thing.  I've never seen more excited people.  Then at this ice around this ice skating rink.  And so I think we either believe in our downtown and we're willing to invest in it or we don't.  And I happen to believe that it's very special and it's worth saving.  And we need to invest in it.  And this is something that I think is off to a reasonably good start.  I've a lot of confidence.  Mr. Autobani can figure out how to reduce that operating deficit.  And so I think I feel very strongly.  This is something we need to do.  All right.  Mr. Wenzel.  One more short comment.  I just noticed something.  You know, talking about the third time is the charm, third year is the charm kind of idea here.  So a year and a half ago, our former city manager had said that he thought that the sales tax would make up the difference.  So we actually would be generating some revenue out of this, including that.  And it says in the staff report that anecdotally we've heard that business is kind of up to it.  But what I'm hearing about the sales tax numbers is that anecdotally, like actually looking at the data,  it's actually down in that this ice rink did not increase sales tax rates.  But it was raining with ice.  Yeah, I suppose.  But it's coming off of COVID.  Yeah.  Well, on a different note, there's one more question.  We did legalize drinking in the plaza.  Is this kind of overlap?  You can ice skate and drink now?  We'll look into that later.  I'm not sure cards doing drinks and tickets.  I got a question.  I wanted to use this opportunity to dispel a few myths, if I could.  Mr. Ottoboni, you know, when I came into office, you talked to me about the ice rink.  How long has this ice rink been on the city's table?  I think it's a lot longer than us just doing it for, you know, a couple of years.  I think it was discussed a long time before I got here.  About five years, I would say.  There's been a lot of discussion internally of things.  As I mentioned in the staff report, you know, we're constantly evaluating options and opportunities to enhance the downtown.  It is the core of our community.  And this was a concept that internally as staff we had discussed for several years and bounced around how to make it work.  Again, there are some major infrastructure upgrades with the electrical service to handle the chiller and the demands.  And we've achieved all those things.  Again, reducing our overall.  Initial capital outlay costs.  All right.  I just kind of wanted to dispel the myth that this was done to close the plaza.  You know, that it was obviously on when this council had a very different makeup.  It was being, you know, talked about in city hall.  And it was an idea that was being kicked around.  Yeah.  The other one, which I'm going to ask you a question, which is completely rhetorical.  You know, Oroville has an ice rink.  I don't remember them getting a lot of...  Hell over the fact that, you know, they were competing with Paradise.  But we did.  And, however, what people seem to miss out on is that the mayor of Paradise was at the opening of our ice rink the very first year.  And that we had a joint package with Paradise to do skating, which actually helped increase some of the revenue up in Paradise.  So I think that's overlooked a lot.  Not to mention cities throughout Northern California have ice rinks.  Anderson has one.  Reading has from time to time.  Mount Shasta has one.  Folsom has one.  Sacramento has one.  And these are common things.  You go down to Monterey, they have one.  So they're all over the state.  They're a common thing for people to do to entertain their citizens in one way or another.  So no answer.  Rhetorical.  Yes.  Anyway, further discussion or should we take a vote?  Okay.  All right.  Madam Clerk.  Council Member Bennett.  Yes.  Council Member Tandon.  Yes.  Council Member Vinson.  Yes.  Council Member Van Overbeck.  Yes.  Council Member Winslow.  No.  Mayor Coolidge.  Aye.  Carries 4-1 with two absence.  All right.  Moving on to Item 5.4, consideration and approval of supplemental appropriation budget modification.  And we have Mr. Ottoboni back.  It's the third time for term, I guess.  We're in an Ottoboni show.  Welcome.  All right.  Who are you next to?  You want to take over Chelsea's item?  No, I think I'm good.  I think this should wrap it up for me for the evening.  All right.  Thank you.  Item 5.4 is a supplemental appropriation budget modification for two specific increases  in project funding through our capital improvement program.  The first being the Cohasset Road widening project that we just completed.  City staff and engineering department were able to obtain an additional $525,000 of grant  funding through the Economic Development Administration, the EDA.  So that increases our total grant contribution for the project.  And then we have the additional $525,000 of grant funding from the EDA to just under  $14 million.  So this supplemental will add that funding in to account for cost increases that were  experienced during the construction of the project.  It will also potentially free up any unused funds in the project that are local.  We'll free those up and be able to use on other projects.  The second being $3.5 million of additional funding through the congestion mitigation  and air quality, CMAQ funding.  That is a regional allocation.  And we've secured that additional $3.5 million through BCAG for our Bikeway 99 Phase 5 pedestrian  overcrossing project.  By way of that, we had some additional CMAQ funds into the Hagen Lane congestion project.  So we had to free up some of those CMAQ dollars to go towards the Bikeway 99 Phase 5 project.  That concludes my report and I'm available for any questions.  All right.  Questions?  I have one.  When does the overpass, Bikeway overpass, start?  It's going out to bid.  It's actually out for advertisement.  We're doing an extended advertisement.  It was already advertised for bid this past winter.  And bids came in about $5 million higher than anticipated.  It's a unique structure.  And so we've now secured this additional $3.5 million with an additional $1.5 million.  So we're going to have to pay $3.5 million of transportation funds of our local funds  to make it fully funded.  So with that, the hope, if the bids come in on price, that we'll start construction next  spring.  All right.  I think it's good for the record because we're going to hear a lot of this as this is built.  The brunt of this is grant funding, correct?  Absolutely.  That could not be used to fill potholes or redo roads in Chico.  Correct.  The CMAQ funds are very specific state funds that go towards congestion relief, especially  related to bike and pedestrian types of projects to reduce essentially vehicular travel, which  essentially reduces greenhouse gas emissions.  So yes, the funding is grant funds that are specific to these types of projects that can't  just go towards filling potholes, reconstructing roads, all those types of things.  Yeah.  I think it's just important.  Every time we mention this project, we mention that.  Yeah.  And I would say that the award that we received for this is the foundational grant was an  active transportation program grant that was one of the largest in the states and was selected  by the state to be a signature project.  So to further the point, there was a lot of legwork with city staff coordinating with  the state transportation agencies to be able to obtain those grants.  All right.  Mr. Winkle.  Yeah.  That's a cool bridge.  The Hagen Lane congestion relief, we're talking roundabouts like Sterling Junction down on  East Park.  Is that what that is still?  That's a component of it, yes.  Okay.  And so that project was kind of pushed out beyond years.  And for the CMAQ funding, there's cycles.  So I believe it's every four years we go through cycles of allocations for our region.  Typically Chico gets the significant majority of that funding for our region for obvious  purposes.  And so that project has kind of been pushed out and put on the back burner, but still  evaluating the specifics of the improvements.  Okay.  That was my question.  Thanks.  All right.  Thank you very much.  Public comment?  We have none.  Entertain motion.  Move to approve.  Second.  Motion by Council Member Winslow, second by Council Member Tandon.  Okay.  Council Member Bennett?  Yes.  Council Member Tandon?  Yes.  Council Member Van Overbeek?  Yes.  Council Member Winslow?  Yes.  Mayor Coolidge?  Aye.  Carries 5-0 with two absent.  All right.  Brendan, we're just going to have you handle the Shelsea's.  No, no.  All right.  We have a side letter agreement between City of Chico and Local 39.  Chelsea Peebus, Director of Human Resources and Risk Management.  Good evening, Mayor, members of Council.  Before you tonight is essentially job title changes with no change to pay to keep up with  industry standard.  Our electrical environmental supervisor is being changed over to electrical maintenance  supervisor to be able to better attract candidates that more closely align with what we need.  And our lead operator, again, is being transitioned over to operations supervisor to, again,  more accurately reflect industry standard and allow us to get the candidates we need.  And I'm happy to answer any questions you may have.  All right.  Questions?  Thank you very much.  Speakers?  None.  Entertain a motion.  Second.  Motion from Council Member Tandon.  Second from Council Member Winslow.  Flip flopping over there.  Okay.  All right.  Council Member Bennett?  Yes.  Council Member Tandon?  Yes.  Council Member Van Overbeek?  Yes.  Council Member Winslow?  Yes.  Mayor Coolidge?  Aye.  Carries 5-0 with two absent.  All right.  Item 5.6, Amendment to the City of Chico, Budget Appendices by Council Member Tandon.  걸로 걸로 걸로 걸로 걸로 걸로 걸로 걸로 걸로 걸로 걸로  걸로 ! ! ! !  걸로  걸로  걸로  걸로  걸로  걸로  걸로  걸로  걸로 !  걸로  걸로 !  make sure the union was okay with the job description and settled on a pay scale. So  before you tonight is solidifying that pay scale into the B1. The fiscal impact is approximately  $123,000 per year. The Administrative Services Department, again, had a new position budgeted  at the start of the 23-24 fiscal year, which was Cybersecurity Analyst, and it was approved  with the budget. We, again, went through the same process of meeting and conferring and deciding on  the appropriate salary range for the position, and that's approximately $190,000 per year.  And then the last one, in our Community Development Department,  we lost one of our  contractors,  contracted inspectors,  with, from what I understand, not much  notice.  And so what we're  looking at doing in CDD  is replacing that  currently  vacant Administrative  Analyst position to a  combination Inspector 1-2,  and that actually results in salary savings.  So I'm happy to  answer any questions you may have.  Questions?  Questions?  Oh, come on.  Here we go.  We got a question.  All right.  Mr. Brennan.  I'll take it.  I had multiple questions, all of which you answered excellently, as well as the City Manager,  so I'm not going to ask any more and push my luck.  All right.  All right.  And how many speakers do we have on this?  We have zero.  We're zero.  We'll do zero minutes then.  Thank you very much.  All right.  Entertain a motion.  Move to approve.  Second.  Second.  All right.  We have a motion from Council Member Tandon, a second from Council Member Winslow.  Council Member Bannon?  Yes.  Council Member Tandon?  Yes.  Council Member Van Overbeck?  Yes.  Council Member Winslow?  Indeed.  Mayor Coolidge?  Aye.  Carries 5-0 with two absent.  All right.  Anyone want to add an item?  No?  Yes.  No.  No.  No.  Hold on.  Let's see reports and communications.  The following report is from the City of New York.  Reports and communication items are provided for the Council's information.  No action can be taken on items under this section of the agenda unless the Council agrees  to include it on a subsequent agenda.  City Manager's report.  No report.  All right.  Item 6.2, Council Members' Requests Pursuant to APMP 1010.  Council Members may verbally request an item to be agendized at a future meeting after stating  what the item would be a majority vote of the Council's need in order for staff to agendize.  Do we have any items?  I do.  I do.  One but the peak.  No.  Go ahead.  I'm just .  Go ahead.  Go.  You know, I'm just requesting some information about the short-term rentals.  I know it's been on the radar.  I did request some information in the past.  But I would like to know how many do we have in the city?  What is the process?  Do we have any process in place?  Or how are we collecting the TOTs on that?  And how much has been our revenue in the last few years?  Maybe three to five years?  And maybe we can have a discussion once we have what we know that the city is doing on  short-term rentals.  Airbnb is just one platform.  But we know there are and vacation homes and tons of other platforms as well.  So.  All right.  Okay.  I'll second.  I think it's worthy to have the information and look at it.  So we have a motion and a second.  Do you get that whole motion there?  I think so.  So that's to get the information on short-term rentals.  Like how many are in the city?  What is the process?  So this is the item that will be agendized?  Or is this just asking for information?  I think this is just the information piece.  Maybe to agendize to get that information?  Well, if you want action on the item, you should make it so it's versatile so you can take action on the item.  So maybe a report on it.  And any.  Report on it.  And then.  Well.  Suggestions, Madam Clerk?  And then we can take suggestions?  I think that if you go with the typical protocol, it would be you're going to bring back this discussion and staff may be prepared to address that when you bring it back.  If you vote to agendize it.  I think I would.  I don't know how easy it is to get some of that information.  It's information that we have.  Okay.  And can assemble relatively easily.  Right.  So it's voting to agendize this and have staff bring back the information?  Yes.  Yeah.  Okay.  Member Bennett?  Yes.  Council Member Tandon?  Yes.  Council Member Van Overbeck?  Yes.  Council Member Winslow?  Yes.  Mayor Coolidge?  Aye.  Carries 5-0 with 2 absent.  All right.  Any other council members?  Any other requests?  That's the agenda.  And we will be back here Tuesday, September 5, 2023.  I wouldn't say that this being national night out, it would be nice to move off the  .  It's like an alphabet deal for me.  I don't know.  Eric?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah. [inaudible]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Can we bring the right guy?  It's Dan.  That's who it is.  It's all Dan.  It's like a name. Okay.  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.
