 All right. Welcome, everybody. We will start our meeting here, the regular city council  meeting for October 19th, and we'll call to order with an invocation, starting with an invocation  from Chaplain Peter Hanson. Welcome. Thank you, Mr. Mayor, Council. Let's pray.  Almighty God, who gives us the breath of life and who keeps alive in us all good desires,  we ask that you sanctify all our ideals and endeavors, that we may begin nothing without  your grace, nor continue it without your blessing. You guide the meek in judgment,  and light rises in darkness for those who seek that light. Grant this council, in its doubts  and uncertainties, the grace to ask what you would have done, letting the spirit of wisdom  save them from wrong choices, that they may find your straight path and not stumble.  God of peace, who has taught us in returning and rest, we shall be saved.  In quietness and in confidence shall be our strength. By the light of your spirit, lift us,  we pray thee, to thy presence, where we may be still and know that thou art God. Amen.  Bishop Hanson, last Wednesday was my wedding anniversary, and I just want to thank you for  performing that ceremony 26 years ago. It was 26 now. I've lost count. Yeah, I remember it well.  You're very good. And you're still married to the same lady, I presume.  Her name was Amber. I deserve that. She's still beautiful, too. She is. And very blessed.  Absolutely. The luckiest woman. All right. If you could please stand and join me in the Pledge of Allegiance.  I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, and to the republic for which it stands.  I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands,  one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.  All right. We have different team rivalries than normal up here on the dais.  Save your cheering for the Almond Bowl this Friday, if you would. No cheering from the audience, or booing, for that matter.  Speaker card announcement. Anyone wishing to address the audience?  Anyone wishing to address the audience?  If you wish to address an item on the agenda, you should first complete a speaker card, which can be found at the back of the chamber.  And then once completed, turn it in to the city clerk over here to my left, your right.  Speakers are taken in the order the cards received, and once the speakers begin, no additional cards will be accepted for that item being considered.  So, and then, again, if you have a sign, towards the back of the room only, please.  And we will start with the consent agenda.  All matters listed on the consent agenda are to be considered routine in nature.  And can be enacted by one motion.  Speakers may submit cards.  Mayor Coolidge, could we take roll first?  Oh, we didn't do roll. Okay, let's do roll.  Okay, thank you.  Council Member Bennett?  Here.  Council Member Brown?  Here.  Council Member Morgan?  Here.  Council Member O'Brien?  Here.  Council Member Tandon?  Here.  Vice Mayor Reynolds?  Here.  Mayor Coolidge?  Here.  All right.  Sorry about that.  I'm jumping ahead.  So, okay.  Speakers may submit one.  Speaker Card for all consent items being considered on the consent agenda.  And if we don't have any disqualifications, do we have any speakers?  We have one.  Jessica Giannola?  All right.  Three minutes.  Hi, Council.  I just wanted to comment on the police funding.  I know nothing's going to change.  I just want to point out that we have a substantial,  substantial amount of our funding going towards our police department.  And I just don't support more arrays happening in the future.  We have other areas of the city.  We have to budge out our entire city needs.  Not that police aren't important.  It's just we have other issues that need funding, too.  So, if I were choosing, I would not choose to have arrays happening in the future and  focusing on other areas of the city.  That's all.  Thank you.  All right.  Thank you.  I'm going to entertain a motion.  I'll second that.  All right.  I have a couple of the meeting minutes of a correction.  Okay.  Go ahead.  On the September 7, 2021 meeting minutes, I did vote no on Council Member Morgan's request,  item 6.2, which is page 7, for a presentation from North Star Engineering regarding moving  the green line.  So, I'd just like our minutes to repeat.  I'll correct that.  I'd also like to register a no vote for item 2.1.  All right.  Any other no votes or corrections?  All right.  Seeing none, Madam Clerk.  Council Member Bennett?  Yes.  Council Member Brown?  Aye.  Council Member Morgan?  Yes.  Council Member O'Brien?  Yes.  Council Member Tandon?  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds?  Yes.  Mayor Coolidge?  Aye.  Carry 7-0.  All right.  We'll move on to business from the floor.  So, members of the public.  May I address the Council at this time on any matter not listed on the agenda.  So, please keep your comments, particularly to items not already on the agenda, with comments  being limited to three minutes or as determined based upon the number of speakers.  The Council cannot take any action at this meeting on requests made under this section  of the agenda.  How many speakers?  We have six now.  All right.  We'll see three minutes.  Okay.  Our first speaker is Jeff Creed, followed by Erica and Nate, who will come up together.  Good evening, Council.  So, the last time I was here, I think I was talking about the lack of visible leadership.  Did you ever figure out who's in charge of the city of Chico?  The follow-up question to that is I was talking about the lack of planning for the budgets.  You know, we have a lot of business people up there.  What do you call a business who plans to not pay their maintenance for years on end?  Is that still a business?  Just hypothetical questions there.  I saw in writing somebody mentioned you can't tax a populace into prosperity.  And the way it was delivered seemed to be in reference to the situation Chico's in with  the sales tax.  And I fail to see how that's not an object lie when you don't distinguish between taxing  for redistribution and taxing for providing for the minimum requirements to promote business.  Okay.  So, if you don't have the minimum requirements to promote business,  then you need to levy a tax to get those minimum requirements.  And I believe it was Commander O'Brien who stood here and said he knew best how to police the city of Chico.  And at that time, he didn't believe Chico needed to follow the national standards.  That's his opinion.  That's his belief.  But how'd that work out?  Is Chico still around 60% higher in violent crime?  Than the rest of the nation?  I haven't looked recently, but when I did look, that was about where Chico was standing.  60% higher in violent crime than the rest of the nation.  So, how did that work out?  My whole point here is the way Chico has been doing business for decades is an issue.  Not necessarily trying to make the wheel spin faster, but you need to figure out a new wheel.  The way the city runs the business is flawed.  And I could point that out in multiple places all across the spectrum.  And I did with some anecdotal blue tarps.  And nobody's caring about blue tarps, but you're missing that that's a tell.  And tells are more important in real life than at the poker table.  That's a tell of mismanagement.  It's a tell of lack of management.  So, the one thing I don't understand and I don't know, what do you all tell your friends?  Your friends that live out of the city.  Your family.  Do you invite them to Chico?  Do you invite them?  Do you invite them downtown?  Chico not mentioned they can't invite their guests to the Diamond Hotel last month.  So, do you invite your friends and family?  What are you going to tell your kids in 20 years when they say, hey, you could have done something.  What did you do?  I don't know.  I mean, that's a legitimate question.  Your kids are going to grow up.  They're going to leave Chico.  And they're going to see the world is not like this.  And they're going to come back and go, hey, you were mayor.  You were a counselor.  What did you do?  Something to think about time.  Erica and Nate, followed by Phillip Wysocki.  And if you could go ahead and line up.  If I've called your name.  All right.  Good evening, honorable council members.  My name is Erica.  This is my son, Nate.  I have been a community member here in the beautiful city of Chico on and off throughout the last 30 years.  Tonight, I am standing before you as a parent.  I am a member and a parent volunteer at the Silver Dollar BMX track, which is a fabulous organization that we love.  Now, prior to this summer, we weren't going anywhere.  It's been a roller coaster, ups and downs.  A few weeks ago, we were notified we had until the end of the year to vacate our property.  And then recently, we received word that.  Notice may be coming that we're going to be receiving a 30 day notice.  And it's an expedited timeline.  I'm just asking to allow these kids to finish their season.  Their race season goes till December 15th.  My name is Nate Smith and I'm 11 expert and I've been racing BMX for five years.  And like many other riders training all year for state 10 district top 10 to race.  I'm going to get as many points as I can.  BMX is a hard sport.  They start the season January 1st.  They go all the way to December 15th.  They get bragging rights by their plate number based on the number of races they have and the number of points they have.  This is the first time in five years that he's received a top 10 state plate.  And his goal in January was to get top 10 state top 10 district.  And those extra few weeks could give him the points that.  He needs.  He's 13 right now in district points and he's trying to get to 10.  And there are many other kids that are in the same situation.  So as you're just looking at paperwork and moving along and planning these kids have been working really hard and they're just really hoping to finish their season.  My son asked me what can we do.  And I said we can come and we can show them that there are kids that have been working hard and I'm just trying to demonstrate to him that if you set.  A goal and you do your planning you work hard you can meet your benchmark.  So thank you for everything that you're doing.  Thank you for your consideration.  And as you finalize the planning process if there's any way that you can let these kids finish their season to December 15th.  There are a whole bunch of little riders that could be out causing trouble but are instead doing constructive sports staying healthy and having fun.  Thank you for your consideration.  Thank you Philip White White sake followed by Tim Adkins.  Good evening council members members of the community.  My name is Phil White sake and I'm a parent and spouse to be a next riders be a next ride myself and the track operator and silver dollar be a nice.  The city and council have been placed in an unfortunate position of having to choose between what benefits a group of about two to three hundred individuals mostly children.  And what benefits the community as a whole.  What a horrible position.  Be placed.  In as leaders of our community on space it is an absolute no win situation.  You're damned if you do you're damned if you don't.  I think it's important for the community to know that to move that the move to our future site has spent four years in the planning and site development phase.  During that time the city and local contractors have committed resources to preparing our future site for the BMX track that is to come.  The pace and timing of the project were unfortunately accelerated by the immediate need to address the homelessness issue Chico now faces with the accelerated pace.  Came the.  Truly.  In.  Four.  We have a fortunate side effect of having to move quickly to attempt to build a BMX track.  Sadly silver dollar BMX will not be able to complete our new track before we will be asked to leave our current location and allow construction of a homeless resting site to begin.  We recognize that this decision isn't become isn't because of some malicious intent on the part of the city but as a result of a genuine need to get construction started before the weather turns.  We appreciate that the city has agreed to be flexible with us on our department on our departure date depending on what future weather allows.  However we will.  Be temporarily shut down.  We have riders who have spent the season like me.  Setting and working toward goals that they may not meet because we will be without a track on which to finish our season which ends December 15th.  The frustration that comes with this issue is exacerbated by the fact that we were shut down most of 2020 due to COVID regulations and guidelines and a sense of community responsibility.  While all of these things are highly frustrating to the BMX community the community in general and the council there is a silver lining.  Silver dollar BMX is a plan a place to go in the future.  And we're on our way to having the track facility to ride on.  We're hoping to be operational at our new location by spring of next year if not sooner.  Council members I'm here tonight to let you and the community know that we are grateful for the support that the city of Chico has shown and continues to show silver dollar BMX through the process which will eventually allow us to ride on our new track.  We wouldn't be in a position of short term temporary shutdown had the city not partnered with us to take the initial steps toward site preparation and dedicated the resources it has and continues to provide.  While the city remains open to the public.  the city has been a major partner through this process, we will need the greater Chico community  support as well. With the speed at which everything has happened, Silver Dollar BMX is left in a  position where we will need additional community support, resources, and involvement to realize  completion of our new track and facility. The future of Silver Dollar BMX is bright.  It's just going to be a matter of getting us across the finish line on our new track and  facility. We appreciate the city, the councils, and the community's involvement to date and look  forward to your continued support as we work toward getting our new track and facility up and running.  Again, thank you for your support. We look forward to continue to work with you.  Thank you. Tim Adkins, followed by Brian Perry.  Thank you. Never thought I'd see myself at the city council. Been in business here for 42 years.  To come down here and talk to you, very hard thing. I get up every morning,  five o'clock, go to work, stay there until eight o'clock every night,  have for 42 years.  Watch the town deteriorate to the point that somebody finally talked me into walking down here  and talking. So you know who I am. I'm a local business owner located on East Park Avenue. I've  been in business since 1979. I employ 70 people, three locations, soon to be four.  Before I get started, I'd like to thank Sean Morgan, his hard work for support of the CCO,  my son, and him.  He's a project manager and instructor at Chico State. He's the GM of our business now.  Lots of thanks to you for that.  Number one thing all business owners have to do to provide safe work environment for their employees,  which is getting more and more challenging in Chico.  The girls in our corporate office are constantly locking the doors during business hours because  of the homeless and transient people, the drugs, and the mental ill who wandered into the city.  We needed to ensure needed needed needed needed  safety for the citizens. All I ask is you give us the  safer city in which to live in and to do business in.  42 years. Don't tell me I haven't seen  this town and don't tell me any BS that's gone on here and don't tell  me this place wasn't the greatest place that ever walked and don't tell me that it  hasn't been completely ruined in the past 10 years, in the past  5 years, come to a dump. It is an  absolute, complete, unbelievable place when my  girls, when I have people walk into my business and  we ask for, call the police department, they come down and taser  them and ask us what's the guy doing. He spun out in my  front room, losing his mind. That's time.  Yeah, it's your time too.  Brian Perry, followed by Jessica Giannola.  My name is Brian Perry. I own and operate a very small business here in Chico  called Roses and I, the Elder Care.  It's the first time I've been to this meeting before. Not that I haven't had  issues that I share with friends and family and anyone who will listen,  but because I think I found myself  getting to a point where I was getting a little numb to everything going around me.  Prior to COVID, I'd say I was probably on the auto dialer with the  police department, non-emergency line and the emergency line.  We're located right on Lindo Channel, which many of you know  is kind of a hotbed of traffic for people going  back and forth and a hotbed of drug activity.  It also wasn't historically this way, but  is now becoming a larger and larger place for people  to move to and to set up camps.  I've had  three fires in the last five years. I have 20  residents at my assisted living home.  About 75% of them are in wheelchairs. I always have usually  three or four people who can't transfer from a wheelchair  by themselves and actually require a mechanical lift to do that transfer.  If you can imagine it, almost a year ago today, when I  got that dreaded phone call at 5.30 in the morning saying,  we've got a fire.  through your head and how fast you drive to get there four miles away from home.  It's a pretty difficult situation. You show up, it's 5.30 in the morning, it's pitch black,  one year ago, almost today, and you find all your residents huddled together in the parking lot,  freezing, waiting for the fire department to give the all clear. The fire department did their job,  they always do. And the police came down and did everything they could as well to try to figure out  what it was, but it came from another homeless camp. All three of the fires we've had were all  from camps in the area. I know you're in a tough spot. I know you've got a difficult job. You've  got everybody wanting you to throw money and resources to a variety of different projects.  I'm here really, I guess, to remind you that there's a lot of people out there who would  like to see our town cleaned up.  But there are also folks like myself who are speaking for others who average 80s and 90s,  who can't come here and speak to you today. And they're worried about their safety and their  families worried about their safety. So I'd ask you to find a way, if you can, to control the  things you can control today and to find those situations that are truly hazardous, especially  to the most vulnerable, and see if something can't be done in the midst of what's happening  from a legal standpoint.  So, thanks for your time.  Thank you. Jessica Giannola is our last speaker.  Council, I also, when I come up here to the podium and speak to you, I'm also speaking on behalf of  people who have a really tiny voice and are often ignored or shamed for being in the position  they're in.  And I have the privilege.  I have the privilege of having an education in public health and understanding the barriers they face.  I also go out to the encampments and work directly with the people out there.  So I know firsthand what their barriers are.  And when I hear community members say, we want the old Chico, the old Chico was good for some.  It was not good for everyone.  And those people it wasn't good for, those numbers increased.  The numbers multiplied.  Those people out there became so much.  That we can't ignore them anymore.  To get something similar to our old Chico, we really have to look at the heart of each other and what our values are.  Is it that we have the really nice neighborhood or is it that we're also looking to make sure that someone has at least a neighborhood that they can afford to live in?  Some people that I visit out in the encampments, they have an income.  They just don't have enough income.  Most of them are on social security.  It's not enough to rent anywhere here.  We have a waiting list for over seven years for a one bedroom unit for public housing.  Seven years.  So where are they to go in the meantime?  If we have shelters, those shelters, those are temporary.  They're not homes.  They have a lot of rules that, sure they're rules, but if you were to place yourself in that situation, live under those conditions, could you do it?  Could you give up your pets?  Could you live without your loved partner?  Because these are hard.  These are hard.  These are things that they have to face.  And if they result to self-medication because of the extreme stress and anxiety they're under, with no other option, we can't blame them.  We should be attempting to help them.  So, anyway, I would like to have a nice Chico too.  But that involves not worrying about who's being ignored out there.  Because it's hard to go home and watch TV myself knowing there's someone out there who could use my help with getting an application in.  Or trying to get an ID so they can stay in a hotel.  Because you can't stay in a hotel if you don't have an ID.  You can't even take a shower.  These are things they face.  Thank you.  That's it.  All right.  We'll move on to item four, public hearings.  Item 4.1, climate action plan update.  Mr. V.  There he is.  Welcome.  Good evening.  I'm Mayor Coolidge, Vice Mayor Reynolds, and City Council.  I just wanted to give a quick introduction to this item prior to having our consultant provide an overview of the climate action plan, or CAP, update process.  The CAP update started in early 2020, literally right before the public gathering restrictions related to COVID-19.  So I just want to share that I'm really proud of the way city staff and the consultant team work together to innovatively engage the community and keep this important planning process moving forward.  I'm also proud to share that I believe Butte County is a city that is a great place to be.  Butte County is leading the North State in climate action.  Not only is the city updating its climate action plan that was originally approved in 2012, but Butte County is currently in the process of updating its action plan that was previously approved in February 2014.  Chico State approved an aggressive climate action plan last year.  I think most of you are aware we have numerous world-renowned sustainable businesses in our community that serve as models for the private sector, most notably Sierra Nevada Brewing Company.  Through this process, it's also become clear that the state is not the only one that is doing this.  We are also proud to share that your city departments and other key institutions aren't waiting to get direction from a plan.  City staff have been proactively pursuing efforts in concert with the city's Climate Action Commission to provide the foundation for this CAP update.  Public Works O&M, in concert with Butte County, is seeking to procure carbon-neutral electricity for the community through the Butte Choice Energy Program.  They're also implementing their comprehensive PG&E Sustainable Solutions Turnkey Program to install renewable energy technology at municipal facilities.  As well as developing an urban forest master plan that will make our community more resilient to climate change.  Public Works Engineering continues to aggressively implement the Chico Bike Master Plan and also include multi-modal elements into all city capital projects to make biking and walking throughout the community more convenient and safe.  Similar innovative projects are being pursued by the Butte County Association of Governments, Chico Unified School District, Butte College, Enloe, and other major institutions.  And finally, I've learned that the City of Butte County has a strong relationship with the City of Chico.  We've learned that one of our local residential developers isn't waiting for direction from the state to go all electric.  He's currently building all electric multi-family and single family residential projects.  As he thoughtfully pointed out at our electrification workshop, consumers want it, it pencils out, and it's the right thing to do.  Again, I just want to highlight that climate action isn't just about a plan.  It's about partnerships, opportunities, and collaboration.  We have these key elements right now, and it's time to keep the momentum moving forward.  So with that quick summary, I'll hand it over to the City of Butte County Council.  With that quick introduction, I want to hand it over virtually to Ryan Gardner with Rincon Consulting.  He and his team have been outstanding to work with.  Their knowledge and skills help the City navigate what I believe is a sincere, robust, and engaging planning process.  So with that, over to Ryan, hopefully.  Can you hear us, Ryan?  I can, can you hear me?  Alright, the floor is yours.  Alright, can you see my screen?  We can.  Okay.  Alright, so let me start off.  Our goals for the capital development really, first and foremost, were to make sure that we had a SQL qualified pre-nest gas production plan.  And this has been a lot of the same to the SQL review process for new development.  It's going to save developers time and money.  It's going to allow City Council and the city in general to move forward with capital improvement projects.  And it's going to support housing and affordable housing, which is in high demand.  We also strove to align with state level goals and CARB's climate change scoping plan, which is a key requirement of that qualified greenhouse gas reduction plan status.  And we wanted to make sure we developed a cost effective roadmap to reduce greenhouse gas emissions because we wanted this plan to be implementable.  Thank you.  Thank you.  We went over the needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed  with them, it opens up the city for more funding and financing opportunities that we see coming  down the line. And also meeting these goals and having a qualified greenhouse gas reduction plan  that you can streamline CEQA off of is becoming more and more important since there are no new  greenhouse gas thresholds being provided by the air districts and the state. So really in order  to do a get a project through the greenhouse gas analysis process, you really do need to have a  climate action plan in place to get that process through without having to do a full greenhouse gas  analysis for every single project. So to start off our analysis, we really focused on the data  first so we took the historic greenhouse gas inventories and did some updated inventories and  then developed our drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug  a forecast off of that. As you can see, this kind of dark blue line here, Chico has been reducing  its per capita emissions pretty significantly over time. And you're on track to continue to  reach about a 27% reduction below 1990 levels by 2030, which is a really great start, but we still  had a little bit of a gap in order to meet the state targets. We focused on per capita, not only  because it allows the city to continue to grow without being penalized, it also helps control  for population fluxes, like we saw from the campfire. So population is really being controlled  for with these reduction targets. So off of that, once we had our inventory and forecast,  we were able to start developing greenhouse gas reduction strategies.  And we really started with doing outreach to the public. In May and June of 2020, as Brendan  mentioned, we had a lot of work to do to get to the point where we could get to the point where  needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed  needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed  needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed  needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed  needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed  needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed  specifically on electrification with developers to kind of hear about their concerns or any  hurdles they saw from having that specific action take place in Chico. And then in November and  December of 2020, we did a virtual community feedback workshop on our key greenhouse gas  reduction strategies. And we had over 4,400 community members review that document and  got comments from a smaller subset of that. And then in March of 2021, we had a community-wide  building electrification workshop where we then got really great feedback from some local  developers on their success doing building electrification. And then more recently,  the CAP and the ISND, which is a CEQA document, went out for public review and public comment.  And then we got a go-ahead recommendation from the Climate Action Commission in September.  This slide is just a little bit of the graphics that we used to communicate with the community  during COVID. So we had our conveyor site where the community could make comments right on here.  And we also had a video up on YouTube that had a lot of information around what we were looking at.  And Brendan kind of cruised through a lot of these, but for our greenhouse gas reduction  strategies in each sector, we really looked at what Chico was doing already and then worked to  build on that. And then we also looked at what Chico was doing already and then worked to build  off of that and make minor tweaks. So looking at Butte Choice Energy, which will help provide  lower carbon electricity to the city, it really means that electrifying buildings, both new and  existing, is going to have even more benefit. Same for electrifying vehicles. On waste, we looked at  state requirements for SB 1383, which are already underway, that'll reduce organic waste 75% by 2025.  And then carbon sequestration, which is going to be a big part of that. And then we also looked at  the city's urban forest revitalization program and urban forest master plan to quantify the benefits  of those programs and make sure we're getting credit for that. And then finally, outreach,  making sure that we continue to work with this community, businesses, and other stakeholders  to actually implement this plan and get those behavioral changes we need.  And then finally, we understand that the city's urban forest revitalization program is going to be  a big part of that. So we're going to be working with the city's urban forest revitalization program  to actually implement that. And then finally, we understand that a lot of, for this plan to be  implementable, we need to have funding and financing for these actions. So we worked with our partners  at Hip Investor to come up with a funding and financing map that lays out opportunities for  getting grants, getting direct resources from the state and other locations to do these projects. So  this map highlights both opportunities as well as case studies that the city can follow to actually  implement this plan. And then finally, we understand that a lot of, for this plan to be implementable,  we need to have funding and financing for these actions. So we're going to be working with our partners  getting grants, getting direct resources from the city to do these projects.  And then finally, the CAP has an entire implementation section. We're already beginning to implement the CAP,  and that'll continue kind of through 2045. CAP successes will be evaluated on a biannual monitoring  basis. So looking at kind of progress and implementation every other year. And then a major reevaluation  should happen around 2045. And then finally, we understand that a lot of, for this plan to be implementable,  we need to have funding and financing for these projects. So we're going to be working with our partners  and then an update around 2030. And that's, again, to just keep consistent with the state recommendations.  And with that, I will wrap up and happy to answer any of your questions you might have or go into more detail  wherever you like.  All right. Thank you, Ryan. Any questions for Ryan?  No? All right. Or Mr. Big?  Okay. So no questions for staff. We'll move on to the public hearing. We'll open the public hearing.  How many speakers do we have on this item?  We have eight.  All right. Three minutes, please.  Okay. So as I call both names, if you could come up and line up.  Jared Geiser, followed by Ann Bykerk-Kaufman.  Good evening, Council. I come to you tonight to urge you to adopt the Climate Action Plan.  I was here about two or three weeks ago. I'm going to be doing a little bit of a review of the plan.  I was here about two or three weeks ago to ask you to keep the Climate Action Commission  because of the vital role they can play in helping Chico address climate change,  one of the greatest threats to humanity, one of the greatest threats to our security on this planet  and in this community. And the Climate Action Commission has been working on this hard with the consultants.  And as you heard in the presentation, it's pretty comprehensive.  And it's a really good plan. I've been reviewing it, and I'm really happy with a lot of the measures  and goals they outline in there. And I think the city needs to not only adopt but implement this.  So I urge you to please adopt this plan that the city's been putting resources to,  to support developing. So state law requires that this be adopted.  Another benefit of it is it will expedite housing developments.  We have a housing crisis right now, and by having this Climate Action Plan,  it will expedite the CEQA process that is required for housing development.  So there's value in that without jeopardizing some of the value in CEQA  in actually protecting our environment. I think this is a valuable component of it.  And the reduction measures, which are the ones that are important,  as identified in the plan, not only benefit climate change,  but as identified in the staff report, bring about multiple co-benefits to the community as well.  And so I urge you to adopt this plan and implement the plan and take action consistently  to meet the goals identified in the plan. Thank you.  Thank you. And Biker Kaufman, followed by Chelsea Barron.  And can we get the time put on the screen?  Oh, okay.  Hi.  Thank you for considering adopting this Climate Action Plan.  This Climate Action Plan is a win-win for everybody involved.  It's good for developers.  Without it, they would have to be on their own and develop their own mitigation plans  in their environmental impact process.  And if the city has a plan, they can just say,  we're going to follow the city plan.  And in general, the various measures in this plan,  cost a lot less money than doing nothing.  Personally, I really like the aspects of this plan that deal with transportation,  especially following the bicycle plan for TECO,  improving bicycle infrastructure.  It is really low-hanging fruit.  Every time somebody takes a bicycle instead of a car,  it saves a tremendous amount of greenhouse gas emissions.  So improving bicycle infrastructure is a very inexpensive thing to do  that has a big bang for the buck.  So I'm really glad that that is part of this plan.  The rest of the plan is really excellent, too.  So I encourage you to adopt this plan and to implement it.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Chelsea Barron, followed by Mark Steeman.  Good evening, Council.  I'm a member of the Council of the City of  I'm a TECO State student, and I'm really excited for the Climate Action Plan.  I listened to the presentation probably five times by now,  because I've been to almost every single meeting the Climate Action Commission has put forth.  I wholeheartedly think that you should adopt this plan.  I think that it's important that the California state law has required it going forward,  and that these measures will cost less in the long run,  and that the cost of doing nothing will be so much more than what we're doing.  It will be worth the houses that might be burned.  It might...  I don't want to have another Paradise Fire.  I want just trees and solar, and I want the ability to come to Chico for my alumni reunion in 30 years.  And without the city adopting this Climate Action Plan,  each development must develop their own Climate Action Plan for the project as part of the EIR process.  And that's going to cost developers money.  They're not going to come here for that, because we didn't put one forth.  And yeah, the youth are watching.  They're watching if you're going to go forward, and we really hope that you do tonight.  Thank you.  Mark Steeman, followed by Melis Bonifacio-Jerez.  Good evening.  I ask that you approve this Climate Action... this Climate Mitigation Plan.  It's required by the City of Ixchel.  It's also required by our children.  As one climate expert put it, we basically have three choices going forward.  Mitigation, adaptation, or suffering.  Now we're going to do some of each.  The question is, what's the mix going to be?  The more mitigation we do, the less adaptation will be required, and the less suffering there will be.  Some of the mitigation measures in this plan may seem like a radical change in the way we shelter ourselves, move ourselves around.  They are.  They need to be.  Because climate change is real, and we're already experiencing its effects.  The majority of Americans know that climate change is due to our burning of fossil fuels.  But most people are shocked to learn that over half the greenhouse gases ever emitted by humans have been emitted since 1989.  In other words, the way we've been living the past 32 years, in huge houses, spread out far from each other, far from where we work,  has produced over half the greenhouse gases we've ever emitted.  That way of living must evolve for the emissions to stop, and for the suffering to be avoided.  This plan is the first step in that direction.  Some out there recognize the changes we need to make, and they don't want to do it.  They want to maintain the status quo of the last 32 years.  At least until they die.  And that's just unconscionable.  And I'm not the only one who thinks so.  Thomas Jefferson wrote in the Declaration of Independence that the history of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations,  all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute tyranny over these states from a distant land.  Jefferson wrote about tyranny not only in spatial terms, but also in temporal terms.  Time.  Jefferson was arguing with James Madison over a dam that would provide water power for a mill, but forever destroy an adjacent forest.  Madison supported the dam for economic reasons.  Jefferson opposed it.  He said no.  Writing, he wrote,  The earth belongs to the living.  No man by natural right may impose upon the earth a debt greater than can be repaid in his lifetime.  For if he could, the earth would belong to the dead, not the living.  In Jefferson's terms, climate change is generational tyranny,  because the people in power will be nodding around to suffer the consequences of their decisions.  In a paper released last month, researchers found that 45% of teens and young adults say climate anxiety is affecting their lives and their ability to function,  and this distress is linked to their government's failure to respond to the crisis.  So the question before you is simple.  Which side are you on?  Do you stand with youth or generational tyranny?  Thank you.  Thank you.  Melis Bonifacio-Jerez, followed by Kirk Mumford.  Thank you.  Where I grew up, there was smoke.  From smokestacks to trucks, there were pollutants everywhere.  Children growing up in my neighborhood back east are diagnosed with asthma at higher rates than the national average.  My brother has asthma.  My friend died of it.  Now I have it.  I have lived through several wildfires in the past three years while being a student at Chico.  I was here when the Camp Fire happened.  I remember the sky full of red.  Every year I see a red sky.  Every year I breathe in the ash of memories made by families and people in different towns.  I may not know all their names and stories, but I know what it's like to live through fire.  My asthma is getting worse.  I now have to carry an inhaler with me during fire season because the smoke and the ash is too much for my lungs.  How much longer until I will need a machine to help me breathe?  How much longer until I myself succumb to it like my friend did when she was only 15 years old?  Climate change is here.  It's real.  It's impacting us as a community more than you may think.  I smell smoke.  I get anxious.  I can't concentrate in school around this time because of the climate change.  I'm afraid of the climate anxiety.  What future do Chico State students have if our own city council won't act on implementing solutions?  Sooner or later, you'll have to deal with the ramifications of waiting until there's not much we can do.  I support the implementation of the Chico Climate Action Plan.  All the measures within this plan cost less than the cost of doing nothing.  If you thought retention rates were bad now for students,  just wait until we are engulfed in other ways.  Just wait until we are engulfed in another wildfire.  Just wait until we lose another town.  Just wait until it starts to hurt your pockets.  You have a choice.  I need you to act on it.  Students' lives depend on it.  And so do yours.  Thank you.  Kirk Munford, followed by Susan Tichuti.  Good evening.  I assume you guys are going to pass this.  I've been reminded a couple times that state law is what it is.  But what I want to urge you to do is not only pass it, but fund it.  And act with enthusiasm.  Because in a way, the pandemic has been sort of a warm-up for what we face with climate change.  And that required the cooperation of all of humanity to get us through that.  And we didn't do a very good job.  So we had a practice round.  It only cost us 700,000 people in this country, at least.  Probably millions worldwide.  Climate action is going to, climate change is going to be even more dreadful.  So we don't get to pick the challenge.  The challenge is there.  We've got to act.  And we can either act reluctantly with evasion and kicking and screaming.  Or we can do it with some kind of enthusiasm.  And I urge you to do it with enthusiasm.  Because this will require the cooperation not only of every nation state in the world.  And every county and state.  And every little bird like ours.  And every individual.  We all need to get on board with this thing.  And to act with enthusiasm would mean doing things like, well, don't wait until you're forced to get a vaccine.  Or when you're forced to do one thing or another.  I mean, you can choose now if you can afford it.  And a lot of us can.  To take steps to try to reduce your fossil fuel consumption.  Because that's what this whole plan is about.  It's getting rid of fossil fuels by 2045.  Right?  I've been inquiring already about heat pumps.  As opposed to getting rid of my HVAC system.  I can wait for the state to mandate that.  But if I can afford it, maybe I can do that early.  I've already got an electric water heater.  And it's driven by solar panels.  And I did all that not because it was cost effective when I did it.  But because it made some kind of sense in terms of climate action.  And I could afford it.  This is going to be...  Acting with enthusiasm.  And voluntarily is something that really provides us with an opportunity.  I mean, already investment companies in the market has decided that climate action is an investment opportunity.  Investment is way down in drilling for new oil.  They're not even replacing the stocks.  BP and Exxon, Mobil.  Oh, sorry.  I misread it.  Well, everybody will profit.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Susan Tichutti, followed by Jessica Giannola.  Hello, councillors.  My name is Susan Tichutti.  And I am the co-host of Ecotopia on KCET.  And I'm the co-host of the KCFR, which is an environmental show.  And over the past ten years, we've interviewed many, many experts with urgent messages about the climate.  And also practical solutions, ways that we can begin to mitigate the impact of CO2 emissions.  What I greatly appreciate about the CAP update is that it is very specific, very concrete, and very practical.  It has detailed measures and actions that will lead us to create a safer, healthier community.  It talks a lot about electrification, making residential buildings, commercial buildings, municipal buildings more energy efficient, but also using local renewable energy sources.  It will have a huge impact.  It also recommends, and other people have referred to this, development patterns that will also mitigate the impact of CO2 emissions.  And that is avoiding urban sprawl and having concrete neighborhood, infill neighborhoods where people can bicycle, where they can walk, where, and have transportation systems.  Right.  And also, I think, one of the things that we've been working on is the development of systems that are efficient and usable.  I think one thing that we have not known a lot about is the plan to mitigate the impact of organic waste.  And the state already has something coming in 2022 to have digesters or have systems so that we're not putting organic waste into landfill.  Organic waste, as you know, has a huge carbon footprint and even produces more carbon than we would have expected.  And that's more dangerous than methane.  And then it talks about creating green spaces and the urban forest and trees.  We know that good farming practices and good green land helps sequester carbon.  And trees, as we know, take in carbon.  And so all of these, and there are many, many plans for doing this.  And I think that it is, number one, important to support the plan, but also to put the money behind it where it will work well.  So I appreciate your time and I appreciate your efforts to help this part of our beautiful community.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Our last speaker is Jessica Giannola.  This item here, it's a nonpartisan issue.  This is something that affects all of us.  And all of this will benefit from moving forward on any mitigation efforts we can with affecting our environment, building better.  Once we know better, we should do better kind of thing and planning ahead.  I certainly support this action plan. I hope that you do as well.  And I hope that you pass it forward and then take those extra steps.  And if you are not understanding yet what people are talking about, we have Chico State here.  We have people who are very, very informed with the environmental impacts and the fires that we see and the water loss that we're experiencing and the heat rising.  All of those are impacts that we're feeling, but they're going to get worse.  And it's going to take a long time for them to reverse, and they will only reverse if we're changing our behaviors.  And if we can build those requirements into our planning and our building codes, then that's helping our builders moving forward, too.  And I'm hearing it's the law, too, so why wait until we're forced to and spend money on litigation if we don't have to?  So I just really support us doing better.  Since we know better and do what we can for our future and our children's future as well.  Thank you.  Thank you.  That was our last speaker.  All right.  We'll close the public hearing.  Any further comments from council?  Go ahead, Councilman Brown.  Yeah.  I just have a couple of questions.  So if this passes tonight, this may be a question for staff or the consultants.  What's the next step for planning?  Or for the plan and implementing its components?  I know that there is a timeline for some of those items, but what can the community expect next?  Well, as I kind of mentioned and Ryan also echoed, a lot of these things, a lot of the pillars are already underway in many ways.  So it's just making sure we continue to be committed to those actions.  The efforts with coordination with Butte County and the Community Choice Aggregation, the PG&E Turnkey Program.  So their master plan for the forest.  Urban Forest Master Plan is already underway.  So it's just continuing to commit to those.  And then checking in, like Ryan shared, on progress and making sure that things aren't falling off.  There are some things that we'll be looking at that I'm hopeful we don't have to have a stretch code.  We don't have to move before the state.  You know, the state should be the leader.  These are their goals.  But there are some deadlines and some commitments to some timelines in the future where we say,  we'll have to do an education.  We'll have to do an education outreach and consider perhaps stretch codes to go all electric prior to the state.  Again, we tried to work to coordinate those dates with the next update of the state's green building code.  And so I'm hopeful that that would be something that would be slow and involved and engage the community, engage the council.  Again, we check to see if we're meeting our benchmarks.  So I think that's what the community can expect.  And then things will be kind of circling back and we'll continue to work with our partners.  Because it's not just about the city.  It's about the other groups like Butte County Association of Governments that are also working on these efforts  and engaging them and making sure that they're continuing with their efforts  and educating ourselves and seeing where we can support each other.  Thank you.  I'm actually glad you mentioned partnerships because that was my next question.  They will obviously need to be leveraged in order to ensure that this particular plan is successful.  Is it your sense that we have a level of buy-in and engagement with these partners,  particularly?  And is that particularly BCAG and the Butte County, Butte Choice Energy Authority Board in order to make some of these changes?  I'd say 100 percent.  You know, even before the Climate Action Commission, when they were the sustainability task force,  over six years, we kind of had repeat meetings every two years.  And every time they came back, they were doing something more innovative, more thoughtful.  You know, it's for BCAG in particular with Beeline, there's some challenges with their ridership.  It just is a challenge.  But it's not due to lack of effort on their part, I believe.  And so we continue those engagements.  We share with them that we're happy to support their efforts.  So, yes, I believe Chico Unified shared their efforts.  I mean, they're taking their facilities to new levels just like we are with ours.  So I have no concerns about our partners.  Very glad to hear it.  Thank you.  Anyone else?  I can actually just echo that.  I serve on the BCAG committee, and every time we have a meeting, it's just about we're talking about ways of electric buses  and putting in different things.  That are timetables where they're looking at a bus now.  Actually, sorry, a train that will eventually hopefully be coming from Chico all the way down to Sacramento.  That will be easier for getting people back and forth and maybe help some ridership and not so many cars driving down to the airport eventually.  So BCAG's definitely on board and doing what they're supposed to be doing.  All right.  Any further comments?  Entertain a motion.  I'll move to adopt the initial study negative declaration and approve the climate action plan update by resolution.  Easy motion to make.  Second.  All right.  We have a motion by Council Member Brown.  Seconded by Vice Mayor Reynolds.  Council Member Bennett.  I almost got that backwards.  Sorry.  Council Member Bennett.  Yes.  Council Member Brown.  Aye.  And thanks to.  Everybody who worked on this.  Council Member Morgan.  Yes.  Council Member O'Brien.  Yes.  Council Member Tandon.  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds.  Yes.  Mayor Coolidge.  Aye.  Carry 7-0.  All right.  And normally we wait until around 7-3 to take a break, but the next item may take a little while.  So we're going to take a short break now and then we'll come back soon.  All right.  Let's start it back up here.  Okay.  If we could have everybody take a seat, please.  We're going to continue on with the discussion.  We're going to continue on with the regular agenda item 5.1, the Inlow Medical Center area parking plan presentation by our consultant.  But we'll start with, we're going to go straight to the consultant.  All right.  Bobby, get off easy tonight.  There you go.  Bikram, we'll kick it off for you.  Presentation.  Do we have the consultant on Zoom?  Actually, no.  Actually, they can be.  They can be here, so I'll be presenting.  Oh, okay.  So if you can load the.  Then get the memo.  No problem.  Fire away.  Good evening, everyone.  So, yeah, so our consultant had prior commitment, so they couldn't be here today, so I'll be presenting.  For Chico and Low.  We went to the drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug  issues so some of the main concerns are around hospital residents can't find parking spaces  they can't find parking near their homes so most of the complaints were they have to park a few  blocks away from their homes and bring groceries you know further away from their homes so that  was really challenging also some people blocking their driveway so they can't get out some people  parking near their garbage cans so the service doesn't pick up their trash cans so it's hard for  them so these are kind of the some of the issues that we heard at the workshop and we also work  with Kena the Chico Avenue group as well because the hospital and the project area is within the  Kena boundary so we work with Kena and low-end residents to kind of come up with some sort of  plan how can we get the people parking near their garbage cans so the service doesn't pick up  parking near their garbage cans so the service doesn't pick up parking near their garbage cans so the  can we tackle this plan we also did a survey on between March and April in 2018 online survey  where we were trying to reach out to other members of the community in the area who couldn't make it  to the workshop to get their feedback so based on the survey we found that majority of the  residents had difficult time parking find difficult time to find parking near their  homes so we're trying to reach out to other members of the community in the area who couldn't  find parking near their homes so we went to drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug So, the next step was to kind of go out and collect parking occupancy data. How many spaces are available there near the hospital on those streets? So, that data was collected in January 2019  to understand supply and demand.  So the peak occupancy is around noontime, lunchtime.  And then after about 6 p.m., the occupancy decreases.  More parking spaces are available after 6 p.m. around hospital.  So also we saw that most of the streets near the hospital are near capacity.  That means 100% occupied.  So the next step was after getting all the data,  working with the KANA and the residents,  the next step was to come up with a plan based on industry practice  and needs of residents and the medical center.  So we worked with our parking consultant, Dixon.  We brought them on board to prepare a plan.  They worked with, they had several meetings with KANA group  and medical, I don't know, medical center.  And also there was online meetings with the residents to,  let me go back, to kind of come up with this plan, implementation plan.  So they used the industry best practice.  The Dixon, they've been working with different cities.  Different counties in different area of the countries with parking issues,  similar kind of issues.  So they have a lot of experience solving these kind of problems  and coming up with different solutions to implement.  So the next step was for them to kind of prepare a plan.  They evaluated also the parking garage, the antelope parking garage.  They have a forced level parking garage for their visitors.  And they have a forced level parking garage for their visitors.  And their employees.  They also looked at the valet parking for antelope.  And also on street parking.  They also look at wayfinding signage.  And recommended some of the improvements for wayfinding.  They also looked at option for remote parking for antelope hospital.  So they came up with this phased approach plan.  There are three different phased in the plan.  So phase one.  Phase two and phase three.  Phase one is the first one.  And this is, you know, we can do phase one.  And we may not have to do phase two and phase three based on the recommendation.  Phase one may solve most of the issues.  And we may never have to do phase two and phase three.  I'll go in more detail for phase one, phase two, phase three in my further slides.  But just keep in mind that phase one, we may have to do just phase one. So, our consultant also had a community meeting almost a year ago. It was an online meeting due to the COVID. They heard all the complaints and issues  We may not have to do phase two and phase three in our plan.  We may not have to do phase two and phase three in our plan.  We may not have to do phase two and phase three in our plan.  We may not have to do phase two and phase three in our plan.  We may not have to do phase two and phase three in our plan.  We may not have to do phase two and phase three in our plan.  also deals with the parking as well so they were they were invited as well so they heard all the  complaints and issues and work with you know all these groups and also we did a second online  survey that was done in november 30 through february 17 2020 we got 64 responses from the  residents and four from the nlo employees so what the majority believe that some employees  should be allowed to park on on the resident streets residential streets and also the time  limits could be used along with a permit program so how does that work is we could allow two hour  parking on residential streets where a patient or a customer can come in park for two hours  and go to the hospital, but the residents will get permit where they can park all day in front of their homes.  And they're willing to pay less than $30 for an annual permit for their resident.  So the phase one basically includes wayfinding and parking guidance.  Guidance that's signage, better signage to find a garage.  Like customers may not know that there's a garage.  So a better signage at major intersections, leading patients and customers to the garage so they can park in the garage.  And the on-street parking can be available for residents.  And then also clearly label free valet parking.  A lot of people don't.  They don't want to pay for valet.  They think that it's, you know, they have to pay, but it's free at Enloe.  So maybe labeling it, it's free and they don't have to pay anything.  That will help as well.  Also installing sensors and digital signage in the garage.  So as an example, on the bottom right, it shows how many spaces are available.  This is taken from a different city.  If something is installed.  Something like that.  That can show that, hey, there are spaces available in the garage.  So park in the garage and the available streets can be available for residents.  So we got a lot of question about 85% occupancy.  You know, the study talks about 85% occupancy.  What that means is there was some confusion.  What that means is if the occupancy reaches 85%.  And on streets, then you need to find solutions to improve parking.  In the garage, we want 100% occupied.  We want fill the garage and then make spaces available on the streets.  That's our goal.  That city's, you know, goal and this is what we want to do.  But there was confusions about, you know, 85%.  We want to fill the streets and not fill the garage.  But we want to fill up the garage with 100% and then make available spaces on the street.  That's our goal.  And then this is, say, finding and parking guidance, signage and striping.  That can be done quickly with resources.  And then the next step would be the parking district.  That will take more time.  We'll have to work with the residents and the KANA group to kind of lay out, you know, where we want the provincial parking.  We'll have a map where, you know, we work with them and kind of come up.  We'll have a map where we work with them and kind of come up with the parking.  We'll have a map where we work with them and kind of come up with the parking.  How far we have to go from the hospital.  How many blocks away from the hospital we want to create this parking district.  And then bring it forward to the council for approval.  So that process will take longer.  And each household will get permits.  And they will be able to park in front of their homes and have, you know, a number of permits.  Right now I think we allow five.  in the current district.  Then also we can introduce two-hour time limit  within that area.  So if anyone is going to the hospital,  they can park there for two hours  and the residents and their guests  can park longer than two hours.  We also have to update our municipal code for this.  So that will require an update.  And we'll have to do no reparking.  So if they park for two hours,  they can't repark either in the same block  or we can create zones so we can set up.  There are different ways to set it up.  So within our municipal code,  we can come up with language  that you can't repark in a block or in a zone.  So that will need to be done.  And then also we have to provide enough enforcement.  If we don't provide enforcement, then it doesn't work.  We have to work with enforcement.  Right now we have handheld units  that our enforcement officers use.  Those are not very efficient.  They currently enforce in downtown  and some other areas.  So to be more efficient,  we're working on a license plate reader system.  So we're trying to get two license plate reader systems,  which will be a lot more efficient.  How does that work?  Is there cameras on the vehicles, two vehicles?  They can drive around.  And they'll trigger if the parking is not paid  or if it doesn't have a permit,  notify the driver and then the officer,  they can give a ticket.  So it's a lot more efficient versus what we do now.  So that's where we're heading with our LPR system.  On the bottom, there's a picture that shows  what the camera looks like.  And we're hoping to implement this  in the next few months.  Hopefully beginning of 2022.  We already have someone on board to provide a cost  and we're working through the contract and all that for now.  This will also help us to collect the occupancy data.  Once we have this system,  we can collect the data with this system.  It'll be a lot more efficient.  This will give us the information  about occupancy of different streets.  You know,  what percentage parking is available on those streets.  So this will be a lot easier to get that data.  So we don't have to go out and collect that data.  It'll be available when they drive around.  It'll be collecting that data and it'll be available  for staff to examine and make adjustments based on the data.  We can make policy adjustments or time limit adjustments.  So the other things can be done under phase one will be,  can be done under phase two.  So we can do education for their employees,  give maybe raffles, coupons.  So they, you know,  to park in the garage or carpool, you know,  some other options.  Maybe, you know, with COVID now a lot of remote work,  a lot of companies are doing remote work.  If there's a possibility,  allow staff to work remotely from home.  So they don't have to come, you know,  in the office and, you know,  so do that as well.  Also ride sharing programs.  There are a lot of ridesharing programs.  Maybe work with some companies and provide ride sharing.  Also carpooling, maybe provide some coupons or raffles  for staff who does carpool.  Also there's a guaranteed ride home program,  which how does that work is if two people are carpooling,  and let's say if one person has emergency,  they can use that free ride program.  They'll give them a free ride, carpooling, and they can use it.  So they can use it to get home if they have an emergency.  So they don't have to worry about it.  So once we have that phase two,  as I explained is not necessary.  We may not have to do this after collecting data.  We may find that, hey, parking is working fine.  You know, people can find parking easily.  There's no real issues.  So we don't have to do phase two,  or we may have to do it, you know, down the road,  maybe in 10 years.  We don't know that.  So at that time, you know,  we can do some policy adjustments.  We can reduce time limits,  or we can do install some pay stations,  a multi-space pay stations,  as shown on the right side of the screen.  These are not meters like downtown.  These are not like in front of your homes,  you know, a resident's home, a meter after meter.  These are a multi-space, like one per block.  So people can park, you know, one by one, and they can use it.  So people can park and pay at these stations.  This could be done to improve parking as well.  This is one of the options where you can allow people  to park and stay longer and pay, you know,  for, to stay longer than two hours.  How does that help is the revenue from parking  could be used for improvement in the neighborhood,  for streets.  If there's additional leftover revenue, that could be spent,  then on sidewalks or improvement of streets.  So that could be one of the solution.  Phase three is, you know,  once we are done with phase one or phase two,  phase three is another phase that we can consider.  Offer more parking.  I know LO offered in the past Chico Nuts or more parking.  Have a shuttle program where employees can park  in their, in that parking.  And shuttles take them to the hospital.  And then also LO can work on the garage expansion.  I know it's very expensive.  So that'll be kind of the last option.  So during the construction,  they can also provide remote parking  and then provide shuttle program if they plan to  do the expansion on the garage.  So that's the plan.  Also, we took this item to the internal affairs,  October four, and the direction was to take this  to the council as soon as possible.  And we are here.  So staff is asking to accept the plan and with any comments.  And then we'll have to still have to bring back,  if we want to do the PPD, the parking permit,  we'll have to bring that back to the council.  But we can, if we get traction,  we can work on the striping where we can stripe the streets  where parking can be improved and also signage.  Those things can be done in the phase one,  but for a parking permit district,  we'll have to work with the neighborhood  and bring that back to the council for approval.  With that, I'll be happy to answer any questions.  All right. Any questions?  Let's start down here.  Council Member Brown.  I have a few questions, but since this came to us  with no recommendation from IAC,  and I'm assuming there was some additional vetting  that happened in internal affairs,  I'd love to hear from some of the members  about their reactions, the community's reactions,  just to get us up to speed a little bit there.  Sure.  I think we had a pretty robust discussion while we were  in internal affairs.  The neighbor, there was, I don't know,  we had about 30 probably-ish people in there, 35 people.  Some really great written comments.  A lot of people felt that some of it didn't go far enough.  Some of it wasn't soon enough.  Some of it wanted phase three to be phase one.  Phase one to be phase three, you know, that kind of thing.  So I think the general consensus was they, I remember,  there was one gal in particular that says,  she's been talking about this since, I don't know,  for 50 years because this is her family home.  And I said, I definitely don't want to be having this conversation  when her children have that home 50 years from now.  So we definitely should move forward at minimum with phase one  and then go.  But I see some of those lovely faces here tonight,  so I'm sure we'll hear some of that feedback as well.  But in general, most of the people were in favor  of moving forward with the, similar to what they have,  we have over in the Mansion District,  type of parking.  I say that in general, not all.  I appreciate it.  Thank you for the context.  Were you going to add something, Mr. Bennett?  Go for it.  Okay.  If this is passed by the council and you receive a green light,  how soon, and I know this is putting you on the spot,  but how soon can actions actually begin,  such as creating, I call them parking stalls,  but they're T's, I think you call them T's.  How soon can that happen?  Is it real soon or is it going to be a long time?  I would say at least six months because in the winter times,  typically we don't stripe, the paint doesn't stick very well.  So at least minimum it will be six months,  probably be spring or summer of next year.  And I don't see why we can't do that by then.  Once we have a plan and then we can, our operation and maintenance staff,  can go out there and stripe those.  Okay.  And you mentioned that the preferred preferential parking district will take  some time to gather all of the information and talk with all the neighbors  about how this is going to be structured.  Can you make an intelligent guess about, not that you're not intelligent,  but can you make a guess how long you think that might take?  You know the personality of the folks that are,  are concerned about this.  So what do you think?  Yeah, no, this is kind of tough one, but you know,  it includes working with residents, you know,  getting can out there by and working with and low also updating our municipal code,  working with our attorney, you know, preparing all that.  I would say probably two years just to be, yeah.  Based on my experience.  But Bob, I don't know if you want to.  Say something different.  I would say less than a year.  Less than a year.  Yeah.  If you, if the council sees it as a priority,  we certainly can do it and within the next year.  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right.  Further questions?  I do have another question.  Go ahead.  As I'm sure you, you know,  we've been getting a handful of emails from residents in the area with some  questions.  Some actually very reasonable questions.  And one of the questions that was presented by a resident of the  neighborhood was,  can the city actually do anything to require and low to support the plan?  And I guess that's question one.  I have a follow-up though.  So city will work.  I mean, we have a good relationship with LL.  We work on a lot of different things and we work at the partner.  You know, we work on many things, many different things with LL.  And I think with this one,  we want to work together with LL and residents and Canada,  and we have the same problem.  I mean, the goal is to fix the parking and they both acknowledge that.  And I think they want to work with us.  And I don't see why we can't, you know, resolve these issues,  but it's just kind of working with everyone together and solving the same  issue.  Sure.  I think one of the concerns that was raised that I think is very,  very reasonable is that it appears that the residents themselves would be  responsible.  We'll be kind of carrying the financial burden, right?  Of purchasing those parking permits.  Is there an investment on the part of end load to do some of the signage  updates, some of these implement,  some of this technology to get better utilization of the parking structure  they currently have.  I mean, we can definitely work with them.  That's something I mean, on, in my experience,  LL has worked with us and, you know,  financially helped us with, for example,  is,  you know,  we are installing a flashing beacon on sixth and Esplanade and,  and LL was willing to help us financially with that project.  But, you know,  I can't promise that, you know,  they will do any, you know, anything, but we can always fit my past experience.  They've been helping, you know, with us, they've been working with us together.  And I don't see why we can't work in the future.  But, you know,  it'll be up to them to, you know, how they can help with,  with those kinds of things.  Okay.  So it would be ultimately up to them.  That was my main question.  Mr.  Yes.  I know that Bill Seguin is here from, from Enloe.  So if he's going to be speaking,  he could probably speak to some of those questions.  Obviously we can't force them to do,  but I think that they are a willing partner as Bikram had noted.  And so I'm sure if they're a speaker as a part of this,  they'll be able to help answer some of those.  Great.  I think that's key.  As I know,  you know,  have you analyzed how the parking district,  sorry,  can you elaborate a little bit as to the utilization of the parking district?  And how much of the Enloe medical center parking structure and how under  utilization can be mitigated by the city,  if at all.  So based on our experience,  the first three floors are occupied almost like 85% garage.  Fourth floor is less occupied.  Sometimes,  you know,  it's not 85% occupied.  So there's some,  you know,  some availability on those floors where,  you know,  I think we can work,  we can work with some tools where we can fill those spaces.  So I think there's opportunities where we can work to increase that occupancy  in the garage.  And that's why we want to use these tools to,  you know,  deter people to park on the streets and then have them park in the garage.  So all these tools that we talked about can help increase occupancy in the  garage and make more spaces available in the,  on the street.  So,  you know,  But based on our experience,  we have seen the first three floors have been pretty full.  The fourth one has some capacity.  Okay.  Yeah.  I think some of these questions kind of come from the idea that there's a lot in there  about what and low medical center could do.  Um,  and as part of this plan,  but it's not,  you know,  our goal is to suggestions,  right?  Yeah.  Our goal is to fill the garage.  So 100%.  That's our,  our goal.  Okay.  And the last question,  uh,  again from a resident, have you analyzed how the parking district might impact  Citrus Elementary School, which has no dedicated parking of its own?  So that's definitely, you know, we will, as I said,  the PPD will have to look at, you know, lay out the map  and kind of figure out, you know, how that will impact. So we may have to go further,  you know, because we don't want people to  park in, you know, we don't want the problem to go  from one block to another block. So that's why we'll have to work with the  residents, you know, we'll have to consider how far we have to go with our  PPD so the impact doesn't, you know, overflow  onto the other neighbors, basically. So that's something we'll have to work with  the neighbors. Thanks for answering. Can I just add one  quick thing that did come up in the internal affairs that I think would help that,  and Enloe did speak to it, and they may again tonight, but  Enloe has the ability to  strengthen the  They have the ability to incentivize, they have the ability to  do as much as they can on parking, but they actually  can't, from an HR standpoint, legally demand where their  employees park. They mentioned that being an issue. So  as much as they're, I think they're trying to do, I think they just got to be careful on an  HR aspect as far as that goes. And then there was also mentioned  the, I think it's the ambulance company  that is not actually  part of the  Enloe, that there's some issues that they're down, but they're not part of Enloe. So that's like a separate conversation that we would have to have to get compliance because it sounds like their employees are all parking right in that one area. And I think the lady who had that house was at internal affairs because there's a lot of congestion in that area, which doesn't, it's kind of because it's ambulances. It seems like it's Enloe where it's actually not Enloe.  So.  Right. Any other questions? No. All right. How many speakers do we have on this item?  We have nine.  Okay.  Let's do three minutes.  All right. And our first speaker  is Jeff House, followed by Bill  Segeier.  Council and staff,  my name again is Jeff House. I live  at 229 West 7th Avenue  and I've been there since 1983.  I have also recently  retired from Enloe after starting  there in 1977.  I'm not represented by  I'm an individual household.  I'm going to be talking about the report mainly.  So Representative Friend-Dixon in the Internal Affairs Committee stated the following.  We need to make data-driven decisions, and data is important.  The data in this report is old and no longer valid.  The parking survey was completed in January of 2019, which was three months after the campfire.  Feather River Hospital patients were being absorbed by Enloe and Oroville.  200 long-term beds were burned to the ground.  Of course, the parking was bad then.  Things have changed since, and studies and the report need to be updated.  Additional parking users need to be in the mix other than Enloe residents.  The Nash customers parked two blocks down in front of my street, in front of my house, on 7th Avenue.  And as just was mentioned.  Citrus School doesn't have a parking lot for the 4th Avenue people.  Between 10 and 20 spaces could be gained on the street if the bull belts were removed.  Approximately 6 to 10 parking spots are red-curbed over on 4th Avenue.  And in order to start Phase 1, parts of Magnolia, Arcadian, and my street, 7th Avenue,  would have to be paved as there's no shoulders and you can't stripe on dirt.  As far as the LPR cameras, have the residents been notified that there will be license plate recognition cameras patrolling the streets?  No survey question was related to this.  And do I want cameras capturing images and sending them to fusion centers?  My answer is no.  And this is a hospital, not downtown.  Are you going to ticket someone who came in for a test and had a complication,  and thereby take them to a hospital?  Or a family member whose loved one became sick, went to the hospital, and they had to rush in?  How does Dixon relate these issues to a hospital setting, not a standard commercial area?  That's where I would address the two hours.  In summary, as the report states, the city is encouraged to adjust the implementation approach as needed  to design a program that best fits the unique and ever-changing needs of the community and medical center.  This report is not full.  It is flexible and needs to become more creative, taking into account many factors left out of the report.  We're not Sacramento or Santa Clara.  We are a special town with special needs.  The report has been written with no understanding of a medical environment and without polling residents for the use of police surveillance.  Thank you very much.  Bill Seguin followed by Bill Cochran.  Hi, Council. Thank you very much.  I'm Bill Seguin.  I'm the Director of Facilities for the hospital.  So I've had the opportunity to work with Bikram, to work with Kena, to work with Dixon on the parking.  Since the hospital was there nearly 100 years ago, this has been an ongoing challenge that will continue as we add more cars  and add more people and expand and grow as a city.  Enloe has partnered with the city, has partnered with the neighborhood, and is on board to do what we can do to help mitigate the problem.  Some of the...  Some of the things that we can do to help mitigate the problem outside of what we've discussed in terms of where people are parking is  what outpatient services are happening at the hospital that can be moved to other areas.  I mean, we get hundreds of people coming to have x-rays done, to have labs done.  So we've opened space up over at Mountain Medical over on Cohasset to do those procedures,  to bring people out of GI procedures, to take them out to Bruce Road, to use those resources out there and mitigate those single...  those single incident travels.  The Dixon report is a wonderful starting point.  You know, do we agree with everything that's in the report?  No.  Do we always see eye to eye with Kena?  No.  But do we agree on most of the things that are there?  Absolutely.  And a lot of them are low-hanging fruit and they are easy to accomplish.  We work on our employee orientation.  Every employee is taught about the parking structure.  Every employee is taught about the other two lots that they can utilize if they have a large vehicle that doesn't fit in those stalls,  or is too tall.  So we have ongoing education that's managed by the Vice President of Human Resources that's done all the time.  What I would encourage you to look at, yes, it is very important.  We have a heavy impact on sixth...  excuse me, on Esplanade between sixth and fifth, on Esplanade between fourth and fifth,  on Magnolia between fifth and sixth, or excuse me, sixth and seventh, and fourth and fifth.  And then Arcadian between fifth and sixth.  So we heavily impact that area.  The impact that the hospital has outside that area drops off dramatically just as the surveys have looked at.  We would encourage more data, more information, but we know that we have an impact there and we want to focus our efforts in that area.  At the same time, the people that are coming to the hospital are coming under stress.  They do not see signs.  They do not see things that are not good.  They do not see things that are not innately intuitive.  Those people are the people that we are worried about.  Whatever we manage to do, the visitors and the patients that are coming to the hospital,  we need a way to manage and mitigate the impacts that will happen to them.  But aside from that, we are on board to do all this.  The only thing I really disagree with, and I told Bikram we could talk about it,  is he's got to show me how an occupancy sensor on the parking structure helps me drive usage,  because nobody's ever told me they didn't use it,  because they thought it was full.  Thank you very much.  And I can answer any questions that you may have specifically.  Bill?  Yes, sir.  Excuse me.  Yes.  I think it was on the planning commission when you were before us with a structure on East Avenue in that field.  Yes, sir.  Is that still being planned?  Because that would take quite a load off.  I don't know.  I'm assuming it will take a load off of the demand for the main complex.  So as part of that design, yes, we designed a very robust radiology component into that project  for exactly that purpose, to move both lab and radiology outpatient visits that happen to be fairly quick,  but are fairly intensive, and there's a lot of them, so that we could move those capabilities away.  So that is still in the planning process.  As far as I last talked with our consultants, so we have finished or almost finished the city review process with the company down in Sacramento doing the third-party review for the building permit.  And when we're looking at that, Enloe is looking at what's the best need and best use for that land.  But yes, we are still planning a project there to do a lot of these things.  Thank you.  So Bill Cochrane, followed by Laurie Monroe.  Council members and staff, thank you for entertaining us tonight.  I have just a couple of comments about the plan, but almost all of them have already been addressed.  So my last comment was addressed by Councilmember Brown, which was basically in some why should the residents of that area be asked to mitigate the effects of the  Why should the residents of that area be asked to mitigate the effects of the building permit?  We needed to ensure that the resident needed needed needed needed needed needed needed  parking program. I also wanted to agree with Mr. House's comments as it relates to the survey  itself. In particular, the survey touts a sample size of 68 people, 25 percent of whom don't even  live in the area. So the report is based on the opinions of fewer people that are in this room.  So it really should be a little bit more robust than that, in my opinion. And finally, the survey  did conclude that a majority of the residents supported the implementation of a residential  parking program. And yet question 17 says, you know, what would you do? And nearly 50 percent of  the respondents said, you know, what would you do? And the answer is, you know, what would you do?  build additional parking at Enloe Med Center or require employees to park at the Med Center,  only 5% responded provide residential parking permits.  So there's a little bit of an inconsistency there.  I think it had to do with the way the question was phrased.  For example, if I ask you, would you rather shoot yourself in the foot or in the chest,  you would say in the foot, but then you can't turn around and report that the majority of respondents prefer shooting themselves in the foot.  So anyway, the report should be looked at in a little bit more detail.  I think ultimately there is going to have to be a parking program in the area,  but I would urge the council to make sure that...  that the necessary tools and personnel and staff are on hand to implement it before the program is adopted,  because otherwise it just results in confusion and the residents being dissatisfied with the service that's being performed.  Thank you.  So Lori Monroe, followed by Bill Monroe.  Hi, my name is Lori Monroe.  I live at 234 West 4th Avenue, which is a block away from Enloe,  and one house away from the Enloe Women's Health, one of the Enloe Women's Health clinics.  I don't have any problem with people who have appointments in the clinics near my house being there.  I do not enjoy employees parking all day long, which is from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m.  It just doesn't seem right to me.  So my main questions are about...  I don't understand how Enloe can be forced to do anything like the gentleman from Enloe just said.  People can't read signs, so maybe they don't want to put up signs.  I mean, that's what I heard him say.  And I'm worried that a lot of the solutions in Phase 1 require Enloe to do things.  Another thing that kind of concerns me about this plan is...  In all the mailings we received, there was a sample area, residential area, that would be involved in the parking district.  And it seems over-large to me.  And it also...  I don't understand.  There's some streets like Magnolia from 4th to 5th and 5th Avenue all the way down to Arcade from Esplanade to Arcadian,  where it's almost all Enloe-owned property.  So in the map that was provided...  information, those streets weren't included.  And it seems like if it's a city street, it should be included,  whether it's lined with residences, with Enloe, or with other businesses.  And the parking survey also didn't address...  On 4th Ave, between Esplanade and Magnolia, there's a fair number of businesses.  True, they're located in houses, but there's an insurance agency, there's a real estate agency.  And...  And throughout the whole neighborhood, there's a fair number of Airbnbs, which are effectively businesses.  And how are they going to be affected by this change?  Are they going to be allowed to buy permits to park all day on the street?  Or is it only going to be residents?  And then how does that change their business?  So I feel like there's a few things that weren't really covered.  And...  I understand that the...  Now I understand that the district...  delineating the district is a question for future discussion.  And I'm really happy about that, because the lines that I saw on the map didn't seem correct to me.  Although I would like my street, which is only a block from Enloe, to be included in the district.  Thanks.  So Bill Monroe, followed by John Whitehead.  Yeah, hi, I'm Bill Monroe.  I got this card, and that's why we came down.  And this is the map that she's referring to.  How do we know that there are employees parked on our street all day long?  Well, when you have a Tesla, the license plate is G-Y-N-D-O-C.  Yeah, that's one of the doctors at the clinic, right?  And they're there all the time.  And I spoke with Bill...  At this last meeting that we had with you, Casey.  And I said, can you get this guy or girl, whoever, to park and employ?  Oh, yeah, I'll talk to them.  No.  They're still there.  And so I have some hesitancy about the follow-through for Enloe.  And the part about how HR won't allow them to do things.  What I heard from them was that it was the union that didn't allow them to do stuff.  And that is not true.  I have spoken with the union people.  And I have worked...  I'm a nurse.  I'm retired.  And I used to work in a hospital in Missouri where you were required to park in the employee parking lot.  If you didn't, if you parked in the visitor parking lot, you'd get fired.  And just a thought for Enloe.  Employees had to pay $15 a month out of their paycheck to park in employee parking.  And you got a little swipe pass and the gate would come up and you'd go in and you'd park.  Things like that can happen at the parking garage, which I think is relatively empty.  They could improve the occupancy of the roof parking area if they put a cover over that.  Because it does get hotter than heck up there.  And we...  It would keep the rain and snow off.  And that cover could, in fact, be solar panels.  So that's my idea.  Thank you very much.  John Whitehead, followed by Jan Reed.  I'm John Whitehead.  I'm the current president of Kenan.  So we've been working with Enloe on this for longer than is noted in the pamphlet.  It was...  When we were working with Kenan and the hospital on the design of the valet parking lot and the Enloe Park that buffers the hospital from the Arcadian neighborhood,  it was Mike Woltermood who came to Kenan and asked if we would support the concept of additional signing out on the Esplanade in order to direct their patients and their patients' family to the parking structure or to the Enloe Park.  And it was Mike Woltermood who said that he would like more movement of the lots, the parking spots, directly around the hospital and not to have them tied up by their faculty or their staff or their employees.  And that's got to be six years ago.  So I guess my point is I'm not very confident.  And...  Enloe is able to move the...  Move the air or move the...  They can't move their employees to park in the parking structure.  So the other significant thing is this is a problem that Enloe created.  The neighbors didn't create this problem.  And Enloe talked tonight about their expansion on East Avenue.  But Bill knows that...  Bill knows that the people who are on the front of the hospital that front the Esplanade lose their exemption from current building standards in 2030 and will have to be replaced.  And Enloe anticipates putting an additional tower on the Esplanade.  So this parking problem is only going to get worse.  So the city, thank you all and the city staff for all the effort and the improvement and the commitment of dollars to the consultant.  And...  And...  And...  You're going to make a further commitment of dollars when you put license plate readers out there, which will make the parking enforcement viable.  But Enloe needs to pony up and put the sensors in at the garage.  And...  And...  I don't know if you can get them to chip in on the signage, but that might be a lost cause.  But at least on their own property to put the sensors in so you have the data so you know what the utilization of the garage is really like.  Because you're going to have that data on the city streets with the license plate readers.  If you have any questions for me, I'd be glad to take them.  Thanks.  Jan Reed, followed by Jessica Giannola.  And if you're next, if you just can line up behind that person when they have about a minute left, we'd appreciate that.  Hi.  Excuse me.  My name's Jan Reed.  Full disclosure, I live in Mansion Park, which is one of the city's current preferred parking districts.  So I do have some firsthand knowledge of what works and what doesn't.  My first question is, why is it the city's responsibility to solve Enloe's parking problem?  My only thought is the city figured out this was a new revenue source.  And what's even brought up today by...  Bikram.  In 2007, the city and Enloe agreed that there would not be further encroachment into the neighborhood after the tower and garage were built.  But allowing people, their employees, to park in the neighborhood is further encroachment.  The city now wants to restrict, by the number of permits, the ability of residents to park on the street near their homes.  In the Dixon report, it says there's an option to reduce the number of permits of residents,  for more parking for Enloe.  Enloe has an underutilized garage.  Why is this not the first issue to resolve?  The Dixon report is flawed from the beginning.  The initial survey was 12 respondents.  Their occupancy data was collected when Chico State was not in session.  So no students were counted.  The latest survey had 68 persons,  but less than 60 of them were students.  And only a few of them were actually residents in the neighborhood.  The Dixon report is a boilerplate report, the industry standard.  But it isn't Chico's best answer.  And I do think the neighbors deserve all of your attention to figure out what works for Chico.  The report also states if too many people are using or are on the street parking,  then Dixon,  went on to say drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug  going on there so i hope you don't go ahead with this tonight i hope you give it further  consideration i hope you get the people from mansion park involved because we can tell you  how it works and how it doesn't work but really we weren't included so one thing is how are you  going to direct these parkers from nlo so that they are spread out throughout the neighborhood  everyone knows the human being parks as close as they can get to their destination so all those  homes closest to nlo are going to be the ones most impacted by parkers my time is up thank you very  much jessica giannola followed by derrick sanderson  council i'm i don't live next to nlo but it's our hospital  so !  so  so  so  so  so  so  so that could be used again. Employees have a specific off-location parking lot Employees have a specific off-location parking lot or use the garage and have a shuttle service if they needed it farther away. That would really space for people who are using the hospital and visiting loved ones.  so so  so so  so so  so so  so so  so so  so so  so so  so so  so so  or someone's visiting someone who's having a heart attack,  well, they're passing away, and people are gathered around,  and they have to look at their watch.  I think that's a bad idea, having a time limit.  So I think that just if Inlo can work on getting their staff  and their employees to use the parking garage,  think about having a park and ride for them.  And what else did I have on there?  I think that's just about it.  And then if they can do that expansion of the garage,  it sounds like that would help too,  because I know there is a parking problem down there for sure.  Thank you.  So our last speaker is Derek Sanderson.  Evening, Council.  Just a few comments.  First, as a real estate professional in Chico,  I've had multiple occasions when I'd go to show a home down near Inlo.  And actually have clients call me without getting out of the car and go,  nope, no parking.  And noticing a trend of desirability, which affects property value,  which isn't good for tax base.  So just something to keep in mind.  And if there's going to be permits,  and you're further limiting the amount of permits for residents,  that's going to even decrease that desirability even more  for people wanting to purchase in those neighborhoods.  So like other previous speakers have said,  are we really going to find people in crisis?  Like, are we going to make them have to go through an appeals process  just to avoid having to pay a fine?  Also, again, people have already spoke to us,  but the sample size, like really, 68 people?  Like really, four Inlo employees.  How many employees does Inlo have?  And they can only get four responses?  Like, that's a bit of a joke to me.  Sample size is way too small.  And lastly, as far as funding of the enforcement,  obviously that means more boots.  Even if you have license plate readers,  like you still have to have somebody go write a ticket,  unless you're going to mail it like the red light cameras.  But how are we going to fund that?  Are we going to have enough money and permits to even offset that cost  when the city would love to be able to use those monies to stripe  and pay for the tickets?  We don't really have enough money needed to pave and work on sidewalks.  So we need to think about funding as well.  I really think you should hit pause  and think about this just a little bit longer.  And even maybe relook at trying to get more people  from Inlo in the neighborhood to give a little more input.  Thank you, counsel.  All right. Thank you, everybody.  Actually, would you mind coming back for a second?  I've got a question for you.  So, I don't really...  want to survey our crowd right now, but I kind of do. How many residents do we have from around  Inla, if you don't mind showing hands? All right, so we have a handful. You know, and this is  probably a silly question, so why don't we just turn all the, in front of the homes, turn in two  hour parking and give the people who live there an all-day, you know, a parking pass that can  park there all day long. So an employee could only park there for two hours, or someone visiting the  hospital could only park there for two hours, but everybody else, residents, would have an all-day  permit. Is that a possibility? Does that look that? So we have to do a permit district, right? So if  we want to give them permits. Right, right. No, I understand that we'd have to do a permit district,  but I'm just thinking that'd be a really easy way to do it, where you just turn in two hour parking.  Yeah, Mayor, I mean, that's the proposal, actually the proposal in the plan, is to set up a preferred  parking district and allow a two-hour parking.  A two-hour grace period for people that don't have permits. And so that was what was proposed in the plan.  So I guess my concern is, is that, does Enloe have enough spaces in their garage to take all the cars?  Do we have that number? I don't think we have the exact number.  Go ahead. You might have an answer back there.  So to answer the question, it's where are you?  Yes, we have enough parking in the garage to cover all of our employees, along with the couple of service blocks that we have that are for employees.  The variable are the visitors. Now, how many visitors come in any one day is highly, it changes.  So the last two weeks, we've had 4,000 visitors, and they average anywhere from 250 to 400 a day.  But that's on top of the hundreds of procedures that happen every day.  Yeah, sure.  So we have about a thousand people coming to the hospital on a daily basis outside of our employees.  That makes sense. All right.  That's the concept behind the two-hour window.  Sure.  Is to help try to accommodate that need, and while not accommodating the employee that wants to come and park and stay there all day.  Yeah, I understand. And making it difficult, obviously, for the employee to move their car to the same zone, which also makes sense.  But it just seems...  It seems like we're over-complicating the problem a little bit.  So, all right.  Does anyone else have a question?  There were several comments about the two hours, and I'm curious from maybe the residents and or staff, if what other time frames were considered.  Did we consider three hours, four hours?  I mean, what's reasonable?  Being sensitive to people are in an emergency situation, and the last thing we want to do is exasperate that.  Yeah, the only recommendation Dixon had was if you make it too long, like four hours, some employees may park there and then move their car, you know, like park there for four hours and then move their car to a different zone.  So, that still may cause issues.  So, that's why we wanted to be two hours.  But that's something, you know, as we collect data, you know, we can always adjust those.  Different streets may have different time limits.  You know, that's something we can always change as we go.  So, that's not set in stone that it'll be always two hours.  That's something adjustable.  Could I ask the staff about that?  I'm sorry, but every time I've been in the hospital with a family member or somebody else, like those people never leave the hospital and they're like shoveling food as they're like running to their next patient.  So, do people really go out and would they move cars every four hours?  Is that a reality?  I'm asking.  I don't live in the area.  So, a nurse would not be able to.  That's just not a practical thing.  But if you had an office staff person in the finance department, they could certainly go and move their car or something like that.  But the people that are in the main building working, no.  They barely have time to get the two breaks that they have and their lunch.  Okay.  Thank you.  So, and one more question.  So, kind of to spell a myth here because I can't imagine the math pencils at all.  So, the cost per permit.  You know.  Do we have an estimate of the total funding?  Cost for the permits?  Yeah.  I mean.  The annual cost.  I mean, like what's the income side of it from the permits?  26.  Something in there, right?  I'm sorry.  I didn't get the question.  He's saying that there's a myth that the city's going to make a bunch of money off this.  I think it's a.  He's talking $26 for a permit.  I think it's.  Yeah.  I'm sure finance.  I believe the current cost is $21 annually.  Right.  For a resident.  And we're probably looking at a couple hundred permits, right?  Well.  Well.  My understanding is the fee is paid by the resident.  And under the current municipal code, the resident gets five passes.  Right.  By permits.  And they can use those for themselves and their guests.  Yeah.  So, they pay $21 annually for that.  So, relatively no money.  The reality is it does not cover the administrative.  Yeah.  The burden to the city.  And it also causes an administrative burden and financial burden to the neighborhood.  Yeah.  But it is a powerful tool in order to deal with an issue like this.  Understandable.  Yeah.  I just was trying to dispute the claims that we're making money off parking passes.  Yeah.  All right.  Any other questions?  No.  All good.  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right.  Council direction.  Thank you.  I just have a couple of comments.  I can see why the consultant didn't want to be here.  Because their report is bad.  I mean, at one point you said there were 66 residents.  It was 66 respondents is what the report said, which is not good.  But I don't think.  I don't think that the council has the expertise to drive this operation.  I don't think we're there yet.  I think two hours is too short and four hours is too long.  I also don't think the residents should have to pay for their resident permits.  I don't know if that helps the staff start to work on anything.  I think that they can probably get somewhere better than where we are.  I wouldn't call those consultants again.  Ever.  I think they should be embarrassed that they put that report before us.  Not you.  All you did was present.  That was not your fault.  I would say it if it was.  Those are my comments.  So I agree with Council Member Morgan's assessment of this.  It's a very complex issue.  I get it.  You know, we've got a trauma center.  We've got neighborhoods.  And right now parking is clashing between the two.  I think there is some low-hanging fruit, though.  That was mentioned, Bill, you had mentioned that term.  And I think it's the wayfinding and the parking guidance.  I think that's an easy thing that we could do.  And I think the other part of it, the compliance and the preferential parking,  they're joined at the hip anyway.  Let's table those.  We can work through that process.  But I think the wayfinding and parking would be a good direction for us to move.  That is really not controversial and will at least provide some relief.  Mr. Stryker?  Yes.  Is that a motion?  Yes.  Is that a motion?  Motion.  All right.  I'll say that.  Second, Council Member Morgan.  Further discussion?  Can I just get a clarification?  When you're talking about striping the parking tees, the wayfinding signs on the parking tees.  Exactly.  Yes.  That's correct.  I just wanted to make sure I understood.  Except in the dirt.  All right.  Madam Clerk?  I have a quick question.  Sure.  So while I completely understand.  I agree.  And I think that it's good to take care of the long-hanging fruit.  Do we need to include anything in the motion then to allow staff to continue to work on  other remedies as what might come in as phase two and phase three?  Or is that already taken care of?  We can do this now.  You guys can maybe find a different company, get some more data, talk about the outline,  the areas where the maps and make sure we're doing the proper area and all that.  I don't believe we need any more direction.  I think the feelings of the council are pretty clear.  I just want to make sure we're keeping moving forward for our neighbors.  City of Trent.  Yes.  I wanted to clarify, Mr. Mayor, a motion isn't required.  The council needn't take action on this item, just provide direction to staff.  It doesn't mean to be in the form of a motion.  All right.  So with what we've done so far, it's sufficient.  I didn't hear you.  So what we've done so far, it's probably sufficient as to the direction?  Yes.  It sounds like staff understands the direction.  So with that, we won't take a vote.  But we'll have staff move forward.  Yes.  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  So we will move on then, seeing no further discussion.  So basically, the staff, so council, so I'll explain this.  So we don't necessarily need a motion to move forward.  The council has somewhat of a consensus for staff to move forward with restriping the T's  and dealing with some of those issues as well as exploring further solutions.  So you'll be hearing more about it as we move forward.  But there's no, we're going to move forward with A, B, and C type of forward motion.  I guess is the best way to say that.  So.  I think it's important for staff to clarify that they understand the direction that they've been given  so they can produce the deliverable.  Yes, it's clear to me.  All right.  So moving on to item 5.2, City of Chico Strategic Vision and Planning.  And I believe we have our deputy city manager.  Welcome.  Get your chest set up, guys.  There we go.  All right.  Good evening, Mayor Coolidge, Vice Mayor Reynolds, council members.  I'm Jennifer McCarthy, deputy city manager.  And tonight we'll be talking about your vision for the city of Chico.  We'll be talking through what your interest is in moving vision statements forward,  forward, and forward.  for our community for the next three to four years.  Talking about prioritization of those statements.  And then how we're going to utilize those vision statements in our actions moving forward.  So tonight, as I already went through that, we're not even going to go in there.  As a reminder, the City of Chico's vision statement puts together what the real purpose of the city is  and who we provide our services to.  So as a reminder, the City of Chico's mission is to protect and enhance our community's quality of life  for the present and for the future.  We needed to ensure that our mission went forward in order to ensure that our mission went forward in order to ensure  We needed to ensure that our mission went forward in order to ensure  We needed to ensure that our mission went forward in order to ensure  We needed to ensure that our mission went forward in order to ensure  We needed to ensure that our mission went forward in order to ensure  We needed to ensure that our mission went forward in order to ensure  We needed to ensure that our mission went forward in order to ensure  We needed to ensure that our mission went forward in order to ensure  We needed to ensure that our mission went forward in order to ensure  We needed to ensure that our mission went forward in order to ensure  the staff time. So where have we been in this process? Well, this is something that just isn't  coming up today for the first time. Back in 2019, the city council took really big steps towards the  first step in strategic planning, and that is the creation of vision statements. The council had an  all-day workshop where they worked with Scott Winter of Brain Dynamics on putting together  what they felt should and could happen for our community over the next three to four years.  That information was provided to council in March, at a council meeting in March 2019,  and at that point, the council asked for additional feedback from our community.  So a survey was done of our community, and over 800 participants responded to that survey,  and then come September of 2019, the responses to those surveys and the vision statements were  again provided to the council for information.  So today, we're going to sort of pick up where we left off back then in September of 2019.  There was a few things that happened between then and now.  So the state...  Can I interrupt you for just one second? Because I was not aware that this occurred.  So was the city's mission statement updated at that time?  No.  Ms. Morgan, I know you're an expert on the city's mission statement.  I'm just going to ask you a question.  Because I've heard you say it a lot.  It's a safe place to raise a family, an ideal location for business, and a premier place to live?  Yeah, that's what I was going to say.  It's not actually the mission statement.  It's like a vision or something that's found on one of the web pages.  I just repeated it a lot to irritate Scott Grendel.  And it worked. He moved.  Maybe we should find out where that is.  All right.  You got it.  Thank you.  We will add that in...  No, I'm not saying that.  I'm just answering his question.  Okay.  It always sounded like a really perfect mission statement to me.  Okay.  It's better than the one that...  Yeah.  You read to us.  No offense.  That you had nothing to do with.  It's all good.  It's all good.  All right.  This is going to go really well.  Yeah.  It's going to go really well.  This is a messy process, and I'm acknowledging that from the beginning.  I'm acknowledging that from the beginning.  So as a result of those conversations back in 2019, the council really saw direction and vision of our community really focused around eight different areas.  And those areas included underserved populations, economic development.  Sustainability.  Communication.  Public safety.  Infrastructure.  Housing.  And a balanced budget.  So tonight what we're going to do, and again back to my comment about it might be a little bit messy, is I will bring up each one of those individual vision statements that was created back in 2019.  We'll talk about some of the nuance of the wording.  And then I will look to you to see how you're interested in either revising, rewording, or even making a decision.  Reaffirming or just reimagining altogether those vision statements individually.  And then we'll have a short discussion about prioritization because when you have multiple vision statements, it's really helpful for staff if we understand your priorities as a council.  And then we'll talk about the next steps in the strategic planning process.  Is that palatable?  Okay.  Well, I'm leaving.  If there's another direction that you'd like to go to, let me know.  Speak now.  I will.  Thank you very much.  I'm not going to make a decision tonight about this.  I want to look at it, think about it, and analyze what my thoughts are before I'd ever come up with any suggestions.  So I just want to say that up front that I require time to think.  And I'm not going to do it tonight.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  You're welcome.  So let me ask you this.  In terms of the process, so this process was developed for a reason, obviously.  And that reason was to have each of these statements be used within the various departments within the city to become priorities?  Well, what happens with strategic planning is your first step is your vision, thinking about where you want to be in the future.  And then we take that down to develop specific objectives and action items associated with that.  You as a council has already approved a number of documents that have a specific objective.  So we have a number of objectives, action items, goals associated with them.  So our first step is to re-look at all of those documents, see how they might fit with this so that we can understand how our existing documents might be able to feed into that strategic planning process.  The other link and a major link is to the budget for the City of Chico.  So the and perhaps I might look to Barbara Martin for a little bit of assistance on this one.  But there is an award that the City of Chico received for the D.C. budget.  And it's a very important document to have a GFOA on our budget and our budget document and how it is linked specifically to goals and objectives is something that needs to happen moving forward.  And it's good fiscal management and it's good prioritization and forward-looking opportunities for staff.  And I think City Manager Orme had something to add.  Sure.  I just want council to know that we totally respect the fact that typically when you go through a strategic planning initiative, it's an all-day.  We're not doing it every day.  We don't really try to do it every week.  allowing you and the community members to hear them.  And then if you want to give feedback, give feedback,  and we'll bring it back again at a future meeting  so you have the time to chew on it.  That's A-OK if that's council's direction.  Another vital component of this,  which I think that Ms. McCarthy noted the real vital pieces,  but there's one other piece that we were intent as a staff  to place in our staff reports,  and that is how are items coming forward to council  relate to your vision statements?  That was a key piece to this.  And so if we have vision statements to know  that this is where you want Chico to be,  we will interrelate our reports to those vision statements,  and it will drive, just as she stated, our budgeting.  And when I come forward with a budget,  these all are attributable to this vision statement,  this vision statement, this vision statement.  It helps me to put together a budget for you.  Now, I may think I know what you want.  It's easier to understand  if you're going to be able to do it in a way that's  when it's put into verbiage in words like this.  Now, this was created under a different council,  and so it was a different makeup of council,  and so these may still make a lot of sense.  There may be just some tweaks, as Jennifer had mentioned,  but ultimately, this is your document.  We don't want to force feed you.  We don't want to tell you what to say,  but what we do want to do is understand what your vision is.  Every time I've seen councils fail,  it's because there's lack of vision,  and I don't want...  I don't want council to fail.  And every time I see council members that point  to where they want to be 10 years from now,  success is achieved because staff knows  what train to get on to take us there,  and we know how to help the council get there.  So this is helpful to us.  I hope it's helpful to you,  but I just want to share that, just a little perspective.  Can I, if I may,  and I appreciate what you said, Skipper.  The good news is if the council fails,  we just blame the city manager,  so that's not a big problem.  I'm kidding.  I don't know if this help clears this up,  but the mayor asked about the mission statement,  the vision statement.  People confuse the two all the time.  In my practice, the mission statement is who we are,  at least who we want to be.  The vision statements are where we want to be  with all of these different initiatives.  The prior council came up with eight different initiatives,  which is probably two or three too many  because most organizations can't focus on that many,  but there's a lot of things going on.  Like, I can look at the city council,  and I can look at this one that's sustainability,  and it's like, we're doing this anyway.  This is mandated by the state.  It doesn't even have to be in here.  It makes us feel good,  but it just, there's that many more things we have to focus on.  The mistake the prior council made,  whether I agreed with the initiatives or not,  was they were never prioritized,  and I told the consultant at the time that.  We paid them an awful lot of money for absolutely nothing  because when there is no priority,  as Skipper said, it's like, well, we have budget,  or we have staff availability, we have whatever.  Which one of these things should I do first?  If we use this current draft vision statements,  should I serve the underserved population first,  or should it be housing, or should it be communication?  So there has to be a priority list.  There's many different ways of doing strategy  as there are mission statements, but here's what I'm saying.  I am willing to follow the lead of the deputy city manager  and see where this goes.  I don't want to be here until midnight,  but I do think that, you know,  I do think it might be worth starting at the mission statement  and then saying, are these the right initiatives?  Do they make sense and how to prioritize them?  Or however you want to do it.  As long as we get somewhere in the end,  that keeps staff and council from just kind of picking on,  what do I feel like working on today?  Which is what happens in the absence of good strategic planning.  So in my eyes, I'm all yours.  I appreciate that.  All right, I'm getting the go-ahead from the mayor.  Okay, all right.  So with that, we're moving ahead.  And again, we'll be going through these individually  and obtaining some feedback.  So this vision statement is regarding underserved populations.  The city serves and empowers the most underserved populations  by providing shelter and resources  through regional collaboration and creative partnerships.  This vision statement really acknowledges the need  to assist underserved populations along with the realization  that the city of Chico cannot independently fulfill the needs  of all individuals and that collaboration and partnership  are essential to the success of meeting the needs  of underserved populations.  So at that point, I'd be happy to take any questions,  any suggestions for revisions, rewording,  or affirmations on this.  Or we can just move on to the next one.  Oh, I'll just start for fun.  Okay, start for fun.  I say you get rid of it.  And the reason I say you get rid of it before anybody starts  writing terrible things about me is we're mandated to do this anyway.  Right?  We have a badly written law and an injunction that is forcing us  to do some of these anyway.  So making this the vision for the city I think would be a bad idea.  I wouldn't put it up there.  I respectfully disagree.  I thought you might, but I thought we needed a starting point.  You know, I think it's easy to conflate the terminology  of underserved populations with homeless people,  which is what I'm hearing a little bit of,  and I understand that the word shelter is a little bit different,  but I'm going to put it in there so I can completely recognize  where those maybe got conflated in the process.  Underserved populations includes a lot of different folks  who face barriers when accessing their government,  when accessing resources in their neighborhoods,  when accessing food, when accessing housing.  It's not just about people who lack housing altogether.  And so while I agree with a lot of what you said about what vision statements do,  the city manager stated very specifically,  that these vision statements will guide the budgeting process.  It will guide where the money goes, and where your money goes says way more,  in my opinion, about who you are as a city than your mission and vision statement do.  And so I think it's incredibly important that we understand  that this is about focusing resources.  And in my opinion, focusing resources on people who do not have as many of them  is critically important.  I agree with what you said, but we're forced to spend that money anyway.  So, you know, I think that's a good point.  As a slap in the face to the realities of the moment,  we're going to remove it?  It's not a slap in the face.  It's just a matter of priority.  I mean, do we want to be, let's say we move this to the top of the priority list.  Do we want to share this vision with the world,  the city of Chico serves and empowers the most underserved populations  by doing all these things?  I certainly believe we need to take care of the people that are unfortunate.  I don't want to do it for the entire state,  which seems to be the direction from some.  I don't mean you.  I just think we have to be careful where that ends up.  I mean.  And I know it's not getting thrown out.  I just thought we needed to start somewhere.  It's odd that this one came up first.  Sure.  I mean, just the way it was written.  I understand.  Order can be seen as an issue.  I totally get that.  I think that those components of regional collaboration and creative partnership  were a big part of the strategic planning process that the council that underwent this process,  which I know disadvantages a lot of folks at the table right now.  Really wanted to highlight is that it does require a stronger level of engagement  and interaction between various entities or organizations.  So I support it.  One suggestion might be a wording change.  The city serves underserved populations by providing resources through regional collaboration  and creative partnerships.  And then you're just hitting the service to the underserved.  And we're not saying whether they're unhoused or not.  And again, doing it through regional collaboration.  Suggestion of wording.  All right.  I think you're going to have a lot of suggestions.  That's good.  If this is more of a workshop situation, the city manager and I have also talked about  the fact that we could pull this and do it through a workshop opportunity where we have  more opportunity for dialogue.  Or as Council Member Bennett said,  we could take some more time and come back.  But each one of these are big.  They're important decisions to make.  And this is all for the vision of your community over the next three to four years.  So it is nothing to be taken lightly.  And I appreciate this level of dialogue.  So the other part of that, and I appreciate it.  I don't know if there's any better way to do it than the way you're doing it.  If this is the mission statement we're going to agree on and do all these things work.  But when we did it last time, and it was good.  It was open.  It was like a Saturday afternoon.  Did you participate?  Yes.  I mean, the usual people that speak at every council meeting showed up.  But they did participate.  But I don't know that starting with here are our eight.  We're saying right now here are our eight initiatives.  Yep.  Well, I mean, by default, that's what we're doing.  This would be an entirely different discussion if we said here's the mission of the city.  And let's go back.  Let's just say we went back to the one that the mayor pointed out.  Okay.  Safe place to raise a family.  Ideal location for business and a premier place to live.  Then we would go, what are the initiatives that get us to that point?  Maybe this makes it.  Maybe it doesn't.  But that's different than saying here are the initiatives of prior council came up.  How does that fit in with what we think now?  It's in a way constraining us.  But I say that knowing you were put in a no win situation.  I thought we needed to redo this since the first time we did it with the priorities.  I'm happy to do it as a workshop tonight.  I'm happy to do it as a workshop another time.  But I think we'll have.  Here's the problem.  Particularly with council member Brown and I.  We're going to wordsmith this for three hours.  And at the end of the day, it's not going to make any difference.  Whereas if we chose all new initiatives, maybe this comes up, maybe it doesn't.  But it gets reworded.  So rather than start with the past practice that maybe wasn't done as well as you might do it.  Maybe we start over.  Without the constraints.  Can I?  Yeah, I'm having a really hard time making decisions for our community with only three of the council members who worked on this are still sitting on this dais.  We're working with two year old data or information and only three of us that were actually there.  And it was a great day.  I actually enjoyed it.  And we got a lot out of it.  And I felt like we all really pulled up our sleeves and worked.  But I'd like to do it again.  Because we're not in the same place as a community where we are right now.  And we have a lot of community members I think that would like to be involved in the process.  So I just this doesn't feel like a council meeting exercise to me personally.  All right.  Council member O'Brien.  No, I agree with that.  I'm not prepared to start commenting on a document I had nothing to.  And it's not anything against you.  At all.  She is not.  Jennifer.  I know she's not.  Good.  Thanks.  But I had nothing to do with this document.  And I'm here at 838 on October 19th.  And I'm going to take this document and somehow craft that into the vision and planning document for the city.  That doesn't make any sense to me.  I think we need to put this aside.  And I appreciate all the effort that's gone into it already.  And we need to do this right and proper.  And that means some type of workshop.  Something where we all can come together, have time to process and do this correctly.  That's my opinion.  All right.  Mr. Bennett.  I just want to apologize for my comments if they offended you because I had no intention of doing that.  I just looked at this and thought.  I think I must clarify if I may, Mr. Morgan.  I'm just not as smart as you all are.  And it takes me time.  So with that, I just want to say I did not intend to say anything inappropriate.  Well, I appreciate this.  This is your process.  So there is no offense here.  We are literally just moving forward something that never really got to the finish line last time.  So if we need to go back, we need to go back.  And I would like to add that I am the one that's been screaming for a strategic plan for two years.  It's not that I don't want to do this.  So I do want to move forward.  I would like it to happen soon.  But I think we need to.  Council Member Tam.  You know, a lot has changed from 19 to now, too.  Right?  So we all had to see this pandemic.  So I think a lot has changed, too.  And moving forward, I think we should have a fresh discussion.  I would like to request to not have it on a Saturday.  All right.  Council Member Brown.  I can hear everyone's comments and see validity in all of them.  I think, you know, I look at this list.  And almost nothing on this list reads as outlandish or far from what any city would strike as priorities.  I think some of these things are specifically related to the culture of our community.  I don't love every single one of them.  And I think that that whole strategic planning day that we did have had struck a very good balance, I think, with weighing in everybody's perspectives in spite of the makeup.  And so.  I'm fine doing the exercise again.  And hopefully it will be similar in really taking everybody's input.  But I also don't see anything weird or off about this list or any of the statements that are listed here.  I don't need to wordsmith them to get the essence and the spirit of what we're going for.  I think we could take it two levels deeper, you know, for actionables.  But if it is the council's will to go back to the drawing board, c'est la vie.  Thank you.  All right.  Question for you, Mr. Owen.  So when I came into office in 2014 for my first term, there was a list hanging on the wall in this chamber.  Yes.  Which was council priorities.  Looks pretty similar to what I'm looking at.  Mm-hmm.  Were you around when that was crafted?  I was.  It was one of the things that we attempted to do straight up.  But it was only priorities.  We were trying to take it to the next level of vision statements.  And then we're trying to take it to the next level of implementation steps.  So we're getting there.  I will tell you, I'm excited about what I'm hearing out of all of you.  You want to own this.  You want this council to be known for your vision statements created from scratch.  That is music to my ears.  Because oftentimes I watch councils.  I've done this stuff in Southern California.  And they try to maneuver around things that are not in the council's control.  And I think that it's difficult to when you're trying to remold something.  It's easier to build from scratch oftentimes.  So I totally respect what I'm hearing.  I also respect the fact that a lot of these are vision statements that are in everybody's list.  So I think you're going to find that some of these will probably make their way back onto here.  But you want to own it.  And so I think from a staff perspective, I appreciate that.  And if that's the council's direction, what we'll do is, and I don't know if it will work out.  But we may need to just maybe start a council meeting a little earlier or designate a whole council meeting to this at some point in the future.  And so we're going to have to try to manage that calendaring and working with you, Mayor, and the council members to try to figure out and the city clerk what that might look like.  Because I want to respect those that have to work on Saturdays as well.  So why don't we listen to our speakers and then move forward from there.  Thank you.  Appreciate it.  All right.  Madam Clerk, how many speakers do we have on this?  We have three.  All right.  Three.  So the first one is Jessica Giannola followed by Nicole Nava.  Okay.  Wow.  I took this survey in 2019.  And I actually, I really object to the discounting of the data that was collected.  That's from the community.  Those are our voices.  They are our voices.  They are our suggestions.  And we are still here whether or not you are on the podium or not.  And 75% of the answers have to do with our housing crisis and the people who are out on the streets.  And we have people who are disabled who can't get into housing and students who can't get into housing.  And that still exists.  In fact, it's worse.  It's worse at this point.  So what you have is absolutely workable.  And I just find it so offensive that there's objection taking on the very first one that's brought up because it maintains the !  It mentions shelter or somehow implies that all homeless people can come to Chico, California and live for free.  Because that's not the message.  That's not reality.  And that is a disingenuous message.  That's a misunderstanding that's continually perpetuated by people on our council and people in our city.  That is not reality.  It's not fair.  So we have all of these things that were on that survey, which I read.  And we all should have read it ahead of time.  And this survey was spread around all of those things.  There's safety.  And it's not just safety for people who feel like they're going to get mugged in their car.  There's safety for people who are living on the streets.  There's safety for people who can't afford housing or who don't have enough food, who are having a hard time getting a good job here.  Those are safety issues, too.  Being victimized by police brutality is also a safety issue.  It's a reality.  Whether people object to it because they're full on black to blue.  And, again, I am not against police officers.  But we can't keep denying that there's a safety factor involved when we have such scenarios.  We need to have more education and more tools provided to our officers.  That is something that we should address when it comes to safety in our community.  This is just really upsetting.  Housing is we're in a housing crisis.  It should be our goal.  It should be stated proudly in our goals as a city that we are about resolutions.  We're about protecting the people in our community.  Especially the ones that need our help.  That should be something we own and not be afraid to say.  Thank you.  Nicole Nava followed by Derek Sanderson.  Good evening, council.  So I was glad to see this come up again.  And I'm equally glad that we're doing this.  I am so excited that it looks like you might be taking things back to take a pause and revisit it.  Because this was done a long time ago.  A lot of water under the bridge.  And I think the way even the first one was framed is problematic.  Because it's segmenting out a certain portion of this community.  And we should be empowering all populations.  And resources for everyone.  And it becomes problematic when we do start to parse people out.  and it just isn't palatable for folks.  I think there's things on here that I would agree with Councilmember Morgan  that are already being attended to.  I did look through this list, and then what I tried to do  was look at some of the sub-bullets under each of these being done,  and just to me, we're down the road with a lot of it anyway,  so I understand what she was trying to bring up  about drawing correlation between documentation that's already out there.  I'm sure a lot of us could rattle it off already  and go, like, you got a lot of this down the road.  So I don't think people should be scared that things are going to be overlooked.  We're going to do the business that the city does.  Some of these things included getting a PIO, talking to our community more,  but some of them are disturbing, like friendly parks, you know, safe parks,  shelter for everyone, and we're like, what does that look like?  And some of this belongs, again, I will say, with the county,  a lot of the things other people were just bringing up.  It's like, can we do this?  County, county, county, county.  We need to focus on this city's viability.  The infrastructure needs to be tended to.  A lot of this other stuff has to come after that.  You know, you just heard from Enloe folks about parking  and how it's going to explode even worse,  and we can't even come to an agreement on things like that.  That's basic, right?  So I'm really happy that you will revisit this.  We need to land on priorities that,  who is at the table now can agree with,  and that have actionable items associated to them,  and I would love to see timeframes associated.  When you have actionable items and you do not give concrete timeframes,  guess what?  Not going to happen.  Kind of like the Enloe employees, I want to park it close.  Yeah, I've got that parking lot, that sweet thing,  a couple blocks down the way, but who's going to do that?  They're not.  You have to incentivize it.  You have to tie something to it.  So I think there's a lot that can be done here.  I'd like to see the community have opportunity to weigh in again.  Maybe you just do a quick survey and rank what's still important,  what's less important, so we can get somewhere a little faster.  I'd love to show up at a workshop and help as well.  I think this is good stuff.  I think that Council Member Morgan and Brown made some good points,  but I think both are coming from their perspectives,  and we've got a whole new council, so I'd like to broaden that out.  Thanks.  Derek Sanderson.  Derek Sanderson is our last speaker.  So from the city's website,  our mission is to protect and enhance our community's quality of life  to present and future generations.  The city council and city staff are committed to ensuring that Chico  is a safe place to raise a family, an ideal location for business,  and a premier place to live.  So whatever it is that you guys decide,  whether you go back to a workshop or however it is that you guys go through this process,  please let that be the lens that you're viewing all these decisions through,  even just all of your decisions.  And I have to agree with Alex, sorry, Council Member Brown,  in that money does really speak volumes,  and if what you decide is going to determine where the budget goes,  actions speak louder than words,  and money...  money shows where your heart really is.  So please let your actions speak just as loud as your words are as you make decisions.  Thank you, Council.  All right.  You have enough direction?  Yes, you'll be receiving an email from the city clerk in the near future  trying to peg a date where we can have some workshop done to start developing this out.  Thank you.  All right.  So we'll move on to item 5.3, which is my request,  the approval of a letter of officials requesting mental health and drug treatment support.  And the idea behind drafting the letter was just so we could at least have a direction  for maybe staff to come back to us at some point with a letter that, you know,  is a little more sought out and definitely, you know,  has a little more research and background to it.  And I think staff would be capable of putting together that letter.  But if nobody has any questions or if anybody has any questions, I'm happy to...  I do have one comment, if I may, Mayor.  I agree with this.  The issues of mental health and drug addiction are significant.  But I think it would be nice to leverage with other cities and counties maybe to bring our voices together  so it's not just us standing alone.  So maybe we can look at that as well.  I think that's a good idea.  Do we have any speakers on this side?  We do.  We have three.  Jessica Giannola followed by Nicole Nava.  Okay, last one for the night.  Okay, so the 5.3.  It's important for this city to seek support in providing additional mental health and addiction services to our area.  Absolutely, it's important.  Our community has experienced multiple crisis events,  compounding trauma upon trauma as people rarely obtain treatment  and care before another set of catastrophic circumstances turn their lives upside down.  We already topped the charts in ACEs, that's adverse child experiences,  signifying chronic unmet needs and need for services.  The people privileged to have private insurance at least have access to benefits, like counseling.  Although many still struggle with their experiences that leave people debilitated and emotionally unregulated,  some with resulting addictions, that's housed and unhoused.  Those without insurance and even with Medi-Cal,  or...  or other public insurances often struggle and flounder under self-medication attempts  with little hopes of recovery when their situation has become too destructive.  I support this request for services,  but it is incredibly important that you as a council  understand that mental health and addiction are only one of the barriers  that our displaced citizens face.  Even with trauma therapy and addiction services, if the people have no home to live in  to keep them safe,  to keep them warm,  to provide basic necessities,  we can never expect them to move out of the primary state of their brain,  which is fight, flight, or freeze.  And where cognitive reasoning and planning does not exist,  we will still have the housing crisis that exists today,  with a major failure rate of attempted mental health treatment services.  It won't work unless we're addressing everything.  This is only a component.  This is one aspect of many that we need to coincide with each other  to bridge the gap of life success and total devastation for both the individuals,  and the community.  So I do support this.  I just want to reiterate that this is a piece,  I know that there is an anti-housing-cursed idea out there,  and it's incredibly important that human beings have housing and other services,  but they also need access to mental health care and addiction services  that they do not have access.  Thank you.  Nicole Nava, followed by Derek Sanderson.  I will spare you my happy dance that this is even being addressed right now.  Thank you.  Actually, I have a question.  Actually, I got to go.  No, I won't do it.  All right.  So anyway, in all seriousness, I appreciate that this is on the agenda.  Part of it, to address the concern over the housing piece,  is the theory being that these would be like residential treatment facilities, right?  So that's supported housing,  and hopefully the next step would be semi-supported,  and then on the way to their own housing.  These are huge, glaring issues that for some reason,  the can keeps getting kicked down the road at a state level, at a federal level.  And to me, this is not an insurmountable issue.  Yes, is it going to take a lot of money by the state feds?  Certainly it will.  Is it going to take a lot of time as well?  Certainly it will.  But we have to start down the road.  If we keep talking about talking about it,  these folks will continue to be people that are disadvantaged and in the throes of chaos.  And so we have actionable things we can do.  And I talked about things, and I talked about assigning a deadline.  This is a narrow request,  but I really love what the ex-chief laid down about trying to network with others.  As you might recall, I had recommended that a long time ago,  and I actually did reach out to some other communities who are interested in collaborating  and doing like a mass resolution of support for something like this.  I think it would absolutely gather the attention of state and federal officials on this,  and to try to get funding aligned in this area,  and get us moving incrementally down the road.  There's people who already have talked at the supervisor level, right,  about regional models, and working together to support in areas like this.  There's a lot of data to back up that this is needed.  Prior speaker talking about ACEs,  that's some of the information that I did provide in a data sheet.  I used data that was collected here locally.  I used the state data and the federal data to try to draw the correlation that,  this is bigger than just Chico.  And so, we're spending a lot of our own money on this.  We can and do need mandates to change,  so that there can be better care for our mentally ill.  We need more beds, which changing those mandates at the state level would allow for.  It would lift a lot of the burden of all the discussion we constantly have  about what the city can and should do,  because I really do feel like the state and feds need to take on this.  and really focus on some of the onus of this and the funding  and those mandate changes.  And then, your will would be to work within that framework, funding, whatever,  and partner with the county to look at what that would look like if it comes to fruition.  So, I think it's a small ask to kind of get together and do this resolution of support.  And I really hope it can be seven to zero this time.  That would be fantastic.  Thank you for hearing me.  Derek Sanderson is our last speaker.  No offense to Jessica or Nicole, but I almost referenced us as the Three Stooges,  seeing as we close out the last few.  I totally agree with this, but I also love that Councilmember O'Brien did bring up the idea of collaborating with some other cities.  Like, there's a lot of power and authority that comes from when groups come together,  when cities and municipalities come together in Connecticut.  I agree and approach Sacramento for some of these things.  Will Sacramento listen?  I have no idea.  But I do believe that that would be powerful.  The truth is the city can't bear the cost of this burden financially.  The county can't.  We just can't.  And the reality is we're already spending a ton of money on this.  The county is already spending a ton of money.  I'm normally not a proponent of just throwing money at things,  hoping for a better outcome.  However, I believe if we can get some more support from Sacramento, from D.C., especially financially,  I think that it can help us get ahead and be able to catch up on some things.  So I'm in full support, whatever it looks like, in drafting this letter.  Thank you.  All right.  I keep thinking that we should have one of those letters where you send it to somebody,  it's a chain letter, and they have to write ten letters.  And send it to ten of their friends.  And send it to ten of their friends' cities to send forward.  That might be the way to go.  Does anyone want to put forward a motion?  Or I'm happy to do it if you don't.  All right.  So for staff to write and draft a letter, which, of course, I'd end up signing,  that's similar but probably better crafted than what I put forward.  And then also to do outreach, whether that be by letter or other means,  to cities in the north state.  And counties as well.  Asking them to do the similar action.  I'll second that.  All right.  Madam Clerk.  Okay.  Just a moment.  Discussion?  No.  Okay.  Sorry.  My going slower.  Council Member Bennett?  Yes.  Council Member Brown?  No.  Because I think I'd want to see the letter when we do things like this.  Context absolutely matters.  And I think the framing is important to me.  I don't like the framing of the current letter.  I'd like to see the next one before putting my name on it.  Okay.  Council Member Morgan?  Yes.  Council Member O'Brien?  Yes.  Council Member Tandon?  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds?  Aye.  Mayor Coolidge?  Aye.  Carries 6-1.  All right.  Reports and communications.  The following reports and communication items are provided for the council's information.  No direction can be taken on items under this section unless the council agrees to include  it on a subsequent agenda.  City Manager's report.  Yes.  Honorable Mayor, members of the council, just a quick update.  You know, I've been trying to give more and more information out during these reports,  trying to also be cognizant of time.  But as you're aware, the city did compete for a grant.  And we won that victory.  Council's very well aware of it.  We've been working with the state water resources control board to make improvements to the unpaved  portion of Overpark Road.  Been having a lot of questions recently as to where that's at, what the status is.  And really the goal targeted for that is to reduce the sediment from entering Big Chico  Creek along with improving the roadway surface.  Well, staff has already taken the opportunity to proceed on getting the design complete.  It's now complete.  And right now the project has been slightly delayed due to the park division staffing  bandwidth.  and navigating through the environmental review process,  but the regulatory agencies such as Fish and Wildlife  and through the state and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers  are finalizing review.  The city has applications,  and staff hope to wrap up the environmental review process very soon.  The required CEQA 30-day public comment period ends on November 2nd,  which is right around the corner,  and public comments will also be taken  at the October 25th Park Commission meeting.  Finally, I just want to say that staff does intend  on putting the project out to bid in January.  So if everybody's wondering when is this finally going to get out to bid,  January of next year, which is just a few months away,  with the hopes of an early summer 2022 construction schedule,  it's going to take about four months to complete.  So we hope in 2022 you will see that vision  that you've already given staff completed.  Just want to give that status update with that.  That's all I have to share. Thank you.  All right. Thank you very much.  Council Member requests pursuant to APNP.  10. Council members may verbally request an item  to be agendized at a future meeting.  After stating what the item would be,  a majority vote of the council is needed  in order for staff to agendize.  Council members may also submit requests in writing.  Do we have any requests?  All right. Seeing none,  council will recess in the closed session.  Do we have any public comments  or council member disqualifications?  All right. So adjourn to closed session.  We'll pass it over to Council Member Thanks. [inaudible]  We'll pass it over to Council Member  We'll pass it over to Council Member  Thank you.
