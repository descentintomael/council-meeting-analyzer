 or we will stop you and ask you not to do that.  And with that, we will move on to the closed session announcement from City Attorney Vincent.  Thank you, Mayor Coolidge.  The City Attorney, City Manager, City Clerk, and staff met in closed session on the listed agenda items.  The items that the Council considered were 2.1 and 2.2.  No action was taken.  And the other items, 2.3, 4, 5, 6, 7, were not considered at that time.  They will be considered at a later closed session today.  All right.  Thank you very much.  And then, Madam Clerk, just a clarification here on these resolutions on the consent agenda.  Do we need to read their title?  So resolutions never need to be read, and we also need to do roll call.  Oh, let's do that first.  Okay. Awesome.  I thought we already did that.  But we did it in closed session.  We did it for a closed session.  So let's go ahead and do that.  Council Member Bennett.  Here.  Council Member Morgan.  Here.  Council Member Tandon.  Here.  Council Member Van Overbeek.  Here.  Council Member Winslow.  Here.  Vice Mayor Reynolds is out.  Mayor Coolidge.  Present.  Thank you.  All right.  Consent agenda.  All matters listed on the consent agenda are considered routine in nature and, therefore,  can be enacted in one motion.  Do we have any speakers on the content?  We have one.  And the speaker is Ciceri Sherry.  For the consent agenda.  Come on down.  Three minutes.  All right.  Thank you.  I did queue up this time.  I just scattered my stuff around.  All right.  Thank you.  So this is 2.6.  The resolution for the grant application, $3 million for improvements to the Park Avenue corridor.  I'm in favor of this.  Park Avenue is full of broken sidewalks, dead trees.  It's generally derelict.  It's really, I live in that area, and it's not really a pleasure to walk down the street.  So improvements to landscaping through this grant would be a great start, although I'd  like to note that the best investment possible in the Park Avenue corridor would be to replace  the dilapidated and unused buildings with decent mixed-income housing.  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right.  And do we have any council disqualifications or no votes on any of the items?  All right.  Seeing none, I'll entertain a motion.  Motion approved.  Thanks, Dr. Simpson.  A motion from council.  I'm sorry.  I didn't hear that.  Motion from Councilmember Winslow, second from Councilmember Tandon.  Okay. Thank you.  When you're ready.  Okay. And that, just a second.  I did not get the second.  No problem.  Okay. And that's a motion and a second.  To approve the consent agenda as read, the ordinance, and the consent agenda are in the agenda.  All right.  And the second is that the expenses do need to be read.  So it's ordinance of the City Council of the City of Chico amending Chapter 14.70 of the  Chico Municipal Code to regulate the use of public right of way for operation of outdoor  cafes.  Final reading and adoption by reading of title only.  Councilmember Bennet?  Yes.  Councilmember Morgan?  Yes.  Councilmember Tandon?  Yes.  Councilmember Van Overbeek?  Yes.  Councilmember Winslow?  Yes.  Mayor Coolidge?  Aye.  Carries 6-0 with one absence.  All right.  We'll move on to business for the day.  Council on the floor, members of the public may address the Council at this time on any  matter not already listed on the agenda.  That's the magic word.  The Council cannot take any action at this meeting on request made under this section  of the agenda.  How many speakers?  We have seven unless Danny, do you have any additional?  Okay.  We have seven.  All right.  Three minutes.  Okay.  And if I call the first two names, if you could line up in the center aisle, it would  be really great.  James Hutchinson followed by Rebecca Geiser.  Okay.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Okay great.  Okay great great great great great great great great great great great great great Really funny last night is going through the computer looking at a local project that was being built in the area of Humboldt Road and Forest. There's an aerial photograph and you look down and you see these little bags down below it.  great great great great great great great great great great great great great  The garbage bags, the ones that I filled up months ago,  when that area was supposed to be cleaned up, nobody took them off.  Before Thanksgiving, I had to take them out of there because the storms were coming  and because there were going to be a lot of people in there.  I spent hours out there with a hand truck removing these bags of garbage  that I'd gathered up from a previous camp.  The camp further on, District 7, hadn't even been touched.  It was a huge pile of stuff.  There were four different camps in an upper area, three down on the creek.  I put them all together, hoping that when they came to do the cleanup  that was supposed to be done, that we were told was done.  Nobody showed up.  Stuff's still sitting there right now.  Went out the other day, photographed it, looked at it.  There it is.  This is what's going on.  You're sweeping things under the rug, just under the rug.  We watched the media.  We watched the people speaking to them.  The media about the successful job of cleaning up.  It wasn't.  It's a lie.  Things were swept under the rug.  I'm getting a little tired of seeing things swept under the rug.  Went out this morning.  We had bottles smashed, alcohol, at a bus stop.  Another pathway that kids use on Humboldt going just above Dead Horse Slough.  I cleaned them up, all of them.  Cleaned up under Dead Horse Slough, three of the four areas under there.  It's a camp that's been under there for years.  It's being rebuilt.  There's a radiator that was sitting there when the cleanup was supposed to be done.  It's sitting there underneath the bridge.  It's part of the guys trying to set up this camp again.  This guy is probably developmentally disabled.  You can watch him.  He comes down there.  He sets up camp, throws everything, all the garbage around he can,  because he wants to claim this for himself.  Understandable.  That's the role model that a lot of these people have now.  You've got people out there whose only role model is them to claim,  a campsite for yourself, is to spread garbage.  We had another guy came out there with, came out there  with three carts blocked off the roadway to the bridge.  If you've ever been on the bridge where a forest crosses Lutequil Creek,  it's a narrow place.  Watched a guy in a wheelchair have to go out into the street in a very narrow aisle,  very busy aisle.  Things aren't getting done.  You're only doing the places that show.  Be proud of yourselves.  Thank you, Rebecca Geiser, followed by Nicole Nava.  Yes, I just want to direct my comments to the, my acquaintances and friends who I've asked to watch from home.  Please keep watching the meetings.  Please tune into the Planning Commission meetings.  Pay attention to what's happening.  Most of these people only won their seats by one.  If we can get them to vote, by a handful of votes, we can do better.  Thanks.  Thank you.  Nicole Nava, followed by Gee Gold.  Good evening, Council and staff.  As you know, we're heading into the budget portion of discussions,  and so I thought it would be prudent to bring up something that I think a lot of us citizens think of,  which is how you're going to point that money and what you're going to point it at and why.  And fundamentally, I think that's what we're going to be doing.  But, actually, I still haven't seen us land on what do we want to be as a city,  and what are we in the business of in.  Today a friend sent like a screenshot that I found interesting.  I think it was from somewhere in Oregon.  It was like here's what the county does, and it was bulleted.  And it was here's what the city does, and it's bulleted.  So it was making it clear to the citizenry, we get our role.  We want you to understand your role and where you go to address the items.  I just want us to, as we come up to things, think about how much is going to a certain portion of the population and what those needs are.  I'm concerned about entities that are like some of the MPOs that are losing funding from private donors that are pointing their money toward other things lately.  And I worry that also the city is falling into that.  I've heard talk about maybe more pallet shelters.  And we still haven't even opened the renewal center that will have 100 beds or Everhart Village that will have 20 beds.  And I think we need to decide where we want to land before we start driving halfway there and allocate funding for things that we maybe need to really understand what are our goals.  I am appreciative that there's been efforts made to make things nicer at the resting sites.  And I appreciate how much that Public Works has to...  I appreciate how much that Public Works has to do and the people at the pallet shelter site have to do and even tourists and other places that are trying to stack hands on moving people forward in their life.  What I'm concerned with is places like we have Public Works trying to hold a lot up around the city, not just things happening with the homeless community.  And so if we take on even more obligations, then we're strapping them in to something where we might not have funded to the level that is going to be needed for maybe standing up 100 more pallets or whatever.  Right.  Right. whatever might be on the horizon. I would love to see maybe do some type of forum where we can hear what the plan is to address the situation. I also would love your support  Right.  Right.  Right.  Right.  Right. to produce the executive summary. Every year we wait months to see it. It's a software program that spits out numbers.  out numbers. They have a template  that they save. The data is  there. It's the narrative people  work on, and we deserve to know  what's going to happen and why.  And so if you can  help in that regard, it'd be appreciated. Thank you  so much. Thank you. G.  Gold, followed by Ciceri Sherry.  Previous  police chief of police  Mike Maloney recently said on  Facebook, and I quote,  quote, it's sad, even  embarrassing when you look at the cited  statutes and tell  the lengths the legislature has gone  to try to catch the police  with failure to comply with some  obscure, ridiculous requirement.  Accountability is one  thing, but this is over-the-top  micromanagement. And what does  our current police chief do?  He gives his Facebook post  a thumbs-up approval.  So let's be clear.  Our current police chief does not  see transparency in our future.  He does not see  any sort of emphasis on setting  a priority for de-escalation process  and procedure.  Perhaps our police chief has forgotten  he has a sworn oath  to uphold the law, and  that is whether he personally agrees with the  law or not.  This conduct by the chief of  police in Chico is reprehensible  and unacceptable.  There have been more, but I'm just  going to mention these deaths caused  by Chico police over the last few years.  Gabe Sanchez,  Tyler Rushing,  Desmond Phillips,  and Stephen Vest.  When body cameras were rolled  out to some 18,000 departments  across the United States,  they were meant to usher in  a new era of police trust.  But trust in the  police has not increased, in part  because less than 1% of these  body cam videos are never  reviewed. Each year,  100 million hours of video  are sitting in the cloud  untouched.  With the lack of transparency  of the Chico Police Department,  we can only guess, but my research  indicates that 80 to 90%  of police officer training  revolves around weapons training.  This has to change.  Across this country,  we are at a crossroads.  The only path to peaceful,  respectful relationships between  the police and our community,  is to make sure that 80 to 90%  of police training is to focus  on de-escalation techniques,  not weapons training.  It's time to focus  on process  and procedure outlined by NACAL.  NACAL is the National  Association for Civil Oversight  by Law Enforcement,  and is a recognized  national non-profit which plays  essential national role  in identifying  effective practices to reduce the risk of  police violence.  Continuing to use, buy, and deploy  military weapons right here in Chico,  California, is a recipe  for their misuse, and will lead  to increased police violence.  Deploying military  weapons here in our town,  and without refocusing our police department  priorities, the next police  related to violence and or killing,  all that blood will be on your hands.  Yes, sir.  Okay, Ciceri,  Sherry,  followed by Jessica Giannola.  All right, and if you want to address  that agenda item, please do it under that  agenda item. Thank you.  All right. Thank you.  So it  doesn't matter how many  resources you throw at the problem,  there will always be people on the street.  Some people have been outside for so long  that they simply can't adapt  to life inside.  I've seen people go into the  pallet shelter and then into permanent  housing, become unable to adapt,  and are back on the street.  And that's just reality,  and we may not want to accept it,  but it is what it is.  And so the best thing we can do for those people  is to help them stay alive  and show them as much love as we can.  And the lack of  24-hour bathroom and clean water  access only serves to inflict  pain and cruelty.  And I'm afraid that this is the  system that we're in right now.  So I'm working as intended.  Thank you.  Thank you. Jessica Giannullo, followed by Jared Geiser.  Hi, Council.  I have two things that I wanted to comment  on tonight. One was  the recent, I forget what you  called it, but the mayor had given a speech  for the year and going over  accomplishments for the city.  I was a little surprised to see  the part where he had  stated that he or the city  had to do something about it.  we had done more than enough  for the housing crisis in our community.  And I just would ask that you  just look around and  consider, are we doing  more than enough or could we do more?  Because when we have  people that are still without your  most basic resources,  you have a city that's still living in a  state of crisis and  anger and all sorts of things that  it's just not healthy  for a community. And if we're able to  see what more we could do  to help them, I think that's a good thing.  But if we're able to see what more we could do to help meet those needs,  we can celebrate together as a community  and saying that we've been able to accomplish  something really important.  The second part that I wanted to comment  on is just this  growing trend that I'm seeing  from our current council.  I'm sure it's actually probably been  from probably all of our councils, honestly.  And it's this type  of retaliatory type approach  to our community,  to people who would like  to sit positions like yourself.  other commission seats, or whatever it might be.  And when we're selecting people who have shown an interest,  are we selecting them based on their qualifications  and maybe them being a good leader like yourselves?  Or are we not choosing them because of something they would have done in the community?  Like maybe they ran a referendum or maybe they ran a recall effort.  Whatever it might be, those are people that are exercising their right to free speech.  And we should really celebrate them for standing up and being brave  because standing up in front of the community can be kind of hard to do.  So instead of pushing them down or saying,  I really don't want to have that person because they voted against me,  that kind of thing sends a bad message to our community.  And it intimidates them, someone else that you might respect  that would be willing to stand up and maybe even vote for things that you approve of.  So it just sends a bad message.  And then the next council round goes, okay, it's our turn.  We'll do the same debate.  They did.  And then down the line it goes.  It never ends.  So if we could just be responsible in how we're voting for our people,  supporting our fellow council members that maybe we don't necessarily agree with,  it just sends a signal of support within the community  that we can be grown-ups about choosing our representatives together.  Thank you.  Thank you.  And our final speaker is Jared Geiser.  Good evening, council.  Good evening, staff.  I wanted to speak tonight on a couple of things,  one of them being representative democracy.  And our representatives should represent the different sectors of our community.  And they should have knowledge that's pertinent for them to be able to serve their community.  And here in this country we have different levels of government  to ensure different levels of representation.  And in our local government we also have different levels of government,  some to increase representation.  And the commissions are one example.  And I think that's a good example of the city having more of the people involved in the decision-making process.  So it's improving democracy to have these commissions.  But using hyper-partisan tactics to take away a councilor's commission appointees  is subverting the representative democracy process and is taking a step towards authoritarianism.  Councillor Winslow appointed very qualified commissioners to each respective commission,  and the council rejects appointees to two of them, which I found quite appalling.  This is unprecedented.  This is unprecedented.  Rafael DiGenova has expert level knowledge of the ecosystems of Chico parks  and understands how to steward the land to enhance it.  To deny him the opportunity to serve the community and our local parks is completely absurd.  Councillor Winslow's planning commission appointee is also getting wrapped up in hyper-partisan politics.  Maggie Scarpa is incredibly qualified to serve on the planning commission,  and removing her after she was appointed is a gross example of political retaliation  and suppression of representative democracy.  I would also like to speak in favour tonight of Councillor DiGenova's  Councillor Winslow's request to agendize a discussion on the pro-housing designation.  There seems to be a broad consensus in our community that we need more housing,  and so this seems like an easy way that we might be able, the city might be able to tap into  additional grant funds from the state of California, as well as the city being able to help expedite  some housing development. So I would just like to encourage you all to consider voting to approve  Councillor Winslow's discussion on the pro-housing designation, and I'd like you all to consider  representative democracy and the tactics you're using as our leaders. Thank you.  He was our final speaker. All right, one further note. So we did not complete our closed session,  so at our first break we will finish out closed session. I'm guessing probably about a half hour,  35 minutes for that. So we started at five, so we'd like to finish that, and then  we'll do it.  If we have, moving on to public hearings, I did 4.1 hearing to reconsider the 2023,  and if we could just keep it quiet here while we try to do this, draft annual action plan for the  use of federal community block grant development funds, CDGB, and home investment partnership  grant home funds, and we have Mary Jo Alonzo, housing program analyst. Welcome.  Hello, good evening, Mayor, Vice Mayor, and Council Members. I'm Mary Jo Alonzo,  housing program analyst. I'm Mary Jo Alonzo, housing program analyst. I'm Mary Jo Alonzo,  housing program analyst with the city, and I'm before you tonight to present the draft  2023-2024 annual plan for public hearing as required for use of federal funding from the  Department of Housing and Urban Development. Chico is an entitlement community and a home  participating jurisdiction whereby funds are annually allocated by a formula based upon a  number of demographic and socioeconomic factors. The funds assist the city in addressing the needs  of low-income households. The funds assist the city in addressing the needs of low-income households,  and neighborhoods, and our community. Every five years, a consolidated plan is developed with very  broad goals to be achieved over the subsequent five years. The priority needs are identified  in the 2020-2024 plan, and those include affordable housing, homelessness prevention, homelessness  services, neighborhood revitalization, and economic development. This annual plan represents the fourth  year of the city's annual plan. The plan is a plan that will be used to address the needs of low-income  households and great bonds and  to satisfy both federal and state priorities.  And as detailed in the proposed budget,  a lion's share of the CDBG and home funding  is going toward affordable housing projects,  two of which are located on city-owned land,  and these projects have been in the development pipeline for several years.  The city has a vested interest in continuing the funding  for these projects and activities.  Home funds have limited uses,  and eligible activities include tenant-based rental assistance,  which we refer to as TBRA,  construction of rental housing,  which includes the Creekside Place Project,  North Creek Crossings Phase 2,  and 1297 Park Avenue,  and the development of five units with Habitat for Humanity.  The funding also can go towards program and administration.  CDBG has a broader overall range of eligible activities,  but has somewhat restricted housing uses.  Staff's recommendations for this grant funding  is also in line with priorities identified in the five-year con plan  and the city's draft housing element.  Utilizing CDBG funds,  the draft plan includes funding for housing programs and projects,  which include sewer connections and program delivery,  site and off-site improvements for Habitat for Humanity on Wisconsin,  multifamily development,  this is going towards the Park Avenue project,  housing services,  which includes the administration of the TBRA program,  economic development activities,  which are provided through the Small Business Development Center with Butte College,  code enforcement activities,  and program administration,  which includes general program administration and fair housing trainings,  as well as some funding for the COC administration.  The final planned activity,  sorry, I was supposed to go to,  there we go, okay.  And then the final activity,  I thought I had another slide, sorry.  The final planned activity for CDBG funding is for the public services.  Funding recommendations for those activities  come from the CDBG Ad Hoc Citizens Advisory Committee,  which meets twice a year,  and they hold two public meetings  where they hear from applicants through presentations,  and then they meet again,  to come up with a recommendation for the public service funding.  And this year, they came to a unified consensus  to fund six applicants,  and that proposed budget is included in attachment D  to the staff report.  Outreach to the public on the annual plan  has been made through notices on paper,  it's on the city's website,  and through community meetings,  and during tonight's public hearing.  The next steps,  the draft plan is available to review  on the city's housing website,  and comments may be made at today's hearing,  and in writing to the email that's up on the slide.  The annual plan is available for review for 30 days,  and will be heard again at the May 2nd council meeting.  At conclusion of tonight's public hearing,  the community development director recommends  council schedule a final hearing on the draft annual plan  for the May 2nd council meeting,  and this concludes my report.  All right, any questions?  It seems that you left out  the most important piece of information,  which is who are you recommending get the grants?  Which organizations?  That information is provided in the staff report.  I do- No, but I'd like to have it now.  Okay, I do have a slide.  Let me see.  All right, we have a question.  I have a follow-up question while you're looking for that.  If I may, Mr. Van Overbeek.  And it may just be my addition of your report,  but the link that shows  this year's funding request applications is broken.  So I can't see who applied,  just who you rewarded money to.  Oh, really?  I double-checked them, but sorry about that.  There were nine applicants.  They're all, they're showing right here.  And this spreadsheet is also included  in attachment D of the staff report, which is,  the final funding matrix provided  after the second meeting of the community action  or the community advisory committee.  And so there were nine grant applications.  There's a minimum funding recommendation of $20,000.  And so that automatically,  based on how the money flows,  you have to remove three of the applications  in order to meet that minimum funding requirement.  funding recommendation? Can you speak as to why the Jesus Center wasn't awarded anything and  maybe why they were told they weren't being awarded anything? Well, yes, I actually have it all written here.  So the funding recommendations were based on, they were directed at organizations that were  providing permanent improvements to the prevention of homelessness. The committee weighed case  management services, especially for those who are mentally ill, as higher because there aren't as  many funding sources for those services. Funding was recommended for organizations whose budget  showed the greatest need and presented in a clear and accurate manner.  So can you name an organization in Chico that has done more to help get homeless people off the  street than the Jesus Center? I can't.  I mean...  That's not...  As staff, that's not up to me. This is why it goes through the whole public process with the committee.  I would say in my staff report, it was a very hard decision as it is in every year.  Who was on the committee this time?  Same committee members that we've had.  Did you guys kick anybody off this time?  No.  Same committee members that were appointed last year.  You kicked me off. Somebody did.  That was a year ago.  That was a year before.  And I deserve...  I deserved it. It was all right.  But I'm very troubled that, you know, solving this homeless problem is a big issue and creating  shelter for the people that are being...  The camps are cleared.  The Jesus Center stepped in and made that happen for us.  And so the fact that you aren't supporting them troubles me greatly.  And I know it's not your fault, personally.  Thank you.  Thank you.  The recommendations are from the committee.  No, I understand.  But what I mean, I mean the group is not supporting...  Yes.  If they're not supporting the Jesus Center, I have a problem.  And it may just be the metrics they're using.  And it's within your purview, though, to move forward as you see fit.  This is what has been brought to you, I guess.  And these are...  This is...  We're just at the draft stage here.  So everything is still open for discussion.  Yeah, we can't make changes.  Okay.  At a public hearing, can we make changes?  Or do we have to wait until it comes back?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It will be...  It's scheduled to come back on May 2nd.  Of course, we could bring it back in two weeks.  All right.  Do we have any other questions?  We'll get you out of the hot seat.  Okay.  Okay.  All right.  So we will open the public hearing.  Do we have any speakers?  We do not.  Okay.  Close the public hearing.  Will the council.  Got me.  I feel like Mr. Ben, I'll go back to that.  The Jesus Center has been a pretty good partner.  I don't know exactly what the metrics have been.  I know I've disagreed with them in the past.  I know you've disagreed with them in the past.  I will approve the current allocation of funds,  not without rewarding the group that has done...  done more and worked better with the city than anybody else.  And I will repeat it,  but one of the things I heard from the Jesus Center  as to why they weren't allocated funding was egregious enough  that I question the entire process.  But I'm just one vote.  Well, but it's just a hearing, right?  We don't have to...  I'm just saying if it comes back the way it is now, but...  Yeah.  Yeah.  I would think that would be ample warning for our department  as well as our committee.  So, Ms. Winslow, do you have a comment?  All right.  All right.  Mr. Mayor?  Sure.  The...  Are we saying we want CBDG to come back with a new recommendation?  Well, I think they understand that, but we don't need to make a motion.  Okay.  It does...  It is scheduled to come back already.  So...  Are you providing any direction to staff to change the plan or...  Yeah.  I can't provide that direction.  I'm just saying where my vote is headed.  But if anybody agrees with me, we might want to give them direction  to maybe rethink their process.  I think before giving direction to change the process,  maybe it'd be good for us to look at what the process is.  I'm not sure what you heard from the Jesus Center,  but I'd be interested in hearing more about it  or having more information from staff  before we reconsider this at the May 2nd meeting.  Just make them look.  How would we do that?  So what would be the recommendation in order for us to proceed?  So if you want staff to bring back more information in terms of the process,  and we can do that, but when is the next...  So it's supposed to come back at the meeting on May 2nd,  but perhaps staff could bring back a report on the process at the next meeting,  the second meeting in April.  Is that okay?  Or I don't want to speak for staff.  Sure.  Yeah.  I think that's good.  You need a motion to do that?  It's just direction.  All right.  Direction given.  All right.  Thank you very much.  All right.  We'll move on to the regular agenda.  Item 5.1, which is here for about to edge a referendum on Resolution 0823  and referendum on Resolution 0923.  So typically, so everybody knows if we have, what, over 15 speakers,  we do two minutes.  If we have over 25, we do one.  One minute.  How many speakers do we have?  We have 21.  All right.  We have 21.  All right.  So just a heads up, but let's have the report from the city clerk first.  Okay.  And then...  Do I need to recuse myself at this point?  Yes.  Yes.  Yeah.  My property adjoins Valley's Edge, so I'm going to recuse myself.  All right.  Thank you very much.  We'll wait for you to leave the room and get a report from city clerk Deborah Preston.  Okay.  Just a moment.  So we...  We now have two additional...  So we have 23 speakers.  So how much time when we get there?  Two minutes.  Two minutes?  Okay.  All right.  So Mayor Coolidge and council, thank you.  As you're aware, on January 3rd, the council took action to approve the Valley's Edge project.  You did that through a myriad of actions.  There were resolutions adopted, two of which were part of a referendum, Resolution 08,  23, and 09-23.  One was for the general plan amendment for Valley's Edge.  The additional one was for the specific plan approval.  On February 13th, the proponents of the referendum turned in their signatures.  I counted over 16,000.  We took them over to the county.  They did a full count, and they found and deemed them sufficient.  What you have before you is a certification from my office,  certifying that the county did find that those signatures,  that 10% or more of the signatures were obtained,  and it is now up to the council to decide what you want to do.  Pursuant to elections law and the elections code, you have two options.  One is to either call for a special election or schedule it for a different time.  Even...  You could even delay it until the general municipal election in 2024.  That's a new...  That's a change in the...  That's a change in the general municipal election in 2024.  As well as you can resend your actions.  And so I'm just looking for direction from what you would like me to bring back to you at a future meeting.  All right.  So any questions for the court?  Yeah.  I've heard some numbers be thrown out as far as the cost of elections would go.  I'm wondering if you have any further information on the cost of a special election  versus holding the election during a regularly scheduled election like March 2024 or November.  Well, the county was very gracious.  Typically, they don't, you know, give out estimates right away.  And...  But they did say that if we did...  So let me back up.  Pursuant to our charter,  our charter allows for special elections to be conducted by mailed-only ballots.  We are already countywide mailed ballots,  but we also have drop boxes and there are some precincts that are set up.  So there's a couple of different options.  What I did get and hear from the county was solely,  solely for a special election.  And that cost is estimated for mailed ballots only,  not drop boxes and no precincts, about $266,000.  Again, I did not check to see what it would be  if you wanted to place it on the ballot for the primary in 2024.  And then you have the general municipal election.  Typically, because the city of Chico conducts and is pursuant to our...  to our charter and our code,  that we hold our elections in November.  So even if we tag on to a primary,  it would be somewhat considered a special election for the city of Chico  because we don't typically forward any ballot measures then.  So I would need to check to see what the cost might be  if we were to ask the council...  Excuse me, ask the county to consolidate our battle...  that special election on these two items for the primary.  For the general municipal election,  it's running as about $100,000 per ballot measure.  And that's what it was at this last election.  So I feel comfortable in saying that.  But for the primary, if you were looking at getting it onto the primary,  which is not typically our election,  I would need to go back and get costs on that.  You're welcome.  All right, further questions, the clerk?  All right.  Seeing none.  So the audience knows, too,  we generally don't do applause or snapping or cheering  just because we don't want to make either side feel intimidated  when they go to speak.  So if we could keep that non-existent, we'd appreciate that.  Let's go ahead with two minutes.  Okay, and I would ask, since we do have 21 speakers,  if you could please go ahead and line up in the middle aisle.  Our first speaker is James Hedgeson,  followed by Loretta Torres.  Thank you.  Paul and Paul used to say,  you've got to get the little things right in order to do the big things.  And in this case, they didn't get the little things even right.  Go back to your environmental questionnaire.  It says, what schools are affected by this?  If you look at the valley edge, what they said, schools that are affected,  they talked about Chapman Town.  They talked about Sierra View Elementary being five miles away.  These were the only two elementary schools they brought up.  Anybody think of another one?  Anybody represent District 7?  Little Cheekle Creek Elementary School.  It happens to be the closest of any of the elementary schools to this development.  It is already impacted by Merriam Park.  It is already going to be impacted by the low-income housing that they're putting across from it.  By the way, don't be fooled.  That senior housing project that's there, it's not senior housing.  Only one senior needs to be there.  The rest of them can be underused.  They're that age.  They can be kids.  They can be anything, as long as there's one senior.  Now, the five people?  That school is impacted, big time.  They didn't get it right.  Take a look at their valley.  They didn't get it right.  It's closest.  It's 1.9 miles away.  1.9 miles from the 20th Street exit.  They didn't get that right.  I'm not an environmental expert.  I don't need to be.  I can see this is wrong.  I can see you've got people disqualifying themselves from voting today,  but they're out in the media campaigning for it.  They're being lobbyists right here.  Conflict of interest?  That's time.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Loretta Torres, followed by Gabrielle Broach.  I took a look at this plan when it was first proposed, and I loved it.  I mean, the use of land.  Versus the pristineness of the property.  I really thought it was well-planned and well-thought-out.  It's literally pretty close to my backyard.  So I could easily say, oh, not in my backyard.  But yet, where I would like the people who are against this to think about when there's infill already filled,  and this will be, this plan is for Thursdays,  30 years to come,  when, where exactly would you want Chico to expand?  North?  South?  Farmland there?  Orchards?  And west?  Towards the Sacramento River?  No, that's farmland.  So I'm saying, please, step up, council.  This is not a popular thing.  Do whatever you need to do to,  have a reasonable 30-year plan,  which is, according to our city, I believe, plans,  actually fits in with Chico's perspective of growth in 30 years.  So please, I am for this.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Gabrielle Broach, followed by Jacqueline Chase.  The city council is strongly in favor.  I'm sure that the city council is also in favor of the development of the new !  of this beautiful community.  Vote our community!  Vote on the fate of a beautiful natural surroundings that so many of us moved up here for.  An important point to make is this, the required signatures on the petition had to be registered  voters in Chico.  This means that the people in Paradise who are going to be affected by the development  could not sign.  The people of Butte Creek Canyon did not qualify as were the residents of Stillson and Stillson.  and Canyon and Forest Ranch.  So you know what they did?  They became volunteers, gathering signatures and donating what they could.  Was this a concern of yours, that the people who surround the areas did not have a voice  in the matter?  The qualified signatures represent more than themselves.  They represented the surrounding residences, the trees, the animals, the flora, the memas  and more.  And that's what I'll say.  Thank you.  Jacqueline Chase, followed by Susan Tichuti.  Good evening, counselors, staff.  We never got a very good answer from Fire Chief Stanbridge on how changes to the fire  risk map that were brought by the Office of the State Fire Marshal on November 22nd might  change his and the council's.  opinion on this development.  There's a lot of unfinished business, a lot of new information that has been rolling out,  and this is a good example of one.  The area that the project is now in has been recategorized as high risk.  We hear time and again, if our fire chief says it's okay, it must be safe.  It's a big assumption.  Most of the time, fire experts are cautious.  They acknowledge the unpredictable nature of wildfire.  He himself...  Chief Stanbridge said in the new Chico wildfire protection plan that wildfire today is the  new normal.  The way it behaves is a new normal, which is very different than what we've been hearing  him being quoted as in the press and by many of the supporters.  Maybe we shouldn't be too surprised as he works for a city that has made no pretense  of its objectivity.  Thank you, Susan.  To Judy, followed by Pamela posing, I apologize if I messed up your name.  Everybody messes up my name.  Good evening, councillors.  Thank you for hearing us.  I just would like to point out one of the things that is claimed about Valley's Edge  is that it is consistent with the general plan.  The only way that it's consistent with the general plan is that it's a special planning  area.  This was designated as a special planning area many years ago.  Things have changed.  It's not the 1950s.  We need to think about...  We need a new paradigm for how we build.  We don't want to sprawl.  We don't want to take over open spaces.  We want infill, and we want density, and that's what the general plan calls for.  Thank you.  I also would like to...  Brief...  Briefly defend the honor of smart growth advocates and save our hometown.  We have not been dishonest or disingenuous or playing fast and loose with the truth.  When we looked at housing prices, we looked at comparables.  We looked at square footage.  We looked at lot sizes.  So we didn't just pull those numbers out of thin air when we said this is not affordable  housing.  We didn't just pull those numbers out of thin air when we said this is not affordable housing.  And I want...  I want you to defend the honor of this group of people.  They're honest, they're careful, they're thoughtful, and their work has been fact-based.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Pamela Posey, followed by Ann Ponzio.  Thank you.  Good evening, members of the Chico City Council and staff.  You've heard the people of Chico speak.  In the recent successful referendum, let there be no development of the foothill area called  Valley's Edge.  You're here tonight to cast a decision as to how to proceed, hopefully to rescind your  approval of the Valley's Edge project.  I have a solution.  Let the people buy the land for a preserve, keeping it undeveloped with its unique qualities  in perpetuity forever for all future generations of Chicoans to enjoy.  There are many examples in the state of California where this has been accomplished.  Along the California coastline, there are several reserves that are funded and facilitated  by local conservancies, Trust for Public Land, and the California Parks and Recreation.  Some of these preserves are Harmony Headlands Reserve, Estero Bluffs Reserve, and Fiscalini  Ranch Reserve in San Luis Obispo County.  Nearer to us are other prime examples.  The Bear Yuba Land Trust.  The Bear Yuba Land Trust at Rice's Crossing Preserve in Nevada County, and the Best Slough  Vernal Pool Preserve and Reed's Creek Vernal Pool Preserve in Yuba County.  These are excellent demonstrations of where locals and neighboring communities came together  to advocate for the protection of pristine places such as we have right here in our hometown.  The people united to buy these lands from the property owners.  We can do this in Chico.  The great  great  great  great  great  great  great  great  great  great  great  Good evening City Council staff. I'm going to be brief and I'm not going to argue the  merits of this. I'm just here to say I don't think the city will win this one. I don't  see that Valley's Edge has made the case for its approval to the people in Chico who will  not be living there. And that's a lot of people. Valley's Edge sells itself on its beautiful  plan, its incorporation of smart growth and sustainability principles and quality of life  that affords to the, it offers to those who can afford to live there. It is said we will  all thrive because the housing market will be loosened up and we will all be able to  all prosper from the inflow of property taxes and money that the well-to-do residents will  spend in Chico. But people know from experience that a massive suburban development, beautiful  as it is, what it means to the rest of Chico. These supposed gains just haven't materialized  in other cities. I did collect signatures for the referendum from a wide spectrum of  populations. I did collect signatures for the referendum from a wide spectrum of populations.  I did collect signatures for the referendum from a wide spectrum of populations. And it was very easy because Valley's Edge is quite unpopular.  Please consider saving Chico from another lengthy, costly, and bruising battle, which in my opinion the city stands a good chance of losing.  I encourage you to enact policies and pursue funding for truly sustainable ways to deliver  and grow for all of Chico.  Thank you. Nicole Nava, followed by Elizabeth Devereaux.  Good evening. So, first I will direct one comment toward the attorney to look up at the die is and see if there is an obvious problem. I see one. I see someone sitting there who probably should have recused himself immediately after Mr. Van Overbeek, because this person, council member Winslow is a solid foe.  member of the referendum and was sharing on his council page, and that would predispose him  on a certain decision. It does not seem that someone could be objective in that circumstance,  so I just want to put that out there. I think that that would be the responsible thing to do.  Moving on to the actual project itself, it is disheartening to me that this is an actual  housing project. Never has it been said that this one project is a silver bullet for affordable  housing. No one laid that out there as the gold standard. There are many other projects in the  queue, and I know some of these folks are aware of that. It is frustrating when facts get suppressed  that actually lift things up and other things are misrepresented, and everyone suffers.  Really?  We have people leaving. I don't know. Hopefully, people are seeing what's happening. We have  imaging places leaving because they don't get the reimbursements they need. There's reasons for that.  The money is getting pointed a certain direction. Businesses are having to fold because it's going  in a certain direction consistently that is unsustainable, and we are losing professionals  that are medical professionals. We are losing first responders because, of course, our area  cannot sustain this. The housing project,  it is beautiful. It is more than just a beautiful project, though. There was green space preserved,  and they offered to give, like, 700 acres to the city. I just, this is disappointing.  Thank you. Elizabeth Devereaux, followed by Alicia Triter.  Let me just clarify. I don't own any property that's near the project. I don't own any property,  and I didn't receive any campaign donations from anybody who was with the financial stake  in the project. That's why I didn't recuse myself.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Good evening. I just think there's two big issues here that are beyond Valley's Edge.  And the first one is, what kind of a world do we want to leave our children? And Valley's  Edge has a problem with carbon emissions, which can't be mitigated. And the kind of  alternative that we are seeking is,  smart growth, which means more density in underutilized areas, revitalization of downtown  as well, instead of allowing these areas to become blighted.  The second thing that I think is really important is, from here on, what kind of a city do we want  to be? Because we are growing, but we have to actually make a decision. Are we going to keep  sprawling out? Are we going to keep growing? Are we going to keep growing? Are we going to keep  traveling? Are we going to keep traveling? Are we going to keep traveling? Are we going  traveling? Are we going traveling? Are we traveling out? Or are we going to bring people  traveling out? Or are we going to bring people in and make it more safe, more livable, more  traveling out? Or are we going to bring people in and make it more safe, more livable, more  walkable, more transit friendly? And as I mentioned before, I think it's been asserted that  before, I think it's been asserted that millennials and younger people can't afford these larger  more livable, more walkable, more transit friendly? And as I mentioned before, I think it's been asserted that  that. We're not saying no growth. We're saying we want a different kind of growth, and we feel that  this is a turning point right now, and that's why so many people signed the referendum. Thank you.  Thank you, Alicia Triter, followed by Ciceri Sherry.  Hello, Council. My name is Alicia Triter, and I'm here to talk about Valley's Edge.  I'm really happy to report that the people have spoken. Thousands of people signed the petition  against Valley's Edge. We do not want this housing development in Chico, not to mention that our  infrastructure cannot handle it. I also do not support a special election on this because  thousands of people already spoke up telling you they don't support this. We don't need to waste  more time, more money, and more resources on this issue. I support building up, not out, in Chico  within our current city limits and infrastructure.  There are many vacant lots around town where development can and should take place, as well as  large empty buildings that could be repurposed for housing here in Chico. I also support giving this  land back to its original caretakers, the Machupto tribe. I would like you, the city councillors,  to focus on developing affordable, high-density housing within our city. I do not want suburban  sprawl. I don't want Chico to turn into another Sacramento. That being said, please repeal the  original Valley's Edge resolutions and focus on developing affordable, high-density housing within  the Chico city limits. Thank you.  Thank you. Ciceri Sherry, followed by Blake Ellis.  Hello again. The Valley's Edge development is one of the most environmentally and fiscally  irresponsible plans I've ever heard of. Putting so few properties on such a massive amount of land  requiring that much infrastructure will never pay for itself, and it will not support other areas of  this city. I would like to thank the City Council for their support in this effort. I would like to  thank the City Council for their support in this effort. I would like to thank the City Council for  I urge the City Council to repeal their original resolution and refrain from wasting taxpayer money  on a special election. Thank you.  Thank you. Blake Ellis, followed by Steve Deva.  Hi. So I wanted to speak on this issue to show my support and solidarity with Valley's Edge  Resistance. I'm a member of the City Council, and I'm a member of the City Council. I'm a member of  and ask you to rescind your approval of this development.  When Chico community members think about what makes our city great,  we think about our abundant resources, beautiful green spaces,  public parks, and open lands.  When we imagine the beauty Chico has to offer,  we think of Big Chico Creek, Butte Creek, the Rolling Buttes,  vernal pools, oak woodlands, and subdivisions,  as far as the eye can see.  There are a multitude of reasons why I believe this city  should repeal Valley's Edge resolution,  but I'll focus on the one that I feel most passionate about  as a social worker who serves folks impacted by the 2018 Camp Fire  and as someone who's been intimately involved  with the immediate and long-term community and environmental recovery  following that disaster.  This development is in a wildfire zone.  Cal Fire ranks the wildfire threat as very high,  with the likelihood of future wildfires as extremely likely.  Evidence from across the western United States  is shouting us to stop development in wildland urban interface zones  as it's the only way to truly protect communities  communities.  Against deadly and destructive catastrophic wildfire.  Furthermore, this development will also remove our fire buffer  and expose our entire city to increased catastrophic wildfire risk.  I work closely with wildland firefighters,  prescribed burn, and cultural fire practitioners,  and the evidence is clear.  So I urge you to stop the Valley's Edge development  and don't expose all of us to unnecessary risk,  trauma, environmental devastation, and death.  Thank you.  Steve Deppa, followed by Dennis Eichholz.  I didn't get it until I heard these speakers.  And one thing that ironically is the first thing Addison brought up  is what is this going to cost for a special election?  If they had put that on the ballot or on the referendum item  and said it's going to cost $250,000 to do this,  would they have signed it?  And, you know, here's somebody that's trying to put something off  into the field.  I think it's a future that's been 14 years in the making.  And I find that ironic.  But what I really find ironic is,  I think it was the third or fourth speaker,  I'm sorry, I don't remember her name.  She said there were 280 different individuals  that collected signatures.  They were from Butte Creek and they couldn't vote.  They have theirs.  They have their plot of land.  They have their space.  They don't want you to have it.  They don't want my kids to have it.  They're from Forest Range.  They've got their land.  They've got their five acres.  They've got their estate-sized lots.  And they bought them a long time ago when they were cheap.  They've got theirs.  They don't want other people to have theirs.  They're from, what did they say?  They said Forest Ranch.  They said Butte Creek.  They said Paradise.  They have their land.  They have their space.  They don't want you to have it.  I am appalled at hearing that these people  that can't vote,  told stories.  And I thought I was crazy  because every time I talked to one of these signature gatherers  and I found out they were from outside the city limits,  I was, I don't understand.  You've got yours  and you don't want other people to have it.  So I'm just flummoxed.  I think it's fraudulent.  I think it's wrong.  And this is the best development  I've seen come down the pipe  in the North State.  And I just pray  that you keep this going.  And I believe  the people will want this.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Dennis Eichholz, followed by Marty Dunlap.  Hi, thanks for listening.  I moved to Chico 46 years ago.  Grew up in San Diego,  a wonderful place to live  until unrestrained growth  just negatively impacted everything there.  Everything.  Valley's Edge is sprawled.  It's in a beautiful natural area.  I loved to bicycle through there.  It doesn't address  the affordable housing crisis we have.  I urge you to reject that project.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Marty Dunlap, followed by Jessica Giannola.  Hi, I don't really have anything I want to say  because we already have had this discussion  and we have brought it forward  to be decided by the city of Chico residents.  But my husband has been making this comment  to me over and over.  And I'll go ahead and make his comment,  which is it seems in reflection  that the people who are in support of Valley's Edge  stand to make money off of it.  And so that does seem to have an element  that needs to be in the mix.  In terms of what happens next,  I think rescinding the vote is probably a good idea.  Trying to put it onto the election and the primary  and getting that information.  It seems like that would be very important  to know before a decision is made.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Jessica Giannola, followed by Jared Geiser.  Hi, Council.  I've talked a lot about Valley's Edge,  primarily because I live right across from it.  And real impacts, I'm going to fill in for sure.  So I'm going to be this loud voice that keeps coming here  and trying to share that information with you.  I feel like this is a really important time  to talk about Valley's Edge.  It's not about the real risks involved,  but the story that the development will be for anyone  other than a handful of Chico residents.  It's really not going to be for our working class.  It just can't be by pure numbers.  My children can't grow up and live there.  It's not a matter of not working hard.  It's just simply how much it's going to cost  and how much it's going to cost their children too  in the future and environmental impacts hitting them  that cannot be mitigated.  As far as us building, we need to build smartly.  The fire risk, we talked about all that.  So when we talk about all of our neighbors being impacted  and how dangerous it could be and how it's not going  to provide housing that we need, it is not going to.  So really what it comes down to is how are you going  to move from here?  Are you going to spend more of our money  in having a special election?  Or are you going to listen to the voices of the people  who signed their names and said,  we do not want this particular development to go ahead as is  and rescind it?  Or if you don't want to rescind it and you want to listen  to a larger number of Chico residents,  put it on the normal ballot.  Then we can vote for it.  Then the people have spoken.  But until then, it's just you speaking  and that's why the referendum came out.  The people spoke against it.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Jared Geiser followed by Emily Einspar.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Good evening, Council.  Good evening, staff.  So as we all have heard, the people have spoken.  And they don't want this irresponsible,  sperm and sprawl development in our community.  The people saw through the greenwashing  that attempted to portray 750 acres or more of habitat  destruction as environmentally friendly.  The greenwashing that tried to portray  a significant and unavoidable greenhouse gas emissions,  threatening our climate, threatening our whole society,  threatening our whole Earth as environmentally friendly.  People saw through that.  People signed the referendum.  People volunteered for the referendum.  People donated money to the referendum.  The people don't like this development.  The people need development that acknowledges  the issues of the 21st century.  We can't keep doing this suburban sprawl.  We need to do smart growth.  We need to do infill development.  And it's so interesting when I hear everyone say that we  need to grow here.  We can't grow north, south, east, or west.  And I'm perplexed because no one must  have read the general plan that identifies, I believe, 14 sites.  I don't know.  But it does say that 16 sites are  the highest profit margin.  So I asked that you rescind your vote.  The people have spoken.  10% of all registered voters signed this.  That's confirmed signatures.  That's substantial.  So I asked that you rescind your vote or at least  put it to vote at the November election.  And in my last 30 seconds, I'll tell a brief story.  I remember at the plant commission hearing when they were discussing the significant and unavoidable greenhouse gas emissions that this project would have.  Chairman Scott asked, Chairwoman Scott asked the consultants, is there any development in Chico that would produce 2,700 units without significant and unavoidable greenhouse gas emissions?  And the consultant responded, yes.  If they could build it where they can take transit, where they can actually walk, where they can actually bike to meet their needs,  then they could be below the significant threshold for greenhouse gas emissions.  So there are other options, and people have spoken.  That's fine.  Emily Einspar, followed by Genesis Ospana.  Hi.  I'm here asking the council to rescind their approval of the Valley's Edge development.  So I grew up in San Diego, similar to him, and I moved here seven years ago to escape the mass gentrification that was happening to my small little surf town.  This made it super inaccessible for me or anyone my age.  I moved up here appreciating the nature that we all have in our backyard and the affordable housing that made it, in my early 20s, a safe space for me to live here.  We've already said this.  Everyone spoke.  Around 10% of registered voters in Chico signed the petition.  We far exceeded our signature goal, and this just goes to show how and who cares about Valley's Edge being a community decision and not just one that was being chosen under our noses.  As far as reasoning goes, I don't need to remind you.  I don't need to remind you all that the land that the development is being built on is a burn scar area.  It's burned three times in the last 19 years.  And, you know, we will be fighting this, no matter what the decision is.  We have been fighting it.  The Valley's Edge referendum and the success of that shows it.  It shows we don't need more urban sprawls.  We need affordable housing.  We need a walkable downtown.  We need access to affordable food.  We need a change, a shift.  Less McMansions and more safe, affordable homes for everyone.  The decision is in your hands.  We're all here asking.  Will you listen?  Thank you.  Genesis followed by Eric Chisler.  The last time the council voted on Valley's Edge, she did so without the majority of the public even knowing about it.  But don't worry.  We've done the work.  We've informed the people, and we gathered their signatures.  And we all agree that it is a terrible plan.  We are here today.  Today, you have an opportunity to listen.  Listen to those people and do what is best for them and not the pockets of the developer.  Please consider repealing your vote, your approval of Valley's Edge.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Eric Chisler followed by Lyle Hayden.  Good evening, council.  I had a prepared statement and really Jared Geiser spoke to just about everything that needs to be said logistically and politically.  So I just want to take a moment to say this is a 30-day vote.  This is a 30-year plan.  And the people who will be inheriting this city 30 years from now, they're right there.  So maybe take into consideration the people who are going to be inheriting your ideas and not just whether or not the ideas are good for you and yours.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Lyle Hayden followed by Kimberly Michael.  Hello.  I grew up here.  I went to college.  I went to Chico State.  I work here now.  I've been working for six years.  And I can't afford to buy a home here.  And I can't afford to buy a home at Valley's Edge.  Build high density.  Build infill.  Please.  Kimberly Michael followed by Bill Broward.  Good evening, council.  I'm going to keep this short.  I think everybody before me kind of said it best.  We don't want Valley's Edge.  Yeah.  To say that we have other affordable housing projects in the queue is pretty rude to all the people that need housing.  But I'm not here to discuss the merits of the project.  People already signed.  And like everyone said, they spoke.  We got 16,000 signatures we turned in.  And over 6,000 verified signatures on each petition.  So I would urge you to rescind your vote.  Thank you.  And if you're not going to do that, at least don't have a special election.  If you spend almost $300,000 on a special election for the project to still get shot down, that would probably be pretty embarrassing.  So.  Thank you.  Bill Broward followed by Julian Zenner.  Good evening, council members.  Valley's Edge specific plan represents the input of thousands of people over the last 14 years to create a home.  And we're going to be working with the city council to create a homegrown plan that meet Chico's housing, long-term housing and community needs.  Long-term plan to create the places that we live, work and play.  City council faces a very difficult choice.  Rescinding your approval marginalizes Chico's long-term housing affordability.  Make no mistake.  You cannot eliminate Chico's largest special planning area and claim that housing in Chico will be more affordable.  Rescinding your approval eliminates protection of thousands of oak trees, over 700 acres of open space, jobs, economic development and a landowner's ability to give something back to the community.  Putting the ballot, on the other hand, eats up public dollars that could be used for potholes and for public safety.  I'm not going to refute the opposition's decision.  I'm going to refute the opposition's continual statements about lack of affordability and about the other information or disinformation that is out there.  Home pricing, you know, this is a land plan.  It's a master plan.  It doesn't dictate housing prices.  And the idea that you can look at comps at $450,000 for a single-family home and then decide that Valley's Edge is going to cost $800,000 to build a single-family home.  That's not going to be a good idea.  That's nonsense.  There's a rock wall.  You've got market rate housing that's being built for under $500,000.  You've got Valley's Edge on the other side.  Half of which is workforce housing.  One thing's certain, the more people understand the plan, the more they support the plan.  I hope Council takes its time and considers this very, very significant decision.  I wish you the best of luck.  Thank you.  Julian Zenner followed by Shelby Herbert.  Thank you.  Let's hear what the great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great  extending outwards.  And I'd like to push back against all this open space  that Mr. Broward has mentioned.  There is open space.  It's cut up in strips.  But the vast majority of that is not available to Chico citizens.  It's available to the homeowners.  And so that's a misrepresentation.  As far as the expense of building houses,  it's much more expensive to build a house  where you have to break up the lava cap  and break up the lava cap to bring in utilities  than it is to build in the flat valley on the alluvium.  So I want to...  I want to support those who say,  let's don't spend more money.  I urge the council to listen to the citizenry here  that is before you tonight.  Thank you.  Thank you.  And actually, Mr. Zinner is our last speaker.  All right.  Council discussion.  Council Member Lindley.  If we were to resign the resolutions,  in effect denying the project,  then the general plan still says  that there is a housing commercial project  with a broad range of housing types on that site.  I'm not sure who's best to answer this,  Mr. Ewing or Mr. Sorensen or Mr. Vig.  How different would a project have to be  in order for a new plan to be submitted  and not be subject to a referendum?  Thank you.  Any project that came forward  could be subject to a referendum.  I think he's asking,  how much can it be changed to be a different project?  The general plan kind of speaks for itself.  It gives an outline of what's expected,  range of densities, range of land use types,  range of uses, things to acknowledge,  the open space in this area,  the old historic walls and things  like that.  So, again, I guess a project  that is generally consistent with that policy framework.  Again, that's made through findings  that go to the Planning Commission  and ultimately to the City Council,  like this project did.  Mr. Winslet, maybe I can re-answer your question  in a different way, if you don't mind.  Mr. Ewing, if this project was to come back  and 5% of it was different,  would it be applicable to the rescinded vote?  Or would it have to,  or would a new referendum have to take place  if just a few things were changed?  I don't know.  I would have to get back to you  with the answer to that question.  I don't know at this point.  All right.  Go ahead, Mr. Winslet.  It's a similar question.  Maybe the answer is the same.  Would there be any different in effect  for the Council to resign the approval now  versus it losing in an election?  Or would it be the exact same action being taken  to be in the same place either way?  What was the question?  So if we were to resign the resolutions now,  or if we were to set an election date  and the project were to be denied in an election,  would the effect be exactly the same  as far as the prospects for future applications  on that land?  Well, according to the election code,  once a referendum, let's say it's rescinded,  it's only good for a year.  The developer can,  it's resubmitted in one year from that.  If the Council resends their actions,  then that action would be stayed for a year  and the developer can come back in a year.  So I think that the answer to that would probably be yes.  But if the City Attorney needs to weigh in,  I'm happy to let him have the mic.  I share Madam Clerk's response.  I would simply add the difference, of course,  would be financial.  You know, you have the special election,  which costs money,  and then you would not have a special election.  Yeah, time and finances, yeah.  One further question.  This is a little into the weeds.  I'm not sure that just the City of Chico  would have the answer here,  but what prospects is there for development  to occur on the land under,  without annexation by the City?  Or are there any other options?  Say this project gets shot down,  what other alternatives are available  besides, as people have mentioned,  conservation of the land?  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  So, sir, you're saying if, in fact,  the referendum moves forward,  what would happen with the land?  I suppose if it were removed as a City of Chico  special planning area,  what would be the fate of that land?  What uses would be available to it?  Basically, my question is,  could it be developed under county standards  with even larger lots and fewer housing units?  I guess conceivably it is in the county's general plan  as a special planning area.  I think some of the assumptions mirror some of the,  assumptions in the city's general plan.  I think there would be difficulty,  again, maybe we're getting off track here,  but developing in the county,  given the need to have sewer services like sewer  and things like that.  So, but I guess, yeah,  it could develop at lower densities.  Conceivably.  The county's densities are generally lower.  What you're suggesting is currently it's in the city sphere.  It's not within our city limits.  So I just want to be, are you through?  Excuse me.  Yes.  Okay.  Thank you.  So if this project was,  if the council decided to rescind it,  it would only be valid for one year,  12 months from whatever the date of that decision  has been made, correct?  And then after that one year,  the game plan could be reintroduced  in its existing form,  or,  or perhaps a modified form and move forward from there.  So this is just a one year  situation, correct?  That is correct.  Number so not clear on the modification question.  We brought back next month.  So it could come back exactly the same in one year.  Yeah.  Would it have to go back through?  I'm just thinking,  would it have to go back through the,  the planning commission?  Would it have to start from,  here's the question.  Would it have to start,  and this might be Brendan's area of expertise,  I suspect.  Would it have to start from,  from just the very beginning?  Or would it be fast forwarded  because it's already been through the process  with the city of Chico?  I mean,  what would be the starting point  if in a year,  it came back to the city of Chico?  Would it,  where would that starting point be?  I think Mr. Ewing said,  well, it depends.  Again, if they made some minor modifications to the project,  you know, there's a lot of effort that's gone  into getting this doc, this project plated up  through the planning commission and to the city council.  So it wouldn't be like starting from ground zero.  But if there was some minor modifications  to the project description,  there would be a requirement to do an addendum or?  Yeah.  Refly the environmental impact report with those changes.  A lot of the resolution staff reports,  a lot of the effort findings have been prepared.  So, but the fact that it's been rescinded would mean we'd have  to go back to the planning commission,  do all the proper noticing, go through all the process,  but not create all the paperwork again.  There may be some things that need to be tightened  up in the environmental document based on changes  in state law, things like that.  But I would imagine it would,  not take the same time and duration it took initially  to get to the planning commission and city council.  Okay. So it could come back in exactly the same format,  in exactly the same development in a year.  And all of the approvals that were secured previously,  such as the environmental impact report,  would still be valid or does it expire too?  Well, my point is it would be, we would,  put it in the planning commission,  put it out again for public availability, public comment,  and respond to I would imagine a lot of the very similar comments  that we've received on this .  Okay.  So we'd go back through the process,  but we wouldn't be starting with nothing.  Thank you.  And that would be entirely up to the developer, correct?  Correct.  Obviously we can't dictate that whether they spend it or not.  If it was exactly the same project,  that would be up to the developer.  It would be up to them.  Do we have any further questions or discussion?  I have two.  Council Member Morgan.  One, Master Chief, City Clerk.  I want to make sure I heard you right.  Special election roughly 2.2, 220,000?  270.  270?  Yeah, 266.  General municipal, 100?  If it goes to the municipal and it's our election anyway,  it would be $100,000 minimum.  And that could go up to the municipal.  It could go up based on cost at that time.  You're not sure on the primary?  I am not sure on the primary.  Okay. Here's what I'd like to see happen.  Getting back to Council Member Bennett's question  and Mr. Veek's answer, in one year,  the applicant can bring it back exactly the same.  We understand that.  Maybe it goes faster, maybe it doesn't.  To Mr. Ewing's point, how much time is left?  How much change would be necessary for them  to bring back a different plan?  I'd like to see staff come back at the next council meeting  answering that question.  How much change would need to be considered  for this to be considered a different plan altogether?  Is it 5%?  Is it 10%?  I'm sure Mr. Ewing can figure that out.  And at the same time, I would like the clerk's office  to see if they can get some ballpark estimate  of what the March primary would be.  And then we can make our decision at that point.  That would be a motion.  Motion, I'll second that.  Thank you.  A second for a motion from my Council Member Morgan,  a second by Council Member Tandon.  Question or discussion?  It's just, you know, we definitely need more information  and I think bringing that information back  at the next meeting would be very helpful  to make the decision.  Okay.  I concur with that.  Before we call the question.  I did have an additional question for you.  So it's what percentage of the voters signed the,  it's actually a question for the,  so the community can just understand.  So what percentage of the voter signatures did they have?  Well, if you look at the, in the staff report,  the County said that it was 10% of the registered voters.  And it was actually a little over that because, let's see.  Is that 10%?  10% would have been 5,700 and they, 6,300.  And then there was, the other one was 6,400.  to push to an election just because I want to see,  you know, obviously 10% is a substantial number,  but I'm sure with enough effort,  everybody can find 10% on particular issues,  but I'd love to see the entire electorate weigh in.  It's 10% of the registered voters,  not turnout in any particular election.  No, no, I understand that.  But I'm saying, you know, a lot of people were representing us, the entire community,  and I think it's a portion of the community.  I'd like to see what, you know, I think the idea behind signing the referendum was to take it to a vote  to see what the entire community thinks.  So, okay, you can call the question.  I will call the question.  Okay.  So it was a motion by Council Member Morgan, seconded by Council Member Tandon,  to direct staff to come back.  To answer how much of a change is needed for it to be considered a new project  and for the city clerk to work with the county to determine cost on the March,  inclusion in the March primary.  Is that it?  Council Member Bennett.  Yes.  Council Member Morgan.  Yes.  Council Member Tandon.  Yes.  Council Member Van Overbeek is disqualified.  Council Member Winslow.  Yes.  And Vice Mayor Reynolds is absent.  Mayor Coolidge.  Aye.  Okay.  So it carries five.  Okay.  With one absence and one recusal.  All right.  Thank you very much.  And with that, we're going to break into break and then break into closed session and be back in about.  Mayor Coolidge, could you make another announcement?  We're still getting cards for 5.4.  Never mind.  You can't.  Also, folks, so you know, item 5.4 is not.  On the agenda, it was tabled. It was tabled. [inaudible]  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay. Thank you. [inaudible]  Okay.  Okay.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Good evening, Mayor, Vice Mayor, Council members, and City of Chico community members.  Thank you for attending tonight.  I'm here to present the Chico Police Department's first annual military equipment use report.  and request your continued approval of all equipment listed within said report.  Assembly Bill 481 requires the Military Use Report be released annually  and a community engagement event to follow within 30 days of the release.  We have scheduled the event for April 27th here in this Council Chamber at 6 p.m.  I invite you and the community to attend as it will be informative.  Within the annual report, the Chico Police Department utilized the following equipment  throughout the timeline of April 18th, 2022 through March 29th of 2023.  106 drone deployments, 8 armored vehicle deployments,  2 long-range acoustic devices, otherwise known as LRAD deployments,  2 37 or 40 millimeter launcher deployments,  2 beanbag less lethal deployments,  0 rifle deployments,  0 distractions,  or diversionary device deployments,  0 chemical agent deployments,  0 explosive breaching tool deployment,  2 paperball projectile deployments,  and thankfully we had 0 officer-involved shootings.  Of note, use of the less lethal and chemical agents upon a community member  was roughly one-tenth of a percent, or 5 out of over 50%,  and over 7,800 were  audit was conducted of all equipment to ensure accountability, readiness, and community complaints  and concerns. 100% of the equipment was inventoried and in compliance with zero unauthorized uses  located. Zero complaints and nine community concerns were received regarding the use or  uses of this equipment. As part of the report, you also see the fiscal impact of the equipment  purchasing, storage, maintenance, upgrades, and other ongoing costs was found to be $72,725  or roughly 0.23% of our overall budget. Training costs associated to this equipment  was attributed to sending officers to outside vendors at the cost of $4,310  or roughly 0.01% of the overall budget. Moving into the next annual  monthly report, we will be looking at the cost of equipment purchase, storage, maintenance, upgrades, and other ongoing costs.  Military equipment use cycle, the Chico Police Department is requesting to add the following  additional equipment, which will continue to help in the de-escalation efforts we train and employ every day.  If you have the report in front of you, if not, I'd like to pull these up  just to show you what we're requesting so you have an idea of what it is.  We're going to go to the annual report. We'll go to the bottom just about  sorry, it's a very long report. That took me two weeks to complete.  Okay, new requests.  With the success of the drone unit that we have had in place now for a little over a year,  we've found that new technology is out there that would assist us  in a much more capable drone system that we use indoors.  Right here we have the Avada ProView unmanned aerial system.  We're requesting to purchase two of those at the rate of $3,200 for the total initial cost.  That's all equipment and supplies that come with those, and those will be added to the fleet.  Two drones, two of the smaller drones we currently have, the DJI minis,  DJI minis, we'll be using those as training drones and replacing those with these in the fleet  for deployment in the field.  The next thing I'd like to add is two combined systems chemical agent launching cups with associated  baffled chemical agents.  We have a new technology called the chemical agent smoke, which attached to the current less lethal  shotguns we currently have and create a safer deployment.  And so to explain what this is, so there's new technology out there when it comes to deploying  chemical agents instead of tossing them and not knowing where they go, you can tactically place them  with this equipment and know exactly where they're going.  So for me it's a much safer mechanism that lets us continue to utilize that equipment.  And so I think that's a great point.  But does it in a manner that we can control it much more?  We'd like to purchase two of those at a total of $650.  And what goes with them is a baffled canister like this.  So it's placed within the cup itself and then you control where it's launched.  So Chief, are you saying that this is just a control?  I mean, you shot through a shotgun, but that's more accurate than what you used before?  Yes.  The Chico Police Department is returning all rifles acquired within the federal 1033 equipment  acquisition program and need to be replaced with 22 new rifles, which will then be owned by the City of Chico.  Of note, this is the last of true military equipment that was acquired through the Chico Police Department.  So we'll get through that 1033 program and will get us completely out of true military gear acquired from the Defense Reutilization Materials Office.  The cost of the additional equipment is estimated to be approximately $59,350.  The Chico Police Department is requesting to test and evaluate the following equipment with the potential to add.  So this is not a request to purchase right now, it's just a request to test it and evaluate it.  It's new technology that's out there.  It's called the non-explosive kinetic breaching tool.  And there's a picture here.  So instead of using explosive type material to gain entry into locked doors, this piece of equipment utilizes essentially a  a  a !  spring load type system that shoots a wedge out of here just enough to where it knocks the locking mechanism off doors.  It's much safer.  It's, like I said, it's a non-explosive device.  It's controlled by one person.  You know exactly where that's going when you utilize it.  And the best thing I like about it is it's non-explosive.  Two remotely controlled robots which will assist the SWAT team with communications, entry of facilities, and controlled and safe chemical deployments.  So the new technology that's out there now for robots has just been amazing.  Just like the drones, we're seeing technology improve so much that it's equipment that actually helps us do things much safer for not only the community but for ourselves.  And reduces the risk of death.  And reduces the risk of people getting injured.  With these robots, we're requesting two of them.  They have different deployment reasons for them.  One, if you look on the top here, has a camera system on it.  It can climb stairways.  It has the ability to deliver smoke or chemical agent here through this canister system on the top.  It would have been tremendous for us in the Amanda wave.  We had a stairway incident with the active shooter because he was on the second floor.  And had we had to make entry into that place, our SWAT officers would have had to actually walk up the stairway to the doorway.  This robot would have been able to climb the stairway, get to the door.  If we had the second one, this is a breaching robot.  It uses hydraulics instead of explosives.  So it goes up to the door.  It uses a spreader system that it has on it.  Essentially spreads the door jam and pushes the door open.  These two work in tandem.  And we would like to test and evaluate them for a future addition if we think it's a plausible addition.  The next thing is there's new flash diversion technology out there.  Again, just like with that launching cup, these new flash bangs they're known as are much more controlled.  They have been developed.  They have been tested multiple times over and over to try and have them start fires.  Whereas the traditional flash bangs, that's the problem is they get so hot and you don't know where that thing is going to roll or land every time.  And during the burn cycle of it, it could start a fire and has in law enforcement history.  These here use a technology.  It looks almost like a cigarette lighter, a little bit larger than that.  It's a little bit bigger than that.  The technology in it now is this thing goes in, it's remotely controlled.  The flash diversion is more of a light system that comes out of it with a sound and it occurs above the device.  So it doesn't actually occur on the ground or floor in this situation.  The cost of this additional equipment purchased after test and evaluation is estimated to be approximately $115,000.  The most expensive is obviously the two robots.  And again, this is just a request to test and evaluate this equipment.  With that, I conclude my request for your approval for the City of Chico Ordinance 2576 and Chico Police Policy 709, Military Equipment Use.  And I'm going to pull back up here to the ordinance that you would be approving.  Along with the policy that I have attached with this also.  With that, I'm happy to answer any questions you have.  Any questions?  Chief, can you give us an example of an armored car deployment?  Sure.  We used it on the Amanda Way incident where we had the active shooter shooting into people's residences.  That vehicle is solely used for armored rescue situations to move people from place to place where they're safe.  We used it there to move our SWAT team in place to be able to remove people from residences, put them within that vehicle or beside that vehicle and move it so that any kind of firearms that were fired toward that direction would not be able to reach our citizens.  So without that vehicle, your officers and citizens would have been exposed to gunfire?  That would have been absolutely the case.  And, you know, in history, we've used patrol cars to do that same thing.  You know that firing at a vehicle is, you know, it's essentially 10 cans when you fire at a vehicle nowadays.  If you get lucky, you hit the engine block.  But this armored rescue vehicle...  I've never done that, but I'll take your word for it.  The armored rescue vehicle is certainly a piece of equipment that helps keep both the community and the officer safe when it comes to these situations.  And typically, that's what it's used for.  Mr. Whitesell.  Yes, sir.  So the ordinance that we have says that the military equipment identified in this policy is reasonably cost effective compared to available alternatives.  And a lot of the things you've shown, it looks like rapidly developing technology, so we know that things...  There's going to be new ones out soon.  We could be testing out some robots, and then now there is a new advanced robot that we could also say is necessary for the safety of officers and civilians.  I wonder if there's any...  Have you estimated different alternatives?  I think there are alternatives of having less of some of these things or waiting on some, knowing that we have...  Our drone program is relatively new.  We've gone through iterations of drones as new ones have come out with different benefits.  If we just wait a little bit until the technology develops further and sort of at least stagger some of these things so that we're not putting the full cost into new robots and drones and then finding that they're obsolete because of new technology.  Yeah, that's a good point.  We're always looking at technology upgrades.  You know, what can...  What can we get that makes it more efficient for us in the field, makes it acceptable for taxpayers in terms of upgrades?  So, you know, we're always finding ways to, you know, meet that need.  One of the things we recently did was we got rid of shotguns, took all the shotguns out of the patrol cars and converted them to less lethal shotguns, so beanbag rounds.  I thought that was a great use of our budget in terms of the upgrade to those that are not being used.  We kept using the same platform that we've been using for years, a Remington 870 shotgun.  The only thing we did was change out some grips, a stock, you know, put orange stocks on them.  You can look at the pictures in here.  But it's...  It was technology we already had and we just used simple upgrades that were cost effective in keeping that technology in place and not having to spend a lot of money.  So we're always looking for ways to...  to save money.  If we see something that is coming out, we want to test and evaluate it first and kind of see is that something we want to spend taxpayer dollars on.  And for me, that's important.  I want to be fiscally responsible with that.  And so we're not just going to go out and spend $100,000 on a robot without first making sure that, number one, is it what we need?  Does it make the community safer?  Does it make the officers safer?  And does there seem to be more technology in behind it that's better than this?  So we always take the time to go through that process.  So some of the new technology is making other things obsolete.  Are there proposals within this, like update of our military use policy to take out some kinds of military equipment and replace them with other things?  We actually see a lessening of equipment.  Yeah.  So, you know, like that flashbang technology is changing.  I want to get rid of the hotter burning flashbangs.  Go to the safety.  I think we need to move to a safer technology in that area.  You know, if you've read the report, you see that we're removing a ton of rifles from our inventory.  Those are ‑‑ a lot of those are rifles that were, like I said, attained through the 1033 program.  I want to get out of that business.  I want the city to own their own equipment so that we're not linked to that program and we're not at the requirements for the inspection process and inventory process of all that comes with that.  So we are removing them.  moving things slowly  that we can upgrade and make  sure that the city owns them versus others  and we're also making sure that if it's something we  can upgrade that  maybe two or three items take  the place of 10 or 12 in some cases.  So always looking for ways to do that.  This is our first year through this process  so for me it was important to  make sure that as we  look back on everything that the  council approved for our use  we said okay has anything  changed with this that we can upgrade  so that we can remove this item  get something safer  or just get rid of it  altogether and the items that  I showed you are helping us in terms of  looking at what it is we can expand  that ability with.  Thank you. Final question.  Since this is a new  bill, this is a new ordinance we have looking at  this in the future are you tracking use of some  of these things and do you anticipate that if some of these  things aren't used that we'll get rid of stuff that  is not we're finding to be not  necessary?  That's a challenging question  because you know just because we don't  use something doesn't mean we don't need it.  Right? If we don't  use it, great. That means that we've  reduced the ability or  we've reduced crimes  to the point where we don't have to use that material  or equipment within the community  but you always want to have  what you need to  handle incidents that pop up in the city so  I don't want to catch us off guard where it's  like if we would have had X,  piece of equipment instead of getting rid of it  because they didn't use it last year. Now we  need it and now instead of having  say something that could have de-escalated an  incident, we have to go to the next level.  Right? So you want to prepare  for all those scenarios  as best as you can and just because you don't  use something doesn't mean it's not something you should  keep. So that's a dangerous  question.  Thanks.  All right.  Public comment.  Yes, we have 11 speakers.  I have three minutes.  Okay. Again, I'll call the  first two names if you could line up in the  middle corridor.  Ann Polifka  followed by Diane Suzuki.  Good evening,  counselors, police chief,  everybody.  I'm here tonight  to request the council  waits to do the final vote  on whether to  approve the military equipment  use policy.  The report until after input from the  community engagement meeting was as chief as  happening on April  27th right here.  California law  481 decrees that the governing body  which is this council  only approve a law enforcement  military equipment use policy if it's  determined that the military equipment  is number one,  necessary.  Number two, safeguards the public  welfare, safety, rights, liberties.  Number three is cost effective.  So one of my questions is, and I have many,  but exactly how necessary is the equipment  when according to the report,  the vast majority of the military gear,  except for the drones, which were used over 100 times,  according to the report, was not used.  It's not even used over the last 12 months.  Chico PD is now requesting approval  from the council for several new acquisitions  of military equipment,  kinetic breaching tool,  and two robots, each at the cost of $100,000  for their evaluation after testing,  equipped with chemical agent deployment capacity,  which is weaponizing basically these robots.  Is this what we really want for Chico?  Do we want weaponizing?  Do we want to have these robots in the police hands?  Would you just take Chico PD's word for it  that these are necessary?  When worst case scenario rationales  are put out by Chico PD,  I can't help but remember that the last time  a Chico police officer was killed,  actually in the line of duty, was 1938.  Council, before you approve the military equipment  use policy report,  you must also remember that the Chico PD's  report is not a report of the military equipment.  It is also determined that the listed military equipment  safeguards the public welfare,  public rights, public liberties, public safety.  AB 48, another 2021 California law,  severely restricts the use of chemical agents  like tear gas and impact projectiles,  like rubber bullets for crowd control  in first amendment assemblies.  AB 48 restrictions are incorporated into certain sections of the military equipment policy, but not all of them.  It's not been consistent.  It's not been spelled out for clarity  in terms of restrictions on use.  This results in potentially risky ambiguity.  How's an officer to know which policy to follow  if the policies conflict?  The policies conflict,  you can't really do good training to the policy.  Additionally, in the policy and report,  there's inadequate delineation of-  That's time, thank you.  Okay, thank you.  Diane Suzuki followed by Nicole Nova.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Good evening.  Military's policing in this country  has become embedded in the mindset,  the budgets and the institutional priorities of law enforcement.  It's built on the practices of war.  I don't take it lightly that policing is going more and more  in this direction nationally.  Because this year's annual report was just completed on Thursday,  and you and the community have had less than a week to study it,  I request that you make your final vote on improving this annual review report on the policy in compliance with AB 481 after the community engagement meeting on April 27th.  Chief Aldrich, I want to acknowledge the time you took to make the changes in the military equipment policy from last year, but I still have some concerns.  I urge you, the council, as elected officials, to ask yourself the hard questions about the fiscal and public safety impacts of this policy, including the training, use, storage, and maintenance of the equipment.  I'm concerned about the public safety and possible civil rights violations to our community.  Will officers be properly trained in the use of the equipment?  The training, including any course required by post, commission a police officer.  Standards and training must be completed before it's used.  Under 709.6, it reads that kinetic energy projectiles and chemical agents can be used for crowd control after de-escalation techniques have failed.  Even so, this could easily hurt innocent people in a crowd, and training must be extensive.  In general, would it make more fiscal sense to not use the budget for the upkeep and training of these obsolete,  cast-off surplus equipment in the Chico PD's possession and divert them towards more de-escalation training and prevention of the need to escalate to military equipment use?  And I understand you're trying to upgrade the equipment, but I believe that good policing techniques shouldn't have to resort to using military equipment.  AB 48 limits police use of tear gas and rubber bullets.  Will use of equipment be authorized when children or other vulnerable populations are present?  We need clear guidelines on what circumstances they will be used and by whom.  And please again, postpone your vote until after the community engagement meeting.  Thank you.  Thank you, Nicole Nava, followed by Blake Ellis.  Good evening.  Chief Aldridge, thank you so much for the men and women who serve and keep us all safe here.  And to our city manager, thank you for placing faith in Chief Aldridge to do the job.  I like to bring factual information and look historically at what's happened.  And I just want to point out very first that there's always talk about, you know, concern about use of force.  And people bring out the names of people who've lost their lives.  And I think this is something that we need to recognize historically and the same names keep being brought up.  And those are all justified use of force that was historic.  Out of 53,000 contacts, 72 involved use of force.  Of that number again, zero were unjustified.  I, for one, am a parent and I'm a concerned community member.  And so when I heard this, I was like, oh, this is so sad.  things like there is a person who is accused of murdering his girlfriend and is up with a minor  in Upper Park, and they deploy drones to be able to keep those officers and first responders in  this community safe by making sure those people are alone, what is with them, how can we get the  minor separated and safe, is de-escalation techniques. We have a fantastic police force  that is very well trained. They do train in de-escalation. They spend many, many hours.  Our police department didn't just have the officers trained. They literally had the entire  department trained. These are people who get maligned over and over, and I would posit to you  that out of our entire nation, we have a fantastic police force that we should be very proud of,  that they are keeping these numbers so low. That is one-tenth of one percent  of the police force that we have trained.  Where we have use of force at all. At all. I mean, that is fantastic. And let's talk about  the drugs that are here. This is not the old world that some of you are speaking of and  like thinking that, oh, what about this? What about that? What about all these domestic violence  incidences that have been happening, where if we had one of those things where you put in and you  get to the door and they could get to the baby and the mom recently that they have an issue,  by the grace of God, we would have been able to get them out of there.  By the grace of God, they were okay. One of these days, they may not be okay. I'd rather err on the  side of trusting these very well-trained people to save people in domestic violence situations,  which are very chaotic. They are, again, trained in de-escalation. There's also been numerous  violent incidences at grocery stores lately with thieves laying out employees and other shoppers.  Let's get real. This is today is a different world.  We have very dangerous drugs and I want our police department to have the tools to do it.  Thank you.  Thank you, Blake Ellis, followed by Alicia Triter.  First, I'd like to address three logistical concerns. One, are all of the true costs of  military equipment actually accounted for? Transportation, storage, maintenance,  testing, evaluation, and what the two weeks it took to develop these reports,  and of course the opportunity cost of services to and for the community. In regard to the community  engagement, we have a lot of questions about the cost of military equipment. We have a lot of questions  about the cost of military equipment. We have a lot of questions about the cost of military equipment.  First, I want to address the need for public trust and community partnerships. If you really want to  ensure transparency, public trust, and community partnerships, there should be more concerted effort  to advertise the need and conduct better outreach. Simply posting the meeting on Chico PD website is  not a good faith effort. Simply put, do better. Will use of military equipment be authorized during  First Amendment assemblies? There is at least one item in Policy 709 that specifies authorized use as  in the following type of situations but are not limited to these situations. This has the effect  of authorizing any and all uses. Second, I'd like to speak to you as a concerned citizen.  Further militarization of our police department deteriorates my perception and trust of our local  law enforcement even more. It makes me fear for my own personal safety, and that's speaking to you as  a middle-class, able-minded, and bodied white woman. I'm terrified for black and brown, unhoused,  and mentally ill community members. This will lead to an increase in community fear and will further  erode public opinion towards police. Thirdly, I'd like to speak to you as a professional social worker  and mental health provider. Passing any proposals that promote the increase of police militarization  is anti-escalation.  The police department is a highly-demanded force that is not only a source of evidence and contrary  to the wide range of criminological, sociological, and legal research and scholarship. Increasing  military equipment significantly increases lethal force. A 2019 study of departments in all 50 states  found a significant association between the accumulation of gear and increased counts of lethal  police force. Despite claims by some police that military equipment is a de-escalation tool, they  provide no detectable benefits in terms of officer safety or violent crime reduction. Several studies  show that the acquisition of military-grade equipment has not reduced crime or attacks on officers and  officers while it does contribute to substantial community fear and harms police reputation. The Center for  Police Inequity found that black people were subjected to force four times as often as white people. Chico PD  eats up half of our entire city's budget but cannot provide the type of solutions we need in order to  keep our communities safe. We've experienced an increased cost of living, three catastrophic wildfires,  high levels of mental illness and substance abuse disorder, and the police cannot fix any of these problems  for us or protect them from us. And a police officer with a military-grade rifle can't protect us any better.  They're simply smarter and more cost-effective and evidence-based way to reduce crime. One of the  best ways to reduce crime is to provide more resources and support in the low-income communities.  And finally, to permit the use of, I'll just skip stuff, well, Austin spent, used to spend a lot of money on  police and in jailing the unhoused, paying for emergency rooms and 911 calls, and now has reinvested those  dollars in services. To permit this use, the City Council must approve an ordinance only if they  determine that this is necessary and there's no reasonable alternative. So, I'm going to stop there.  Okay great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great  great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great  great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great  great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great  great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great  great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great  great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great  great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great  great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great  who couldn't be here tonight because this is bedtime for most of our families with young  children. But we are concerned about Chico Police Department's military use policy 709  for the following reasons. Number one, we aren't at war, so we don't need military-grade weapons  in our community. Number two, our police officers are not trained military personnel, so they should  not be handling military-grade weapons. Number three, bringing these lethal weapons into our  community increases the risk that they will be used in our community on us and on our children.  Number four, we aren't safe. We know we aren't safe when our local police are amassing weapons  of war and they enjoy qualified immunity, meaning they don't face consequences for police brutality  and violence against civilians. We are also concerned about school resource officers,  which are police officers in our schools. Are they bringing these military weapons into our  local schools? Are they showing up to lockdowns and emergencies with military  weapons? Are they bringing these military weapons into our local schools? Are they showing up to  lockdowns and emergencies with military weapons? We don't know and we are concerned about that.  I was under the impression that Chico PD was working towards de-escalation tactics and nonviolent  encounters with community members, which I support, but this policy seems to go against those goals.  The question that remains unanswered is why? Why is our local police amassing military-grade  weapons in our small, rural, Northern California community? Again, I don't know. That hasn't been  answered.  I want to remind you, our city councillors, that you oversee the Chico Police Department.  You have the power to say no to policies that make us less safe in our own community.  That is what parents and working families are asking you to do tonight.  We are asking you to say no to renewing this military use policy and to please  move the vote, if you are going to vote on it, to after the community engagement meeting so we  all have a chance to be informed and to make informed decisions moving forward. Thank you.  Thank you.  Next up is Sister Marie Sherry, followed by Chris Nelson.  Hi. I'm not here to give you a definite pro or con position on this because it's pretty nuanced.  If an item is simply a safer version of something that's currently in use, I'm all for it.  You know, that seems like a no brainer to me.  But that was a pretty long presentation that we just kind of played around with.  blasted through and the use of military equipments needs to be done thoughtfully and we need  to take our time doing that.  But again, I see the practicality in some of the items that were presented.  I'd like to see more debate on things that are, in my opinion, kind of extreme like robots.  But I would just like to share some wise words that I heard about 20 years ago that might  help you in your decision.  The military defends us against the enemy and the police protects the people.  When the police become the military, the people become the enemy.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Chris Nelson followed by Marty Dunlap.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Can you say that our community is going to be safer with the use of this military-grade  brand-new technology to them, although these are all things that the U.S. military has  dumped on our communities?  I wanted to get back to what I was going to say.  The one I'm most concerned about or that I wanted to focus on has already been discussed,  but a lot of these are for crowd control, the weapons like gases like capsicum.  Which can cause anaphylactic shock, flash banks that can cause hearing loss.  When you treat citizens like enemies for exercising First Amendment rights to assembly and protests,  it puts all of us at risk in a democratic society.  But it especially puts at risk our kids who show up to these events, our elders like me  who can't walk fast, those who are unable to respond and move quickly, like those with  any kind of disability.  And we have seen this.  We have had use of deadly force against those with mental health crises who could not respond  to police orders.  They failed miserably to use nonlethal problem solving, and they will continue to do that  because the focus is on militarism.  It's a life-or-death decision-making that they have to use.  And just like a nurse has to know how to triage and do CPR and have it all in them,  we are not the enemy.  They have to see us as people that they care about, that they are supporting, rather than  as the enemy.  So I just really feel like I know I'm all over the place with this, but I want you to  reject Policy 709.  And if you're going to vote on it, I request that you do it after the community meeting  because we don't understand a lot of these things that he brought forward tonight.  Those have not been presented before.  This is a brand new report.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Thank you, Secretary Dunlap, followed by Jessica Giannola.  Hang on.  I want to be safe.  Okay.  As a 50-year resident of Chico, I started paying attention to local law enforcement  activities about six years ago after Chico had several officer-involved shootings.  I started working with the Concerned Community for Justice, CC4J, a local group focused on  improving the climate of respect between law enforcement and the community.  One of the six focus points of CC4J is to demilitarize the police.  Law enforcement may underestimate the impact of militarized images of themselves.  When officers are dressed and armed like combat troops, the ability to create trusting relationships  between law enforcement and the community is severely challenged.  Many of the delineated purposes of the military—  including the use of military equipment—are to enhance the safety of officers and the  community.  It bears noting that the use of armored rescue vehicles or robots is paradoxical because  it actually creates a barrier between people and officers, hampering efforts to improve  relationships.  Policy 709, covering the local process for funding, acquisition, and use of military  equipment policy, is an important one for the public to be engaged in.  In reviewing the document, the President's Task Force on Twenty-First Century Policing,  the overriding construct is that public safety requires law enforcement agencies and communities  to work together to co-produce it.  Keeping the public engaged with law enforcement is necessary for trust and respect to be reciprocal  for the community and the officers serving them.  I believe the State Legislature's intent, as manifested in AB 481, under 7072 ,  underscores their view of the importance of public participation in review of the military equipment.  use policy. Furthermore, I believe  there is an allowance for a sequencing  of timelines for the governing body's  renewal vote to occur after the  community engagement meeting.  My interpretation of  AB 481 under  7072A is the annual  report shall be submitted within one year  of approval. The renewal of  the policy by a vote of the governing  body is governed under another  section of AB 481  7071E1.  The distinction between submission  requirement of the report and renewal  requirement of the policy is important.  My request to the City Council  is to defer renewal  of policy 709 until  after the April 27th community  engagement meeting. This will allow  the public adequate time to review the report  and have a thorough discussion with  the police chief about the use of  military equipment in Chico.  This also will allow for possible changes  to the local policies so they  can be improved upon and reflect  the policy.  The report is effective of the community of Chico  and its inherent values.  Delaying the vote on renewal of the  policy until after the community engagement  meeting is paramount for the  public to know their participation  and input can be  and will be a necessary  and valued contribution.  Thank you, Jessica Giannullo  followed by Shelby  Herbert.  Alright.  First off,  I want to thank  Chief Aldridge for his  very careful breakdown  of what is being  requested, why,  and what those items do.  I think that community  communication  piece has been missing for  a lot of aspects.  And when someone takes the time  and listens to the community,  it really helps.  And I find it  regrettable that the  additional meeting that he will be  having at the end of the month is happening  after this meeting.  I think the community could benefit from being  able to meet with him and hear his presentation,  maybe ask some questions, dispel fears,  see where our future is headed.  I think this is hopefully a starting point  in seeing that recognition of the need for less  deadly force type weapons and equipment  and moving towards equipment that is not  going to kill someone instantly or quickly  when we're in high stress situations.  Funding will be another conversation because our funding could be used better for our police force,  in my opinion.  People who support the military equipment,  I think it's because they're coming from a place of fear.  They feel if the police department is well equipped,  then they'll be saved if something bad happens.  And the people who are objecting are because they're coming from a place,  often, of experience.  They have loved ones.  Friends who have lost their life in an interaction with a police officer,  whether it was warranted or not,  but possibly they'd be alive today if different equipment was used  or different training had been provided to the officers.  And that's why they're so passionate and saying,  please, let's not approve keeping more military equipment around.  Is it necessary?  Really, we do need to ask that.  Is it necessary?  So I do support having less lethal.  I don't support, I don't give my support,  I don't support for the equipment that I consider being as possibly unnecessary  in our town of Chico.  I have, when I was running for the council,  like I said before, I did get to do a ride along with a supervisor,  one of our Chico PD supervisors.  And I was greatly impressed by the conversation that I had with him  and the moving towards this younger generation of officers,  moving towards this recognition for this mental health piece,  and trying not to put their officers and the community in danger  when they don't have to.  When they can use, they can back off more,  they can use equipment like a robot or something to talk to somebody,  waiting until they're ready to talk to somebody.  I was glad to see that our officers here are moving towards that.  And we have a leadership with Billy Aldridge that I feel is promising.  And I think we need to keep up that communication,  keep educating, and we can grow together as a city.  That's right.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Shelby Herbert, followed by Julian Zenner.  Good evening, Council, staff, Chief Aldrich.  My name is Shelby Hebert.  My pronouns are she, her, and I'm here to express my concern over the fact that this  vote is being considered before the community engagement meeting and request that you postpone  the vote until after said meeting.  I know from facts like those that Blake Ellis has previously cited this evening that more  guns will not make Chico safer.  Bigger guns will not make Chico safer.  More ammunition for these weapons will not make Chico safer.  Training Chico PD in de-escalation, continuing to do so, is an option that will make Chico  safer.  And I encourage you to do so.  I also encourage Chico PD and the Council to consider investing funds in continuing  to train officers in de-escalation rather than the amassing of military weapons, specifically  22 new rifles.  I ask that the Council consider primarily the safety of Chicoans in their discussions  of these weapons.  Will robots make officers safer?  Possibly.  Will 22 new rifles make Chicoan safer?  Most probably not.  It is also worth noting that based on statistics of police weapon discharge, Chico citizens  of color are most likely to suffer fatal consequences of the storing and use of military  weapons.  It is incumbent upon people of power such as yourselves to protect the dignity and  life of vulnerable people.  As Council member, I will be happy to take any questions that you may have.  The great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great  great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great  great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great  great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great  great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great  great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great  great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great  that in your conversations of this policy you keep in mind first and foremost the safety of jacobins  thank you thank you our last speaker is julian zener  good evening council members staff and chief aldridge  in this time of unprecedented new laws regulating law enforcement coming from the state of california  i want to congratulate our police department for its response to the military equipment  requirements of assembly bill 481 the update of his website policy 709 from last august to just  last week is remarkably improved i have however several observations the department is removing 68  firearms from its inventory they have also requested  the 20 new ar-15 semi-automatic weapons to be added to their current inventory of 42  and to their inventory of 146 000 223 caliber rounds for these weapons  due to the large ratio of the propellant to the weight of the slim bullet in the cartridge  the bullet leaves the rifle muzzle velocity at the very high speed of over half a mile per second  as a physician i'm very concerned about the extreme damage these weapons cause  trauma surgeons and pathologists describe the awful destruction of the bullet entering the body  the very high kinetic energy is transformed into shock waves often with bullet fragmentation  and tumbling resulting in several inches of tissue like liquefaction and an orange sized exit line Surgeons cannot repair destroyed blood vessels  surgical or liquefied liver or lung.  surgical  is not itself  great  great  great ! ! !  during the past year.  The weapon was devised in the 1960s  to effectively kill our enemies, not Chico citizens.  The power of these weapons needs to re-emphasize  the use of space and time for de-escalation  of a tense situation to physically back up  and communicate effectively.  As Ann Palenka pointed out, in the history  of the Chico Police Department, one officer  has died in the line of duty, and that was in 1938,  85 years ago.  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right.  Comments?  Go ahead.  This report's very well prepared.  Even though we have a chief who's  earned the respect of a broad cross-section of the community,  I think it's important.  It's important that we have oversight,  or at least make him think that we might offer  some critical feedback.  This assembly bill is convenient in providing us  an opportunity to do that.  As a lot of people have alluded to,  there's a community meeting scheduled later this month.  I, perhaps other council members,  would benefit in being able to offer feedback  from having that meeting already passed  and be able to hear citizen input,  because there's a lot of people that know a lot more  about all of this than we do.  And I wonder if Mr. Sordson, if you could just say a few words. And I wonder if Mr. Sorensen or somebody would like to address the sequencing of meetings and why we're having this hearing for the community meeting. Sure. Yeah, the sequence of events is that that is outlined in the city municipal code, which was developed in response which was developed in response to the relevant sections of the government code. And it does require the posting on the website, followed by a presentation to council. And then within 30 days of this presentation,  a community meeting. However, there is a section that effectively provides council with 180 days  to make a decision. Actually, it says if council fails to renew the ordinance within 180 days,  it expires. So you do have that latitude. If you want to add anything.  I would only add that Council Member Winslow, the meeting, the discussion of this agenda item  has happened in an open and public forum with a duly noticed agenda. Members of the community  have come out and spoken on this item previously, as they did at today's meeting, and they will have  an opportunity to do so at the subsequent meeting later this month. I have a comment.  No.  Just my last comment on that is that we have the opportunity to table the discussion to the future  in order to see the feedback from the community and have a good faith effort at receiving that  feedback and incorporating it into our decision. I think that's what we're doing, but hear from the  rest of you.  You want to go first?  I was waiting for you, but I'm waiting.  Oh, okay. Thank you. So a couple of years ago, a couple of tweakers broke into my neighbor's  house at four in the morning.  And, you know, he didn't call me.  He didn't call Behavioral Health. He called the police department. And those of you who have spoken  against this use of this equipment, I suspect that's who you're going to call to. So when these  people, I've done some ride-arounds with police officers, and our police force is excellent.  Like these two young men in the rear of the room, they put their, literally put their lives on the  line every day they go to work. And the reason we haven't had anybody killed in 85 years is because  they are extraordinarily well trained, and they have the tools they need to do their jobs safely.  I trust the chief of police and the command staff of this department, who I know personally, to  decide what tools they need to do the job to protect us and them. And I want them to make that determination.  Council Member Morgan.  I have a question for the clerk.  Yes.  So in making a motion since it's an ordinance, do I have to read the ordinance, or can I make a motion to renew the Chico City Council ordinance?  It's just a renewal, so it is not like the implementation of a brand new ordinance.  Thank you. I will make a motion to renew the Chico City Council ordinance number 2576.  Second.  All right. Before we do that, I have some comments. So don't call the question on me, please.  Mr. Morgan.  Don't call the question on me. No, stop it. Call the question.  All right. It's nine.  I know. But certain things need to be said, and I get that opportunity to.  So I usually say Chico, not Chicoans, but Chicoans, but that's like saying almond and almond here too.  I will say that I'm not thrilled that the California legislature put this on and burden every single.  you know, municipality and then the state in an effort to bring this issue forward when this  issue has never been brought forward and military equipment have been used by our police department.  Now, in saying that, I also believe that how Chief Aldridge is moving through this and what's  taking place and how we do it is very worthwhile. But, you know, a lot of people, every year when  we bring this up, people always say, you know, we would never have this instance in Chico or  need use anything. You know, they're only lawful gatherings. There's never anything,  you know, serious. There's never any riots. But in fact, if you don't remember it, you weren't here.  But I certainly remember watching it on TV when I was a kid that there was a riot in Chico and it  did burn a couple of cars, including a police car and turned over a media van. And that all  happened in our downtown. So there has been instances. And that's when our town was less  than half the size it is now. So school shootings,  like that, are commonplace, as we all know. And I want our department to be well equipped to  respond to those kind of things. So I'm happy to support this. So with that, all right, one more.  Council Member Taylor.  You know, I totally support what Council Member Van der Werbeck just said, that, you know, that  our officers are well trained. I've personally had experience.  I've done a lot of writing with officers. And I really like to encourage more citizens to graduate  from volunteer department that we have the VIPS program, Volunteers in Police Service, because  there is a lot of, I guess, misinformation we have. And once you attend that 14-week program,  you will learn a whole lot. And you'll gain a whole different trust with the department. And  you can ask more questions. And I think that's a really good point. And I think that's a really good  way of asking questions if you have. I totally support that our officers need the equipment that  they need to protect us. But on the other hand, I do feel like that we should listen from the public  and vote on it later on. Maybe in the first meeting of May. But we'll see how the vote goes.  Yeah, I can do the substitute portion.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  I just, in reference to some of these comments that have happened,  even though we can trust the current occupants of these positions in the police department,  I don't think that extending that to a principal,  just we're always going to trust the police or any other department in our city,  is just poor management.  You know, we trust a surgeon when we go on the table, right?  Because he has the right training to use the equipment.  It's the same way we need to trust the law enforcement  when we give them the equipment to use as well.  The difference being is when I go to surgery,  I don't get a public opinion on how the surgeon's going to do it.  All right, so I'm going to call this question.  Madam Clerk, can you take the roll on the subsequent, or substitute motion?  The table of discussion.  Right.  Actually, it was Councilmember Tandon made a substitute motion,  seconded by Councilmember Winslow,  to wait on the renewal of the ordinance number 2576 until May.  Councilmember Bennett.  So with this one, it feels like a yes and a no.  So which way, if I wanted to support?  If you wanted, if you want to wait to renew the ordinance,  then you would vote yes on this substitute motion.  If you would like to renew it now,  and then have your chief of police hold the meeting  pursuant to the outlined procedures in the ordinance,  then you would vote no.  No.  Councilmember Morgan.  No.  Councilmember Tandon.  Yes.  Councilmember Van Overbeek.  No.  Councilmember Winslow.  Yes.  Mayor Coolidge.  Oh, he's fun to sit in the middle.  No.  Okay, it fails two to four.  So the original motion, just a second, let me just record that.  The original motion.  Can I?  Do you, Chief Gohsidy?  I do have a quick question.  Okay.  If we vote yes today, right, and after the public input,  we can revise it if needed?  So if you voted yes?  No, of course not.  Excuse me, folks.  We're going through this.  The reason I'm asking that, that if you're going to be.  You could actually bring this back if you were part of the approving party.  You could bring it back within that time period to at least review it, I believe.  The reason I ask that question is that if we are going to take the public input, and  if Chief seems something needs to be revised, then we have to wait a whole year to revise it?  I don't want to speak for the Chief, but I believe that if the Chief holds his hearing,  which is pursuant to the ordinance that's in place, then if there was a change that  needed to be made, he would bring that back to the Council.  Is that correct?  That's correct.  After the community engagement meeting, if something comes up that changes my mind or  perspective on something, of course that will result in a deep conversation internally in the organization.  If it's something that we feel that we missed or need to change based on that community engagement meeting,  it would certainly be something that I would take to my boss and recommend we bring back to Council.  Nothing says we can't bring it back to Council.  And we could always have a Council member voting in the positive to bring that back.  To bring it back?  So if you vote yes, you can bring it back as well.  I just wanted to check.  Yeah, I already did.  So the question that's before us is to renew the Chico City Council Ordinance Number 2576,  the Military Equipment Use Policy 709.  Council Member Bennett?  With that clarification, thank you very much for the clarification.  That makes a big difference.  I feel more comfortable, although I do support you and the police department, yes.  Council Member Morgan?  Yes.  Council Member Tandon?  Yes.  Council Member Van Overbeek?  Yes.  Council Member Winslow?  No.  Mayor Coolidge?  Aye.  Carries five with one no and one absence.  All right.  Moving on to Item 5.3, Commission Interviews, Airport Commission and Climate Action Commission  Positions, a report from City Clerk Deb Kress.  Okay, I'm going to make this very—  You're going to leave.  Please leave quietly.  I'm going to make this very, very short.  This is the culmination of the biennial meeting.  This is the culmination of the biennial recruitment.  And what's before the Council tonight is just to hear from the individuals who have applied  for the airport—who have applied for the airport commission as well as the Climate  Action Commission.  Some of the applicants were unable to be here from prior schedules or whatever.  And again, just to remind the Council, attendance at this meeting and speaking to the Council,  is not a requirement for appointment.  So if you will indulge me, I will bring up the speakers.  And if they aren't here, we will do the airport commission first.  I have Roger Efremski.  If you would like to come up and—what they will be doing is just addressing you and letting  you know why they want to serve and their patience and waiting all night to get here.  And so go ahead and come on up to the—  Yeah, and thank you for your patience, folks.  Sorry.  All right.  Good evening, Mayor, Council members and staff.  My name is Roger Efremski.  I'm a recently retired federal judge from the Northern District of California.  I've moved to Chico.  I want to stay active.  I want to give back to the community.  And that's why I have applied for this position on the airport commission.  My prior history, I was in 23 years in private practice.  I spent the last 17 years.  I've been in the airport for about a year.  I've been here since 2010 with the honor of serving the federal judiciary.  Four years as a chief judge.  I serve on two Ninth Circuit committees, PICA, which is public information community outreach,  in order to have a deal with the community, educating them about the federal judiciary  as well as the U.S. constitution.  I also have been trained by the Ninth Circuit alternative dispute resolution panel.  And I'm a trained mediator.  I think I have some unique skill sets.  It might be of assistance.  Okay.  to the council and the staff in dealing with their areas of the airport commission.  I am not a pilot.  I don't own a plane.  I am the son of two naval officers, and my best friend was a naval aviator,  and I've had a great deal of experience of flying with some pretty major pilots,  but I myself do not have a pilot's license.  If there's any questions, I'd be happy to answer them.  Otherwise, it's late in the evening, and I have nothing further to add.  All right.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Judge, thank you for offering your services.  Thank you.  Okay.  And then we have Bill Perini, if he's still here.  Probably scared some people away with our long meeting.  I don't see Bill standing up.  And this is Loretta Torres for the airport commission.  So, Loretta.  Just save time.  Maybe you have the next.  I'll line up, too.  Who's next?  So, we're done with airport commission.  Mike Antelock is unable to be here.  Gotcha.  Okay.  Go ahead.  Most of you know Loretta Torres.  Grew up at the airport in the 60s.  My father had a fixed wing operation, flying and maintenance and charters,  and I lived in a barracks between two of the hangars that are no longer there.  And I watched the airplanes come and go, and I learned how to fly from my father.  And I have always been interested in the airport and how it's been developed.  And I was disappointed, very disappointed, with most of the people in the community when we lost our commercial airline.  And that would be my goal as a commissioner, to do the best I can.  And to find a way to return that commercial flights to our airport without costing our city a bunch of money.  Because that's what it seemed like it was heading that way.  So, anyway, I do have the time and the willingness to serve and to read all the federal and state information and requirements for our airport.  So, I would be happy to serve.  And you know who I am.  And you know my phone number.  Thank you.  All right.  Thank you.  Okay.  And then, so we had Raul Hernandez, and he is out of town, as well as Mike Antelock.  And so, the goal will be, this is a five-member board.  The council will vote by ballot at the next meeting.  And you will decide who your appointees will be at that time.  Moving into the Climate Action Commission.  Didn't hear back from all of them, but I will just call their names.  And if they're here, that's great.  Britt Cooper, followed by Britt.  Bryce Goldstein.  So, go ahead, Bryce, if you would like to speak.  This is for the Climate Action Commission.  Certainly.  Good evening, council members.  My name is Bryce Goldstein.  My experience working on climate action and sustainable transportation would be an asset for the Climate Action Commission in working toward sustaining our community's safety, health, and climate resilience.  I'm a transportation planner.  I've served for four years on the City of Chico's Planning Commission.  And I have an education and prior work experience in climate change.  My four years on the Planning Commission have prepared me to work with staff, fellow commissioners, and members of the public to ensure that all information and voices are weighed in decision making.  I've also learned a great deal from my role as a planning commissioner.  I've also learned a great deal from my role as a planning commissioner.  In learning about the processes through which our city's plans and policies are updated and implemented,  which I feel would be an asset for being a commissioner.  For five years, I've worked as a transportation planner for both the private sector and for the state of California.  I've primarily worked on planning for multi-modal transportation projects that support the state's climate action plan goals for transportation infrastructure.  This includes planning and guidance for complete streets, biking and walking infrastructure, and  infrastructure, transit, and rail projects. I would bring to the commission my knowledge of  reducing greenhouse gases through transportation infrastructure investment. I also have a Bachelor  of Science in Environmental Science with an emphasis on energy and climate from Humboldt  State University. My education included relevant studies of environmental policy, climate science,  renewable energy technology, planning, and more. Post-university, I worked for the City of Chico  for a year as a Civic Spark Climate Fellow. In this role, I worked with the Sustainability  Task Force, which was the predecessor to the Climate Action Commission, as well as our  wonderful planning staff. And we worked to implement our climate action plan objective  of developing and implementing a community engagement program promoting residential  energy conservation. I also analyzed energy use data from PG&E to find trends, and I worked with  the business community to promote energy conservation and highlight the successes  in the community. I also worked with the City of Chico for a year as a Civic Spark Climate Fellow.  I also volunteered with Butte Environmental Council and served as a Board of Directors member  for four years. And in this role, I've helped organize environmental conservation and education  events and led a community forum series on climate change issues. My work as a transportation planner,  my education, and my experience in climate change, and my passion make me the right fit  to serve our community as a Climate Action Commissioner. So thank you so much for your  consideration. Thank you.  We have Britt Cooper.  Janika Kramer.  Good evening, councillors. My name is Janika Kramer. I'm a working professional mom, wife, passionate hiker of  Bidwell Park, and a new resident of Chico. I want to contribute to my local and global community  therapy program through the  City of Chico's Climate Action Commission. But foremost, I want to help safeguard Rory and Freya's future.  Those are my children. I believe I can do so by engaging with my community and by sharing the knowledge  and skill set that I have collected through work and life experience with the City of Chico through this  commission. I have a degree in environmental policy, environmental and social policy and management  from UC Berkeley. And this gave me a really good theoretical background on climate change,  governance and action. After I went to school, I actually went into the biopharmaceutical industry.  And I've worked 10 years as a continuous improvement consultant and change manager. And in the recent years,  the last six years have been quite intense, as we all know. So I work to manage and organize the biopharmaceutical  industry collaborations. For example, I led a risk assessment around the COVID-19 pandemic. And I also worked to  vaccine at the height of the epidemic. I recently started a new role as a senior sustainability  analyst at Caramita Inc. It's a global sustainability and health and services firm.  This role I am privy to the latest information on new technology regulations and opportunities  that can benefit the city of Chico in the work against climate change.  I may also be able to provide a new or different perspective being a dual Swedish and American  citizen. I split my life between the two countries and it has challenged my thinking what can  and cannot be done as it comes to environmental and social governance and specifically climate  action. Before I thank you for my time, I would like  to direct the council's attention to something that is coming up soon. I would like you to  draw your attention to the following. I would like to draw your attention to the  new climate pollution reduction grant that has been recently made available through  the inflation reduction act. This is a noncompetitive fund that the city of Chico is privy to. The  application is due on April 28. I know we are on short time so I'm going to leave some  information for the clerk and hopefully this information makes it to the council and the  existing climate action commission. Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Okay great great great great great great great great great great great great great  great great great great great great great great great great great great great great  great great great great great great great great great great great great great great  great great great great great great great great great great  great great great great great great great great great  great great great great great great great great great  great great great great great great great great great great  great great great great great great great great great great great  the people who spoke before me and all of their experience. I lived in the area for 49 years,  first for 12 years in Paradise, came up from San Mateo, California, and lived there. Then moved to  Chico in 1986. I went to Chico State, studied English, got teaching credential and a master's  in English. I taught at Chico State and Butte College for nine years, teaching research and  writing. And then I went to work in Willows for 21 years at the high school there. Since retiring,  I have been doing tutoring, some substitute teaching, served on the Butte Crayon jury for a  year, and was the lead editor on the long 100 plus page document. I also take care of my home in  California Park and rental house that I own in Chico on Cairn Drive. I've been on the board of a  Chico nonprofit.  I've been on the board of the Chico nonprofit for over 10 years. It is an organization that  coordinates monthly citizen monitoring events at seven sites along Big Chico Creek. And it also  works with local agencies on grants and projects related to water quality in the area. Among other  roles with them, I have helped with grant writing. I previously served a two-year appointment on the  Chico Art Commission from 2010 to 2011.  The great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great  great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great  great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great  great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great  great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great  great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great  great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great  I would hope that we could, you know, reach across with other agencies to, you know, facilitate dialogue that could lead to positive actions for the community.  Let's see, another thing I want to talk about.  Oh, yeah, is that I've been doing a little bit of research, you know, since I realized that you had some need here in this area.  And one group that I thought was interesting is an institute for government, local government, that's 160 local agencies in California.  And they have a beacon project that provides training and support to implement and document sustainability best practices.  They offer technical support, peer-to-peer networking sessions and other things.  So I would look to reach out to, you know, other areas where, you know, we could learn from best practices.  Okay.  Other cities.  I'm running out of time, but I thank you for listening to me.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Al Shadiman.  Hopefully I said your name right.  Yeah, Shadiman.  That's good.  All right.  Good evening, Council.  My name is Dr. Al Shadiman.  I'm applying to CERBO in the Climate Action Commission.  I'm a professor of science education and research methods at Chico State.  I've worked for 16 years.  First of all, I believe in a small footprint.  I live in an 824 square foot house in the avenues.  I ride my bike to work.  I'm about to install solar panels on the roof and a heat pump to get, you know, how to get the NEM2 thing going here.  I've also engaged in both community and university service, coordinating the School of Education's Torrey Shelter community effort for the last 10 years.  And I serve on the university's sustainability committee, among many other committees.  At the university, I've gained a reputation for my work.  I've also gained a reputation for working productively with a wide range of faculty, admin, and staff, regardless of their ideological and political beliefs.  I'm also a trained and certified mediator.  These skills, plus my disposition as a collaborator, have given me the abilities to work productively with diverse people.  I also follow a thing called Cultural Historical Activity Theory as a framework for designing and implementing human activity systems.  From this perspective, all human activity is goal-directed.  So if a group of people can define a goal,  they can define clear, shared goals.  Those group members can work collaboratively and productively because the focus is on the common goals, not on individual differences.  I also believe that all human activity systems should work towards sustainability as a matter of community and self-preservation.  As we are experiencing through the profound effects of climate change, there are limits to the necessary human consumption of natural resources.  So building sustainability into urban and rural systems should be a priority.  I also understand that any climate change measures need to consider five major sustainability domains,  a very balanced approach between the material, the economic, the life, the social, and the spiritual,  with each one of those domains being led by core principles.  I've read much of the current comprehensive and extremely impressive Climate Action Plan,  and I know that implementation is ongoing.  We have made significant progress.  We have much more to accomplish.  With my background in the field of education and in science, I believe I can be of service to this endeavor.  Thanks for your time, and I hope you will lend me your support.  Have a good night.  Thank you.  Katie Thoma.  Good evening.  Thank you for continuing the meeting.  I know it's getting late.  I have lived in Chico for nearly 45 years.  I care deeply about the people and our local resources, namely Bidwell Park, the business community that drives our economy,  the brain trust that sits at Chico State and Butte College, and the medical community that serves us all.  I am deeply concerned about our future, though, with the passing of Measure H and the increase of sewer rates.  I feel more hopeful than I have in a long time, now that we have resources that will shore up and strengthen our infrastructure.  I have attended most of the Climate Action Commission meetings and worked with the Commission on Climate Action.  I have attended workshops in the last few years, and I have learned a lot.  I was often the only member of the public in attendance.  The current Commissioners and previous ones who have served are passionate and knowledgeable,  but I believe I bring a practical, business-minded view that ought to be considered when implementing the Climate Action Plan.  I am asking for your support in being selected to sit on the Climate Action Committee.  Thank you.  Thank you.  And then Andrew Wilson.  Thank you.  What an excellent pool of candidates.  Good evening.  My name is Andrew Wilson.  Ever since I moved to Chico nearly 30 years ago, I've loved this town, the people, and the surrounding areas,  which all hold a big piece of my heart.  I moved away for career pursuits,  and I'm grateful that I've returned with my family to raise our children in this community.  I seek this honor to serve on the Climate Action Commission with a sense of civic duty and pride in our city.  I am familiar with the Climate Action Plan update,  and I am excited by the direction that our town is taking.  If I am selected as a Commissioner, it would be an honor to carry on the tradition of duty to keep Chico great for the generations that follow us.  Thank you for your consideration.  Thank you.  So those are all of our applicants.  And on the Climate Action Commission, because this is a seven-member board,  the incoming council members of Councilmember Van Overbeek,  Councilmember Winslow, and Vice Mayor Reynolds will nominate,  and then the Council will choose to implement or to, well, actually, it will come back at the next meeting,  and you'll have that nomination to confirm as well as voting for your airport commissioners.  So do they get direct appointments on them?  On Climate Action? Yes, that's how they work.  That's, yes.  It's a seven-member board.  It was set up that way.  No, but I don't remember getting that.  Pardon me?  Oh, maybe we did.  Anyway, okay.  It's direct as it gets.  Yeah.  If it wasn't set up the last time, then it was because we didn't,  the formation of the formal Climate Action Commission did not happen until after that election.  That's why you didn't get an appointee.  I understand that.  It would be nice.  All right.  I would like to thank everybody who's applied.  If you do not get selected, please apply again in the future.  It does not mean we don't want you or love you, think you're good enough.  It just means that someone else maybe had a relationship with you.  Maybe you had a friendship with somebody or had a friendship or something, or they thought  that person was ideal and asked you to come forward, whatever it might be.  But please continue to apply in the future.  Get more on me.  I know it's 10 o'clock.  All right.  Move to adjourn according to the AP and P-1010s, which say we will not-  Oh, look, it's 10 o'clock.  We will not entertain new items after 10 o'clock.  All right.  I'll second that.  I do believe we have to take the city manager's report.  Yes, we have to do that as well.  All right.  Everybody gets grumpy.  All right.  So I typically-we do council member requests after.  And the rest of the agenda, yes.  Madam Clerk.  Yes.  So you're wanting to do the council member request?  Don't we usually or do we not if it's after 10?  Well, if you adjourn, you would-everything would come back at the next meeting.  I have another question.  In the past, you've done it both ways, but when it-  Let's vote on the agenda that we can't get through now.  It's up to the council.  All right.  I made a motion to adjourn.  I did second it.  So let's-  No, no.  It's fine.  Let's do the vote.  Okay.  Council member Bennett.  Yes.  Council member Morgan.  Yes.  Council member Tandon.  Yes.  Council member Van Overbeek.  Yes.  Council member Winslow.  No.  Mayor Coolidge.  Aye.  It carries.  Five, one no, and one absence.  Meeting's adjourned. Meeting's adjourned.  Let's look at what is written on the calendar.  Okay.  Let's look at what is written on the calendar.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.
