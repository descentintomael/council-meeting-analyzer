Anyone wishing to address the council on any matters on this agenda should first complete a speaker card found at the back of the room. Once completed, turn your cards into the city clerk and the speakers are taken in the order they are received. Once the first speaker begins, no additional cards will be accepted. Persons. Demonstrating rude, boisterous, speaking on matters outside the jurisdiction of the City Council or engaging in otherwise disruptive behavior will be called to order. If such contact continues, I will call a recess requesting removal of such persons from the Council Chambers, adjourn the meeting, or take other actions as appropriate. I don't think we'll have that happen over budget. So budget presentations. Mr. City Manager, you want to take us away? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I don't think we need to go. podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem! podem podem podem podem podem involved in many years of work by not only barbara martin and amanda mcgar but the entire asd crew and all of the directors across the city. It' s quite an amazing five-month process to get to this point. As noted in the budget message we continue to have concerns about the economy as we currently expect revenues to the city to be virtually flat when compared to the current fiscal year and we still see inflationary challenges causing expenses to rise. Accordingly you will note in the budget there is only one ad of a full-time employee in the entire city and that one is a network cabling technician and that' s going to be more than offset by us not having to contract out for that work. I think you' re going to find it very important to have that in mind as we continue to watch the economy and what happens with our revenues during the coming months. With that quick introduction I' m going to start a four-minute video created by our very own multimedia coordinator and then I' m going to turn it over to the star of the show, barbara. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. So some pretty big feats. All right, Barbara, our Administrative Services Director. Okay. Here we go, everybody. I don't know what that means. Huh? Okay. Okay. Thank you. Good afternoon, everybody. Mayor, Vice Mayor, members of the Council. Here we are again. Feels like it was less than a year ago, but here we are. Here to provide you with the proposed annual budget for the 25-26 fiscal year. As Mr. Sorensen said, it is very much a continued business as we have been going this past year. Not a ton of growth. So we are here to keep good things going the way they're going. And effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively! working with our strategic planner to come up with these three main initiatives going forward and just to keep this in mind that these three initiatives the safe community long-term viability and protect and enhance the primary community assets are really what focuses and continues our focus as a staff and as a city going forward and in our planning and forward and how we have formed the budget. First thing we will look at is our five-year projection. This is something that is in all of our budgets. It is focused on our general funds those are the most discretionary funds that we have and kind of the most unpredictable when it comes to funding sources and where we are and where we think we will be at is our revenue sources as you can see here our biggest source of revenue is our sales tax both our Bradley Burns which is the one percent sales tax that has been in place for since the dawn of time and then our district sales tax which you all know as our measure h tax those come up to over 50 percent of our revenue in the general funds discretionary funds so that's really a key factor in how we plan things and the volatility of that affects how we go forward our next biggest is property tax and then followed by the others just looking at it from a statewide level our California economy you can apply these sentiments just kind of throughout the state throughout the federal level and then really locally as well questions about budget um how much of a deficit is coming from the California side how much is our is being changed on the federal side that trickles down to us in terms of grants in terms of funding levels for other programs and also just it kind of is an inclination of what's going to be happening here generally in Butte County and in Chico things that happen at the state level start there and then we see the effects of those kind of after the state level and then we see the effects of those kind of after the state level and then we see how effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively the information that we have is as well as our local industries are going and you can see here based on this is our fiscal year outlook the information that we have they provided this to us as of March 2025 but by March 2025 we only have through the December quarter information available so we' re always playing catch up with what' s going to happen. We won' t know the end of this fiscal year information until September so again it' s always we come here with you with our best knowledge and our best estimates but the changes can come down the road even six months from now. So you can see here that most of the industries are down projected this year with an overall decrease of about a 1% overall statewide. There' s declines in autos and transportation we haven' t yet seen that quite as much here locally but with all the questions at federal level with tariffs etc. Who knows how that is going to play out. Building construction is just kind of things are in a I wouldn' t say a decline but a people are waiting and seeing and just slowing their activities just to see what happens. You can see that throughout the rest of the different industries here fuel and service stations as people are traveling less maybe also people are moving into electric vehicles etc. That shows a decline there. And then projected for next year it' s not looking like it' s going to continue that way it looks like at least right now there' l be a slow improvement of just over 1% increase and then the out years we' re going to see more expected to see. So what does that mean for us? Our five year projection from a revenue side is looking at sales tax remaining it' s the Bradley burn sales tax from last year' s period till now has been a reduction but going into next year we' re looking at that being fairly flat same with measure H sales tax property tax is still seeing increases overall and then everything else is remaining fairly the same. You can see at the bottom line there change from the prior year for next year 25-26 is at 0%. You can see in the settlement proceeds the $1.7 million. If we had taken that out you would actually see about a 1.7% growth in next year's dollars as revenue but because that' s in there it' s just showing 0%. So looking at the Bradley burns tax again this is our biggest dollars. Last year in May we had projected that our 24-25 sales tax amounts would be just under $30 million and going into 25-26 we' d be just over $30 million. Now you can see that we are at 26,000. We have lost about $26.7 million into both years. So we have lost dollars in the amount of about $3 million at least in projected amounts in this year of $3.1 million and then 25-26 that' s about a 3.7 almost million dollar swing. So over those two years it' s about almost $7 million that we have lost in the last year and at this time last year we thought we were going to be higher. On the other hand though measure H we were looking at that that we were going to be at about $24 million going into this year but that is looking to be in a positive movement. Again measure H is still fairly young in its measurement so we' ve always been very conservative with what we thought would be happening here. So we are on the positive side We are looking to be at about a million dollars above where we were where we thought we would be last year and then next year we' re looking at about a $800,000 increase. So between the two and then also our property tax increases being still better than what we had originally projected we' re staying about where we thought we would be. There are other factors though that are increasing the costs in our general fund obligations. Most I will talk about just a couple of those here just to give some perspective. The first is our community services fund. This is the fund that funds our genesis activities as well as all the activities surrounding that and homelessness and dealing with the issues that arise out of that. This is kind of a busy slide but I think it is a good slide to show you we have about $5 million worth of costs each year going into these activities and until now we have had other funding sources available to help pay for those activities but going into the next years that' s not going to be predicted that we' re going to have those. These transfers in that are right here that' s the only revenue source and really that' s what' s saying other activities like general fund and other activities that we have been doing for Fund one is paying this amount and grants are paying another amount, et cetera. This is kind of where we' ve been with those dollars. In 22-23 the activities were less. We had American rescue plan dollars that came in that paid for the bulk of it. 23-24 we had American rescue plan and then some other grants that helped making the general fund contribution at 2.6 million. We have a lot of grants that we have been doing this year, 24-25 that we' re in. We have other grants and then a little bit more of the American rescue plan but as you can see going into next year and then beyond those revenue sources are going away as far as we know and there' s no new grants available at this point so that full $5.2 million is going to be an obligation of our general fund. The next piece that is going to be in the budget is our biggest cost is our salaries and benefits and as we said there' s no increases in personnel for this next year. There are increases in costs that are naturally born from salaries and benefits. The estimates that we have include scheduled salary increases so if we have employees that are moving up step scales, that sort of thing, we include those in here. Any contractual increases, cost of living, we include those in increases, that sort of thing that we already know about, that' s included. For insurance we estimate a 10% increase in those costs as of January of 26. That' s when those rates go into effect. And then CalPERS and other benefits costs. And then CalPERS is really our biggest cost driver in terms of benefits beyond the actual salary rate and wages themselves. And that is the hardest to predict and a big dollar value to put on there. I put some slides in here that I have previously put together for the finance committee but I won' t go through that whole pension presentation but thought it would be good information for you all to see just what goes into our CalPERS costs and what considerations there have to be. So I think that' s a really good way to s two pieces of the pension costs. There' s the normal cost which is normal cost of what it costs to provide future retire benefits for our current employees. It' s designed to cover their future retirement costs. It' s all calculated through actuarial studies and it' s a percentage that is of pensionable wages multiply a little bit more than what we And then the other piece that is the piece that we hear about quite a bit is our unfunded annual liability unfunded accrued liability. This is something that' s calculated by CalPERS and it' s very much based on what their investment returns are and then also what they calculate in terms of what their retirement pool looks like in terms of mortality rates, the number of retirees that are out there, etc. And then the other piece that' s s similar to a mortgage in that it adjusts every year based on what their investment returns are and it' s based on a now a 20-year life. It used to be a 30-year life so they' ve modified that. And then every five years CalPERS goes through a whole new study where they evaluate the pool of people that are in CalPERS and reevaluate all these rates based on new estimates for mortality, etc. This year in 25-26 the city is paying just over $14 million for and that' s combined for what' s called our safety members which is our sworn personnel and then miscellaneous members are the other folks. And we do save every year by paying that off in July instead of doing monthly payments throughout the year. So CalPERS is a CalPERS their target rate for their investment returns is 6.8 percent. That' s called their discount rate. If they earn 6.8 percent on their investments then whatever they have said is what we will be paying is what we will be paying. As you can see on this chart that doesn' t always happen. So as it fluctuates we get new information every year on our actuarial studies that reflects whatever the investment rate is. So this is our report that we have that' s going to affect 25-26 rates was based on 2023 return because they' re always two years behind so it' s reflected in this 5.8 percent investment return. So just to kind of show you this is the normal cost. These are the different reports that we get. We got one a couple years ago that was as of data 6-30-21. We had a little bit of a change in the This is what the estimated normal cost rates would be. 22 it changed a little bit and then here we are from last year' s report and it' s gone to that. We use our best efforts to use these as our out year predictions but again they change so we really just follow along and do our best to remain in a conservative state but also generally follow along with these estimates. Thank you. Now this also affects our unfunded accrued liability. We have two pools as I said safety and miscellaneous and between the two as of our information from our actuarial as of 2023 we have $177 million of unfunded accrued liability. Now that' s a big number but again this is something that is paid off over a 20 year period. It' s not all paid off all at once and as you can see as the market changes that is a big number changes quite drastically. If we have a good return year which we did last year in 2024 it will go down a bit but then again in 2025 with the way interest rates are right now and what the returns are not sure how that' s going to end up right. Last that I saw CalPERS was right at about a 4% or so return. So this is what our payments look like for the unfunded liability payments. We have a lot of problems with the unfunded You can see that in 2030 that' s the peak of what our costs will be. As of last year it' s predicted to be just about $18 million for that year and then you can see it drops off as of 2044. That' s the whole theory of the unfunded liabilities are estimated over 20 years so by that 2044 we' ll be out of this unfunded liability problem. That comes with an asterisk though because as I said if the investment return doesn' t happen that unfunded liability is going to come here. It won' t be to this level because these unfunded liabilities were born from all of the things that happened previously before they had the pension reform and then also a change in from a 30-year payback to the 30-year payback that they did some years ago. We are getting there and once we get to 2044 there will be improvement. I' m not convinced that it will be zero though. With all of that though I do want to say that our net operating activities, our revenues, less normal operating expenditures we are still at a surplus of over $20 million every year. We' re doing that and we' re doing great in terms of being able to afford the activities that are ongoing activities throughout the city. And then from there we take those dollars and decide what we need to do in terms of the other things which are capital improvement projects and then funding other places in the city that need replenishment. And that comes with our transfers. This is also a busy slide but just to kind of give you an idea of all the things that we effectively do effectively. We effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively policy that any kind of surplus that comes every year in the general fund excluding measure h will will put some into our section 115 which is to fund future pensions and then also is split among the replacement funds that we have here so while we do have a lot of needs still we are making efforts to make sure that we're continuing on a path to fund those at least in some regards so we don't continue to go backwards and with that we predict that we will be at our cash balance that we desire to be in all of these funds at the end of the year our desired operating reserve is seven and a half percent of operating activities so that's the money that we have left over as a cushion in case something happens beyond what is in our emergency reserves so that's the money that we have left over as a cushion in case something happens beyond what is in our emergency reserves So this is not all the dollars that we have. This is just our general fund operating cash balance. We are fully funded in our emergency reserve, which I'll show in a second. And then all the other funds have dollars in them. This is just general fund proper. And I do want to say that we use this deficit word here, and I know that has bad connotations. So we really want to say this is really just revenue-less expenditures. And so when you see a negative $61 million in 24-25, that's not an overspend of dollars. That is a carryover of dollars that we have received in previous years that we had previously were planning to spend, but it didn't come to fruition. So now we're spending it this year, predicted to spend it this year. That includes the Fire Victims Trust proceeds, among other things that we have in there. That's a lot of money. And that goes back to those four funds that are high dollar values. So we are doing well, and we are maintaining our policies and maintaining our conservative approach here. We do have a few funds, though, that I just want to call out just to say that we're kind of keeping an eye on them as we go forward. Our sewer fund, we have a high cost of materials, maintenance, that sort of thing that is outpacing revenue somewhat. We also have very expensive. Capital projects that are out there that we need to fund so that' s something we' re keeping an eye on. Our parking fund we have had lower revenue in recent times and it' s not able to provide what we need for the costs in the fund and then private development just because construction is slowed we' re keeping an eye on that to make sure we' re still receiving the funds that we need to there. Fund 850 is our sewer fund proper. You can see that there are some transfers in here that' s transfers from our reserves that will help pay for some of the capital projects that we have this year. We still are receiving good revenue increases. We have a lot of revenue keep in place year over year based on the new fees that we put into place. However, they aren' t quite making what we need to to keep that fund where we need it to be. Again, we do have reserve balances. We also have if you all remember we had a PG&E SST solar project and we are going to be seeing some funds come in there from that that will going forward. Then our parking revenue just to let you know the fund balance you can see it' s a negative $222,000 predicted at the end of 2026. However, we do have this reserve balance of $300,000 available. Again, we are estimating on a conservative basis so hopefully at the end of this year things will be better than what' s expected and we won' t have to use those reserves to balance those. Then I put the private development funds up here. They are four funds split by divisions but they all use the same sources of revenue so they' re all put together here so you can see. The activities there we have had a high fund balance in recent years and that' s kind of by design because the cyclical nature and the ups and downs of the industry we can' t live by a zero balance all the time because there' s going to be times when economics are lower and we can kind of weather that storm. As you can see we' re doing fine in that regard but again it' s just something we' ll keep an eye on and see if revenues continue to decline or if we are going to keep pace with what we predict it to be. Thank you. Now talking about unprecedented times. Now I' ve been at the city since late 2008 and I think that unprecedented time is really normal at this point. Since I have been here we' ve had 2009 we had the great recession and CalPERS investment returns lost 24%. We' ve had the dissolution of the redevelopment agency which took away quite a bit of our ability to do capital projects and redirected a ton of our property tax increment into state obligations and different not coming here. 2013 we had our reset here which we really established good policies, good fiscal practices. 2018 we had the campfire and we all know what we had to deal with that in terms of higher population, costs of housing, impacts on our roads, et cetera. Then we had COVID-19. We all went home and we all had some funding from federal government but we also had a good number of our economic drivers kind of go through hard times. 2024 we had our concern that measure H sales tax would be rescinded so we had to go through considerations for that. 2025 here we are in the middle We are talking tariffs, talking about federal funding reductions, what does that all mean? Really I' m just bringing this all up to say that our whole point of the way that we do things is to be able to weather those storms. We have a fully funded emergency reserve, we have policies to dedicate surpluses to future liabilities and replacement funds. We have our emergency reserve here at the end of 2025-2026 that will have over $15 million there just for the general fund related activities. And then we have a section 115 pension trust which we do have that budget policy that we transfer dollars in there, surplus dollars in there. We' re estimated to have over $8 million in there available as of the end of this year. And then our unfunded liability reserve fund when we calculate what to charge the different on the different wages we do put in a buffer of about a 10% added amount in there so that we can fund this fund so we have the ability to use these dollars. Should again if revenues or anything become depressed we have the ability to use these funds for those costs if needed. Thank you. thank you. now before I move on to actually I wanted to show you this one other slide. There' s a couple new developments that happened after the proposed budget was produced and then for your consideration for the final budget. Speaking of the sst program and the sewer fund we have about $1.5 million that' s expected to come to us from E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E Fund to match that because the only way they can get that grant is to do that And I'm sure are you gonna speak to that later? Okay, okay, so just letting you know that those are things that we're wishing to add to the final budget for your consideration Before I move on I'm just have do you have any questions? I want to make sure that you guys know that you can ask questions at any time. I have a question yeah, there's a two million dollar discrepancy between measure H sales tax revenue and Whatever the previous sales tax is called and they're both 1% So what why is there a two million dollar discrepancy? once 27 there's a difference in the application between the two and I could send you a summary from Whatever it's called now used to be board of equalization You know fastest example I can give you is if you buy ten thousand dollars worth of lumber from pay less lumber and You have them deliver it to paradise We get the Bradley burns, but paradise gets their measure or whatever it is. We don't get our district tax So there's a lot of differences in the way those two 1% Taxes are applied in any given transaction Thank you. Sorry. I wasn't understanding what your question was. Thank you adequate question on the The fund the 115 and the cow purrs The eight million and I don't remember the other money where does that money sit and do we earn an interest on that or does that go? Back to this we do the section 115 sits in its own mutual fund So we do that receives its own interest and is invested separately and then the other fund is part of our pooled fund So it receives interest just by our allocating whatever interest we receive on our pool and does any interest earned go back into that? fund or general fund? Into that that fund. Okay. Thank you Council member Goldstein and You mentioned about a 20 million dollar surplus Annually, I think could you give a little more background on that? That's that's based on our operating activities So what we look at is to make sure that our operations are being fully funded by revenues and then beyond that We have capital projects and other transfers which are can kind of sit at one time and more discretionary So that's really just calling out that in terms of our operations where we are well funded and able to carry on with our ongoing costs so our costs of salaries our costs of turning the lights on our costs of All the different things that come into the day-to-day kind of thing that that are ongoing that we will need to pay for going forward Okay, so do those funds carry over to the next year usually I mean they're used at let me see if I can go back here Maybe it's best illustrated So, okay here's So you can see the net operations before capital expenditures that top line there That's where the 20 million dollars is and then from there we fund capital improvement projects and then from there we fund Transfers into other funds for supporting those activities So it's not it's not a surplus of dollars that we have available It's it's dollars that are available before we do these other things Okay So it comes from Multiple funds and then goes into these other this is all general funds This is our one. This is our parks fund and this is measure H our fire victims trust fund and then the E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E would be placing this into the general fund this is going into the sewer fund it's going into the sewer fund because that's where the dollars came out from the um to pay for the solar array out there okay thank you yeah anybody else all right carry on okay okay so that's it for all the economics background kind of a thing um and i just want to um speaking of budget policies and what we um continue to do here i just have one budget policy modification that we always bring forward to you every year and this is just to expand a little bit on what we can do with the um police training funds that we receive that are reimbursed previously this budget policy was specific to post training that they received they go to trainings and then this the state reimburses us for the budget policy and then we have a budget policy modification that we received that we can use to reimburses those trainings and we made it so that we can put those training dollars back into the police training budget so they can use it for other trainings and this is just expanding it so that it's not just from that post activities but if they have any other reimbursements from trainings from other entities that we can do the same thing okay now carrying on to the different department budgets and we'll move on here i'll quickly go through the administrative services information and then pass it on to the different departments to let you know what's happening in their worlds administrative services department as you know recently adopted the human resources and risk function so we're now doing that as well as finance finance and then as well as information systems and really our strategic goals and our mission and everything really our main things are we want to protect our financial resources we want to support other departments and then we want to support our employees along the way of their employment life initiatives for the next year again again along those lines we want to continue recruiting efforts so that we can get quality candidates get people that are going to be in the community and get them to be able to come and stay here at the city and be employed here at the city for a long period of time and then on the finance side we want to make sure that we continue to follow the rules of our government finance officers association and implement any new rules that they provide to us on the information system side we are still continuing with our fiber utility project and in the phases of about to implement the pilot program there and then our risk management again just looking for ways to mitigate risks throughout the city both on workers compensation and then our general liability out in the city streets and that sort of thing our mission is to serve the cities of the chico so city of chico and the city departments by providing everybody with accurate efficient and timely information our total budget request is just over 13 million dollars and our personnel request is about $1.5 million and we're going to be able to provide that to you as well as the other staff members and we're going to be able to provide that to you as well as the other staff members and we're going to be able to provide that to you again this is this is the hr mission as it was in the past once we get our new deputy director in that division we'll probably come up with a mission that will serve our whole department as a whole so what's new for administrative services one position as mr sorenson said we are requesting a low voltage technician i want to let you all know that there are no dollars added to the budget for this position previously when we have to contract out for cable wiring for projects such as refurbishment of city buildings or camera projects that sort of thing the amount that we pay contractual is about twice of what it will be for an annual person to be here on site to be able to effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively special projects for us. A couple of non-recurring operating items. Our executive time software is our timekeeping software, and it is very outdated. So we need to upgrade it just for security measures and to make sure that we're keeping up with the times in that regard. The Masonic generator, we have a tower over at the Masonic Lodge that helps with communications, and this is just to keep that powered up if they lose power. And then the $365,000, the P25 radio license and GTR. The GTR is an actual physical radio repeater, and this is to ability to have an extra thousand users on the channel, and then also to add 50 radios so that our public works department can be on the same network as our safety folks. And then just additional funding in our replacement funds because we have annual costs that increase, and those are the two items there. And that is it for administrative services. MS. Ms. Martin, if you don't mind, I have a quick nitpicky question. The Masonic generator, I'm curious how that's a non-recurring expense if that $60,000 is just to keep it? MS. It's just for the equipment. MS. Oh, okay. Thank you. MS. Yeah. CHAIR BAILET. So there's a million dollars in the purchase services increase for IT between 24 and 25. It goes from 1.3 to roughly 2.5. Is that system related? MS. Yeah. Generally speaking, our purchase services includes our maintenance agreements for all of our software that's around the city and that sort of thing. CHAIR BAILET. Oh, okay. So that would be purchase services. MS. Yeah. All of that kind of thing is in there. CHAIR BAILET. But why the big jump? MS. I'd have to look and see exactly what they are, but they're generally like annual increases. MS. Yeah. CHAIR BAILET. So that would be the expenses that we are looking at, ongoing costs. MS. Anybody else? No? Okay. CHAIR BAILET. Okay. Thank you, everybody. I'm sure you're done with me. MS. Thank you, Barbara. Next I have human resources and risk management. No? City Clerk? CHAIR BAILET. Okay. Thank you, everyone. CHAIR BAILET. Thank you, Mayor and Council. Let me make sure I can. So our mission, obviously, is to maintain the integrity of the legislative history and to make sure that everything is transparent and our citizens have access to their government, to their elected officials, as well as all documents. So we're incredibly proud of the work that we do. We do have four-and-a-half FTEs. I share one of my positions with the City Manager's Office, and so far that's working great. And we've been able to save a little bit of money by doing that. Our funding sources, obviously, I am funded by the general fund. The PEG funds are restricted funds. Those are solely for public access to our televised meetings and making sure that the public has access to its government. So you can see our total personnel costs. And this also includes the City Council's budget. In this particular budget, we had an overall budget reduction, and that was really due to the election costs coming in a lot less than what we had anticipated. We had budgeted $400,000, and thankfully it came in a lot lower. So we gave $200,000 back. And I believe that now, with the bulk of all of the district elections, we're going to be able to save a lot of money. We're going in and we're set until 2030, I believe that those costs will stay very similar to that. what did so there was like half the cost for election than we anticipated? correct. But we also thought that there could be additional special elections as well and a couple of other ballot measures that we didn' t have to have. so that included the special election in March and the general election in November? I believe that was with the was that out of the same budget? Yes. okay. thank you. podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem a coordinator position that position has proven to be a great success our meetings are being televised we were able with lewis's expertise and abilities to bring in the channel 11 station back in and we handle that and we ensure that it is turned on and working so with that position there's additional memberships and things like that associated with but very minor increase obviously we've worked on a lot of different things and on top of our just our normal duties we did just complete a very successful board and commission orientation the other day thanks to all the staff that participated and helped me pull that off and we want to continue to provide training we're working on streamlining the agenda process as well as the annotations and just the ease in which we get the information to you and to our public and once we do that then we'll provide training for our staff we continue to look for opportunities with our peg funding again those are restricted dollars can't be used for anything other than the videotaping and streaming i do want to say that the city of chico's channel now is available through lewis's effort on roku and amazon fire devices so not only do they just turn on their tv for it or go to streaming on their tv but they also have the opportunity to do that on their own and on the city's website they also have other opportunities to to watch our meetings and to hear what's actually going on we are currently in here you will see that we've actually asked to move four hundred thousand dollars from the peg funds again those are the restricted ones for the technology in this building and we look to do we already have the rfp drafted and we're reviewing that right now we want to do a complete upgrade and we want to make sure that we have the latest and greatest technology to ensure the continuity of watching our meetings and people and our citizens being able to have access to it i want to again thank angie dilg my deputy director for the implementation of the records management program that she went citywide i wish we had the before and after pictures of building 400 on that top floor where we had records that had been stored for 30 40 50 years anyway we continue to work on that and we are now looking at if any of you have been so fortunate to look at the old documents in my office the minute books from the 1800s are all written in calligraphy and they're beautifully bound and we want to make sure we preserve those because if there was a fire you know in that building we would lose all of that historical documents so that's the next big task that angie will be working on in terms of looking for ways to preserve those documents and we want to make sure we preserve those and we want to preserve that information so that we have those beautiful books forever. We already did the commission recruitment and training and then the staff reports and i think other than whatever else you direct us to do we will have our hands full this year are there any questions? thank you. thank you. thank you. thank you. before we start, madam mayor can we agree that we will hold our questions until the end of presentations just so this flows a little faster? at the end of each presentation correct? yes. thank you. okay, city management. we continue to strengthen all of the partnerships that we have in the city consistent with all of the goals that the council just department to improve the organization and help all the different departments work through whatever challenges they may be facing. obviously a major operational item is trying to make whatever council policy direction comes out and make it happen. obviously we continue to work with the city attorney on anything we can do to improve citizen engagement. we also do manage the website most primarily. year over year budget change is virtually zero. we are still staying at 3.5 positions. the .5 we kind of go back and forth. we are not sure what half of steno looks like yet. some of the current highlights the lost park redevelopment. the initial launch of cannabis and now that' s really transitioned into a! a a! effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively and the other! Thank you, Mr. Stanton. good afternoon council members. I' m happy to report on this year' s budget. Not a lot has changed obviously given the circumstances with our revenues. I can share some of the stuff we' ve done this last year. One of the major initiatives that we embarked upon last year was creating our new strategic plan. These were our adopted internal strategic plan goals and objectives that we have. It focuses on recruiting and retaining highly qualified workforce, enhancing our physical assets to address the needs of the growing community. I' ll talk about that in a moment. Improve our industry standards and strategic plan to promote clear and transparent dissemination of information both up the chain and down the chain. Improve communication externally to our community, to the council members and other stakeholders within the community. Enhance the training program to align with industry standards and improve our capacity to effectively mitigate our emergencies. It' s a moving target sometimes because we have new initiatives, we have new mandates, so we want to keep up with those. Lastly, establish comprehensive health and wellness program. As we know, we have a higher risk for PTSD, higher risk for cancer and injuries that are associated primarily with shoulders, knees, backs that can end careers or lives. effectively effectively! effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively We've been pushing, obviously, hard to get an additional engine, given our call volume in this last several years. We've seen an increase in the calls for service and a larger population, which has just been identified as over 113,000. And then taking our standard of cover, completing that this year as well, and aligning it with the service gaps in our strategic plan to address those. Our mission statement hasn't changed. In fact, it was a pretty robust discussion in our strategic planning. And it's really unusual that people in an organization knows their mission statement. And I'm happy to say every single firefighter. Knows our mission and lives by that mission as well. We're predominantly source funded through general funds, but we do have funding that helps support our code enforcement folks through new development. And so that's been a huge help for us and has helped us maintain a really positive and functional code enforcement group. Our budget this year went up to almost 21%. And our total cost of personnel, as you can see, is 17 million. I believe that number at 68 is wrong. It should be 66, if I'm not mistaken. So our big push will be to get this last phase of the alerting system that we instituted two years ago. It's just taken quite a bit of time and the costs have gone up exponentially. So we hope to cap this. And hopefully we'll be able to get those costs off with this year's funding to get this project completed. Our areas of responsibility are emergency response. Virtually anything you can think of. We tend to go out on those calls. Emergency management and pre incident planning, code enforcement, and public education. So last year was an exceedingly busy year. It was a monumental year. In fact, we had been really busy. We saw some of the three major incidents, some of which were the largest in our city's history, with PV fire being the latest one, mansion fire, and then the park fire being the fourth largest fire in California, starting in our own backyard. As I suggested, we implemented phase one and worked through that part of it last year. We initiated and completed our tablet command, which is our overlay with CAD system rims, and it's given us a great opportunity to use that to better understand our situational awareness, resource management, command level oversight of major incidents. We built out two new fire engines. And while the standard of cover was actually initiated in 2023, we've had to reboot it again, given the differences in our response capability, as well as our call volume from when we started first. And then finalized the strategic plan and finalized the Station 6 feasibility. And you can see that's... So we're going to continue to work towards our rendering of what it would look like if we get that built. So our goals this year, we're going to keep pushing for that extra engine as we see our call volume continuing to increase. Our risks and hazards are no less than they were in 2008. So we want to continue to move towards getting us right-sized. We're in the process of finalizing the last phase of the P25. We're going to continue to work towards getting that P25 system from the fire department to get on that. Finish the mock alert, as I suggested. Securing funding for Station 6. Adopt our standard of cover. And then we should be done here soon with our emergency operations plan and start training our city staff on what they would be doing on a major incident. And I will now turn it over to Chief Aldrich. I think we're going to have some questions. So hold on just a second. I figure you didn't have any. So I... Vice Mayor Bennett first. Nice try, Steve. I know. Dang it. Vice Mayor Bennett. I thought I was getting out of here. Scott Free. My comment is that I am extremely frustrated that we could not find the money for Engine 1. That was a high priority for me. A high priority for many folks. I know that some people were disappointed that that didn't happen. So I'm going to continue looking. At the budget. And perhaps in the fall when we see some of the projections, perhaps, maybe, see some of the projections actually exceed what has been placed in the budget, perhaps there will be an opportunity to bring that item back. So that's what I'm going to do. Thank you. I appreciate the support. Council Member O'Brien. So I know you had an ideal staffing model for Engine 1, Steve, or Fire Chief. What would be the minimum staffing level to get that up and running? Well, last year I presented an alternative understanding the limitations of the budgeting last year. I was going for an incremental increase by taking three firefighters, putting them on Engine 4. That would be the second or third unit that would have four firefighters. And then as the revenue started to increase, So I think it would be a good idea to take some of those positions and some new ones to Staff Station 1. Or Engine 1, I should say. Got you. Thank you. My question is minor. But in the video that we saw in the beginning, it said the P25 was live for radio. And then I see you said that you need to still, so it was only partially in the fire department. Correct. PD got the first rollout to that. They wanted to take out fire. They wanted to take out all the lumps on them and not fire. So I appreciate that for IS. But they wanted to make sure we are dependent on it in a little different way than PD does. Because we' re using that system on incidents to coordinate everything. So PD was able to take out some of the kinks in the system. And then we' re in the process of rolling ours out here in the next month or so. So I' ll save asking how that' s working for the next presentation. Well, I can tell you it will be a huge improvement on what we have currently. And PD has been very happy with it so far. So I have no doubt. And this is also the same system that makes us be integrated with what Butte County' s using and everything else, correct? Correct. Okay. Sounds good. And that' s all I had. Does anybody else have questions? No. I think we got a request to take a quick break. Thank you. So can we take a quick break before we go into the next question? And then we'll go back to PD. All right. I guess I' m telling you we' re taking a quick break. Before we go to you. We'll be right back. . . . Thank you. Thank you. Chief Aldridge, you're up. Thank you, Mayor. We got Dale coming. Hold on. Oh, there he is. He's got the door. No need to apologize to me. Thank you. Good afternoon, Mayor, Vice Mayor, members of Council. City staff and to our community members who are here today, thank you for attending. From the police department side, pretty straightforward. As the fire chief said, no growth in the police department in terms of additional staffing this year because of the flatlining of our revenue in the city and completely appreciate the safe approach that we're taking in that manner. So I support everything the city manager has suggested for the police department. Thank you, Mayor. So what are our strategic goals here at the police department? Number one, we have to provide a safe place to live, work and recreate. If we can't do that as a police department, we're absolutely failing. I think we' re doing a really good job of that and chico is a very busy city as you know, especially for police services and we are working 24-7 running from call to call in this city. Reducing fatal vehicle accidents through education and enforcement. Two of the three E' s within the traffic piece. Engineering being that third piece that we oftentimes find ourselves working with. Brendan and his staff to correct areas around the city that we find are creating issues making the roadways unsafe. Commitment to community engagement and partnerships. We' re out there in the community all the time doing different types of events. Putting on our citizens academy. We' re just getting ready to go out there and effectively effectively! podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem! podem! podem engaged in the community. Maintain department transparency internally and externally to ensure police legitimacy and procedural justice are practiced through the four tenets of voice respect neutrality and trustworthiness we know that came out of the president' s 21st century of law enforcement report several years ago so we continue to do that. thank you. as I said a very busy year over 101,000 calls for service into our dispatch center over 9,000 cases investigated the cop logic online crime reporting over 1200 of those almost 1300 total arrest and citations for 2024 at 5,500 I suspect that' for next year being our traffic unit has been highly engaged in making the roadway safer. then over 6000 police reports and public records act pra requests filled that continues to be the biggest amount of work that our records staff are seeing is the pras that are coming in it is nonstop within the pd to the point where we may need to create a division within the police department for pras. this year key initiatives for 2526 we' re going to finish up our integration of the evidence module into our dispatch rems module which has our report writing our accident investigation module and things of that nature. That' s called property room and that will ensure that we are providing police department and the same system as all other agencies in the county so it talks seamlessly especially with the d.a. Office allows us to get reports and evidence information over to them quickly allows us to get information from other agencies to assist investigations so going over to property room was a huge piece for us and that will be wrapped up here this year with the final training that' s going to be occurring. we' ve been working with facilities. Eric gustafson and his staff are helping us with a infrastructure needs assessment study matter of fact we have several people in glendale arizona right now as we speak at a station design conference and then in the near future we' ll be having some meetings with other companies that will help us with the identifying either the potential funding sources or design concepts for the police department. and then we just signed our strategic plan contract today with the company we closed that rfp earlier this year and I believe the city attorney john lamb just signed that for us so we' re moving that forward and hopefully to have that kicked off here within the next couple weeks. we just installed the last piece of our alpr system in the city that you authorized last year and the last two pieces that we haven' d completed on that are still waiting caltrans permitting processes we' re working with brendan autoboni and his staff to ensure that those permitting processes get completed in a timely manner and we can get those last license plate readers up one on the south end of town on 99 we' up one on the north end of town on 99 so we' re pretty close to wrapping up that project and just the expansion is going to be huge for our ability investigating crimes in the city of chico. thank you for that. the red light camera enforcement program is still moving forward we' re in the contracting phase of that we hope to have it wrapped up within the next couple of weeks and move it to the next phase. so it' not as fast as i thought it was going to be but it' s moving forward. forward progress ever forward. the police department' s mission statement to create a safer chico and improve quality of life by partnering with our community and providing dedicated service i think we do that on a daily basis and our core values integrity courage respect we all live by those within the police department. so we can we fund a lot of our budget out of the general fund as we all know we do have some grant funds that we' re still using. i believe amanda told me it was out of the cops grant. we still have a little bit coming out of that which i think it actually may be ending this year if i' m not mistaken. so the total budget of 45 million million. With a total personnel cost of $36 million we know personnel are our largest portion of our budget. I have no control over that. We' ve been very fiscally responsible in what we requested and laid out for the city manager to look at and tell us what we can afford and make it work. With the current number of positions we have 183 positions within the police department. I wish all 183 of those were police officers for the community but only 109 of those are police officer positions or peace officer positions. Three of which are park ranger positions. What' s new in the 25-26 budget purchase services communications business expenses animal services janitorial animal services training equipment equipment and equipment equipment and vehicles and I' ll explain those throughout this presentation. On the operating side we are continuing to expand our body camera and taser program to ensure every employee who is on the street engaging with our community have those body worn cameras on them. We' ve expanded it out to our animal control officers and police officers. We are assigning them to our detectives and our swat team. It takes a little bit of time to expand that program because it' s so expensive. It' s been a phased in approach to get everyone a body camera. We recently started using the barnacle parking enforcement device. It' s been highly successful. It' s paid for itself several times over with the fees the city has been able to recoup from those scoff law violations. We want to continue to use that. Field services for tows, vehicle tows, the reason that request is there is because the fees for towing a vehicle have gone up. We wanted to make sure we increase along with that. Communications continues to be a growing project with our radio system, the cellular devices throughout our cars. As the federal government is working in the state, the fleet grows and we add more computers and cars that comes with the communication upgrade also. These are things that throughout the year we pay. Firing range taxes. We partner with butte county on our firing range so we split the cost of our property taxes on that. Varying membership dues, business expenses that we have seen throughout the years that have gone up on us. Veterinary expenses for animal control. Historically we relied on donations to take care of the animals and the shelter. One of the things that I have tried to do is get away from having the care of the animals depend on how many dollars we receive in donations. It' s our shelter, the city' s shelter, we should at least fund what it costs to take care of the animals and get them adopted out. We still get donations which helps out tremendously. It' s allowed us to expand into other little areas such as the spay and neuter programs and also the waiving of adoption fees that the city manager allows me to do pretty often that helps us clear out the shelter. Disposal services for narcotics. This is one area where all the agencies in the county are struggling with. We have a lot of drug companies that are drugs. I think it was called coban was a company we were using and they are no longer taking drugs and we' re having to find a different contract to get rid of those narcotics. Also in the near future we may have to find a way to dispose of firearms through a shredding system. We no longer have a company that does that for us. It' s shut down so we' re trying to figure that out. As we continue to hire in the police department and as you know for every 20 backgrounds that you do you might get five to eight people who actually pass a background. Those are expensive. The more you do in terms of positions the more backgrounds are going to fill out. You have to keep doing more to find the right person that can pass a background. As we' ve seen just this past year historically that amount of backgrounds has gone up so therefore the cost associated to it has gone up. This is the animal shelter and this is new. This was an out of the box thinking. Genitorial services to include kennel cleaning. We had asked for some positions at the animal shelter to assist with the workload that they are faced with there. What we have found is that the ! a lot of the staff spend an ordinate amount of time just cleaning kennels and not doing animal services stuff in terms of adoptions. Even the vet tech who is in there are helping clean the kennels. We' re shutting down the shelter hours because they' re having to clean the kennels so that doesn' t keep it open to the community. What would it look like if we actually had a janitorial service that could clean the kennels and the shelter and then we could have our folks focus more on what animal services employees should be doing? By doing this contract it actually allowed us to increase the available hours that the shelter is going to be open, places employees back into those positions where they should be focused on as an animal services shelter. That will be huge for us and we will be working on that. It will be huge for the community in terms of our availability to be open for intakes, adoptions, things of that nature. One of the things we' ve really needed to do out there for a while is provide some training dollars to that part of the organization. A lot of what their training that they get is pretty cheap in terms of what we have to pay for. We have to and we felt like this additional training funds just for the animal shelter would get them quite a bit of training. Existing capital projects, the crisis response unit personnel equipment, most of their equipment has a life expectancy on it. Throughout the year we always prepare for what needs to happen. We have a lot of provide that. We have this ongoing capital project that allows us to plan for that throughout the year, multiple years in advance, especially like our tactical vest that are bulletproof and have rifle plates in them. They have a life expectancy on those and they' quite pricey so we plan that out. Increasing this by $22,000 annually has allowed us to continue to plan that out with the increased costs that are coming from just inflation on the equipment. Then we want to add some more members to those different teams. This isn' t just swats. This would be our swat team, our hostage negotiations team and our uas team. Those three are connected at the hip now. Whenever we have a call out all three of those units go. We' re trying to grow out the crisis response units so we have the right people in place, the right amount of people in place and the right equipment for them to be safe while they' re doing their jobs out there. Ballistic safety equipment. You' ve probably seen the officers sometimes you' ll see them in a ballistic helmet and then what looks like a rifle plate vest. That' rifle plate vest that they' re wearing on critical incidents. That has a five year life cycle on it so we have to plan for replacing that every five years. We' ve gotten behind on the ability to replace it. We' re looking at with this 105,000 to replace that equipment in year one and then build it out for the next five years so it' s not such a big hit at one fell swoop. down at the bottom, transfer safety vest budget from current operating to offset the request of $46,900. That' s just a transfer, I think it was a combining of line items, correct barbara? What' s that? It was just shifting the budget that you had in that operating category to that project. Okay. Another new capital project was our transport vehicle for the swat team. Currently we have a suburban. It' s 26 years old. It was donated by the fbi and it' s literally on its last legs. It' s about to die and I know that eric doesn' t want to give, doesn' t want to put a lot of money to it. We started planning for that and the request was literally s a little bit more expensive and we had to go ahead and replace it. The reason that is so expensive is it does have an armor capability to it so we can safely drive into a scene and not have to worry about rounds that would come through a vehicle. It' s essentially a suburban or some sort of like a vehicle that would transport swat officers into a scene safely. I' s the right word but I want to point out that vehicle is 26 years old and we' ve been trying to get it replaced for a while and eric' s been fighting me on it and doesn' t want to give me money for it. Lastly as we' ve seen the success of our traffic unit we would like to enhance their abilities through some different types of vehicles. As we continue to grow patrol officers and the patrol staff, we' we only have so many vehicles. Oftentimes we find ourselves running out of patrol vehicles and so with the traffic unit being dedicated to working traffic we need to have two dedicated vehicles assigned to them for traffic related matters. That helps out with patrol not having a lack of vehicles when those traffic units are working and taking from the fleet this would just enhance their ability to have all their equipment everything they need for those maybe those major accident investigations and have them prepared at all times instead of switching vehicles every single night. So vehicles are expensive now it's amazing how much it's costing to build just a patrol vehicle but I support that we need these two vehicles to further enhance that unit. And with that I'll answer any questions you may have. All right questions? Council Member Van Overbeek. Chief my recollection is the traffic unit was staffed out about 10 months ago something like that. Do you have any stats on how many citations they're writing? I don't have any in front of me I believe I can pull it up for you if you'd like. Be interesting on my computer. Interesting to see it it's it's I when I was a young person I never thought that I would be happy to see traffic cops out there but thank you. Yeah I wasn't happy to see him with my couple tickets I got when I was a teenager either. Vice Mayor Bennett. I'm curious you've mentioned this before but why do you think your um uh PRAs have gone up so much are people looking for problems? Are they? Um so I think that with the new laws in effect for um you know what is it AB 1421 I believe it is with opens up a lot of the requests for information on officers um that has been a large portion of our work. Vice Mayor Bennett. I'm curious you've mentioned this before but why do you think you've gone up so much through people rightfully so according to their rights within the law are asking for information on on employees and you know um that was the whole transparency piece to 1421 and other than that it's you have a you know you have a lawsuit that comes through and then all these outlets want information on it um and then you know just it starts to compound as you get multiple people in the law and then you know you have a lawsuit that comes through and then all these effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively this is designed to be intentionally burdensome to police departments and that' exactly what' s playing out and the fact you have to create a unit or potentially create a unit just to deal with the volume of requests is not transparency I would say that' s intentional effort to burden our police departments throughout the state of california. thank you. can I ask has this been an issue in other cities too? the pra? yes. it' s statewide everyone is seeing an influx in these requests. It' s becoming quite burdensome for a lot of agencies. The going way to fix it right now is just what I said people are creating divisions of pra records folks some are even bringing on their own attorneys in house and pd' s. council member winslow. yeah. there' s two things I noticed the ask you have a relatively modest vehicles are expensive but there is a 9.44% increase versus the prior year and with that there' s a kind of interesting financial thing of where we get you' re getting 6.2 million less from measure h and then the general fund and then 9.7 million more from measure h leaving 3.5 million. I wonder if you could explain one is where is all that money coming from that over 9% increase and then one is why that move from general fund to measure h is taking place? I will let either the city manager or barbara answer that measure h. okay. With the reduction in revenue in the other general fund funds. We have a In order to balance and to keep the costs in the general fund large we had to shift some of the costs of it could have been any of the general fund funded items into measure h dollars. That' s the pluses and minuses to having a separate fund for that revenue stream. It shows everybody exactly what we are using those funds for but it also makes a shift things around. We shifted dollars for generally the salaries and benefits of the police department. It' s not the increases that you see in there are just what I spoke about before. Cost of doing business and cost of general salary increases that have already been established. Per's increases, et cetera. That' s what' s been shifted into measure h so we can still do all the things that we want to do. We have a lot of additional funds that we have been able to use. We just selected the pd items because those were already previously approved costs in measure h so it just was the most efficient way to use those funds. thank you. That' s a good explanation. I think it helps for people who are looking at that and wondering what' s going on. Overall the total increase I know in fiscal year 24 we had a large increase for all the sworn personnel 20%. How come so much of it is hidden now that we almost have a 10% increase year over year? I think the answer to that is there' s a lot of capital improvement requests in this so it builds it out over time. Then when you look at the cost of some of the things that we don' t have control over I was just looking back as you were listening to Barbara speak. I mean we had the janitorial services of 150,000 that we' re looking to add. The big number items here I' m looking at such as narcotics disposal, background expenses, the body cameras and taser packages. Those are big numbers communications. I would say there' e nothing that is within this budget that is fluff. We' ve gotten it down to the bare essentials that we need to continue to operate and the things that allow us to continue to provide the service to the community. cost of the services that we' re looking at. Thank you. One more question. It' s always hard to keep track of your staffing levels because there' e a lot of positions we' ve added. Where are we at right now with sworn personnel, cso' s, dispatchers? Are there a lot of vacancies? we' re effectively the organization. We' re working with the department to get a couple of laterals which will help us balance out the youth in the organization and experience level. From the dispatch side we' re doing really well. I mentioned before we started taking away mandatory overtime for the first time in 15 years and when you can say that I think that' s a success in and of itself. From the cso staffing point we' re currently at five openings in that. We' re hoping to initiate six backgrounds right probably this week on folks who we interviewed the last couple of weeks. We' re going through a different process now. We do a triage on the background before we spend all the money on doing a full background. That triage process has ended and we' re looking to start potentially six backgrounds in that area. just to clarify if you' re talking about the police officer openings there' s two in the academy that' s in addition to the seven openings? They' re filling in two spaces? we don' t count anybody that' s in the academy when it comes to how many vacancies we have because they could fail out at any moment. They' re one bad day away in the academy from no longer being there. I never count them. If you wanted to you could say there' s two in there and two in the training program that' s four and then we have three that are scheduled to go into the we would have to apply which would be seven. We have seven vacancies. In theory those are the seven positions we would have but then we have one that potentially is going out on a work comp and one that I know of last day of work is this week, the end of this week. Then you add back those two. You' re looking at two positions that are unfilled at this point but we' re still early into the year when it comes to recruiting and like I said I' m hoping we' ll be able to get some laterals throughout the year. thank you. council member goldstein. one last thing on that we do have a park ranger vacancy. That is the other vacancy. thank you. one of my questions was also going to be on vacancies and recruitment. Just to clarify right now there are two vacancies of peace officers. Is that right? that are open right now. there' s a lot of vacancies s moving parts so it' s seven? it' s seven. It' s seven is the number right now. When you look at it in terms of operational can I grab my phone I have a piece that I can answer a lot of questions. yeah. thank you. thank you. thank you. thank you. currently the way we look at it is operational versus filled positions. We have 92 operational of the 109 positions. In theory you take all the folks in training and add that in to filled positions that' s 99. You have the other 10 positions one being park ranger position that' s open. Then if you want to add back in the others I was giving you the two in the academy the two that are in training right now and three that are coming. That gives you seven. It would give you the two positions in theory if you played it out that way. The way we like to do it is operational versus filled positions. are in the same position. We know what we have at our disposal for the community and that is 92. okay. great. thank you. s a very confusing number for a lot of people that don' t understand that process and it' s fluid. that helps clear it up. thank you very much. Vice mayor bennett. I actually I could go after that. m sorry. I was looking through council member winslow mentioned there was the 9.44% increase in the budget and you helped clarify that. I was wondering what amount of that is going to pers slash benefits and barbara might also help answer that. you have to answer that fully because I can' I don' t have the numbers in front of me but cal pers for safety employees is about 80% of wages so I' d say it' s about half of that. half and half wages and half benefits. all of the vacancies we' re talking about are also budgeted in the measure h fund five fund so any of that kind of savings we will realize will be in fund five. okay. I was wondering because I had been asked about how much of that increase is essentially mandatory because we have to fund the positions we already have. I don' t have a super clear question on that but just wondering how much we' re already committed to of that over 9% increase because I had been asked about that. all of the dollars that are in measure h and again it' s just moving salary dollars it' s discretionary as to whether we did that or moved some other piece of fund once off the obligations into fund five but everything that is in measure h dollars right now is salaries and benefits and they' re all positions that have already been with us forever. They' re vacancies but they are already established and already committed to be part of the operating picture. okay perfect thank you for that explanation. all right. senator? vice mayor bennett. being the public safety is one of the most important aspects of any community throughout our state and nation I just want to say thank you very much and this includes the fire department that' s the other piece of this public safety is the fire department calling somebody and you know they' re going to be there and they' re going to do whatever they need to do to help you. I just want to say thank you to the chico police department I think you' re doing a great job. you' re more than invaluable. you are a piece of the public safety. part of our community and again thank you very much you' re doing a great job and all of the men and women in the chico police department and the chico fire department deserve our respect and our admiration thank you. thank you. councilmember o'brien. I echo all of those comments vice mayor bennett well said I won' t repeat those other than to say I completely agree I also wanted to commend chief aldridge everything I think you' re asking for is needed and very thoughtfully presented. I know and understand those issues and I think you did this in a very pragmatic and appropriate fashion. thank you for that. one area I want to highlight that I think you were exceptionally creative and that involves animals that are in our care for the city and that' s one of the responsibilities we have and we take in an animal. we own that animal in the sense that we need to take care of that animal and your budget and the increase that you presented I think is very important something that gets overlooked that the police department actually runs animal shelter people forget that and we have great people that work over there that are often forgotten you have not forgotten them and the needs of the animals and I just want to highlight that. an area that often times kind of stays in the corner but I recognize it and I want to extend my appreciation for your thoughtfulness in that as well. councilmember renoverbeck. one of the things I want to point out is we' ve had a lot of conversations with the police department and I had a letter or email campaign from people that don' t want us to increase the police budget this year. I think you said you have 109 sworn officers in california for a town this size the median number of police officers for our population would be something like 170. and we have something like a for example. We do not have an under I still think the police department is underfunded and we want to do everything we can to help you but for people who think that we' re throwing too much money at the police if you look at other cities across the state that is absolutely not true. I just want to get that out there. all right. council member question. one more question. we had a letter kind of recently from somebody I think involved in the animal shelter and I was just reminded that I wanted to know if we know if we' re addressing the concerns that that letter had brought up for funding the animal shelter with our allocation in the budget. I can find it to be more specific. I think I know what letter you' re speaking on. This was a letter about staffing. let me see. m going to try to find it so I can tell you more of what' s actually going on. It was about staffing. I think we addressed we did make some requests for positions the way I do my budget with the city manager and barbara I just lay out everything that I think we need as an organization to be a fully functioning fully staffed police department for our community and then I let them tell me what we can afford. The animal services area we did request positions in that but being that we can add positions to the budget this year this one we got creative and said we can actually do a one-time expenditure of $150,000 for janitorial services it actually frees up about three to four hours of each of their day from cleaning kennels. It exponentially increases their ability to focus on their actual job and then not have to worry about that cleaning of the re-examine the secondary piece that should have more staffing hours associated to it. thank you for the explanation I appreciate it. that' s a contract so they' re non-perishable non-recurring cost positions. that' s something that director gustafson' staff will be handling the contracting services on. perfect. anybody else? thank you. I want to make a clarification my mathematics failed me my education we are at 68 not 66 so my apologies. that' s it. thank you. you' re fired. I' m glad I don' t have to do finances. good afternoon mayor reynolds vice mayor bennett and council happy to be here brennan vee community development director I' m going to give you an update here on planning building housing code enforcement and gis those divisions all make up the community development department. while cdd' s responsibilities ultimately touch on all of council' s goals I believe the three primary goals are housing economic development and creating a desirable place to live. in order to meet these goals the community development department has created its own strategic goals those include ensuring the city' s general plan and land use regulations are consistent with quickly evolving state housing and land use legislation. that we expeditiously process development applications in accordance with local state and federal regulations. that we plan and administer affordable housing programs and funding. that we provide up to date gis data and information to the community and the city. that we ensure all construction is consistent with california' s complex building codes and that we maintain and improve the quality of the community through enforcement of local state and state codes and regulations. I' m going to start off and go division by division so I' m going to start off with planning. the planning division is funded by a number of funds including private development which is the enterprise fund as well as general fund and some special revenue funds. the planning department or division has eight positions and we' re requesting approximately 2.6 million. at its core planning seeks to implement the general plan and apply the city' s development standards as I mentioned and the city council to propose projects which also helps us meet our jobs and housing needs. and in addition to you seeing me every other tuesday here with you at the city council planning also serves the planning commission, the architecture review historic preservation board, the map advisory committee, the zoning administrator as well as the city' s climate action commission. so again we' re like many clerks we have significant coordination including agenda management, applicant and commission communication, public noticing, community engagement and ultimately the planning providing an open and transparent decision making process. so what' s going on? development activity remains steady and the demand for housing is strong. planning is deeply involved in processing the entitlement of chico' s next special planning area, barber yard. this of course is an infill brownfield project proposing up to 1250 residential units, reusing also existing historic buildings and up to approximately 60,000 square feet of new commercial uses. there' s a required environment for the we have a long-term plan environmental review. you all know sequa by now and so that' s nearing completion and we expect to be before the planning commission here as well as council later this fall. long-range planning also you' ve seen us here for a few visits to council in the past. also remain very active. we continue to implement the housing element policies. we' re amending local codes to keep pace with the state' s again I say onslaught of housing legislation. we' re updating the general plan safety element to address emergency preparedness as well as the state' s new management.! wildfire maps. this year' s initiatives include more residential readiness code amendments implementing commitments made to the state through our housing element. also intended though to streamline residential permitting as well as promote housing. and then also per council' s direction the city will be obtaining its pro housing designation from hcd and that will support grant funding for housing and capital projects. we recently resubmitted to hcd last week. hcd in their normal form project. we have a received in the form that really appreciated our application and thought we were above board but they had comments. we' re addressing those. moving on to the housing division. it' s funded by non-general fund sources including federal housing and urban development funds the affordable housing fund as well as fees collected. the division has three positions and a total budget request of 495,000. and again as you know affordable housing is the primary focus of that division. they receive funds from hud and coordinate with affordable housing developers to implement the housing element as well as the hud consolidated plan. over the past five years the city has seen an unprecedented level of affordable housing production that has occurred due to federal disaster recovery funding as well as tax credits. these resources have supported the development and lease up of 937 new affordable housing units. there are an additional 370 units currently under construction or in pre-settlement development. that will mean a total of 1,315 affordable housing units coming to the city' s inventory. currently the housing team is working on three projects that are being funded directly by city funding. the cusick apartments which is 75 units. oleander community housing 38 units. and bar triangle another 70 units. so in addition to the new units the division is also committed to preserving existing affordable housing. a priority moving forward is the rehab of turning point commons. again an existing 66 unit housing or affordable housing project. in addition to that the city' s partnered with habitat humanity on a home ownership project on wisconsin street which is due to be completed in early 2026. they' re also actively implementing programs and activities outlined both in the housing element but also in the draft of the hud consolidated plan which will be coming back to council for final action next month. and finally the housing project to further support homelessness services and long-term housing solutions the housing division will be applying for years four and five of the permanent local housing allocation funding through hcd which will be used to support homeless services at both genesis as well as torres. our gis division which is our smallest is funded by enterprise funds as well as some general fund support. they have two positions and are requesting 357,000. they support every division and department throughout the city whether it' s staff answering questions from the public, field crews maintaining city facilities or updating 911 dispatch for fire and police. they also support chico unified, cal water, pg&e and others who are going through master planning efforts. and last year gis received funding through council' s direction for a new central portal to house the city' s gis in the cloud in order to lower renewal costs, enhance the field staff use and support the community and ensure unimpeded service. that transition is complete and so now they are working to train staff as well as the community on how best to utilize that resource. on to building. they are entirely funded by the private development fund. they have 16 positions and the total budget request is 2.9 million. I think as you all know construction activity in our community is vital to economic development as well as housing production. and ultimately the building development fund is a and the building division is responsible to ensure the safety of the community by ensuring that construction is all meeting the local ordinance as well as the california building code. under the leadership of deputy director dale fletcher we have successfully filled all positions in the building division and we have incredibly talented and competent individuals. and i' m highlighting that because we had a long tenure with building division being understaffed and having difficulty retaining and getting new applications. and so now the culture has changed significantly and we see a steady pace in both residential and commercial development. you saw my recent press release to you all about residential development. there were 141 single family units. 572 multifamily as well as 42 adus. and we expect a similar pace in the coming year. so in addition to keeping the trains running. that' s processing those building permits. and we expect a similar pace system. This year the building division will lead a comprehensive update of our online permitting system to enhance both external and internal use. We are finalizing a user fee update that will require a future visit to city council for new fees as well as adopting the states new building code and that will require training staff as well as the community on those changes. The code enforcement division five positions primarily general fund they have a request for 947,000. Of course as you know their job is maintaining and keeping things quelled within the community about things that can become festering or growing problems and so they do a commendable job of that. Things that I really wanted to highlight and champion on them is that of the 10,000 new and of the 1,900 code cases opened last year 92% of those were closed based on voluntary compliance. That incredible volume was accomplished again with just three code enforcement officers and one supervisor and doesn' t acknowledge the incredible annual community benefit we received from the we debatement and drop and dash programs. Also last year code enforcement abated over 257 abandoned vehicles and trailers and throughout 2024 and cleanups throughout the city' s open spaces. Also this year they have been respectfully implementing council' s recently adopted shopping cart retrieval ordinance and I think most of us can tell there' s been an evident change in our community. Finally per council direction a massage parlor ordinance will be coming back to council later this year. Finally as you know cdd is not seeking any new positions for the upcoming fiscal year but I wanted to california and the city of california to create a more sustainable department structure and this effort will include not new positions but ensure that each division has dedicated lead or appoint person and also that we' re providing adequate career path opportunities in order to keep employee retention. That' s my presentation and I' m available for any questions. we will start on this side this time. anybody? council member winslow. just tracking budgetary changes and seeing something I don' t understand so I' ll ask a question little bit of a decrease in salary. s a 16.81% decrease most of that I can see is the private development fund so it' s driven by development activity. Out of the general fund there' s a slight decrease even with a little bit of salary increase and it' s in the category of allocations. There' s a $64,000 decrease. I' m just wondering what that is. again this is in the what category? it' s under general fund in allocations it' s below other expenses. okay. There' s a grant fund the plha fund that' s ending and so there' s that piece of it and then the allocations themselves that depends on salaries throughout the city. We have different ways that we allocate different pieces of those puzzles. We have a liability insurance that is dependent on salaries so as a department becomes a different proportion of the m just wondering if competitive salaries those get allocated differently and also utilities, telephone, etc. all have their different formulas for how those are allocated and as those costs change those get spread out differently throughout the city. interesting. Good job on whatever kind of savings you' re doing with telecommunications. anybody on this side? I just had a couple of quick ones. The plha fund is a $1 million one time purchase services what is that? under plha says purchased services it' s a million dollars. I don' t remember you joking but I think that has to do with the money we received that we' re supporting the pallet shelter. the plha funding came to council possibly I think two years ago. I think it was a five year plan it' s a total of it' s a little over $2 million plha funding and the plan is to use that money for homeless services. And so we did a request for purchasing yes request and that funding some of it is going to torre shelter for their ongoing services. So we have a couple of years. So that' s what that professional services agreement is for. The other part of the funding is a direct transfer to eric' s group for genesis. perfect. And the update to the this one' s for brendan I' m sorry thank you. I had mentioned there' s more where we were pursuing additional funding from the plha for the same purposes. that' s great. That' s good. It was because there was nothing for two years and then it hit and so it obviously stood out. Is the update on the online system when do we I thought we were working on that last year but is that just ongoing of like. to track it. to track it. it has been a challenging engagement with the primary vendor. So it' s been difficult first getting a contract where we agreed on what they would be providing and then we don' t want to go live until we have things right and so that was a mistake. we look back to when we kicked initially six or seven years ago and it was kicking off before it was ready. This time we' re making sure everything is ready to go live. do we have no recourse if we have a contract with somebody and they don' t perform their end of it? it almost seems like at this point we need to cut bait and run. that would be a big that was something we contemplated and we were looking at what the county was pursuing and honestly we thought that maybe that would be a change system and it would be wonderful. let' s just say they' re having their own challenges with the new direction they' re going. We' ve made a commitment and I think it' s the right one. We have folks that are supporting us that are previous employees of this company that we' re working with that are helping us better support how we' re going to go live and then it will be ongoing. We have learned that with any online permitting system it' s not like it' s just ready to go day one. It' ll be ongoing tweaking and fixing and enhancing but we' re comfortable with where we are and you' re right. We' ve gotten to the point where we questioned the m not sure if that' s going to be successful. I think we' re going to have to change that. I think that' s what we' re going to do now. are we close on the massage parlor? It seems like that' s taking forever. m not sure. the city attorney' s office has provided something to us. We' ve been busy and I mentioned us, code enforcement. We have a version of the ordinance we' re reviewing. great. Awesome. That' s all I have. did council member holly? no. all right. I think you' re free. thank you. thank you. we' re going to go to the we' welcome. welcome. Thank you. Mayor, vice mayor, council. appreciate the opportunity to speak to you. Eric guesstin, public works director of operations and maintenance divisions of the city of chico. honored to represent the men and women of public works on m and present our proposed 2526 budget. make sure we maintain safe reliable modern infrastructure and services for the greater chico community. We have a handful of source funds that fund our 12 divisions we' re now. Total budget requested is 33 million. Out of that personnel costs are 14 million. We' re at 103 full-time equivalent positions. I want to thank the council. We' ve had per our 2017 staffing plan we' ve had incremental growth each year as a budget and resource. We' re getting there. We' ve seen vast improvements from where we were several years ago. I feel we' re extremely effective on our service delivery model. We want to continue that momentum. We want to thank the council for all of our efforts and all of your efforts and approvals over the last few years. Thank you. There' s a snapshot of our 12 divisions as you can see. We have internal service divisions, a very diverse department. We' model. One moment we' re discussing fleet services and the next moment we' re discussing sewer or park services. Very diverse in our service delivery model. Our strategic goals that all of our staff are aware of are enhance infrastructure and recreation facilities to be world class, inviting public spaces. We of course always want to deploy a rapid response service delivery system focused on a sense of urgency in all functions and everything that we do. We deploy projects to ensure long term sustainability, accessibility and opportunity and then establish an economic development opportunities and partnerships to ensure a robust local economy wherever possible. We' re going to go through just a few of our division initiatives for the upcoming budget year. Of course our main focus this year is really going to be in our right of way street maintenance division. We want to continue our coordination efforts with our friends in engineering, the engineering side of public works for our city and the city of we're able to support our upcoming annual roadway capital projects and complete labor intensive dig outs, crack ceiling and surface preparation at least six months ahead of their larger capital projects. It' s a great partnership and relationship there and we want to continue those efforts. We want to extend city streets by replacing at least 10,000 pounds of crack seal material. This coming year we bought a crack seal trailer and we' ve been putting that to good use and it' s extremely effective and part of our pavement management system. We continually repair about 8,000 square feet of city sidewalk. We have a great program. Of course council knows that in most cases the adjoining parcel owner is responsible for the city sidewalk. We follow california government code like most municipalities except if there' s damage due to a city street tree and that happens quite often. So we have a magnificent program in place to make those repairs when a city street tree has collapsed. sidewalk or crack. We want to continue to maintain our streets and our underground storm drain and sewer system through our ms4 permit which is our municipal separate sewer system and storm drain system that' s regulated by the state. That' s a snapshot of our have been working on. We have a course through our last year' s budget approvals we purchased a working w130 asphalt grinder that' s extremely effective and we' re putting that to good use. We started it last year and really going into good use this year with a lot of projects identified. We' ll talk about that a little bit later in the presentation. Wastewater as barbara mentioned we have a handful of capital projects this year that we' re working on. Our primary clarifier scoping and costing, secondary clarifier scoping and costing, scada upgrades, we' re delivering our phase three of our sustainable solutions turnkey energy reduction projects and of course our constant adherence to our npdes permit, our national pollution discharge elimination system permit that' s also heavily regulated by the state. Our park division is really moving forward. A couple of key points in this fiscal year we' re increasing security and aesthetics of caper acres by installing a new perimeter system. We' system along the upper park road along the upper fence. Mostly funded by a donation to which was fantastic. We are a previous council approved the parking management program for upper park several years ago. We do want to get that implemented by the end of summer. We wanted to make sure the roadway services were repaired which took place last year both the upper park road section and the paved section. And we' re using the same kiosk system that is used downtown. so we want to make sure we have the bugs worked out of that system prior to implementing that into upper park so I wanted to give a heads up that is coming. Of course we want to complete our lindo channel defensible space project hazard mitigation grant program in lindo channel this year that is wrapping up and want to continue those vegetation management efforts not only in the channel but all the eastern urban interface of the city and we' ll talk a little more about that in the upcoming slide. Always a lot going on in our street trees division you' re going to see significant corridor pruning projects in the south campus neighborhoods after school gets out and the students are moved out as we' re seeing happen now. We want to continue to manage no net loss of canopy cover and maintain our 36% canopy cover and start to increase that towards our urban forest master management plan of 40% in the next 20 years. We want to continue to maneuver from reactive forest management The addition of active calls for service to proactive urban forest management and of course the addition to a third tree crew during last years budget cycle it helped us get there it' s taken a little bit to ramp up as far as equipment purchase and things like that but we do now have a fully functioning third tree crew thanks to your approvals last year and we' re looking forward to seeing that in service so thank you for that. That' s going to ultimately that will help us achieve our goal of a seven-year pruning cycle for all city street trees. Traffic safety division continues to move forward we want to have a rapid response within one hour to any report of street light or signal knockdowns that' extremely important we want to continue to meet our federal highway administration retro reflectivity standards and change out our older signs to retro reflectivity signs as we maneuver through the fiscal year. Underground division is extremely important of course we try to clean our sanitary sewer system at least 75% of the sewer collection system on an annual basis of course that reduces our sanitary sewer overflows and it' s really important to inspect at least we would love to do more we have one inspection crew in future years we may want to add another additional crew currently we' re only able to inspect about 10% of our underground division and we' underground system but you can see the importance there we found a fiber intrusion on the picture on the right that we had to replace the pipe due to some directional boring that took place and the picture on the left is actually a storm drain pipe that had failed and we dug that up and we' re quite sure what that was it looks like some old orangeburg pipe but it' s not it' s just some old pipe that was wrapped in a material with a rope around it so it' s very interesting the things you find sometimes in the underground sewer so it' extremely important to make sure we inspect with our camera system as much as the underground infrastructure that we possibly can. Fleet division we have some pretty intensive regulations coming up we had a big round of regulations back in the 2008-2009 era from the california air resources board we have another round coming up here this fiscal year with a clean truck check program that' regulations and we' re going to make sure we' re adhered to and so far we' re positioned well. Listening to chief aldridge' s presentation I don' t want to get rid of that 27-year-old suburban so I was thinking we have a 25-year- old these are old file photos from fleet and that' s a 25-year-old fire engine that' s going to be surplussed this year with arrival some new ones we might be able to paint that blue and transport I support the swat officers. I fully support replacing that suburban but we have got our money' s worth out of it. Our facilities division continues to set some good initiatives we want to enhance and modernize all municipal facilities with the aim to serve the public effectively and efficiently. Capitalize on building systems as much as possible and of course capitalize on an asset management system that we could use to forecast upcoming replacements in our city facilities. We have a lot going on in facilities with the fire station 6 design that we want to get through design costing we have some work to do on fire station 2 a little bit of work to do on fire station 1 and of course the new police department design that we' re heavily involved in. A lot going on in our facilities and we' our facilities division. Airport continues to move forward we want to renew our older lease holds to current market rates and we' re doing that as much as we possibly can. We want to work to expand leasing development opportunities where we can and then continue our general aviation and aerial fire suppression efforts. Of course we' re going to continue to pursue commercial air service and continue to fund and set up and design our capital improvement projects at the airport we have a handful identified for the coming years. You' ve seen this slide before our outreach and engagement encampment cleanup division. We' re getting weary of the rinse and repeat situation that we' re in a lot of instances we' re looking at different ways to assist there we also will talk about it a little bit later. We want to increase our management efforts at the alt site to try to get that situation under control a little bit better so that' s going to be a big initiative for us in this coming fiscal year. In the proposed budget I don' t like the word status quo but we' re going to maintain our core responsibilities and continue our very successful service delivery and we'! delivery model there is a 6.7% increase in our operating budget that' s due to a few capital projects you see listed below and then some increases here and there in our materials and supplies budgets in certain operating divisions. I do want to focus on three initiatives or project highlights if you will that will be our priorities this year. Of course we will be working with promote the economy of scale with partners and city contractors and volunteers and other organizations that are out there the ccc crew we had ccc' s working in the park today so you' re going to see a lot of vegetation management efforts lindo channel the eastern side of the city the urban interface that' s identified in vegetation management plan the community risk reduction plan and the cal fire layers that you' ve recently saw so lots of efforts are going to be with vegetation management this coming fiscal year and the goats that we' ccc and other organizations as well to do a fantastic job for us grazing and reducing the vegetation fuels that start fires. So we' re targeted initiatives for vegetation management will be pile burns down and dead removal grazing elevating and some dozer lines as well we' ve been able to maintain some existing dozer lines that were put in during some of the previous fires and We' re putting in a couple more too in strategic locations that we think will help protect neighborhoods on the eastern side near the park. Our grinding operations this is something that' s very proud of and we want to highlight what we' re doing with our grinder. We have purchased two used larger dump trucks that were kind of a pinch point with the amount of material that the new grinder can generate. We' re really excited to put that into play this year you' probably seen a lot of work happening already on forest and it' s really to stop having to do potholes I' m going to be honest I really dislike filling potholes it' s a temporary repair of course it' s a necessity we' re always going to do that but it' s a band aid and we would rather do a more permanent repair and just have a better use of our funds so it' s when you can see the s s indentions and the roadway degradation there in the wheel cuts and so what we' re able to do is grind out those wheel cuts with our grinder replace them with new asphalt and then partner with our colleagues in engineering to come in with a surface treatment a slurry seal if you will which basically produces a brand new road surface that should last another 15 years or so. I do have a short video if this will play. This just kind of highlights the process. E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively and we hope to replace those dig outs with new asphalt and ultimately a seal coat on top and I think that' s a great use of our funds and a good collaboration between o and m and engineering and we hope to do a lot more. Those are some of the areas we will be performing dig outs this coming fiscal year. Council has gotten that list but for the general public those are the areas it' s a tentative list and with dates we hope to accomplish this We will be doing that this year. We will land on encampment cleanup those are some of our statistics in 2024 we removed 2,740 cubic yards or 418 tons of material year to date so far those numbers are reducing down which is good the encampments that we' re coming along and enforcing are smaller we' re doing everything we can to re still picking up a fair amount of debris with 653 cubic yards or 95 tons to date. Moving forward we really hope to accelerate our outreach and engagement functions to make sure we' re getting people into shelter when they will accept those resources when offered to them. We' re really dealing now you' ll hear a presentation later tonight briefly from myself and then our site operator at and the situation on the folks a lot of the folks we' re dealing with now are unfortunately service resistant but we' ll look at different ways and better ways to try to help them into more of an emergency housing situation. We' re also going to take a hard look at our alternate site and increase our management layer there with some additional case management from our site operator at genesis and then a little bit more routine cleaning there and really trying to layer in some rules to better manage that facility and not let it get to the point where people are way outside of the 20 by 20 square or way out invading or impacting the fire zones or the accessibility for public safety to get in there in the event there' s an emergency. It' s been a tough site to manage but we' re going to really prioritize it and look at different ways to try to be a little bit more effective at the alt site. That concludes the presentation and I' implementation. Again we feel we have a consistent track record of producing tangible results through our projects and services. This year' s budget maintains an intense focus on street repairs and the dig outs crack ceiling and sidewalk repair we mentioned. Tree pruning and vegetation management and open spaces and greenways. Through these modest operating increases and capital requests we can continue to serve the community well and we' ll land our end on our mission statement again to and to maintain safe reliable modern infrastructure and services for the greater chico community. that concludes the presentation. questions? council member goldstein. I have a quick one did I see third street near the transit center on your map of resurfacing projects? awesome. we' re going to do some dig outs there and dig out repairs there. great thanks. council member robles. challenge with third is where do you stop? you can keep going so it will be identified years from now with a larger project but for now we' ll do some repairs there to at least get us by. thank you. thank you. thank you. thank you. thank you. thank you. after public safety I hear more about potholes and roads than anything else quite frankly. I was really pleased to hear about is it the working grinders is that what that device is called? yes. so removing the wheelbase and the roadway where obviously we spend most of our time in our cars and the wheelbase removing that doing the seal after it' s got to be much cheaper than removing an entire roadway. fraction of the cost. fraction of the cost. I think it' s outstanding. I was on forest avenue this weekend driving on the road and what an improvement that was. I think that' s an excellent use of our dollars. I want to compliment you for that and also pleased to see that east 20th street is on the docket. that is a roadway in need of repair. thank you for that as well. council member wenzel. along that line. pothole repairs are a s a good point. I tell people because my understanding is pretty driven by citizen complaints we can call them citizen inspectors they' re out checking out the roadways letting us know when things are not looking good. for these wheel cuts which I agree are really efficient. fraction of the cost. how are we prioritizing those and is there some flex in the schedule for that? as far as our ground out repairs? it depends on how we deal. some of them get a little more complex when it' s a large arterial street and you have to deal with traffic control. I think that' s a good point. it slows things down of course but that' s our tentative schedule and if we get through that a little bit quicker we' ll keep that grinder working as long as we possibly can. great. council member van overbeek. yeah. director gustafson I always marvel at the number of complex functions that you' re responsible for and frankly how well they' re executed. thank you. appreciate that. thank you. thank you. we' yes. vice mayor bennett. do you need a masticator? you' re going to get one of those? yeah. we have a fleet of flail mowers and rotary mowers and rotary mower attachments we' re looking at a masticator. we think we have some savings in the existing fleet budget depending on where the prices come in to be able to purchase that. it' s not a new request in this budget but we' re definitely looking at a masticator attachment to put on one of our existing skid steers to see how effective that will be. they do an incredible job they' ve been using it up at butte meadows and boy those things are great for fire control. thank you. so what is an masticator? it' s like a big drum grinder if you will it' s almost like an asphalt grinder but it' s an attachment that goes on a tractor or a skid steer and it' s used for fire fuels reduction. it can be challenging sometime in an urban setting because they' ll throw material that' vegetation and it' s several hundred feet so you' ve got to be cautious and make sure areas are clear and of course you need to make sure it' s well within the eir of the existing vegetation management plan that we have in some areas it is so we' ll see how effective that might be and where prices come in and definitely deploy it because they' re extremely effective rather quickly. all right I think that' s it. thank you. anybody else? I' m going to take a quick break. I' ll do one more. okay. I' m going to leave so I' m going to go over there. I like the intro. take a quick break? okay. we' ll do a quick break. we' re running on track. sorry that' s your warm up to the mic and give us five. I' ll just stand here. I' m going to take a quick break. m going to take a quick break. m going to take a quick break. I' m going to take a quick break. I' m going to take a quick break. I' m going to take a quick break. I' m going to take a quick break. I' m going to take a quick break. I' m going to take a quick break. I' m going to take a quick break. I' m going to take a quick break. I' m going to take a quick break. I' m going to take a quick break. I' m going to take a quick break. E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Mr. Honoboni, now you're up. Good afternoon, mayor, vice mayor, city council members, and members of the city council. I'm proud to report that our dedicated team of approximately 36 staff members has performed with integrity and exceptional productivity over the past year, continuing to set new records and project delivery. Despite operating with three long-standing vacancies, our team has consistently adapted and found innovative solutions to maintain our momentum and meet our goals. It is important to recognize our success is not achieved by our staff alone. In addition to our core team, we rely on approximately 150 to 200 contract professionals who provide essential services and design right-of-way services, environmental compliance, construction management, and program studies. The expertise and support of these contract staff are critical to maintaining the quality and timelines of our project delivery. Furthermore, our construction contractors play a pivotal role in the physical execution and completion of these projects. The I am deeply grateful for the dedication and collaboration of everyone involved. It is truly a privilege and an honor to lead such an outstanding team. Our capital improvement program remains at the core of the engineering department's mission. These projects demand continuous organization, planning, and the ability to adapt to ever-changing circumstances, much like a symphony that requires each musician to perform in harmony for a successful production. As the center of this effort is a conductor who ensures coordination and excellence. I would be remiss if I did not specifically recognize our deputy director, David Gianco, sitting behind me here in the audience, for his outstanding leadership in orchestrating the CIP program. His efforts have been instrumental, pun intended, in achieving historic levels of project delivery. Thank you for your continued support and confidence in our team. So our strategic goals One of the three main core strategic goals in our department is performance, excellence, and leadership culture. This past year and moving forward into the fiscal year 25-26, we focused on leadership training, leadership efforts, and creating a culture of leadership amongst our staff. Secondarily, our project delivery is a core strategic goal, not just going through the design and processes, but actually building those improvements so that the Our strategic goals are strategic infrastructure planning. As the city grows, builds out its general plan, our role in engineering is to ensure that we are providing the critical infrastructure and utilities so that we can support the growth in a thoughtful and planned manner. Our four key divisions are our traffic engineering division, which oversees our parking program. We put out an annual striping project that is out to bid currently. And then we look at our traffic signal systems. Eventually we're trying to move towards coordinated traffic operation center. I don't know that we'll get to that in 25-26, but that is part of our future goals and efforts. In addition, you've seen a few yellow flash or flashing yellow signals improvements to have that permissive phase of traffic signals that improve the overall circulation and access. Development engineering processes development applications, and so our continued efforts and goal there is to continue to process applications in an efficient and effective manner, ensuring that improvements and facilities tie in well with existing conditions in the city. Third is our sewer and storm drain engineering division. This past year we updated our sewer master plan, our stormwater master plan. With this budget, we'll be engaging in updating our sewer rate study in coordination with the operations and maintenance department. And another thing that we're doing is And another strategic effort in this division is compliance with our state water resources control board MS4 permit. Capital projects, mentioned that. We've heard a lot of talk in the past about the historic level of capital projects. This past year we did over $60 million in construction contracts alone. When you add in the consulting services for all the support of those projects, it comes in at over $90 million. And then we look at the budget. We're looking at roughly $25 to $30 million in projects. So between 2024, 2025, and 2026, we expect to have over $100 million in construction contracts, which is unprecedented for an organization of this size. Again, goes back to the people that we have and the teams that we have in place. So kind of overall, we have our mission statement there. I think the budget numbers are a little misleading because when you look at the budget, we have a significant variation of funding sources between general fund, we have our development impact fee funds, we have grant funds, measure H, so on and so forth. When you accumulate all of the capital project costs, I believe we're at over $180 million in budgeted costs. Some highlighted projects, obviously that started last year, we'll be finishing up this fall. The Bruce Road widening project, that was a $30 million construction completing that project with the construction. Currently, as you likely know, the roadway portion is complete. We're finishing off the center median improvements with lighting, landscaping and other utilities. So we expect to be completed with that project and hopefully have a great ribbon cutting this coming fall. Next is our esplanade corridor safety and accessibility project. Again, started last year and expect to be completed this summer fall timeframe with the improvements along finishing off esplanade as well as oleander. Obviously a part of that project was the roundabout at memorial way and oleander in front of chico junior high that was done literally the day before school started this past year. So great efforts there and look forward to again another successful ribbon cutting there. Our bikeway 99 phase 5 pedestrian bridge, we're going to be doing a the bridge similar to the past two starting 2024, working on completion of landscaping and lighting aspects of that project and expect a summer completion for that project. Just completed this past couple of weeks was the Rio Lindo rehabilitation project. So we started that last year with the underground work, doing sidewalk curb and gutter and then had to pause through the winter to do the weather conditions. And then just this past couple of weeks finished off the paving work and operate opened up the began operation of the new traffic signal system at esplanade I believe yesterday. So that will be operational and has one of those new flashing yellow components as part of that as well. Coming up with this current budget or this current year actually sorry about that. We'll have our 2025 road rehab projects that will include Peterson memorial drive and then we'll have the! And so brown engineering was the awarded contractor for that and we expect to begin says May 2025 but with the timing it will likely be June at this point. So excited to get about get going on that project and then secondly is the north Bruce road so from highway 32 to Chico Canyon Road rehabilitating that roadway surface as well as completing multimodal improvements there. Didn't want to go through pictures on every single one we have so many projects going on. That's the first one.! These are the list of projects anticipated or currently contracted and beginning this calendar year. So here in the next couple months obviously we're getting into construction season. Many of these projects are kicking off May June timeframe. And so it's a variation of bridge projects road rehab projects the eaton floral roundabout sewer line p18 for the southeast portion of Chico. And so on. Secondarily with this budget light will fund the 2026 construction projects so these are the current projects we anticipate to finish off design work this year and then we shoot to advertise for construction bidding during the winter that allows us to get competitive pricing from contractors. We have some asterisks there with some of our those bigger projects that may be a little bit more expensive projects that may get pushed out due to other coordination efforts that may impact the schedule. So a long list I won't go through and read all of them. But again I think this represents the hard work going on at city hall day in and day out by our staff. Just amazing work and not only getting it out but doing it the right way so that again these improvements last for a very long time and the community will be able to experience those improvements. Not shown on this obviously is the construction related projects is our downtown revitalization project so we just kicked that off this past month. That will be ongoing throughout the 2526 fiscal year and hopefully have that in front of the city council for consideration during the winter of 2526 with a goal to hopefully submit a grant application next June. And then lastly our development impact fee program we' re currently in the process of getting that done and we' re in the process of updating our transportation plan so we' ll go through this summer into the fall and likely in 2026 we' ll be bringing forward an item for consideration of adjusting our development impact fees related to these master plans so that would include sewer storm water transportation related aspects. That concludes my report and I' m available for any questions. so director ottoboni the bruce road project is a project that we' re working on right now. beautiful thank you. how much was that delayed by lawsuits? it was about a year and then we advertised the project for construction and received bids higher than we anticipated so we had to basically wait another year to get more funding and re-advertise so a total of two years. if it were built on schedule without that lawsuit what was the it depends on inflation and all that but I would likely guesstimate somewhere in the two to three million dollar range. thank you. council member bryan. thank you mayor. I might to compliment you on the bruce road project that was not just a traffic flow concern but also a safety issue. we saw it during the campfire for sure so thank you for that. it' s a beautiful improvement but I also want to compliment you on the esplanade course. effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively So many exciting things. Yeah, I mean I could talk about all these all these projects I'm not I'm not a big fence guy, but that fence on the Esplanade a little like wooden one It's really nice. I've heard that from other people too. Just out of nowhere told me that So good good design. Yeah, there's a lot of interesting stuff going on in our capital improvement plan the 10-year what projection? I recall that we were Looking at like a 10 million dollar like baseline and it was kind of like if we can allocate more funds We'll be able to stretch further obviously And how are we looking on that? It's hard to track because there's so many different funds to go into all your projects Like how are we looking on that? Yeah, we've delivered on what we've committed to so far that much I know and then we'll kind of see where the budget goes with measure H and whatever Allocations are made will make the most of it and the goal is to focus on that 10-year list The 10-year list was premised on a 10 million dollar per year measure H commitment. So again, whatever is Budgeted and allocated we're gonna make the most of it and do the best we can with that Are you getting the 10 million dollars this year from measure? I know because you had dollars moving around stuff from funds But I'm trying to tell looking at all these numbers and I'm not quite sure There is a reduction and so we had to reduce some of the scope on the East 20th Street portion But maybe Barbara city manager could Yeah, the reduction he's referring to was about what seven million About some point eight. Yeah, roughly, you know just to reallocate into the general fund in other places Of course we've also Allocated what almost 30 million and fire victims trust. Yeah And then so that so that portion of East 20th that's now going to be delayed and that's from 99 to Park Avenue, sorry That's the section that will be delayed. Yeah, correct. Yes So where does that land in our? 10-year capital improvement list that push everything back now a year or Well that portion we'd have to determine I guess what the happens with the budget in future years and unspent dollars one-time monies potentially there's different options or Other savings from other projects that we might be able to look at so we'll continue to evaluate what those options are When one further question, I think it was just at the last meeting We're talking about improvements on West Sacramento and Warner Street and I know they were pretty small compared to full reconstructions going on And this is probably a lot of this was done before that direction But is that included in the budget or do you have the funds in order to pursue that? We don't have that included in the budget because those were all being worked on. I think we have some strategies we're working on and looking at some partners that might be able to Achieve that and so we'll be coming back to City Council I don't we all have a date at this current time, but I would definitely come back to City Council for consideration. Yeah, that's good. Thanks Okay Um just to Clarify so the 10-year capital improvement program projects are not directly included in your department's budget, right? They're their own thing Sorry say that again the 10-year the the CIP the 10-year Projects yeah that is included in there. And so we kind of forecast out because again What we do is slow and we recognize that it takes a long time to go through design phases and environmental and right-of-way and all that kind of stuff and so we are effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively s right. it would be under the capital improvement program in the future years. another question we' re talking about the 20th street improvements and how the scope has been scaled down and similar to the question what do you anticipate it will cost us to delay projects as the cost will escalate in the future? we have our annual inflation numbers we typically experience in construction. Sometimes those variables are affected by the time we bid a project and the amount of other work and the industry in our region and how hungry contractors are. Again we will continue to evaluate funding opportunities and where we can get those and evaluate as bids come in what the unit prices we tend to see are. great. I think last question is for the board. related to that. You touched on this. I' m seeing a gap in our ability to fund 20th street and potentially other projects. Do you think we will be able to secure grant funds or find other ways to fund these projects in the future if we continue to have to move funds around and maybe fall short of our goals? what I know for sure is there are a lot of opportunities for maintenance related components. Probably not very likely candidate for grant funding opportunities. However, there are other projects that do certain improvements that meet guidelines and objectives of certain programs. We' re always looking to leverage local funds as much as we can as a match to get bigger pots of money. We' ve been very successful at that over the years. During my tenure as a city council member I evaluating different funding programs and opportunities. thank you. The city has been really successful at getting active transportation program funds and other funds. I' m hopeful even if we were to see our revenues continue to be flat hopefully we can find some ways to fix our roads and have some good new projects. thanks. absolutely. I just had $100 million in three years. Wow amazing. Kudos to you and the whole staff that' s awesome. Bidwell roundabout I have heard from people that live in that area and it' s game changer coming and going from that time of day in the morning. People who were suspect of what it was going to do and said it' s absolutely definitely helping over there. I would like to this is off the budget is that the bicycle overpass we' re doing is that going to be painted? I see in the picture it' s pretty silvery color but it' s brown. at the end of the day we evaluated that during production and that' s a patina stain that protects the steel better and doesn' t have the same kind of maintenance requirements like a requirements like the guard rail and highway 32. It' s going to stay the color. Currently there' s a lighting package. s on purpose. It' s on purpose and it actually protects the steel. My last question is on the slide you showed for the esplanade project if you want to go back you have to but see those pretty green lines that go across there are we going to be eventually effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively! I know it' s in process. as beautiful and amazing as our esplanade is it has certain engineering challenges with the side drives and how traffic circulation and operations coordinate with one another. I have gotten a ton of compliments and people have specifically brought up the fence. It looks awesome. I think that' s all I have. Did I trigger something? thank you very much. Thank you. One more. You mentioned the long-term staffing shortage. Is that just the senior engineer positions that are still vacant? For multiple years it' s been a real challenge. Just in the industry in general finding licensed engineers with that 15 to 20 years of experience they' re unicorns in the industry. The senior development engineer we' ve had open since before I was here. Our senior civil engineer has been about a two plus year vacancy. Continuing to evaluate applications and applicants and dig into our network of professionals that we could recruit here. We haven' t found it yet but we continue to strive to fill those spots. Pretty soon our junior engineers are going to level up. Exactly. We' ve got some really good ones in house. That might be where we go. That' s a question to me. Would you say that the salary we' re offering for those positions are up to industry standard? I believe so. I think the recent enhancements and recent years has put us definitely in that highly competitive range. I think it' s more a reflection of just supply and demand. There' s more of a demand than there' s a supply. We' re trying to create culture. Again, Chico is getting on the map with the types of projects and the amount of projects we' re doing. We' re trying to leverage that and find good people that want to come back to Chico or whatever if they went to college here and find those great professionals to come enhance our team. All right. Thank you very much. Thank you. Do we have human resources and risk management? No, we already did those. That is the end of the presentation. That' s what I thought. Do we have any speakers? We do. We have two. Will they get their full three minutes then? Let' s see. Elizabeth Devereaux followed by Eric Nolson. I think Elizabeth is gone. I don' t see Eric. I think they both left together earlier. In lieu of that, thanks to the people who did stick out the whole time. Way to go. Well done. Thank you. Thank you. All right. Budget resolution. Mr. Sorensen. That is it. It' s budget resolution time. Either as is or any adjustments that council would like to make. Councilmember van overbeck will start down here and I' ll go that way. I went this way last time. I want to compliment the city manager, especially director martin. And the staff for really great presentations. And well done budget document. Really well done. I only have one small change I would like to see. And that is to move the from the deferred capital projects. There' s an item for trail design in the park. It' s $41,000. I don' t know how many of you hike much in the park. But especially in the upper park. The people are cutting switchbacks and making their own trails. It' s a problem with vegetation. It' s a problem with erosion. We really need to address. There' s also some safety issues on the south rim trail. There' e some big exposures. We need to get that in motion. And I would like to propose that we put that into the budget. And obviously something else has got to give. And the city manager is going to ask me what that is. And I don' t have a good answer for you. I don' t think in general. This was the case last year. There was a certain council member who is no longer here who wanted us to specify what to defund in order to fund something we want to see. And I think the city manager can make a good recommendation generally on that. And I think it' s appropriate to just ask for him to find the money. I have a question. Is the lack of the $41,000 the reason that it is not getting done? If we allot it, would that allow it to get done? Is it within the scope and ability of time? Is that the question? I would look to you, Eric. The question is. So he wants to put the $41,000 in. Is the lack of not having $41,000 the reason the job is not getting done? Or do you not have staffing and ability and the ability to do that? I would like to ask you to give us a little bit of a general idea of what the $41,000 would be and the people that are ready to get it done. Currently it would be a bandwidth issue for us. We would hire a consultant to do a master trails plan. A very comprehensive plan. And then an implementation piece of that as well. So the $41,000 would be just for hiring the consultant? And implementation. And implementation. Is that what you were thinking, Mr. Van Overbeck? Yes. Okay. All right. Any. I will say, too, that once we have that, we will have a plan. We will have a master plan that would also make certain projects ripe for grant funding as well. So it' s good to have that plan and be able to submit it with a grant application to do a lot of the work. So I just wanted to add that in there. Okay. Is that it for you? Yes. Okay. Council member holly? Yeah. I just really admire Ms. Martin and Mr. Sorensen's financially sound policy. I was reading in the news the other day my hometown of San Diego is facing a 200 and a half million dollar financial crisis. We are in a 49 million dollar deficit at the moment and I don' t think a lot of other cities are in as good a position as we are and that' s in part largely in part thanks to the very competent staff that we have. Simultaneously, though, I ran and was elected to this position because living in the heart of Chico for the past six, seven years, I' ve noticed a really drastic difference in services. I think that' I think it' been a little bit more difficult to run in certain parts of Chico compared to others. So I' m going to maintain my advocacy for the core. I do think that having engine one staffed is something I didn' t recognize when I was running for election. And now that it' s been brought to my attention, I' m having trouble to immediately support the budget as it stands at the moment because of that, especially with the barber yard project being We have a lot of people that are coming up. It' s just the most populous part of town, there' s already been so many cases that the fire department has faced where we just don' t have the capacity to respond to the need that the city has. So I know how enormous of an ask that is. Two and a half million is an enormous amount of money. But I think honestly, some time might help us put the power in the hands of the city and the city itself. puzzle pieces together. I told miss martin yesterday when I walked into her office that I exude ignorance on the subject. Of course it' s a language to continue learning. And every time she talks about this I learn a little bit more and more. But part of that ignorance that I' m trying to figure out is where that money is coming from. Just like how my colleagues were talking about. So it' s hard for me to say we need to take money from here, here, here. Because so many of these funds we can' effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively I first want to compliment our city staff what a great group of employees we have from our department directors all their staff to our city manager really outstanding and to take a very complicated process and give us a finished product is outstanding and I want to compliment them that' s number one. Number two I also ran on a public safety platform and I will not back down from that platform I will always support public safety first that' s for our community. So I like you council member holly want to do something that supports our fire department right now fire danger has changed whether we like it or not it just has changed even as shortly as when I was chief of police so I would like to find some way to at least start the process of funding engine one some seed money something towards that end so at least start that process and get that engine staffed I don' t know what that exactly looks like of course the million dollar question or 2.5 million dollar question is how do we fund that so I think we need to look at some answers as to how we could actually fund that even if it' s partially right now but I think that' s an extremely important thing for our community right now like I said fire danger has changed but I think we need to look at change it just has and we need to support our fire department right now. council member winslow. just one maybe procedural thing on this as we' re talking about this two things one is I just said I don' t think we need to give direction for exactly how we find like $45,000 city manager can ask department heads to come up with the best reductions in order to support that but when it comes to 2.5 million dollars operating we probably should have a little bit more money coming in. effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively have to delay this one meeting without putting us off schedule. that is true. thank you. did you have another question? vice mayor bennett. that nod makes a big difference in talking about this. I do support both councilor holly and councilor o'brien' s concern. I will say concern about engine one and I will support both of their ideas that maybe we can look at this a little closer and find something. since you nodded that I will take that as an approval that we can look at it. I' m not saying we can be there or do something but I would like to look at it. I lend my support as well. thank you. thank you. council member bannoverbeck. thank you madam mayor. of course we want to we need that engine at some point. we' re in a situation where revenues are flat and we have to make choices. I have a question I want to clarify something that councilor o'brien said and a question for you chief. my understanding is that the the engine is not the cost of the the cost of the engine is we need six people we need six staff to staff that engine. it' s not the cost of the engine so much as the $2.5 million a year to pay those six people. in my mind it' s a binary thing we have the people and the engine is staffed or we don' t. am I thinking about this the right way or is there some incremental change in the budget? it was one of the options I presented last year was to hire three fte's firefighters and we would staff engine four and that would give us additional capacity and then in a subsequent year hire another three and then we would fund engine one with the appropriate staffing and the positions. thank you. thank you. thank you. re saying half staff this year and then full. basically we would make another four person engine right now we have two the truck with four engine five with four and then we still have one floater position available to us to relieve four sick leave. what do we give up to do that there' e no free lunches? the funding that would require second or third or fourth or that third engine with four. we need six people right? we wouldn' t get engine one with that incremental step. we would hire the people but we wouldn' t have the engine? we would have the engine correct and to your point yes it' s a binary decision if the only expectation is to go after engine one then we have to hire the six fte' s to make that happen. thank you. now vice mayor bennett. now that you' re taking a drink. you' re good? council member Wenzel did you have something else? i could i don' t know how far down this we want to get and how close we can get to funding this he' s talking about incremental approach. i think we all have sort of perspective on this. as distinct from the operational expenses it comes with hiring new personnel these are things we get done and it' s done until it falls apart again. i' m certainly concerned to see we' re slowing down on that and the enthusiasm for having measure h is waning a little bit and we' re filling it up with operational expenses in particular some of the staffing increases we had and pay increases for the police department that are soaking up a lot of those funds. when it comes to how would we get the money for either new firemen to staff this engine or shoring up our engineering budget in order to follow through on those projects the only place that i see first one that comes to my mind is the unfilled cso positions that right now i know it' s stretching the sworn officers thinner not having those and part of the point was to free up their time for doing more of their core duties but that' s the only place that i see a little bit of flex in it. we can' t cut the senior engineer positions that are still unfilled i didn' t see in any other department there being this sort of like the ability to do without something that' s being funded currently. so let' s make sure i' m clear on this question for the city manager we have one more meeting before we have to approve this or yeah okay so if we said because i' ve talked to you i' ve talked to barbara and i came to the conclusion that the money is just not there for engine one but i think it' make sure that we have a budget first three years but i would sure like to see it happen but if we said can you guys take another look at it and see if there' s a way to get there we would have time to do that and approve the budget on the june 3' d meeting? yes. okay. so i would agree with that approach let' s take a deeper dive let' s look at the options all the options and then come back let' s do that we still have time to do so but let' s take a deeper dive into this and make sure we' ve exhausted every option. do we need a motion to do that or can we give direction to have staff? i haven' t made a comment yet if we' re still doing that. i wasn' t done i was just asking if we need a motion. all right if it' s my turn. first i' m okay with taking a deeper dive and i' ll reiterate this i just want to make sure we' re focusing especially on funding our transportation network and i know everything if we add funding somewhere it has to come for somewhere else and so i want to make sure that we' re going about this very carefully but anyway first thank you to all of our department heads i like katie said there are a lot of cities that are really struggling to fund their basic needs and not get deeper into a hole so i' m really appreciative that we can talk about how to best fund our city and how to make sure that we have a better future for our city and our community. effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively re still following behind on our commitment to fixing our streets and roads and we made that commitment to the voters when they approved measure h. They were told this is our hope for continuing to catch up on fixing our streets and roads and creating a better transportation network while also funding other public safety priorities. I' m a little concerned by the drop in expected revenue and seeing a lot of measure h funds be shifted. I understand again give and take between different departments and different funding sources but I' m worried about the capital improvement program falling short on roadway projects including 20th street west of the freeway and it' s hard to start to tell my constituents who are concerned about other roads like humboldt ave we got emails about that it' s hard to make any promises that will make progress on that. That' s a really high priority for me biggest challenge for me is figuring out how we can make sure as we grow as a city we can fund everything we need for public safety for fire and for our streets. With growing fire danger in a growing community fire department is incredibly important as all of us are discussing but also access on our transportation system is also necessary in a community at risk of wildfire even within our community. we have to make tough choices and we need to weigh our priorities for all departments equally and consider what the voters are counting on us to do with their tax dollars especially for measure h. I think I would be in the minority to suggest any significant changes to this budget but thanks to the folks who reached out to us to speak on their concerns with how we' re allocating funds and the things they would like to see us do. I wanted to know there were those two speakers who couldn' t make it and I had met with them previously I wanted to know I know they were here to speak on potential funding for the park avenue study that was brought up previously that will be a future agenda item but they had spoken to me about trying to look for sources within our budget to be able to fund planning for priorities here I' m not sure there would be a way to work that in but I wanted to elevate that because I knew that group is working on it. I would support a budget that more fully funds our roads, fire, planning, the arts and more and this looks to me like planning for neighborhoods and corridors including a study to revitalize park avenue and the wedge ensuring transportation projects are funded as has been would support planning for future projects like humbled avenue park avenue and investing in the arts and I support the ideas that the rest of our council has proposed but I also want to state I wouldn' t support any further reduction in the use of measure h funds from our transportation system. thanks. can I respond to something council person goldstein I want to repeat something that director blatt said earlier. I would like to say that we have a budget of $100 million in road construction contracts that is unprecedented so before we got a council that was how shall I say oriented philosophically more like me than like you we' re spending something like four or five times as much annually on road construction. I mean it' s an order of magnitude difference in the amount we' re catching up. we' re doing better than that we' re doing a great job but by the nature of these projects you can' t do everything at once they' re long term projects. thank you. all right anybody else are you good? okay so direction given to relook at the relook at the relook to see where you can rob ll look at that at the next meeting and go from there. just to check on what to anticipate the next meeting you' re going to come up with another alternative budget we can weigh the two from current draft versus draft number two? I think it would be isolated to if fire engine one was to be funded in one way or another either the option one or option two that the chief came up with what that looks like in terms of cost. I would like to see that in the what we have been doing and then as we said that will have to come from somewhere and unfortunately it' s not just a capital expense it' s forever or pretty close to forever once you go up with the incremental staffing you go up with incremental staffing along with the overtime and all of the costs that go along with it. that would have to be offset from somewhere. finance they have both a rabbit and a hat in barbara' s office. and barbara' s is amazing. I was thinking of digging for treasure in somebody' s backyard. council member holly. one more question for staff. going back to the point of we cannot just find funding from any fund. it has to come from specific places. when we revisit the budget item at our next meeting are we to expect multiple different options a diverse array of options of where that money is coming from is that what our next meeting is going to look like? we will have to think about that. I' m not sure how many different ways we could spin it. if I know our staff and if I know our city manager we will probably have a report in our e-mail well before the meeting for us to review. thank you. different options would be great. I wouldn' t want to have us look at something where we' re torn between we really love how this part of it is done but this needs to be tweaked and then we go on for more meetings. and then to add more complexity to the already complex picture just to get through this budget we did push off initial payments on a replacement engine. we' re still looking to how we would build station number 6. we need to look forward to replacement of fire station 2. it' s beyond its useful life. it' s physically too small. it' s on a parcel that' s too small. and then we have the persistent problem of a police facility. those are all things to throw into the hopper. absolutely. and that' s just one department. that' s fire. we got the same in many other departments. I think direction is given and we will look forward to what you have. we' re going to recess to close session. council will recess to close session to discuss public employee appointment for city attorney believe in chico versus city of chico labor negotiations for cpoa cpsa local 39 and chico fire thank you. I' m believing chico. so noted for tom. and any speakers for closed session? no. no speakers. we are adjourned and we will be back at 6 o'clock. thank you. thank you. thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem As I said no final action was taken there. For item 2.4 conference with legal counsel existing litigation in the warren matter due to time constraints the council did not have time to discuss this item that will be brought back at another meeting. That concludes my report. thank you. Consent agenda all matters listed under the consent agenda are considered routine in nature and therefore be enacted with one motion. Do we have any council disqualifications? I got a no vote in the poll. A no vote on which one? The abandoned barbecues out there. 2.2 that is. I also wanted to poll 2.5. Poll 2.5. Before we go any further were we going to do the presentation that goes before? Darn it. To get to the consent agenda. Can we have a presentation? Mr. Gustafson you want to kick us off? And Amber I think is. Sorry about that. I will go ahead and Good evening again Mayor and vice mayor and council appreciate the opportunity to speak to you tonight. This is a quick presentation between myself and the site operator for genesis executive director of the cheesus center Amber Abney bass. This is a third year anniversary update. We like to do these after every year. The year terms for genesis April to April. We opened it up in April 2022. This is the third year update that we are providing tonight. We are going to be doing Quickly I will review a couple of slides on overview budget cleaning public spaces. Some of our renewed outreach and engagement efforts and of course the genesis site operator report. This is a picture right before the site opened on April 23, 2022 before any occupants arrived. This photo this aerial was taken several weeks ago the beginning of this month. You can see not much has changed. Sometimes there is a low and sometimes there is personal storage and things like that we find outside of the units. The site operator has done a great job in keeping the area clean and organized. Impressive considering on average there is around 200 people per night on average and 100 dogs which is always outstanding to me that s managed quite well with 100 dogs and 200 people on any given night. I wanted to review the budget and again the annual year that we are looking back April to April spans two fiscal years for us. We are looking at two different fiscal years so it' s a little difficult to capture but this is what we have budgeted for site operations each year and will land on where we are coming in this last third year. We have a lot of work to do and For the outreach and engagement staff and genesis maintenance staff we budget about 422,000. We originally had several o and e staff members allocated for this and two senior maintenance workers in our public works o and m crews. We found we have been able to manage o and e with one person. Of course with oversight from the jesus center and then we are able to support genesis from a maintenance perspective with one Our contracted services we have budgeted in the worst case scenario about $4.2 million and we have been significantly coming in lower each year and we will talk about it further on another slide we have sourced the laundry and shower services which has created a lot of savings and that' s where you see those numbers units that are used frequently and a c unit that is used frequently and that' s where you see that uptick. All in all this third year we are about 27% in our budget we have saved about $1.3 million from what we budgeted as a worst case scenario. Point being in those slides we want to make sure the council and the public know we are doing everything we can in step with our site operator to make sure we are doing everything everything we can to make sure we are doing everything we can. cleaning public spaces and of course our deployment model continues there it' s slightly different now we have been at this for a few years the encampments we come across are much smaller but we still come across encampments and as we mentioned in the budget session we' re still in experiencing a bit of a rinse and repeat situation from those that are service resistant are resistant from the services being offered to them through the outreach and engagement process. This is just another shot of what we typically come across this is Comanche creek wind chime which has been impacted probably seven or eight times we have had seven or eight clean up operations and enforcement operations at wind chime. Depot park. years in total we removed 2,740 cubic yards or 418 tons of debris. Again smaller than the numbers we were seeing and experiencing the first year or two but still a significant amount of debris we' re cleaning from public spaces. During that time during 2024 we provided 100 individual assessments offering suitable shelter to re still working with the fire department who have been previously assessed returning to the areas already enforced and cleaned. It continues to be a challenge for us at this point. Plaintiff' s council is always a challenge as far as objections and things of that nature and that' s always a tough road to manage as well. Of challenge for us to manage. Total the three years we have been at this we have assessed 614 people and removed 3,138,642 pounds of trash from public spaces. So we kind of had a slide mix up here when I loaded it looks like these two slides got mixed up but just wanted to kind of talk briefly before I hand it over to amber on our focus for this upcoming year. We will continue to engage those that are service resistant and make sure we' re providing opportunities for those folks to get into shelter and out of the public space. And then really something we' re going to focus on as mentioned in the budget presentation is the alternate site on eaton and cohasset. We' re working with the site epi at genesis to maybe increase services there as far as case management. Increase visits of other service providers there' s other service providers that also visit the alternate site. We' re going to try to land on the re also preparing the same process and procedure for rules enforcement that' s currently taking place at genesis. Verbal warnings, written warnings and ultimately a sequence of four or five of those and it' s a departure situation. We hope that increased management will really help the situation out there and allow us to get our hands around it and manage it a little bit better. And with that I' ll turn it over to our site operator miss amber abney bass. councilmember bennett. opportunity to talk. Are you encountering the same people over and over again? of course. In the latest enforcement it' s about an 80-20 situation where 80% of the folks that have already received an individual assessment and 20% of the folks there we have not seen before. you' re offering assistance and help and everything we have to offer in our community every time you make contact with them. correct. the target does. and we will be able to help them we revisit the individual assessment and where they were assessed and as long as capacity is still there there' s an option to go. thank you. good evening. mayor, vice mayor, council. all right. so one of the things I try to do in this presentation is really try to give a good picture of the type of we have a lot of folks that are accessing services out at the site and also let you know what we' re doing and who our partners are. I tried to trim this down and make it as efficient as possible. I know you all have had a long day to this point. as Mr. Gustafson mentioned we do have some updated images of the site. I know that the site has it' s uniquely positioned where there isn' t always a lot of opportunity for the public to see what goes on back there which leads to a lot of intrigue and questions. I took these two images on Monday or the day after. website when I was out at the site. I wanted to update those. just a brief overview for folks who are not quite familiar with this project that haven' t been immersed in it as we have been for the last three years. the site is 177 noncongregate units. we only shelter adults at the site which means we do not shelter minors nor do we shelter unaccompanied minors. as Mr. Gustafson mentioned our site is a low barrier model. we have a!!! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem to Genesis this is the language that was used in the Warren v Chico settlement I think this does a really nice job of setting a tone for what it is we are able to do out there and what we are not and then of course the behavior base just suggests just that come out here behave in this manner good things happen struggle or choose to not behave in that manner and that's when we start talking about that departure in that punitive process well that's a right-click I also want to talk about our key partners we have a lot of partners that come out into the site that has made this site successful of course our partners over at Butte County behavioral health director Kennelly's team has shown up in a variety of ways they have all sorts of teams in total I believe there are five different teams now that throughout the week come out to the site really attempt to connect with the community and to the community and to the community and to the community and to the podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem and the home health team. Really critical to free up the beds that we know our community needs so desperately post camp fire so they are a critical partner. I want to acknowledge haven of hope on wheels as Mr. Gustafson mentioned we did in source laundry and shower trailers that was effective 10-1 this year but through September 30 of 2024 our partner at haven and hope was the contracted provider for shower and laundry services so I want to acknowledge the contributions they have made to the site as well. Ampla health is there with their mobile medical unit attempting to connect these folks to primary care providers and providing basic health screening and services. We have weekly meetings from narcotics anonymous and with our community and large number of dogs and cats previously reported bird but the bird has since checked out. We have the major clinic that comes in regularly and that is staffed with a retired vet who utilizes donated products through a nonprofit the major clinic to provide some of those critical services on site. All right. So I think it is people always want to know who is out there what does that look like this is I think this is a breakdown of the age of people accessing the site. The blue columns will let you know year 3 the green columns are cumulative for the entire three years of operations. A couple of things to note on this slide number 1 as you can see in the year of operations 3 that we are talking about the site served 294 unique individuals. So you can see a breakdown. jumped out to me that I just want to address is that 24 to 44 age population that represents 57% of the folks this year that have accessed that site. I think the instinct is to feel like these are capable younger folks that have the greatest chance of reentry perhaps through job readiness connecting to some of those other service providers you know they are sort of younger that would associate with opportunity. I wanted to say that out loud it is very flat we have always represented that age group has always represented 57% of the folks who have access that site since opening so not a lot of change there. I think we will see more information as we get deeper into the data.! The other piece is the 55 and over category that represents 18% this year which is down 1% to date from the 19. Pretty typical generally speaking 60% of people experiencing homelessness are single males. So this slide does not surprise me very much in line with what we are seeing not only in our state but also across the country. Race and ethnicity information. This is the slide that really talks about some of those challenges that I think we hear some of our other partners talking about which is the disabled component, chronic health conditions and also mental health disorders. For those of you who have not had an opportunity the new point in time study was released yesterday and this year's study we asked a follow-up question that said does the instance of these conditions impact your ability to get work, to get housing and those sorts of things. And so I just wanted to make sure that we see here how complicated some of these folks are. It is really about more than just the age that they are representing. This is a big one. We talk about this a lot. I know that there is a lot of concern with the site being low barrier. The rate of drug and alcohol use this slide shows. This slide will tell you these are self-reported. This is self-reported data. So what that means is that sometimes people feel more inclined to share and in other places they will feel less inclined to share. I just want to mention that this information particularly around substance use is something that people tend to under report just for lack of comfort when they are engaged in these conversations and being asked these questions. Nonetheless 51% of the folks we have talked to have had a chronic This is a very consistent 50% so far for all of the three years of operations. This also tells you about the complexity of the folks that are in that site. You can see here most of the people reporting chronic homelessness. Really wanted to break that down so that you could see what does chronic homelessness mean, how many times and how many times, bless you, Katie, that they have had an episode of this. I will just say that there is also a question sort of about where do folks come from. I just want to show people here that 273 of the folks that have come in this year have come from a place that was not meant for human habitation. There is going to be public encampments, perhaps vehicles. We have a lot of folks that are in vehicles. So I just wanted to just really drive home that the intention of this space to bring people in who are effectively effectively! The critical services on the site mentioned 29 94 unique individuals this year the site so far has served 4 25 individuals to date 33 8 case management appointments this year that represents effectively 151 unique individuals. So as you can see from that, we have a very low rate of engagement in case management. In the low barrier model, that is something that you cannot require that service, but I would absolutely argue that that shows up in the outcomes of the site. Low barrier is important. I think that being able to meet people where they are and bring them into services, into shelter, is very critical in order for them to start a recovery trajectory in their life, but also I have a mean argument against why we shouldn't keep people there. So the services that we talked about, as of 10-1, we have on-site laundry and shower trailers. In that small window of time, my team out there has provided very robust numbers of showers and laundry. Part of that is because with the low barrier model, we have a very low rate of engagement in case management. So that's something that we have to be aware of. We have a very low rate of engagement in case management. On-site management, we were actually able to expand the hours of showers. We actually now have showers and laundry from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m., where the previous operator was limited to 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. So we definitely are seeing people take advantage of that. This talks about how long people are coming and staying at the site. I don't want to spend a whole lot of time talking about it, but I do think it's an important illustration to just show that there is a very good number of people that are coming out, and they are taking up the service. And utilizing it. We always talk about departures. This, again, is, I think, one of those places that people feel like it's a little bit mysterious, and they fill in the blanks. But I just want to address this. The most common reason that people leave the site is that they fail to return. There is a condition in their occupancy that states if they leave the site for 72 hours, they don't notify the site operator. These are folks that, you know, we're not aware. If they're experiencing a lot of junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk! The other one that you see on there is the consent to share recall. We cannot require people to share units. They certainly maintain the ability to remove their consent when that happens. 64 square feet is not a lot of space to share with another human. And when conditions arise that that is their desire, we honor those. And nine times this year, those have been recalled. Second to failing to return, we have unit inspection failures. We have an incredibly robust inspection process. When people come in for the first six weeks, their unit is inspected once a week. Then they convert to a once-a-month inspection. At any time somebody fails a once-a-month inspection, they revert back to a weekly inspection. When somebody fails four consecutive inspections, there is a reset option. Okay. There is some grace in there. But when somebody has to fail four consecutive inspections before they are departed from the site. So I just want to make that really clear. I know that there is a lot of narrative out there that we are quick to depart people, that people return to street-level homelessness as a result of limitations on their personal belongings and such. But I want to assure you, it is not easy to depart people from the site around these reasons. My staff does a tremendous job coaching. Encouraging. Joining people side by side. And really trying to get them to the finish line to stay in the site. And as I mentioned, we do have a process in which people can reset. But it continues to be a challenge. And then we also have a good number of folks who have left the site as a result of behavioral violations. And, you know, 30 people is actually, while it is the third largest reason, it is still an incredibly small portion of folks that are leaving. And so I do. I do just want to make that comment. I know there's a lot of folks that say that they won't go in there because of rules and whatnot. And I think that we have a good number of people that are going in there and are really adjusting and making it work. The most common question that we get, I think, across all of our programming, and is certainly the burning question about this site to many, is the exits to housing. And I just wanted to bring this slide up so that you can see the Genesis site, but also Jesus Center operations as a whole for some comparison. The Genesis site has led 34 individuals exiting to housing in the last three years. That represents 12% of the people who have come in. That is three years of operations in a low barrier setting with no length of stay. Just some really brief bullet points to be able to understand the differences in these programs. At the Jesus Center and our Sabbath House program, we have four years of operations since we renovated and relocated to Fair Street. That is a recovery-focused program. There's a six-year program. That is a six-month length of stay. We have served 248 individuals, and 40% of that population has exited to housing. At the Renewal Center, the family shelter, we opened that in September, September 13th of 2023. So we have served 85 individuals. Of the people we've served, 85 individuals have exited to housing, which represents 51% of those seeking services. Again, been open over there for 18 months. That is a low barrier model, and there is a six-month program stay for emergency shelter. The other half of that site is the senior shelter. That shelter opened in July of 2024, so we are only 10 months into operations, which really means we're through our first real cycle of those six-month stays. We have had 14 people exit to housing, which represents 23%. We anticipate that number continuing to increase in the month of May so far. We have already exited nine people from Renewal Center into housing. Senior side is also low barrier in six months. So for those of you who are sort of wondering the idea about why there could potentially be this improvement regarding the exits to housing around that service or that engagement, why I keep talking about the importance of relationships and case management, that slide was intended to really connect that for you. So what are we looking ahead to for this year? In year four? In year four, none of you may have noticed, but this particular report is quite the tongue twister because it's 425 of 24 to 424 of 25. I don't know how many times I said that out loud while I was working on this. But year four, the things that we're going to talk about is addressing care avoidance. That is the terminology regarding the folks who are choosing to not come into the incredibly robust set of services that we have put together out there. We want to increase that case management engagement. The other one is to proactively build staffing that specifically includes drug and alcohol specialties. It is not lost on me that 51% of folks reporting drug, alcohol, or co-occurring drug and alcohol use, that we need to do something out there and bring people on staff that have the ability not only to inform our just general shelter staff, but also to be working very closely with folks out there so that we can get people out there. And that is the goal, again, on that trajectory to recovery. We're also working on expanding volunteer opportunities for occupants. We did launch a program last month where we have a volunteer application that's gone out for folks who want to engage and do some things around the site. And we had a very positive response on that. And that concludes my presentation. And if you guys have any questions, I'm happy to answer them. All right. Any questions on this end? Council Member Hawley? I'm just curious about the volunteer opportunities on site, what exactly that entails. Is it caretaking to the laundry or shower facilities, or what are you guys thinking? Yeah, I think that we're looking at contributing. Our laundry team actually, the laundry and shower team actually has two former occupants of the shelter, one who has moved out and one who is in the process of moving out. And that created an opportunity for them to get full-time. And we're looking at that as a way to make sure that they have a stable employment. And so my hope is that we can use that as a throughput for other folks at the site, start in volunteering. We have one of those folks who's out right now with a, getting a medical treatment. So the idea that they could step in there, get familiar, and then when those folks move on, they could step in and then transition into employment. Showers, laundry, I think that there's a bunch of possibilities. We have a list that we've created with staff, but we're looking at all options. Thank you. Council Member Vance? So I have a statement. A fabulous job. I mean, these things work because they're managed well. And you're a great example of that. Thank you. The question is, are the occupants required to work to offset their cost? I mean, doing maintenance around the place, cleaning it up. Do they have the opportunity to do that or are they required to do that? No. That is not something that was included in the settlement agreement in the terms of the site. That is why we developed the volunteer option, but there is not currently a requirement for folks to contribute to their stay. Thank you. Yep. All right. Anybody on this side? No. All right. Thank you. Thank you for the information. Thank you. Now can I go to the consent? Yes. All right. So we have a council disqualification. We have a no. We're pulling five. How many speakers do we have on consent? We have four on consent. Okay. Three minutes each. All right. Okay. I'll call the first two speakers. If you could line up in the middle aisle. Allison Boyer, followed by Greg Scott. Hello, everyone. For those of you who I haven't met yet, my name is Allison Boyer. I'm the new manager of DCBA downtown. I'm very happy to be here. I just wanted to voice DCBA's support of CARD with the ice rink. We think it's an incredible initiative that brings a lot of people downtown for business, culture, and engagement. And from a community standpoint, someone who grew up here, it's amazing to see downtown so lively and interactive in this great winter event. That was really all. Keep it short and sweet. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. Greg Scott, followed by Lori Monroe. Hi, guys. I just want to echo what basically Allison just said. I didn't realize it was on the consent agenda. It was 2.5. But anyway. Anecdotally, I can tell you that last year the ice rink was extremely well managed and the people that came down, even though we had weather problems, the downtown area was vibrant from 2 o'clock in the afternoon until 10 o'clock at night almost every night. You saw kids skating in the rain. But with the CARD's programs and all of the things that they brought together, I think them having the ability to do a three-year contract with the provider makes all the sense in the world and to take advantage of what the city's already purchased and let it go forward. Thank you. Thank you. Lori Monroe, followed by Bruce McLean. Mayor, Vice Mayor, City Council. I just wanted to bring an alternate viewpoint to the issue of the ice rink. My concern is that it costs several hundred thousand dollars for each year, and that's precious general fund money. And although it does all the wonderful things that the previous speaker, mentioned, there's other ways that that money can be spent that can also do the same things. Meanwhile, the city plaza is blocked off and other community groups are unable to use it for whatever they would be using it for. Those activities also would bring in people to downtown to spend money at businesses as well. So I don't see it as a win-win. I have some concerns because of the cost. I'm not saying it's a good idea to spend it on the arts budget. Like, the arts budget is almost non-existent, and this one gets several hundred thousand dollars. I'm not saying you should spend it on the arts budget. I'm just giving it as an example of another area where it could be spent. And I also have some concerns because all the users of the ice rink have to pay a fee. And I think the city of Chico has done a really great job of having fee-free services. Like, Sycamore Pool and the park. And we all enjoy them a lot. And I would like to see the city aim for those kind of events. Thanks. Thank you. Bruce McLean is our last speaker. Yeah. In previous discussions about the ice rink with the former council, I expressed some concerns. One concern that I had was... What effect it would have on Paradise's long-standing ice rink. And I was assured, actually, by the former mayor, I think it was, that they were continuing and that there'd be no effect. Well, they've stopped doing theirs, so there obviously has been an effect. But if we're going to proceed with it, I would very much appreciate it if the entire park were not fenced. I would like to see the park be fenced off. We have one or two public restrooms in downtown Chico. And I see no reason why one of the two restrooms should be sealed and made inaccessible. So I'd like you to take that into consideration if you decide to go ahead with this. Thanks. Thank you. So that's it on consent. Okay. I'll consider a motion. Thank you. Thank you. On everything else except for 2.5? I'll move to approve. Second. And that's with the no vote on 2.2. Thank you. I was going to check on that. So that was item 2.2, and that was Councilmember Winslow, 2.2? Okay. Thank you. All right. Councilmember Goldstein? Aye. Aye. Councilmember Hawley? Yes. Councilmember O'Brien? Yes. Councilmember Van Overbeck? Yes. Councilmember Winslow? Yes. Vice Mayor Bennett? Yes. Mayor Reynolds? Aye. Carry 7-0. All right. 2.5. Councilmember Winslow? Thank you. Yes. This ice rink, you know, we've been looking, doing it on a year-by-year basis. We're looking at a three-year contract. It's never been a consent item in any time it's been discussed. The city's subsidizing it, that is. I think we all agree that it's really nice to see all the people. We've seen a lot of people come downtown, that a lot of people get use out of it. I do want to apply some historical reference to it, that when this first did come up, I have a quote from the former city manager. They said it will at least break even in 2021. And then every year we come back and we find that it is running a large deficit. So we're looking at committing about $240,000 a year in order to keep this running. And there are always different reasons why it doesn't break even. You know, it rains in the winter, right? As if this is a surprise to anybody. And this interrupts them. And effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively enough space to go around this ice rink and I think I would like to understand we have some conditions we' re not going to block the sidewalks again I think in recent years we have narrowed the fencing a little bit the idea of maintaining the bathrooms open feels appropriate to me but additionally as Mr. Scott mentioned the city has put significant investment to this ice rink in the first place in order to lower the cost overall prep it equipment stuff the training that has already occurred so we have committed a lot to this as it is. While I have different feelings about whether this ranks in our priorities we just had a budget discussion we have a lot of things we' re not able to fund I personally can' t justify committing $240,000 a year to make sure that happens I would like to have a conversation about trying to secure that funding elsewhere looking at card to help split that. If we are funding this my first ask is that we talk with card about sharing the costs that are incurred. Secondly in terms of we are providing and this is also brought up by Ms. Monroe is since we are offering this as a benefit funded by the city' s general fund we can ensure a broader benefit to the parts of the community that struggle to pay to access this and that could be school kids who are going probably at non peak hours to not impact other operations so much for PE classes that we can make it available to them other events through groups like youth for change which I know card has great partnerships with that. I would like to say we can at least condition the offer that we will make it available to people free of cost at some points. could you speak to the budget that I' m looking at for 2425 shows a $19,000 deficit not hundreds of thousands of dollars. I see how it looks on the budget. I think it' s a good idea to have a part of the staff report. under fiscal impact. you' re right the numbers I have were the first year the net operating loss was $28,992. 2324 was $33,470. We don' t have this last season' s final numbers but expect it to be in that ballpark. or in that 19,000 ish range. 20 to 30. we will call it. I' m not talking hundreds of thousands a year. We' re talking 20 to $30,000 a year. when it' s all said and done that' s our annual start-up cost to get everything going. then card obviously derives some revenue and then repays the city. I just wanted to address the paradise comment. I don' t usually talk but I actually have had a specific conversation with a member of the and the mayor up there that came down here and supported our ribbon cutting and our thing. They have lost money every single year on their ice rink. It was never profitable to them. They saw it as a community service. This is what he told me. It was important to them. However, after the fire when they had a 16th of the population it It just never made sense for them to do it anymore. It happens that all happened about the same time we were getting ours up and going but it had nothing to do with the fact that chico had an ice rink which is why they' re not doing theirs anymore. I' m guessing as they rebuild and have population come back they will relook at doing that because they enjoyed that as having something for the community. I don' t see that and that' s not what was told to me. I think it' s very reasonable to assume that fencing should not encumber the city. The sidewalks we have assets there that need to be protected but sidewalks should be kept. if I could on that one I believe the time that did happen was because we were applying pesticides due to cockroaches and some systemic for some infestation on a tree. we couldn' t have humans in close proximity to those applications. it was up for months. vice mayor bennett. I will add to the mayor' s comments. The last year paradise had a rink it wasn' t ice. They didn' t use ice that year. They used an artificial surface which was a disaster. I think there' e extra additional considerations regarding paradise closing down their rink. with that to be said. is there. a quick comment. i. count. i. you guys are first. go ahead. one community comment I had received recently was basically a question of whether or not the city can look into contracting local businesses and make it more of a competitive thing than just contracting card and I don' t know but I wanted to throw that out there. council member o'brien. I think it' s important to note this is not going to cost us in the end $235,000 a year. It will be pretty close to breaking even and by the way we' re not trying to make money on this project we' re trying to enhance our downtown experience it' s well worth that little expenditure but it' s not going to cost us a quarter of a million dollars each year. I spent a lot of time downtown and I think it' ve never seen anything that got people as excited as this ice rink and it' s little kids and families. This has been in my mind a great success. Our downtown is in trouble and the last thing we need to do is to pull the plug on the ice rink that would be a really bad decision in my judgment. council member holly. I was going to comment I think there' s more nuance to this than perhaps everyone is giving credit to. I disagree that a municipality should fully run like a business if we ran it like a business we would always want to see profit on every single project but council member van overbeck just said there is a lot of validity to the capital that we bring to our downtown as it draws people in. We do have dcba events that surround downtown and we have a lot of people that are supporting the project. bring the holiday theme and draw more people into the ice rink and I' ve seen it super full and super fun before. I would say in the long run 20,000 as a loss on this project it just doesn' t seem that huge of a deal to me for what the community gets. Of course every municipal expense is a privilege and it' s a privilege I' I would say that we would have to give up 1 16th of a firefighter. Ms. Grimm is there anything you would like to add that we missed? If you don' t mind. Ms. Grimm is from card and is the operator. vice mayor and council members thank you so much for entertaining this request. I want to speak to a few things that I heard. First it is our intention to pay back the city's investment. scholarships and donations and things aren' t all timed within that period. It is like a rolling forward to pay back the city. It is our intention to pay back the city for its investment. Second to the youth organizations and to see the boys and girls club and youth for change we have partnered days and events where they come for free already. The other thing we changed last skate on Monday for five dollars. We also have a broad and actually expanding scholarship program so that we are improving access to some of our families that otherwise would not be able to attend. And so we learned a lot year one, even more year two. And so year three, we are planning a whole suite of offerings to be able to tap into different funding streams to make, to help settle down those fluctuations that we see. Because yes, it does rain and we do know that. We just hate when it rains on the weekend because that's our most profitable time. So any other questions for me? So you anticipate that the financials are going to be better this year? It'll fluctuate year to year. It really will just depend. So we will have to keep rolling the tally forward and sometimes we may be a little bit profitable and we may be able to pay back the contract right then. But sponsorships go for fiscal year, so it gets a little tricky with the winter season. All right. Thank you. Sorry to call you unannounced, but I wanted to clear up a few of those things because I had talked to you about a few of those and I knew a couple of those things. So if anyone would like to be a sponsor of the Downhand Plaza, I would consider a motion. I move to approve item 2.5. I just wanted to, I don't think I posed my comment earlier as a question because I wasn't sure who I was asking, but I just, because I don't necessarily have the history of us contracting card with this. I was wondering if there was any discussion previously of contracting businesses locally to run this in some form or if card has been kind of understood to be the only choice. I guess I can speak to that. So we first began the city operating system, and we had a lot of program that we had created the first year. We coordinated second year, DCBA ran it and then ultimately with card and the programs that they provide to the community as essentially a special district, it seemed most appropriate. I know they have received multiple quotes for the service of the ice rink itself and rentals and we have coordinated with them and you see the different programs that they bring to the table. So it seemed most appropriate given the programs and the people that they can reach in the community. I think the goal is to have a city that has a lot of experience and a lot of experience in the city to go with an operator such as card. The original goal is the city started it, but we know that that's not a service that we typically provide. We don't do programs like that. And so inevitably from day one the goal was always to transfer it to card. And I think they've been doing a great job and they've learned as Annabelle mentioned each year and it gets better and better. Okay, as long as it's getting better each year as far as not costing our city money, I just wanted to say thank you. I wanted to ask about this because I think that' s one opportunity to make sure we' re getting the best benefit from our cost is to potentially consider other operators. It sounds like people are comfortable with card. So mayor, I' m going to second council member van overbroek' s motion. Vice mayor, did you have something else? No, I' d second. Okay. I will just say in full disclosure I did have a conversation with one of the owners of the mayor of cal state. I think it was the mayor of cal state. And he did reference an interest in possibly assisting the city. That was way back when the city was doing it. I passed the information on that. But I don' t know where those conversations ended up. So that could be something that' s looked at in the future. And so I do know he knows that area and knows that area of expertise. So I did pass that information on to staff at that time. I had spoken with the owners a while ago and they were talking more about the cost of the I would like to say that the city is doing a lot of work in the context of the city is doing programs downtown to benefit downtown businesses. And there could be a broader reach of what the city is helping with to boost businesses and or involving businesses that aren' t located downtown in more of the things downtown. maybe we can connect them with card and they can get a twofer. They can dry skate and ice skate at the same time or something. I would like to see that. All right. So we have a motion and a second. Okay. Council member Goldstein. Aye. Council member holly. Yes. Council member o'brien. Yes. Council member van overbeck. Yes. Council member winslow. No. Vice mayor Bennett. Yes. Mayor Reynolds. Aye. It carries 6-1. And then for the record, I need to read the two titles of the ordinances on consent. I apologize. Item 2.1 was ordinance of the city council of the city of chico designating fire hazard severity zones as determined by the California department of forestry and fire protection pursuant to government code section 51178. It was final reading and adoption. And then item 2.2, ordinance of the city council of the city of chico amending title 9 public peace, safety and security. And then item 3.2, ordinance of the city council of chico amending the state of chico by adding section 9.35 outdoor warming appliances with open flame and section 9.36 outdoor barbecues and amending section 16.42.070 of the chico municipal code. Final reading and adoption. Thank you. So we got the executive summary this time, not the 10-minute version? Yes. Thank you. Great. Thank you. Public comment. Members of the public may address the council at this time on any matter that are not already listed on the agenda and within the jurisdiction of the city council. effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively!! podem podem effectively All right. Speech to the City Council on PFAS and Chico's water supply. Ladies and gentlemen of the City Council, thank you for allowing me to address you today on a pressing issue that not only affects our community, but also challenges our very health and safety, the contamination of our water supply by PFAS, and the actions of Sierra Nevada Brewing Company. PFAS, or P-chloro substance, represents a grave danger linked to severe health conditions such as cancer. This is not just a regulatory concern. It is a matter of life and death for the residents of Chico. As custodians of our community's resources, we need to prioritize the safety of our water supply and hold accountable those who jeopardize it for profit. In 2016, California initiated a program to ensure transparency in new projects through the CEQA network. However, in 2017, I observed construction of a well at Sierra Nevada Brewery without adequate public disclosure. My attempts to investigate were stymied, raising serious concerns about the transparency of these operations. In 2019, I requested information regarding the brewery's well plan from the Environmental Health Department. The findings were alarming. The well depth reaches 680 feet, precariously close to known contamination sites. Four. Yet alone, when I approached Sierra Nevada Brewery, effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively We must confront the reality of the Sierra Nevada Brewing Company is projected to generate $203 million in revenue in 2024, raking them in much of the top craft breweries. This wealth, however, comes at the expense of our community's houses. They leverage our water resources for projects while they engage in lucrative business deals like entities with the Sacramento Kings. They neglect the very essence of our community and our water. Additionally, Sierra Nevada Corp. spent $1.76 million lobbying efforts this year. This is not just about business. It's about a calculated effort to funnel our life source away for profit, endangering the health of our residents and potential health implications. Testicular cancer, thyroid cancer is serious to ignore. The decision-makers who approve these measures will not be around to witness the consequences of their negligence. To protect the city, I propose sanctions on Sierra Nevada Brewing. We will not be able to approve the sanctions until thorough investigations confirm the safety of our water wells. Furthermore, I subject implementing prepaid bottle tax estimates to generate sufficient funds will be placed into a sovereign fund. The principle of this fund will be protected forever by the local judiciary, ensuring that we have resources. Thank you. I had a meeting with... Thank you. That's your time. Okay. Okay, the next speaker is Benny Greenleaf, followed by Lori Monroe. Good evening, Chico Council members and the good people of Chico. My name is Badass Benny, and I am your friendly old Chicoan from the 1970s. Spring is here, and May is Mental Health Awareness Month. Have you ever experienced a family member say, watch this, and slam their head repeatedly into the living room wall? Or save them from electrocuting themselves? And a bathtub full of water. At 30, I've been a single parent of two dual-disorder children, and a third with a brain disease called bipolar schizoaffective. I raised them with a double prosthetic neck with daily chronic pain, and I almost died and had a spiritual experience sober. While in the ambulance from Paradise to Chico, I spoke to my higher power and asked to stay and be with my children so they could have a parent. And a child should not ever die before their parents. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I wish to express my support and advocate for dismantling Dubuque County Behavioral Health and having the state of California take over for a non-bipartisan behavioral health hospital and housing support for safely removing incumbent people off the streets. They cannot take care of themselves and are dying in handfuls each day as they are not disposable people. For decades, we have been in local and national mental health crises. My son was suicidal on August 23rd, or August of 2023. As a small child, I was a little girl. I had a family of four. We took him to Inland Hospital Behavioral Health Union Chico. Two weeks later, he came home frothing at the mouth, holding his head, partial catatonic, and had been missing for weeks and months on end in two different states. After finding out that Dubuque County Behavioral Health Unit overdosed my son, he was given back to his loving family and competent. I had to take him out of the state of California to get emergency mental health treatment as we kept doing the same thing over and over at Oroville, Inland ER, and Dubuque County Behavioral Health Unit. I left to Reno, Nevada. I was in the state of Nevada and obtained support at the Reno Behavioral Health Hospital. Immediately, they took my 30-year-old son in. A week later, he was found incompetent in Washu County Family Court. Every day for a year in Washu County, being on the streets and in a studio for my incompetent son was a mental health crisis each day. To keep my son on this earth, I couldn't let him go. I brought my son back home after a year, and jail to jail isn't the answer for brain injury folks. As my son is in Dubuque County Jail and had been forced meds after spending 22 weeks plus in solitary confinement. Which is inhumane and recovering from a brain injury in Dubuque County Jail. This is absolutely immoral. I have sent all my findings to the Office of Ethics in Washington, D.C. And I encourage all parents and patients to do the same because the local PUP unit is sending people away if they are suicidal. Not doing psych assessment at times and visual assessments many are let out after 72 hour hold and not stabilized. Our family has been through it. Because brain injury affects the health of our children. And it affects our whole family. Thank you for listening. I am leaving your brochure for the brain injury coalition. Thank you. Thank you. Our last speaker is Lori Monroe. Briefly I just wanted to thank Mr. Augustason and the City Council for beginning to think about what to do with the alternate camping site for unhoused people. the! information and I hope you consider ensuring they get potable water in addition to the other things he mentioned. Thank you. thank you. Public hearing on the workforce vacancies and recruitment and retention efforts and compliance with assembly bill 2561 government code section 3502.3. Ms. Barbara martin. thank you good evening mayor vice mayor and members of council. I' m sure you' re tired of seeing me up here today but here I am. I' m sure you' re tired of seeing me up here today but here I am. okay. ab 2561 was a bill that was introduced to address the issue of job vacancies in local government and the effects of them and how they adversely affect the delivery of public services and employment. employment and the effects of it was effective January 1, 2025 and incorporated in the government code section 3502.3. the requirements of this new legislation is that once a year a public entity must have a public hearing and in that public hearing must identify the activities that may lead to obstacles in the hiring process and then that also must occur this public hearing before the adoption of the final budget every year. so as long as it' s done before the final budget I know we talked about the proposed budget already but final budget is the required period of time. employee organizations are allowed to present at this public hearing. we have ten bargaining units in the city of california and we have three that want to present tonight as part of this public hearing. that' s IAFF local 39 and seiu. when vacancies in a single bargaining unit so not throughout the whole city but in a single unit itself meet or exceed the 20% of authorized positions in that unit upon the request of that unit we provide additional information about total number of vacancies the number of vacancies and the number of applicants the average time to fill positions and opportunities to improve compensation and working conditions. so this presentation is a lot of data and a lot of numbers but it' s fulfilling the requirements and please stop me if you have any questions along the way. so in general our workforce this is all as of December 31st 2024 we had to pick a point in time because it' s a very fluid set of numbers that come through. at that time and as we are right now we have 476 authorized full time positions. the services re rendered to the public are public safety community development public works that includes parks that should also say engineering and operations and maintenance and then we have the administrative support of the departments. general vacancy information throughout the city. the average number of vacancies at the end of each month is about 7.6% highest 9.7% and the lowest was 6.7% as of December we had an 8.2% vacancy rate throughout the city. this is a very busy slide but just kind of gives you an outline of what our recruitment process is. when we identify a vacancy we go through the department fills out a recruitment requisition we go through the recruitment process we determine what kind of recruitment it will be whether internal, external, etc. the requisition gets approved we post the job go through an application screening in the human resources department and then from that list of folks it could go through a written exam depending on the position there are certain positions through the city that require that otherwise then it goes into the interview process and then we go through the internal and external panel depending on the preference of the department and then typically we have a scoring list and anybody who scores over 70% on the set of questions that they are answered according to the panel then go on to the second interview and then from that list of folks if there is enough people then a candidate is selected from those that survive the second interview and then from there a conditional job offer and then we go through the pre-placement process where we do background checks etc. and then after they successfully go through that process then they are offered the job officially and get a higher date this is all to say when we talk about the time for vacancies and the time to fill positions we have to fill positions before we get there so when it looks like hundreds of days that's because this process takes quite a bit of time so we had 73 vacancies filled during 2024 most of them from internal and external recruitments we had average calendar days was 140 we had internal only filled which is usually promotional opportunities is 24 and then we had to fill those internal only recruitments the average days was 37 issues that we have here this is just a snapshot of what goes on and really depends on the position but really when we do have recruitment issues it's because of the specialized duties of the position that we are talking about we deal with public safety folks who require certain skills we deal with people who need certain certifications or knowledge of certain areas that isn't just anybody who's in the local area potentially that leads to the semi-remote location issue since we are in Chico we don't have as big a pool of candidates as somewhere like Sacramento or somewhere like the Bay Area so we just have a smaller pool of people to pick from and then really an ongoing issue just in public agencies in general is just remaining competitive with your salaries Retention we had 76 created vacancies those that were created by newly budgeted positions during the year were 20 and then 26% resulted vacancies resulted from growth of staff and then 14 internal promotions 3 in transfer and 22% of the vacancies resulted from the internal opportunity and we can continue to read on here vacancies created during the year were 76 as I said retirements were 11 involuntary separation was 6 voluntary separation was 22 and then generally speaking for the full year the rate for the annual turnover was 5% which is fairly low and then we had a lot of vacancies that were not that were not not that were not not not effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively We had a total of 13 vacancies in cpsa and you can see here all of the different statistics the applications we received throughout the year for the whole unit was 415. No shortage of people applying for the positions in the different areas. And then the average calendar of days to fill the vacancies was 178. For local 39, again we have three vacancies as of the time of this report. We had electrical maintenance supervisor, electrical technician and a laboratory analyst. The electrical positions have been open for some time. During the year we also had an industrial mechanic position that was open that was filled. The laboratory analyst position was a new vacancy at the end of the year. As of the end of the year it hadn't gone through the whole process yet. This is more the three vacancies. Again we had quite a number of applications for each of the different kinds of positions. The electrical positions, again it's a lot of specialized work that they have to do and they're not always the same. It's hard to find people that are qualified for those positions. Then a laboratory analyst, again we are still going through that process. It hadn't gotten through at that time. Average calendar days to fill is quite more here because we do have these long-term vacancies on the electrical side. Opportunities to improve the compensation of the working conditions. We're currently in negotiations with both CPSA and local This is our opportunity to have discussions with them about what would be beneficial for both sides to improve any of these areas where we do have issues. As you all know we have previously enacted signing bonuses for positions with long-term vacancies, for example. Looking outside the box and being creative in that way. Also we are, we have a lot of other issues. We are implementing some compensation software where we will be able to stay current with what that looks like in terms of our salaries compared to other entities. That is all I have. Then I will turn it over to the groups that want to present. I'm going to open the public hearing. Do we have any questions for Barbara before we go to comment from the? No? Okay. Okay. We have three speakers. Jason Anderson followed by Ken Smith and then Garrett Dickinson. Jason Anderson. Thank you for the opportunity to speak representing SEIU and members of operations and maintenance. Some members of operations and maintenance. As mentioned before, we're a diverse group. I would like to start by echoing the sentiment that Director Gustafson said earlier and just demonstrating our appreciation of all the leadership that has acknowledged the value of the services we provide and increasing our full-time employment numbers over the last few years. In the dark days of the city's financial crisis, extreme austerity measures really crushed our numbers. It led to massive amounts of layoffs and all those vacancies were just sort of swept away. For many years, they just became uncounted vacancies. They no longer existed. As the city grew, we got so much smaller. During the reset, as Barbara Martin mentioned, we came back and under Director Gustafson, came back to the model that is much more efficient and much more focused on technology, equipment operation, trying to really spread values across the city in ways that capital projects don't really do. A huge component of that is skilled operators and with our historically low wages, currently we're at 15-25% below equivalent cities. In particular, our traffic signal technicians are making between 35-50% less than equivalent cities. We don't have the ability to really recruit lateral transfers like maybe some other entities do. It really matters that we train in-house and hire good people and retainment is so important at that point. Yes, our vacancy numbers are not very high, but at the moment we're operating at around 70-80% of the number of full-time employees for maintenance as other cities do. We really, really are focused on recruiting and retaining our quality young employees and hopefully providing opportunities to our longer serving members as they provide training, leadership, job site supervision, focus on safety. As we go forward, we again just want to thank the previous decisions that were made that really helped and we hope that you take into consideration our value and we can really provide a trust to the city that with measure age passing and as you saw Director Gustafson's initiatives with grinding and replugging and we hope you just hopefully we can demonstrate our value some more should the opportunity arise. Thank you. Thank you. Ken Smith followed by Garrett Dickinson. Good evening, Mayor, Vice President, Council. Long day. Thank you, thank you, thank you for your day of work to all the staff. Been grinding since 1 o'clock this afternoon. Very much appreciated. Speaking on this topic, just learning this new assembly bill to have to report this and it was very curious to what the report would look like and what essence it would bring. And I believe that today and all the work that you've done and the essence of culture for us as IFF, as fire department. I'm going to be selfish and speak just to us right now, right? Our brothers and sisters in SEIU, they're doing their thing, everybody. For us, we've never seen signing bonuses needed. You've never seen people not showing up to apply. But I will tell you 27 years ago when I applied here, there was 1,000 of us over at Chico State and we filled the auditorium and we tested. Our last two recruitments, we were under 200 applicants and we utilized what's called the FCTC, it's Fire Candidate Testing Center. We thought it would be a great management labor agreement to use this statewide eligibility list, speaking to not having the pool of people here just in Chico. So we cast our net statewide and we're finding is this point, click, drag, apply. Point, click, drag, apply. Point, click, drag, apply, right? We'll help young men and women show up in the interviews and we'll be interviewing them and their interview will say I'm seeking employment with the city of Santa Barbara, right? And that's just disheartening, right? So you're just like, oh man, come on. So we're kind of muddling through that process but it takes a giant load off of HR. Right? We're trying to get everything out of the way. We're trying to get everything automated. We're getting through it. We're finding some quality candidates. We're fortunate enough to have Butte College Fire Academy, one of the best in the country. Half of your fire department also works at Butte College Fire Academy for a few reasons. To get back to where we came from and to influence the culture of the next generation and try to find that talent. We're out there every day. They're finishing up graduations this Friday. We're out there all the time. So we build our recruitment internally by genuinely preaching to the support we get from fire management. The support we obviously get from council, including today. I want to say thank you to Ms. Holly, Mr. O'Brien for having the courage to keep that conversation alive about staffing on Engine 1. I'd be remiss if I didn't point that out specifically. Thank you very much for keeping that conversation going. My time is up and I appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Good evening. Good evening. The union representative for the international operating engineers. Local 39. thank you for joining us today the staff at the water pollution control plant. First to thank barbara and her staff for putting together this presentation I think it' s very important for you guys to receive this information regarding your workforce. Basically with our group they' been working short handed since covid the plant already works on a lean staffing model as it is so when you have these vacancies it puts even more work load on the staff that is currently working out there. That creates extra stress and extra work load which can cause people to go elsewhere. It wasn' t in barbara' s information because that went up to the beginning of the year but we have another operating position open that is open to and we have a new one that came up a few months back when we had an employee leave. Basically we' re in negotiations right now we' re hopeful that we can get the salaries a little more competitive and get those people that we need applying. Our folks are certified in wastewater electrical and all of that stuff so they' re trades people you have to have some experience and have to get in there and do the job. But again we' re pretty hopeful that working with the city we have a good relationship to come to an agreement that will make them more competitive to bring some fresh new faces out to the plant and to keep our water functioning our wastewater functioning. thank you. thank you. I will close the public hearing and is there any further comment or questions from council? no? all right. Do we need to vote on that? it' s just a public hearing we' re all good. 5.1. the council should have a motion to accept and file the report. I will move to accept the report. I will second it and thanks to the employees who came out and spoke and shared. thank you. council member goldstein. aye. council member holly. yes. council member o'brien. yes. council member van overbeck. yes. council member winslow. yes. council member excuse me vice mayor bennett. yes. mayor reynolds. aye. carry 7-0. all right. 5.1. consideration of a resolution amending the chico municipal code chapter 11 r.32 adding section 11 r 32140 entitled mobile fueling. Mr. gufteson. thank you mayor and vice mayor and council. this item is recommended by both the airport commission they heard it at their last meeting and myself to amend munico 11 r 32 to get some operational control on some of our fueling operations at the airport. currently the airport is operating at the airport and we have a contract fixed base operator that does all the feeling on the airfield. we' re trying to manage what' s called fueling through the fence where if you have another company that' s operating at the airport temporarily brings their own fuel trucks and technically puts the hose through the fence and fuels their own aircraft. this is very common for airports of our size and of course larger ones to regulate who is allowed and how they are allowed to fuel on the airport for a number of reasons. it solves revenue protection for the city. we get 10 cents per gallon of throughput on fuel that' s sold through the fbo. service reliability issues it solves some of those. legal safeguards and of course liability mitigation. it' s really a best practice to try to manage who is allowed to fuel on the airport. this code section does give or the amendment does give some exceptions in the event of emergency. we have a consultation with the airport manager and fire chief for fire response. fire firefighting companies are allowed to bring their own fueling apparatus on site to fuel their aircraft as long as they buy their fuel in bulk from the fbo. again very common for airports of our size we benchmark this policy from reading's policy and some other surrounding airports of similar size. best practice and we hope for approval in the resolution. thank you. any questions for staff or we will take speakers. how many speakers do we have? we have none. all right. I will consider a motion. move to approve. second. motion and a second. you can read in our. council member goldstein. aye. council member holly. yes. council member o'brien. yes. council member van overbeck. yes. council member wenslow. yes. mayor bennett. yes. mayor reynolds. aye. carry 7-0. all right. 5.2 council member goldstein request on parklets. council member goldstein. you are up. all right. you will notice I had postponed the other agenda item request I had made until probably the next meeting. it has been a long day. I am grateful we did that. this item is on parklets downtown. that had emerged from a previous meeting. discussion on parking downtown with a goal of boosting business downtown and bringing more people into our downtown area. most of us probably remember that during the height of the covid-19 pandemic until through 2022 we had a lot of temporary parklets downtown. some of them were right across the street at duffy's and were operated by bars. parklets in this case meaning where people can enjoy their outdoor seating areas where customers and businesses can enjoy what they buy from the business in that area. we also had ones at restaurants or at cafes like at naked lounge and these took up parking spaces temporarily. usually 2 to 3 parking spaces depending if they were parallel or diagonal. i talked a bit to our public works engineering director about what we allow now. there is a lot of information from past meetings that i looked through and i attached some of that information to this report but what i found in that research was it is unclear whether any sort of more temporary parklets are currently allowed but we do allow businesses to either put a small chair and table outside of their estates or a small building or a small building establishment a lot of businesses do that on the sidewalk or to more permanently construct an outdoor dining area that pushes the sidewalk further away from their business. one thing that was pointed out by our city manager is that abc law might have changed since the pandemic when they allowed alcohol consumption to be detached from a business such as across the sidewalk. are still eating at a restaurant at a parklet across the sidewalk from a business so i' m curious and couldn' t find if there are opportunities for cities to enact policy to make it easier for across the sidewalk consumption of food and beverage these are all things that i had researched during this and at the bottom of this attached some imagery that public works had provided of parklets and other picnic table type of scenarios that we had temporarily during the pandemic but aren' t necessarily concrete permanent structures. what i' m hoping we can do tonight is see if there' s any will to figure out maybe if we can have kind of like an more open to the state up front for businesses or open to other ideas and part of the reason i bring that up is because we have our downtown revitalization program coming up and that will involve regardless tearing up the streets downtown in the next i believe about five years so there' s a lack of desire among local businesses to foot the bill for challenge for perhaps tens of thousands of dollars currently to build a permanent outdoor seating area when we' re going to redesign downtown anyway. Hopefully that' s a good start would love to discuss further and if there' s anything that our city manager or public works director wants to add open to that. all right. we will start with. i will add something quick on the detached service areas during the last couple of weeks.!! the operational restrictions and I don' t know all the nuances we would probably have to talk with a licensee but I think what they did was after covid about a year or a year and a half after covid they went back to their old paradigm where if you were operating this detached area there were just so many people who wanted to do it. I think that might be a little more accurate I think it can be done but I think you have to be a lot of sales would have to justify that. as I understand it abc requires you to have an employee with your eyes on that outside area and I think we want to get some clarification on that. information on what the rules really are. is that something for the city attorney or who and staff can clarify that? council and mayor the city attorney can work with staff to provide that clarification if that' s a direction from council. good to know thank you. I don' t know if the direction from council. I would just say before we go in just because I was here the first time we talked about this and we talked a lot about this I think we had about an hour or two discussion on if I remember right it was pretty lengthy. One of the and this is probably my fault and I' m sorry I' m the one that joked about how much fun I had down in San Diego and how great their parklets are. However I will say four years later they' re all the exact same parklets set up the exact same way that are re very dilapidated and yet they' re very busy but they' re very dilapidated and not putting the money into them so I' m super conscientious of the fact that we have several businesses that have spent up to probably hundreds of thousands of dollars to do the pop out and to do it the legal and right way and so I just want to make sure and then we went through the whole safety issue and this is what we tried to do with duffies and then we also have the complicated issue complicated than parking because it' s almost impossible to do on the vertical without taking up extra space so we have a lot of things that I think we could probably bring back a report and remind us of a lot of those conversations that we already have but I love the idea and understand we will be tearing up our streets soon I think maybe there' s a middle road but the safety I know we dealt with that with duffies is how do we get people sitting on that patio safe without having the make sure we had everything you had to do to put over the concrete to make the concrete look nice now all of a sudden you might have done the pop out and done the whole thing because you' re right about to the same cost that' s what I remember from the conversation last time I love the idea and I love doing it but I' m not sure how we get there that' s just my comments before we go to vice mayor bennett. we have an additional complication we have several hundred in the north area of chico state. As the liaison to the dcba I would be very reluctant to agree to anything that would potentially remove more stalls downtown 27 is quite a bit. We have no choice it' s another state regulation and it does make some unless we have had very many accidents across fox right next to where a stall is located but that doesn' t make any difference they' ve made their decision. With 27 being lost again I will repeat I would be very hesitant to move forward on losing any additional stalls unless representatives of the dcba were to perhaps support this and I' before we take any direction I would like to hear from the public. we have two speakers. does anybody else want to say anything before we go to speakers? clarify vice mayor bennett was that the daylighting law that requires we can' t have cars parked within 20 feet of a crosswalk? excuse me. mayor? is that chief? if I could speak on this real quick just so you know abc has extended that temporary permitting through 2028. okay. for the outdoor service that was created during the pandemic. really? okay. thank you. I will just say I think it defies all common sense and people' basic experience to think losing parking at the expense of having people outside in downtown is actually going to leave us worse off. everybody saw it and everybody feels that you hear about it all the time any time you bring it up all kinds of people come out of the woodwork to say that was great that was wonderful we loved it when downtown had that kind of activity. that doesn' t mean we have to allow it anywhere and main and broadway certainly have more safety issues with cars driving much higher speeds on there. just a little bit of quickly one is really good report council member goldstein very well done. there was a good case it would have been unfair to reverse course at that point because other businesses already taken theirs out in anticipation of this rule change. then we amended our ordinance to allow those special circumstances which was a beer walking across the sidewalk and diagonal parking we made an ordinance to allow those situations to work. but then at the same time we started talking about tearing up all of our intend to do that because we have to replace the sewer pipes we have to get in there and do that. I think it' s on us because that was our mess up that prevented any of these parklets from reapplying under our rules it' s on us to figure out something in the meantime that' s going to work. I think plenty of towns in fact most towns with good downtowns have examples of parklets which are not just straight slab and something terribly ugly but it' s also not a concrete extension of the sidewalk and requires that level of fixed investment. I think we should figure out something that' I think we would like to have engagement with some businesses to know what they' re willing to pay because there' s both the expense incurred in expanding that sidewalk and the construction and also the charge we have for the lost parking revenue those are the two things that cost that money. Maybe the lost parking revenue is fine but the investment is not but we should be thinking about how we can Greg scott followed by bruce mclean. I was hoping this wouldn' t come up again but it has. I' m going to go back to my comments this is not a DCBA sponsored thing this is me as a business owner and someone who has spent $250,000 on outdoor parklet it' It's great. I love outdoor dining. Councilman Goldstein, you're right. You did go to San Francisco. You could go to San Diego or you can go to L.A. And they call them entertainment zones. And I believe, Chief Aldridge, if you think about that, I don't believe they extended the non-continent or congruent outlet, the ABCs I'm talking about. We are leasing 27 spaces. A few years ago, we lost 26 spaces. Not just one or two, three or four. They're not ADA compliant. The ones we had were a blight to the city. And you look at Tres Hombres, Woodstocks, Burgers and Brews, Raw Bar, LaSalle's, Fifth Street, Crush, all those businesses spent an enormous amount of money to entertain people outside, which is great. We don't have a climate where we already have, let's see, tellers. I think Panama. There's two or three others that are vacant right now, outdoor dining. Because as a restaurant owner, just because you can eat outdoors, I mean, we have bigger problems than eating outdoors. And maybe losing parking isn't a big deal to someone who doesn't park downtown and rides a bicycle. I don't know. But another 26, 27 spaces, as we had before, it's just ridiculous. And that's just my opinion. Thank you. Thank you. Greg, excuse me, Bruce McLean. Yeah, parklets is a new word in my vocabulary. But having lived in Rome for a dozen years, I enjoyed them immensely. Because if you've been to Rome or any place in the world, you know that eating outside is part of the tradition of eating out. And I'd like us to think about how that might excite more people to come downtown to eat. And that with that vision in mind, I think that people would find a place to park. Now, Rome has a terrible parking problem. They never have enough parking spots. Or the other way around, they have too many automobiles. But that has not stopped almost every restaurant in Rome from having a parklet. And people simply walk a little bit to use it. So I think, you know, in part of our revamping downtown, that accommodating parklets, and making it as affordable as possible, would be a great addition. It won't be Rome, but it will be a different kind of space, not the antiseptic kind of space that so many American cities tend to have. So that's what I think about it. Thanks. Thank you, speaker. Thank you. So I'm going to give this a shot. And Council Member Goldstein, you can take it if you want. But I'm wondering if a good first step on this might just to be have staff bring back where we left off last time, maybe look at the, where we could have made some errors possibly in our code. And have the city attorney check out where things are on ABC. Then take into consideration the loss of the park. And if we can't get that done, maybe we can just bring us back our report so we have all of the conversation in front of us and we're not bringing all these, because I think most of it's already done and maybe could be updated. I'm not sure how we engage the, but I'm pretty sure we could send something out to DCBA and we could probably get a pretty good feel for what DCBA feel, or, and the members, not just DCBA as the whole, but DCBA members. Maybe we send something out that they could put some feedback in. And maybe start from there and bring the conversation back. Anyways, that's my idea. Yeah, I think the first step would be to gather that information. And then, yeah, outreach should come after that or, I mean, obviously we have business owners who are participating now too. But once we have that information, we'd know what to communicate to business owners. If this is even something that's a potential idea that could happen. Because if we find out that there's just no way that this could pan out to support parklets or allow more. There's no real engagement to be had. But yeah, I think finding out about those ABC laws and finding out about what we currently allow as a city, those are probably the first steps. Yeah, I think I agree with the mayor. I think there's something worth looking at. And I, but I also respect the objections, for instance, parking that the Vice Mayor raised. And so we need to look at this holistically. So for example, you know, the way you solve the parking problem is you park it in a parking You park it diagonally on Main and Broadway, which cuts, you get 40% more parking spaces for a given amount of curb face. You give up a lane. But there are solutions. And it's a question of tradeoffs. You know, what kind of downtown do we want? So I think I support the mayor's suggestion. So I would concur with that. The only thing I might add, if this is something we really want to take a deeper dive in, it needs to go to internal planning. I think we need to get that back to the internal affairs and let us vet that and bring that back to council with all these different layers that are present. Because obviously this is a very complicated issue. It's not simply putting a parklet in and then going forth and doing good work. There's a lot of different dynamics to include tradeoffs. I would suggest if we want to continue after getting at least the basic information back from staff, mayor, is to send that off to internal affairs. I make that a motion to send it to internal affairs to discuss some of the things that I mentioned as well as anything else they'd like to. We're regarding parklets, not anything. Second. Sounds okay. I just do want to register the concern that we could spend so much time just like reanalyzing this. We really have had robust discussions about this in the past. And I don't know that it really is that complicated. It's about us making a tradeoff. People are already going to pay for lost parking revenue. We have this consideration. But it's really a decision of us of do we want to prioritize our downtown. Like having people out in the street eating outside. Really businesses can figure out ways to do it. We can simplify standards. I think we can make that direction right now. And I don't know that a bunch of new analysis is really going to get us too far. I'm seeing that we're waiting for a report. We're going to internal affairs. I'm already seeing this being months out. And a whole other summer season where people just don't eat outside because we couldn't come to a decision. When you can look at, I mean, not just LA and San Francisco, Marysville and Eureka have these things that are going perfectly fine. Do you want to go first, Kate? Well, we got a motion and a second. I was just going to say I don't think this is going to take months. I think we have a report that we can regenerate. You guys can answer the questions and we should be able to have it back. And internal affairs meets monthly, right? We do. So if we get it on the next one, then we should be able to have it back. And like anything else. Unless you're super busy tackling something else. No, we're okay. We want to do this right. I don't want to rush into something. And it is complicated. I'm sorry. I'll just say it's a complicated issue that I think we need to hear from our downtown businesses. They're affected most. And from others. Other stakeholders. I think it deserves the attention that we're talking about doing. Well, not only are they affected. They're the ones that would actually have to do it. So if none of them want to do it. Hopefully they would lead the charge. Yeah. And the ones who might want to implement a parklet. I would love to hear what's prevented them so far. Yeah. Yeah. I mean. I'm open to sending it to internal affairs. I'm also concerned about slowing down the process and also I guess I'm just Excited to talk more about this and would love to have the presentation to City Council perhaps selfishly I also just want to know I The the two hundred fifty thousand dollars spent on a parklet I that's what we're trying to avoid making small business owners pay especially in the face of having the whole downtown Street scapes have to be replaced anyway, so I just wanted to point that out Absolutely. Okay. We have a motion a second Okay councilmember Goldstein Hi Councilmember Holly. Yes councilmember O'Brien. Yes councilmember van overbeck. Yes councilmember Winslow Yes, vice mayor Bennett. Yes mayor Reynolds. All right, Carrie 7-0 Okay We have nothing posted after the agenda any reports and communications the following reports and communications are Provided for councils information. No action can be taken on items under this section unless the council agrees to include it on a subsequent agenda City manager reviews report All right Next time councilmember requests for certain to code a PMP 1010 council member members may verbally Not verbally verbally request an item to the agendize at a future meeting after Stating what the item would be a majority of vote of council is needed in order for staff to agendize. Do I have something there? Okay? Councilmember we're trying to get out of here, but I think this is a time-sensitive issue that we're in budget season So there is a cancer screening program in the city that was initiated by our fire department Expanded to the rest of the city as I understand it. I think we need to hear more about that program What it actually is covered and more of the details. I don't understand all those details right now as a council member I think we need to understand what those details are and my motivation is we put our firefighters and our police officers and Firefighters in the city and we're trying to get them out of the way and we're trying to get them out of the way And part of that harm is exposure and cancer and Those are real threats and I think when you take your employees you put them out there into those situations You own those employees as far as that exposure and I think we need to understand if there's any gaps anything we can do better with that particular program and I'm suggesting that we agendize that and have a Discussion or both robust discussion. It can be certainly presented by Chief Standridge or podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem 2023 and I would recommend you go back and watch the meeting. I understand that but I want to understand this a little more specifically as it relates to gaps that maybe we need to jump in and fund in this budget. seeing how that is related to the budget are you also suggesting we set aside our rules and bring it back at the next meeting? that is my suggestion yes. I would suggest that we set aside our rules and bring it back at the next meeting information about it so it could potentially be considered in our budget. we have a motion and a second. are you good at adding that? yes. councilmember goldstein? aye. councilmember holly? yes. councilmember o'brien? yes. councilmember van overbeck? yes. councilmember winslow? yes. vice mayor bennett? yes. mayor reynolds? aye. councilmember kerry? carries 7-0. we will adjourn to I' m sorry you did have something I apologize. s member one's slide. it' s all you. governor newsom releases model ordinance on anti-camping enforcement it' s really simple. while I understand and I can imagine this being the response of some of my colleagues that we' re in this world of settlement we can' t really do anything different and that' s generally true. however I don' t think it makes any sense to postpone this until after the settlement agreement expires for us to discuss what the best method of maintaining these rules are. when we did a little bit of legal gymnastics to criminalize camping in the past I think there was some significant collateral in that in terms of we made a ton of things enforceable as a misdemeanor as an arrestable offenses every single park' s rules and regulation that I don' t think anybody would have seriously considered doing that in and of itself it was only this was sort of a proxy to criminalize camping in some way and I think that this ordinance provides some sort of I think that's a simple way to have the same effect and so I would like to have a discussion where I would just kind of compare and contrast this three page ordinance versus what we' ve done to criminalize camping. you have some motion. second. all right we' ve got a motion and a second. okay. council member goldstein. aye. council member holly. yes. council member o'brien. I' ll have the discussion so we' ll have it. council member van overbeck. no. council member winslow. yes. vice mayor bennet. yes. mayor reynolds. no. it carries five-two. all right. any other requests on this side. no. all right. now we will adjourn to a closed session on tuesday june third at five p.m. or five thirty followed by regular council meeting at six p.m. right here in the council chambers. thank you. thank you. thank you. thank you. Thank you.
