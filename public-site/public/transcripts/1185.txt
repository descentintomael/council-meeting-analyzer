 It's in the same order as Charlie.  Okay, yeah, no worries. That's good. Good to see you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Let's pray.  Thank you.  Thank you so much. Please stand and join me in the Pledge of Allegiance.  Salute.  Pledge.  I pledge allegiance to the Father,  to the United States of America,  and to the Republic for which it stands,  one nation, under God,  indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.  Welcome. Thank you, everybody, for being here.  Madam Deputy Clerk, can you take the roll, please?  Yes.  Council Member Bennett?  Here.  Council Member Morgan?  Here.  Council Member Tandon?  Here.  Council Member Van Overbeck?  Here.  Council Member Winslow?  Here.  Vice Mayor Reynolds?  Here.  Mayor Coolidge?  Present.  All right.  Speaker card announcement.  Anyone wishing to address the council on any matters not already listed on the agenda  can fill out a card in the back of the room.  Turn it into my left or your right.  And once we start a topic, we will not take any further cards on that particular topic.  All right.  We will start with item 1.5, September 3, 2024,  closed session announcement from City Attorney John Lamb.  Mr. Lamb.  Thank you, Mayor, City Council.  Earlier this evening, the City Council recessed in closed session.  All council members were present.  With respect to the closed session items, item 2.3, conference with labor negotiators,  that item was not heard in closed session.  So there's nothing to report.  Items 2.1, 2.2, 2.4, City Council was briefed, direction was provided, no final action was taken.  That concludes my report.  All right.  Thank you very much.  And then we'll move on to a presentation from Deputy City Manager Jennifer McCarty.  I'll turn it over to Jennifer McCarty on our economic development update.  You have the floor.  Thank you.  All right.  Good evening, Mayor Coolidge, Vice Mayor Reynolds, council members.  I'm Jennifer McCarty, the Deputy City Manager for the City of Chico.  Tonight I'm going to give you a quick overview of the 2024-2025 Economic Development Program.  Specifically, I'm going to give you information on three of our agreements that we have in place.  To provide economic development services.  I'm going to give you a little bit of information and background on how our shop local campaign did over this past year.  And then I'm going to talk a little bit about some of the internal business assistance that we provide.  Before I do that, I wanted to give you a snapshot of our business community.  Based on our Governor's Office of Business and Economic Development, the City of Chico has approximately 4,200 businesses.  And as you can see, the majority, the vast majority, are small businesses.  93% representing 19 or fewer employees.  The numbers also before you show our unemployment rate over the last five years, as well as our labor force.  And what's interesting here is that we continue as a community to follow the state of California in terms of our unemployment rate.  And I'll show you that in a minute.  But in terms of our labor force, and those numbers are those individuals that are either employed or actively seeking employment.  We had a pretty big drop off after COVID.  And what we are seeing is those numbers are coming back in our community.  So we are almost back to where we were five years ago, which is a positive.  So this shows our unemployment rate over the last five years.  You can see that we started out pre-COVID about three-tenths of a percent below the state from an unemployment perspective.  And that's exactly where we are today.  So where the state goes, the City of Chico has been following.  The first agreement I'll talk about is the Team Chico Agreement for Fiscal Year 2015.  The agreement amounts $49,000.  And the contractor for this agreement is the Chico Chamber of Commerce.  And I know that their President and CEO Mike Egbert is here today.  And thank you for that.  As a little bit of background, Team Chico was formed as an economic development collaborative to really base an understanding of what the businesses' needs are.  And then respond to those needs appropriately.  It was formed back in 2012.  And each year as Team Chico has functioned, they've really tried to take a step back.  look at what our community's needs are and then again respond appropriately.  This year we met and we started to talk about our scope of work and our scope of  work is going to be around these five initiatives. That includes resource  development, engagement with business, labor pool development, understanding the  needs of business, and then making sure that we're also looking towards  community branding. So to highlight a couple of those features we do have a  business resource guide that is being updated currently and that is a list of  business resources. We provide that list to businesses when they obtain a  business license through the City of Chico or when they renew that license  and we also have that information on the City of Chico's economic development  webpage. This year we'll also be looking towards doing some industry sector  engagement, bringing industries together to talk about their individual needs and  provide specific resources to help meet their needs. And then finally with  under community branding we will continue to remind businesses why they  chose to locate in Chico through the Choose Chico social media initiative.  The next agreement is Travel Chico. For fiscal year 24-25 our agreement amount  is $40,000 and our contract for that is Explore Butte County. The Executive  Director Nicole Farley is here of Explore Butte County and the Travel Chico  project manager from Explore Butte County Alaina McCarthy is here today.  As a reminder Travel Chico was established back in 2021 when the Council put money towards  this initiative to really create a focus on marketing specifically to the City of  Chico. Bringing in people to help increase overnight stays, creating economic growth  but then as a secondary impact it does things like maybe there's going to be students that  travel with their families that one day will want to be going to Chico State or maybe there's  individuals that will be wanting to expand their business that travel here that may want  to do it and come back.  This initiative truly is a partnership agreement again we stated that we put $40,000 towards  that agreement and Explore Butte County is our partner in this. Their focus is typically  in marketing on a regional approach but of their marketing dollars they set aside 10%  of those funds for the individual jurisdictions to market. Not for us to market but for them  to market individual jurisdictions. And in conversations with them the City of Chico is  The City of Chico is a community that is a part of the community and Explore Butte County  agreed to partner so that what we're doing is we're getting a much bigger bang for our  buck because as we collaborate together the City's funds and Explore Butte County's  funds are all moving this community forward from a marketing perspective.  They've been very active over the last year. This has really sort of been that inaugural  year of getting things together. Their social media presence has been pretty phenomenal.  They've posted over 2,000 posts over the last year and have had engagements of over  2.2 million. They've created some assets. I hope all of you have seen the Travel Chico  Visitor's Guide. This is a really exciting guide as you move to other communities and  go to other communities to visit you'll see that they all have individual visitor guides.  This really focuses on the great things to see and do in Chico. They also put together  a downtown RAC card that talks about things to do see eat drink between Chico State and  downtown. And then in front of you today also is a Hot Off The Pratt  effectively effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively reviewed by city staff as well. That map we did a very small print with the understanding that we' ve got a lot of other great    projects in the loop right now that pretty soon we'll be able to add even more bike routes to  the city and the city is  working on a new travel chico  guide and they will be putting  together some updates to the  website and expanding their  collateral with the city'  s funds.  Next is a visitor services  agreement.  This agreement is $20,000 and  the contractor is the chico  chamber of commerce and again  Mike Egbert is here with the  chamber tonight.  The chamber of commerce is  The chamber has been a visitor  services center for the city of  chico for many years with the  goal of connecting both visitors  and businesses with information  and resources.  Over this next year we will be  working with the chamber on  their scope of work but some of  the things they will be focused  on is providing support for  The chamber is a visitor center  they have people available,  phones available, email  available and they are not just  responding to visitor requests  they are responding to businesses  that are considering coming into  the area as well.  It is important we have someone  there to answer the phone and  respond to the emails to be there  when people want to stop by.  Finally they will be looking at  their visitor services materials to see what needs to be updated, what could they update, what could be provided electronically so that we are making sure we are getting people the best and best.  to get the information we can.  Real quickly last year we did  the get it in chico campaign  this was funded through a  $250,000 ARPA funding from the city of chico  Porter Co was the agency  I won't go into a lot of information  on here but I will tell you  we had some really great results  with this.  They created a website, social media,  a jingle, billboards,  radio commercials,  TV spots,  and a lot of other things  We also had a lot of  business trainings on how to  utilize the information and  market small businesses in our community.  Our purpose was not just to  market our local businesses  but to market to our community  the fact that when they change  their shopping behaviors the results  of those shopping behavior changes  benefits their community.  Digital boards had 18.8 million  impressions and digital media  had 5.6 million impressions.  Finally I would be remiss if I  didn't say the city of chico is  also a provider of economic  development services.  We provide services in four main  categories that first being a  business ombudsman.  From development assistance side  of the house we have our building  officials, planning folks,  development engineering and others  that meet with businesses on a  regular basis and really try and  work through a process with them  that is efficient when it comes  to building, expanding within the  chico community.  It is also important to remember  every time we do something like a  new bike lane, we are repairing our  roadways, we are putting money into  our parks, we are working towards  creating a destination and that is  the city of chico.  When we create that destination there  is an impact, an economic impact to  the city that comes as a result of that.  Finally we work towards community  collaboration.  The city is involved with a lot of  other organizations that are working  to move this community forward from  an economic and workforce development  perspective.  Many of us around this table today are  working to create a community  environment that is inclusive and  In summary I highlighted three of our  agreements that we have for economic  development today.  The one you didn't hear about was  the downtown chico business association  and you will be getting their 18  month report next council meeting.  I didn't think I would want to tell  you about them twice.  In addition we talked about some of  our internal business assistance.  workforce development organizations  throughout the community as well as  our educational institutions.  We are able to do this type of robust  work because of the partnerships we  have.  With that I am happy to answer any  questions you may have.  questions?  I think it is great information.  Thank you so much.  you are welcome.  thank you.  with that we will move on to the  consent agenda.  all matters listed on the consent  agenda are considered routine in  nature therefore can be enacted in one  motion.  do we have any speakers?  none.  council disqualifications?  entertain a motion?  move to approve.  council member bennett?  yes.  council member morgan?  yes.  council member tandon?  yes.  council member van overbeck?  yes.  council member wenzel?  yes.  vice mayor reynolds?  aye.  mayor coolidge?  aye.  motion carries 7-0.  item number 3, public comments  members of the public may address the  council at this time on any matter not  already listed on the agenda and within  the jurisdiction's authority. the council  cannot take any action at this meeting  on request made under this section of the  agenda. how many speakers?  four.  three minutes.  stephen hazel followed by tessie walker.  stephen hazel is first and you're second.  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  I just want you to know there's two names on the memorial.  They miss it every year.  It's Father Michael Judge and Michael Richards.  He was an artist on the second floor.  You know Father Michael Judge.  And two inscriptions below their names.  Below Michael Richards, it's Doug and Peter.  And below Michael Judge, Father Michael Judge, it's Crawford.  Okay, that insight, it tells you he was involved in that event.  I'll just get out from that.  Now, a positive message.  I'll bring something here.  Talk about library.  You know, for every ticket you spend, 34 cents goes to schools.  No matter what.  Before the prize is even drawn.  Here's a deal.  This is the best odds game.  So I'll bring you something.  You know, just play all through this game.  You have jurisdiction right here.  In fact, I played for Winco.  I wrote to work there.  And everybody knows you win at Winco.  It's a low-priced leader.  And just to kind of how you play it.  You get the three.  One is a thousand.  It's like one.  You know, a thousand.  One puzzle piece.  Hold on.  One puzzle piece out.  Sir, you have to address issues relative to the city of Chico.  It's not.  And you'll need to.  No, no.  It's a game.  It'll be your last warning.  Okay, okay.  But here's an example.  I hit 316 12 times.  Okay.  And one straight box.  It's divine.  But he tried to come out.  Sir, we are not going to talk about lottery tickets.  We are going to talk about issues relative to the city of Chico.  What your thought is.  No, I have a right to speak.  You do not have a right to interrupt this meeting with things that are not local.  It hasn't given me.  The longer people have thought.  Then make your point.  And I want to wait.  If it's a billion dollars.  That is not a tie-in to matters addressed by this council.  34 cents goes to education.  34 cents goes to education.  And I want.  If I want a billion dollars, I want 612.  I want 8.  All right.  We're good.  Thank you, sir.  You're interrupting this meeting.  You continue to do this.  Thank you very much.  That's your time.  All right.  Take a five-minute recess.  Sergeant Arms, can you approach the speaker and inform him once again of the rules, please?  All right.  We'll be back.  We'll return with our next public comment.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you. . . . . .  .   . . .  community. It's overtaking everything. The methadone clinic that we have in place to  help our addicts is not helping our addicts. It is failing miserably. And I want to see  if there's something we can do about changing that. I mean, if we're trying to save our  community, our community is at a break of just pure ugly and loss. And I was at the  methadone clinic earlier because unfortunately my daughter goes there and I was there a year  ago at the same time taking her to the methadone clinic. It's not fixing nobody. It's adding  more drugs and giving it to them legally. So I don't know if proposing to you guys in  this manner is proper or not, but I would, I'm going to anyways. I'm going to ask that  the council take into consideration and maybe putting a detox center, a 24 hour detox center  that is really free and available for the community so they know what a bottom is. There's  no bottom. There's nowhere to fall. It keeps falling.  we'  re losing. I don'  t know what else to do. This has been my first grown up decision to make in this  matter. I would ask that the council take into consideration and maybe look into it  and I will come back next month with more factual information on this. That'  s what I have today.  any questions?  we can'  t respond to you at this time but individual council members may reach out to you.  thank you.  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem . . . .  . . . .    .    . . .  .  people would be willing to help nurses maybe volunteer.  There's a lot of ways we can do this and it be successful and have follow-up.  Thank you.  Adam Fideli, followed by Corky Letelier.  Evening, Council.  Mayor Coolidge, members of Council, thanks very much for your service, as always.  I would like to address speed on Park Avenue.  You know, back in the day, I've been in the neighborhood over there for 27 years.  When it was the old 99 route, narrow lanes and parking on the sides of the streets, bad pavement, people went slower.  Now that the contractors have done such a good job repaving it a few years ago, now we have no parking on the street.  It's a big temptation to speed.  People fall.  People fly.  Especially on the south end.  We've got a 40 mile an hour speed limit on the south end at 21st Street.  And I don't know exactly where it drops to 30, but I think it's 14th Street, where the sign is.  I would suggest that we need to reevaluate that.  I'm just as guilty as everybody else about pushing the speed limit when it's 40 miles an hour and the pavement is so nice.  It's a little bit too tempting.  Also, we have all these people who are trying to get out of the city.  We've got a lot more people living at 12th and Park now, with the new apartment building, Chico Country Day School being very successful,  the existing senior housing at 1200 Park Avenue.  So I would ask that you work with engineering and the police department to reevaluate.  We need to be able to slow down.  I saw some guys on Saturday night at Park Avenue Pub in their Hondas, a suit of Hondas, just flying.  I mean, it's really easy.  Also, what triggered this for me was the gentleman, as we all know, that got hit a month ago trying to cross in his wheelchair.  Somebody blew a light. Now he's dead.  So let's think about that.  Thanks.  Corky Letelier.  Corky Letelier.  I urge the council to have sympathy for the poor and unhoused.  To help the sick and the addicted.  Please stop simply moving people around.  Set up a managed campground.  Step up and help your fellow humans.  All right. Is that it?  That's it.  Okay.  All right.  Item number four, public hearings 4.1, title 18, subdivision ordinance amendment.  Noticing radius correction.  And we have.  I'm going to do it for Mr. Ambo.  Okay.  Very quick presentation.  Yeah.  But let's start with ex parte communications.  Anyone?  No?  Okay.  Okay.  Sorry about that.  Thank you, mayor, vice mayor and council.  So as part of the comprehensive subdivision ordinance that was updated last year, lot line mergers, minor land divisions were mistakenly included in the 300-foot noticing list along with parcel maps and other items.  We will continue to review the ! .     . . .  .   . . . . . . . . . . . .  E  council.  .  .  .  .  .  .

Mr. Hazel I would say please  keep your opinions to the topic  on hand or I will have to  interrupt you again.  your point is so narrow it's  unbelievable.  that's why I make a point.  this is public comment.  it happens to every city council.  you have to admit.  we thought before I speak you  had a mind made out.  the reason I'm speaking is  because it's provided by law.  see that's a problem.  if you really mention yourself  you have no take in or whatever  you get your speech.  how do you know?  this last speaker doesn't have  something you never thought of.  it's hard to do.  we can make a line up.  everyone can make a line up.  on the grand jury report it's not the point you need to make. . . . . . . . . .  .  .  .  . .  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively [inaudible]  effectively  effectively  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  you'  re disrupting the  meeting.  we'  ll take a recess.  I'  All right.  Normal Wilcox.  When you'  re ready.  Yes.  I would like to read something from the report and then make some comments since I have been visiting the site at  Cohasset and eaten on a number of occasions bringing water and food.  I  So on page 12, it says,  The alternate site located at the Eaton-Cohassa intersection in North Chico is not a site of which to be proud.  Its current configuration is hazardous and subject to inclement weather, drive-by shootings, medical issues, drug use, deaths on site, and numerous other issues.  And below in the next paragraph, there is additional work that needs to be done.  So I have spent several years going on a weekly basis to deliver food and water to the people there.  And I find the site, even if it was empty, you know, a place that has absolutely no shade.  There's no running water.  When it's windy, there's...  There's no windbreak.  So it's really a place where you wouldn't want to be camping or even living.  But when people are there, the way that the city has, quote, mismanaged the conditions there, it's really deplorable.  It's a real disgrace.  Every time I've been there, the dumpsters are overflowing.  I've never, never seen it emptied.  The porta-potties, which there were only two for too many people, are not emptied on a regular basis.  So you have health conditions there that are creating all kinds of contamination.  And so what we have...  What has been proposed is a managed camping ground,  which allows people to have their...  Their trailers or cars or even sleeping in their cars that would be managed.  And so that they have proper hygiene and hopefully some shade.  So I think that the city can do much, much better.  Charles with Hoon, followed by Robin McCollum.  Charles with Hoon.  Councilman, Mayor, staff, thank you very much for your time tonight.  Doing unto others as you would have them do unto you makes for less despair.  That makes our streets safer.  The longer people are in despair, the more people become irrational.  More irrational people is not safe.  Yet that's where we're at.  Why don't they all just go to the shelters?  Let me remind you, we have been told,  the limitation on personal items is too restrictive.  The noises and odors all night long are untenable.  The banging on my door in the middle of the night.  Too many people there.  We didn't have the kind of meetings that built trust.  My stuff got stolen.  I didn't feel safe there.  The pallet cabin is the same size as a jail cell.  I can't stand it.  These are among 13 reasonable reasons we have been told.  Could it be we have a wider variety of people than our variety of shelter options?  From a taxpayer's point of view,  our shelter crisis strategy of three conventions,  three national shelters, and sweep and sweep again,  shows no guarantee of a decisive accomplishment.  What it does show is damage to our community.  More damage, by far, than us teaming up,  working together, some community collaboration,  bridge differences to more effectively address this multifaceted crisis  that obviously is a problem.  The impact of this crisis is a challenge.  I say all hands on deck.  Why don't we team up?  Successful examples abound.  North and South.  From Eugene to Ojai.  You have a flier about those.  Tiny homes and church parking lots.  Co-managed campgrounds.  With a local nonprofit to help.  And I want you all to look at the Cal-Royal  Recycle notes and the grand jury report at the top of page 31. I  Think that was a standout part of the grand jury report  Let's work together to put together a program. We can all be proud of  Let's have some community collaboration we can do it. What do you say? Thank you  Robin McCollum  I  Didn't it comes I'd like to follow on with Charles wish for a collaboration  It is our problem  These are our people  They don't have property they can't rent because they can't afford it  Rents are too high. There's not enough housing available. So they're on the street  But there are people  Many of them are handicapped  Can't do better  If they wanted to doing the best they can most of them even the druggies  They all need something different  we need to be able to provide different kinds of services for them to  To deal with the problems and in most cases I think that they would probably  Meet us if we tried that  There's much more to do out there after the cleanup that was done last  They need reasonable security a drive-by from once a day or how many times from the security service that we've heard has been hired  Is not enough that the gate needs to be secure  We need to keep  The lawbreakers the people are not properly assigned out of there so that access should be controlled as it is at the pallets  More people need to be connected to services  More people need to be connected to services  That's something that I think the city could help with the county in the city collaborate and volunteer  social organizations in this town can surely contribute a  Bus stop there might be a good idea  Since most of those people do not have  Transportation and they need transportation to avail themselves for their independence  to avail to get services  And then last but worst  the septic pond adjacent to  The one water faucet that it's there needs to be abated needs to be mitigated  Perhaps a leach field or something like that  That was our last speaker, thank you  All right councilmember comments mr. Morgan. Thank you. Mr. Coolidge  This may sound overly harsh, but there are multiple points to be made. So please bear with me  The word grand and grand jury comes the French comes from the French word grand meaning large  The jury is so named because traditionally has more jurors than a trial jury  I point this out because I want there to be no mistake that there is nothing grand has in stately majestic or dignified  About the grand jury that issued this report. I'd also like to start with my grand jury experience has some background on where I think some of this  came from I  Received a phone call from a lady saying she represented the grand jury and would like a return call which I made  Once we made contact she stated this was a private  protected call oh  My I thought I must be in some serious trouble again  The grand jury wants to interview. She said about what I asked. I can't tell you was the reply  You said this was a private protected call. I quoted. Yes, but I can't tell you she replied then the answer is no  Thank you for calling. I said and hung up a week or so later  The jury then wind sorry complained to County Council who called and wind sorry complained to the City Attorney. Mr  Lamb mr. Lamb called me and asked if I had declined an invitation for a meeting with the grand jury  So secretive it seemed the topic couldn't be discussed on a private protected phone call. I told him I did  Mr. Lamb inquired as to why I politely I was polite. Yes junk  Yes, thank you  I politely informed mr  Lamb that I did not work for the County Council or the grand jury and they were welcome to subpoena me if they didn't want to  the double top secret interview was going to be about. Mr. Lamb informed me of the topic  easily enough it seemed and I arranged a time without a subpoena to meet with the grand jury.  Then it got worse. I arrived expecting to see some semblance of professionalism and I was met  with a room of mostly inexperienced at least when it comes to homelessness investigations  government financing and politics looking people a dog and someone with an iphone to record my  interview and maybe this is how all grand juries are I have no idea but I was fairly certain this  was going to be a monumental waste of my time. Then this 25 plus page report was released  requiring responses by people actually trying to make things better for people that don't  necessarily want them that way. I'm sorry but it's hard not to be offended. So part one of the report  Chico needs a plan. The grand jury wrote and I quote studies have shown the most expensive way  to deal with unhoused individuals.  Not surprisingly the study isn't cited but nevertheless we can't force anyone to do  anything. I loosely quote from the county director of behavioral health until we change the laws of  conservatorship who have little or no impact on the addicted and mentally challenged homeless.  My own thoughts everyone has an opinion and we've all heard them from countless people  been accused of countless things even tonight been told to keep the deliver deliberations  private because it was ongoing litigation been threatened with federal law enforcement  and federal sanctions. I'd love to have these discussions in public let the people truly see  what's been offered and how many roadblocks to progress there have been for any group to come  in and make recommendations to people that have spent countless hours millions of taxpayer dollars  and been subject to all manner of criticism from all sides I find it appalling inappropriate and  offensive. My response to the entire report is go pound sand. I think city staff already burnt out  by this process articulates it better and their response to the entire report is go pound sand.  I think city staff already burnt out by this process articulates it better and their response to this process is probably the one we should adopt.  They're the ones that have done more than anyone spent untold hours and millions of taxpayer dollars  trying to make all of this better.  Has to the jury's recommendations.  Recommendation one the City Council should direct the City Manager to develop and implement an internal committee specifically designed to interface  interface with the unhoused population current service providers and future county state and federal homeless commissions.  Are two.  Has to the jury's recommendations. . . . . . . . . . .  . .  .   Has to the jury's recommendations.  Has to the jury's recommendations.  Has to the jury's recommendations.  Has to the jury's recommendations.  Has to the jury's recommendations.  Has to the jury's recommendations.  Has to the jury's recommendations.  anything, challenging every small aspect of the Warren settlement, which is, by the way,  a written plan based on interfacing with the unhoused current service providers, city,  county, state officials, and federal judges. And the plan has been shared with all departments.  That's how we got here, grand jury. How about issuing a report on legal services of Northern  California and informing the community how they block progress at every step while lining their  own pockets with donor money? How about that? Because our city management, attorneys,  public works staff, police officers, firefighters, and citizens are fed up with the cost,  the crime, the destruction, the death, the finger pointing, all of it. No one would be  happier with a true solution than the group of people right here tasked with fixing it.  Unbelievable effort, expertise, and millions of dollars. Recommendation five, the city should  agree to a three-year plan to reduce the cost of building a new city. And that's what we're  doing. We're going to expand shelter opportunities for unhoused people who currently live outside the  shelter facilities. To what end? Spend more and more millions of dollars of taxpayer dollars on  people that reject the services? On people with uncontrolled, unleashed dogs, convictions,  offenses we can't talk about in polite company? To further the destruction of public property and  the amount of waste that must be hauled away by public works staff who could be trimming trees,  paving streets, and beautifying the park. To create a larger attraction,  effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively  effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively  effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively  effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively  effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively [inaudible] ! ! ! !  solve. Recommendation six the  city should continue funding  transitional emergency housing  programs. Part two of the  report. Alternate accommodations  for the unhoused a lot of  pictures and words blaming the  city for allowing appalling  conditions. More  recommendations they change  formatting this times there are  the city should consider  rotating alternative campsites  every site sanctioned and non  used by this community gets  destroyed city plaza plaza  bathrooms the park bathrooms in  the park the alternate site the  pallet shelter someone burned  down their own unit at the  pallet shelter this  recommendation will increase  cost destruction and mayhem not  to mention it took council and  staff months to identify just  one camping site. Next  recommendation the city should  begin the process of closing and  direct the target team to issue  fresh assessment on current  alternate site residents fresh  assessments ask legal services of  north of California how often  they want the residents assessed  excuse me sir have you gotten  rid of your unleashed animals  cleared your name of  unmentionable felonies that make  it impossible to house you with  others or somehow other change  your status we expect clear  honest coherent answers to these  questions I don't.  The next recommendation city  should begin the process of  closing and cleaning alternate  The next recommendation city  should provide clearly marked  spaces well gee everyone if the  folks in the site would clean up  just a bit after themselves this  would have happened a long time  ago we have to stop placing lack  of accountability by certain  individuals on government  government can create enough of  its own problems.  Next recommendation city should  ensure care and maintenance  supervision of alternate site  conforms to health and safety  regulations I say again.  Every site used by this community  gets destroyed cleaning the sites  up and making them fresh and clean  is like the movie groundhog day  start all over the next morning.  Next recommendation city should  provide residents of sanctioned  shelters and alternate sites with  information about available  services.  Those that don't have the  information don't want it there  are resources available people  programs non-profits private  public city state county the  v. A. If someone doesn't want  to be helped there's little that  can be done I refer to my  earlier partial quote that  I refer to the board of  I refer to the board of  behavioral health director.  If no one is ever held  accountable for anything chaos  and mayhem will be the order.  For a group of people that seems  to have little experience in  these matters this jury sure  likes to make recommendations.  Later in the report they  actually suggest the board of  supervisors initiated discussion  with cities that host library  branches to store the potential  for potential funding for  library operations.  Like that hasn't occurred to  anybody.  jury and move that the council  approve option for  recommendations will not be  implemented because they either  have been or are unreasonable.  Here is my own.  Grand jury thank you for your  time thank you for your report  all the same thanks but no  thanks to your recommendations.  I apologize for my angst and  irritation it's not the grand  jury's fault.  You were asked to do a job and  you did it.  Chico has become ground zero  for the homeless challenge and  battle raging across our  country.  You were played.  Played by those who don't know  better.  Played by those who don't want  things better.  Those who pretend they care so  they can condemn point fingers  win elections feel better about  themselves and line their  pockets.  Not all the homeless advocates  are like that but we seem to  have more than our fair share.  The good ones though the ones  really making a difference along  with the staff of this city have  gone over and above in their  efforts to make things better  and reasonable for all parties  regardless of who controlled  this dais.  I know because I spent 12 years  meeting with all of them being  liked by some hated by some  liked by some hated by some  others and having even those  positions changed overnight  without warning.  My remarks are intended to make  it clear to anyone reading the  report and or speaking from that  podium that this grand jury report  contains nothing new nothing  interesting nothing that will  solve anything and certainly not  anything not thought about  before.  Please don't reference it like  it is a memorandum order or  finding of any substance because  it is not.  And there was a motion in  there.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I would like to hear the  I would like to hear the  I heard the motion but could  you repeat the motion for the  clerk?  the motion shortly was to go  with option number 4 and let the  grand jury know their  recommendations will not be  implemented and the reason for  that is because they either have  been or they are unreasonable.  All right.  Further comments?  Mr.  Vanover back.  that was well done.  A little lengthy.  Mr.  Vanover back.  I am going to go back to  And even though you went  over your three minutes a couple  of times it was worth it.  So I want to assume the good  intentions of the grand jury.  I wasn'  t interviewed by them and you  were so you have a different  perspective.  But it'  s clear that the  their report would have been far  more constructive if they had  taken the time to actually  political restrictions we'  ve been  laboring under they clearly  don' t understand them or  disregard them. I don' t think  we want to wordsmith a response  from the diocese tonight but  what I would suggest Mr. Mayor  is either you or a designee of  yours get together with the city  manager could be one city  council person I think that'  s enough  because I think our response  should be obvious or two get  together with the city manager  and I think in an hour meeting  they could knock out a response.  I'  d be okay with that.  Mr. Wenzel.  I didn'  t prepare a whole oration on  this but there'  s a part of that I liked a  lot it was when you said you  would love to have a public  discussion about this. You  weren'  have a motion at the very end  that we actually do have an open  discussion of what our plan would  be like in writing post war and  settlement since we'  re applying to  get out of it. We have a court  hearing we'  re anticipating October 30. In  any case in January 2027 we  would be free from the war and  settlement agreement but we don'  t have a written policy on  exactly what we'  re going to do. In that for  example that rule 60 motion we  extol a lot of the things we'  ve been doing under the war and  settlement but these are not  things that have been  independently determined as  policy by the city of Chico. The  only thing that we say we will  do the city council has issued  is to say we will keep open the  pallet shelter under unspecified  conditions until January 2027.  The whole idea about keeping the  alternate side open until the end  of the year is just a plan to  close it. I think we should have  that discussion of those things  because I made the motion I'  m not allowed to make it again  but you could make the motion to  have the public discussion about  what our plan on homelessness  would be. Just one suggestion  there. Other things I think it  is a good idea to have a  it is worth us going through some  of these recommendations and  having individualized comments on  it we can pitch it to an ad hoc  committee but being that this is  the only major item on the agenda  and people are gathered here  anyway I think it is worth us  just having the discussion right  here. There is a few things I can  go through. I may exceed my three  minutes if I go through point by  point but I want to offer up to  see if anybody else has the  appetite for us to actually  respond or give our thoughts to  some of these findings and  recommendations.  Mr. Chair.  Mr. Mayor I meant to make a  motion that you appoint either  yourself or appoint some people  on the council to sit with the  city manager I do not think it  would be constructive for us to  spend the next couple of hours  seven people opining on the  report.  since I didn'  t get a second to my  motion I will second Mr.  Van Overbeck'  s substitute motion.  okay sounds good. We have a  motion and a second but let'  s move with further discussion  on the motion.  discussion at this point.  Vice mayor arnott.  all I would like to say is  we have made a lot of progress  since the grant jury report has  been filed a lot of clean up and  rearrangement of the spaces have  been done at the alternate site  and I would definitely support  Mr. Van Overbeck' s motion.  and.  council member Winslow.  a question for Mr. Van Overbeck  before I go through some of these  myself.  you say you want us to appoint a  single council member to work  with the city manager to issue  responses to these but we haven'  t discussed what response we  would have.  it'  s the mayor'  s decision and I said either one  or two to sit with the mayor but  I think other than you there is a  consensus on the council my friend.  the public can'  t know what those things are.  there is a consensus on the  council on how we want to respond  to this.  you could be one of those people  but it'  s up to the mayor.  right. [inaudible] . . . . . . .  .  .   right.  right.  right.  right.  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  we still have discussion  unless you want to vote to call  the question.  I want to make my point too.  do you want to go first?  no rapidly.  I think there'  s a lot of the  assumption the grand jury didn'  t do the work they did in order to  come to the conclusions they came to  one of those that stands out to me is  finding number one on the alternate  site that the city is responsible for  the conditions at the alternate site  because the city recently issued press  releases because we did some of these  recommendations we implemented and  notably we had access to this report  first and then we decided to do this in  February 2023.  I have a point of order Mr. Mayor  shouldn'  t we be talking about my motion rather  than the merits of the grand jury.  it'  s outrageous you can try to cut me off  on the agenda item we'  have to see how it works.  we can allow him to speak in terms  of the individual item and he can  move through it.  I would after all my colleagues  talking I would just ask for brevity  as the source of wit.  right.  no offense Mr. Warren.  I'  m not the one who has spoken the  longest here.  I was being funny.  in February 2023 we had an order  from the magistrate judge of the  court that found unequivocally the  city has the authority to manage the  campground.  from February 2023 until July 2024 we  did nothing on that.  there'  s been no real explanation of that  in the city'  s press releases brushed over as to  why there'  s this incredible lapse of time.  that'  s what they found so it makes sense  they found that it wasn'  t an outrageous proposition.  the idea of assessing people at the alternate site is finding three there.  we did an eviction of  something like 40 to 60 people that  were unassessed to be the alternate  site. we evicted them without any assessment  process because we considered it a public works  operation and a lot of those people are now camping in the  plaza. so again it makes sense  that they would recommend we assess people  there so that people don' t just get scattered across  town but that' s what we' ve done  and it' s not clear whether we' ll continue to do that in the  future because we don' t have a written policy on what  we will do in the future.  yeah again I did make a  motion that we have a discussion on what  that future policy will be.  I think that would be  worthwhile for all  the people to know and for us to  formulate ourselves  what is the future past the war  and settlement agreement because the press releases  we' ve given so far do not go into detail  about what policies we' re going to maintain.  well at the last meeting  you made that motion and it was  voted down so you cannot make it again.  I don' t think he did.  I heard him say it.  he was referencing it.  all right.  so I was interviewed by the grand jury  unfortunately  grand juries are made up of people with  opinions and sometimes  like anything like we are sitting here  sometimes those opinions come through  everybody in the audience has one  we all have one you know what they say about them  but  yeah sorry  this has been a difficult task  and  you know I would  seek to remind everybody  in this chamber because if you weren' t here  I was  as well as some of my colleagues  is we had every  organization possible in this chamber  to talk to us about this issue  we had behavioral health we had mental health  we had a variety of county issues  county organizations we held  I think six  community forums  on this issue originally  when we were first approaching it.  and they included people right after the  lawsuit those included law enforcement  included service providers they included  people on the way left they included  people on the way right  and they were  very helpful and provided a lot of  information and then we also invited  the public in and over the course of  I think  you were there I think it was about three and a half hours  in this chamber  conversations with the public about what we should do with the homeless  and then we presented a report to council  and then voted on it I can tell you this  there was nothing new  in that entire comment period  no one came in with the golden arrow  and I think that' s what we' re all looking for  is hey how do we solve this  I think the problem is you can' t  I think societally this is where  we' re at and this is how it is  but I do believe like Mr.  Morgan said that we need some responsibility  we really do people need to be  responsible you spend your life on drugs  you end up on the street and you move from spot to spot  because you don' t want to be in a shelter that  actually will provide you help  then you know what you need to step up  and be responsible I know it' s harsh but  you know we need a society  that actually has societal laws  and we need to all function within that that' s my  strong opinion  I don' t always believe housing first  is the best option I know a lot of people in the audience  will differ from me on that but  there are studies that show that if you  give someone who' s highly addicted to drugs or  has mental health issues and the studies from  UCLA a very liberal institution  we actually hired someone who actually told us  about this study  and came and presented to council  that those people usually end up dead  more often than just being  out in the campsite area  so in terms of campsite  it would be great we have a lot  of folks who come forward and talk about a managed  campground we don' t have a real proposal  we don' t have a piece of property  we don' t have anything moving forward  through the city and nothing has been  submitted officially through the city  ever  that being said we have the largest  managed campground in the state of  California and almost in the country  which is a pallet shelter with  177 units and  344 beds and it  has worked pretty darn good  minus the fire  but it is actually a  great way to show  the community  that there is a solution  for this and that is I think  the best one that has been presented  to my colleagues  at that time who were on the council  we took some bold steps  and I think those were very well met  and have served this community well  I think our plan has been  outlined very obviously  and I have spoken about it several times  with direction from my colleagues here  is that plan is to keep  the pallet shelter and move forward with it  and enforce our laws in parks  and waterways  and I still think that is the best bet for  the city of Chico and I think that is what the citizens of Chico  on the majority basis want  so with that no further comments  yeah  just to respond  to that timeline you brought back to  I was a Scott Huber appointee on the  ad hoc homeless solutions committee meetings  if I recall  my recommendations were not taken  I remember one of the things I emphasized was  we should do managed camping so that there is a deliberate  place where people are and it is not scattered across the community  we are not sending people from one place to the plaza  but that we shouldn't have over 30 people there  that is based on best practices  having worked with the group to look at best practices  for other communities that have tried it  also I had a really forceful comment  about how we should enforce dog leash laws  and not pretend like  outlying camping means  or not outlying camping means we have to let people have dogs off the leash  but that is kind of a digression  what the city council did after that was open up the airport campground  at 470  or 500 something shelter beds  that was just paint on tarmac  that put a lot of money into  the remarkable thing is that when that didn't pass  the state court passed a straight face test  and the court said it doesn't pass the straight face test  there were still people that were staying there  and we had to evict people out of it once we shut that down  so for all this talk of the people  who don't accept services  it is amazing that we can do the most bare bones  like hostile kind of offering  and we still have people show up with their RVs  with their cars to stay there  those people have nowhere to go and will have nowhere to go  after January if our plan is to go forward  if the city's plan is to open up  something like the airport campground  in the county again then I think that  people should be worried about this council making those decisions  so and the only reply  I have to that is that  actually in the opinion  from the justice who wrote the opinion  for the supreme court he referenced  the managed campground we're not just going to go back  and forth so on this one  I get last word but we  referenced that and said very clearly  that that's part of the problem  and that's the reason why this  decision is getting handed down the way it was  because the opinion takes a site like that  and says in essence  that it was fine  so but relative to that  I know we're talking about a supreme court  you may not agree with but  you know the governor of California certainly  agrees with it and his push  both the governor of California and  Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch  celebrated and said the city should take a  multi-faceted approach and we've had our city attorney  use that term we've had our city manager use that term  and I will say that keeping open the pallet shelter  and shutting down everything else and having nothing to say  about any of the provisions in the warrant settlement agreement  and how we approach the unhoused  people with our city employees is not a  multi-faceted approach.  All right and you and I could debate this forever so let's call the question  when you're ready  So Mr. Mayor  Yes  Mr. Randover-Bakes  Is this going to be the mayor and the city manager  responsible for the pay-per-view?  I said either the mayor or his  designee either one or two  and the city manager  Thank you  Yes and I ask the vice mayor to join me on that  Okay  Council member Bennett  Yes  Council member Morgan  Yes  Council member Tandon  Yes  Council member Randover-Bakes  Yes  Council member Winslow  No  Vice mayor Reynolds  Yes  Mayor Coolidge  Aye  Any other questions?  Any other questions?  We have item 6.1 city manager report.  Thank you mayor I have one update for you regarding some previous conversations we had with regard to security of this building as you are aware over the past almost two years we had DHS cyber and infrastructure security agency together with our police department conduct various security assessments of city facilities and other facilities that are not in the city.  and infrastructure.  Those efforts have produced a variety of different recommendations.  One publicly visible recommendation related to the council chambers that was previously approved by council was the addition of security screening to the entrance into the council chambers being similar to what you would encounter entering a courtroom or even this year going to the silver dollar fair.  We do expect the equipment and the procedure to be done in the future.  The council members will be monitoring the procedures to be in place within the next few weeks.  As we get closer to that launch we will have a press release providing all of the details and expected timelines because it will take a little bit longer to get into the council chambers once those procedures are in place.  Any questions?  thank you.  Okay.  I will request an item to be  agendized at a future meeting  after stating what the item  would be a majority vote of the  council is needed in order for  staff to agendize.  I respectfully  request that the city council  support me in the request to  agendize a discussion of  proposition 36 and that would  lead to hopefully a consensus  of supporting a letter to the  primary organization heading up  proposition 36 and that is my  request. I will supply if this  passes I will supply the city  clerk' s office with the  required written material.  thank you.  second from council member  tandin.  when you' re ready.  council member bennett.  yes.  council member morgan.  yes.  council member tandin.  yes.  council member van overbeck.  yes.  council member winslow.  yes.  vice mayor reynolds.  aye.  mayor hoolidge.  aye.  motion carries 7-0.  any further requests from  council?  seeing none we will adjourn.  thank you very much everybody.  thank you.  thank you.
