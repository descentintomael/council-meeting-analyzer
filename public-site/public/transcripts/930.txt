 All right, so we'll call the meeting to order and start with our invocation. Chaplain Eileen Burnell. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And then we have a certificate of appreciation for our leaving assistant city manager, Chris Constantine. Chris, will you come meet me down front? Still helpful, too. Well, before I get to this, I want to say a few words, because you're leaving as I return, which I'm very sad about, of course. But, you know, having you here during my first four years on the council was quite a pleasure. And I think everybody will join me in this sentiment is when you needed an answer, particularly on whatever the hell might be, but if it was a technical issue, Chris was your guy. And I sincerely thank you for your service to the city. You took us through some rocky times, and your leadership, as well as Mr. Arms, were really the guiding light through those difficult storms. And, you know, you certainly have an excellent history. I'm excited for that resume, as well. I know you're moving on to bigger and better things, and we wish you all the best as you do. So, I will attempt to read all of this. My glasses don't fog up with this mask, but if not, I'll just wing it. All right. Chris started serving the citizens of Chico as administrative services director and was promoted to assistant city manager over a little year later. His efforts helped the city succeed in implementing dozens of new financial policies. In an effort to restore fiscal stability and control of the city when it was near bankruptcy. In 2013, the city had less than $10 million in the bank and a negative general fund reserve. Today, the city has over $130 million in the bank and has fully funded reserves for the first time in history. Equal to 27.5 of general fund expenditures due in part to Chris helping to champion fiscal prudence. Along with his savvy fiscal stewardship, very good wording, by the way, Chris engaged at a high level to work in concert with the city's economic development partners to meet the needs of the business community and strategically worked on various projects across city departments to navigate barriers to improve service delivery and operational effectiveness. During this time, supporting the city manager and city council, Chris experienced one of the most devastating disasters. In California state history in the campfire and help the city through the various complexities that such a disaster can bring. Throughout his service to the city of Chico, Chris truly embodied the Anthem of graduating students from Syracuse Master of Public Administration's program, strive to achieve, which in essence said, leave the city better than you found it. We won't make you reset the whole thing. We'll continue to work and continue to work and continue to work and continue to work and continue to work and continue to work and continue to work and continue to work and continue to work and continue to work and continue to work and continue to work and continue to work and continue to work and continue to work and continue to work and continue to work and continue to work and continue to work and continue to work and continue to work and continue to work and continue to work and continue to work and continue to work and continue to work and continue to work and continue to work and continue to work and continue to work and continue to work and continue to work and continue to work and continue to work and continue to work and continue to work and continue to work and continue to work and continue to work and continue to work and continue to work and continue to work and continue to work and continue to work and continue to work and continue to work and continue to work and continue to work and continue to work and continue to work and continue to work and continue to work and continue to work and continue to work and continue to work Thank you, Chris. Thank you. So it's been a long road for Mark and I, who built an incredible, fantastic relationship, having never met, contrary to what most people thought when we first came here. A city that was ranked fifth closest to coming to bankruptcy that's now 85. I'm going to a city that was ranked 420th, so one of the safest, that's gone the opposite direction just as much as we've gone up. And so there's another challenge to be had in another city, albeit there's no city like Chico. There never will be. I see what the potential for this city and what it has and what it has in store. And while I would love to stay and navigate it for another eight to 10 years, the significant impacts in my life have caused me to reassess and to try something a little bit different. Since we have one of the best city managers in the state already, and a young one at that, I think waiting another 10, 15 years to be a city manager may be a little bit long. And so I thought, find a city that needs your skill set, your talents, and a council that really, really wanted you. And I found it. But my heart will still always be in Chico. And I hope at some point in time, whether I come back for work or I come back to live the rest of my life, that I can come back to Chico. So thank you. Well, thank you. We'll keep a place for you for retirement. For sure. And then if we can welcome Supervisor Tammy Ritter. She wants to say something as well. Well, Mayor Coolidge kind of, stole my thunder because we started in the same time in 2012. And Chris met you in 2013. So when you started as our finance director, I immediately respected your prudent and conservative approach to city finances, in particular, our very significant negative general fund reserve at the time, which was surprising to many of us. There were some on the council who it was not a surprise for. But you walked into the city at a really critical time. Your attention to detail has served the city of Chico, as well as Butte County at large. Your in-depth understanding of each city department has aided you, and again, the city coffers, in identifying savings and negotiating contracts. Your passion for, as well as your ongoing service in public safety, has given the city a distinct advantage. That one of those with direct oversight of the city, understands and is committed to public safety in its many forms. As a former elected official yourself, you totally and truly understand local government in a way that very few administrators do. You're also one of the most committed and loving parents that I have had the honor to witness. I would like to thank you for your time. I will miss having you in Chico, and I wish you the very best in your new endeavor. And on behalf of the County of Butte, I want to thank you, Chris, and let you know that we really appreciate you. So, here is a certificate that, in essence, says exactly what the city of Chico said. I really do appreciate that. It was watching a council meeting in January where I saw Mayor Grundle, and I saw the people crying, that showed me the compassion that this community has, and it's the kind of community that I wanted to be in. But I'd be remiss in not saying that, while I'm thankful God has blessed me with a lot of talents, those talents don't come forth without a team of people that are committed together. And I can see in this room right now, the number of department heads and staff, and leadership and council, that there is no way I could have been a part of that success, without all of you. And so that's what makes this community wonderful, and that's why Butte County, us, Paradise, Gridley, the rest of this community, is all one community. Let's see where I stuck my glasses first. There we go. All right. Okay, so public participation. This meeting is being conducted in accordance with Executive Order N29-20. The public may view the meeting on Comcast Channel 11 or via streaming video found on the city's website. Public participation during the meeting. Public comment will be accepted by email at publiccomments, with an S, at chicoca.gov, chicoca.gov, during the meeting. Prior to the close of the public comment on any particular item, the public is encouraged not to send more than one email per item and not to comment on numerous items in one email. So if you want to comment on numerous items, send multiple emails on each matter. So, and then prior to the consent agenda, I believe Councilmember Brown had a statement. Yeah, just a quick point of order. Our APMPs require that council members submit written narrative to their request prior to them being added to a subsequent agenda. I notice that there are three requests on this agenda, 5.4, 5.5, and 5.6, that are not accompanied by any narrative from council members who submitted them. I recognize council sees these items as urgent, and I recognize Councilmember Morgan's item, 5.7, may be nuanced because it was a reconsideration of a vote. But when we adopted the rule stating that a council member could make verbal requests, we also adopted a rule stating that they must submit accompanying material to their requests prior to those items being added to the agenda. Just for the good of the public, I'd like to read the rules that Mayor Schwab, Vice Mayor Reynolds, and Councilmember Morgan brought to us this year. Councilmembers may request items to be added to a future agenda if a majority of council members present at the meeting vote to take up the matter. The process for agendizing council requests shall be as follows. Under reports and communications section on each agenda, council members may verbally request an item be agendized at a future meeting. After stating what that item would be, a majority of council is needed in order for the staff to agendize. Discussion on this request should be limited to whether the item should be heard at a future meeting. Should the item receive a majority vote, the requesting councilmember is then required to prepare a written statement explaining the request, why the matter is coming before the council, and what action, if any, the council is being asked to take. The requested discussion will not be agendized until such a time as the written report by that councilmember has been received by the city clerk for inclusion on a future agenda. I'd hate to see this council start off by disregarding our APMPs, which I know were updated this past year as an attempt to make our processes more uniform, and to ensure that the council members are aware of the needs of the council members. I'd also like to make sure that each member of council has time to review requests by their colleagues prior to their presentation at meetings. And so I'd like to move that we move items 5.4, 5.5, and 5.6 to a future meeting once council members have the opportunity to submit their written narrative. Okay. And while I certainly understand that, particularly like an item like mine where it was, you know, asking behavioral health for, you know, qualified information or details on particularly what we wanted to learn, I think some of them can be done just simply within the title of it. So I'm certain it's a point we probably disagree on. But, you know, I think if it's, particularly if it's an item that's been brought before council, which I believe all three had been, you know, there's obviously been information submitted at some point in time, but I'm welcome to vote on it. I don't have an issue on that. I have a question. I think councilmember Reynolds' request regarding the pedicab, I think that was written at one time, wasn't it? Yeah, it was actually attached to the original request two or three times ago. And then I forwarded and updated one today, and I'm sorry for the delay on that and that coming out late. I know it's hard on everybody getting stuff late, so I do apologize on that. Thanks for clarifying. So I would be, I would make a friendly amendment to your motion and just say 5.5 and 5.6 because we have received written information on 5.4 before. And is that a second? Yes. With that amendment, I accept that. So I have a, sorry, go ahead councilmember Morgan. I appreciate the AP and P1010s because I helped make them what they are because they were being fairly abused. On 5.5, I don't know what else you would say. The police department staffing is frozen to unfreeze it. I don't know what else would be written, but we can go one way or the other with that. Whether we do that tonight or later is not going to make a big deal. I'd probably say the same thing about 5.6 except on that one, I think that we can chalk that up to someone that didn't really know every single policy and procedure and none of us were any better in the beginning. So at the end of the day, I appreciate, and I do, because, again, I've tried to be a stickler for the rules, although I was in favor of getting rid of all of them because I thought it would have been great. All we're doing is delaying the inevitable, and I think that's kind of the point, and I don't see the point to that. We've set aside our rules in the past, so voting no on this would be basically saying we're just going to say we're going to set these aside for now, move forward like we knew we were going to anyway. And I know there's a few of you that ran campaigns on these items, and not very many people are surprised to see them. So it's just my comments. Any other comments from council? All right. Madam Clerk? So there's a motion and a second to delay and postpone item 5.5 and 5.6 for additional information. Just a second. My computer is running a little slow. Council Member Brown? Aye. Council Member Denley? No. Council Member Huber? Yes. Council Member Morgan? No. Council Member Tandon? No. Vice Mayor Reynolds? No. Mayor Coolidge? No. It fails 2 to 5. All right. Thank you. Okay. Moving on to the consent agenda. This is for items that are routine in nature and can be enacted in one motion. And if we can just make a note that Clerk Pressom will actually read the title. So if you do make the motion, you do not have to read the ordinance titles. We'll let her take on that wonderful ability because she proved herself so well at the last meeting. And are there any disqualifications or no votes on any of the following items? Yes. I'd like to poll 2.1 for a no vote. Okay. So 2.1. Council Member Huber will vote no. Okay. And so noted. Oh, I would also like to vote no on item 2.1. Okay. And Council Member Brown? Okay. Council Member Brown, are there any public comments received on these items? Yes. On the consent agenda through the Engage Chico platform, we received 136 comments. They are printed out and in front of each of you. And let me check with Danny on the public comment side via emails. We have five. Five additional ones. So I don't know how much time you want to give to everyone to read through them. Yeah. Let's do five, six minutes and February just give me a heads up when you're done. They're on there in your email right now. And then Mayor Coolidge, did you want me to read the names into the record? Yes, please. Okay. All right.

So I'll just let you know that we did receive 16 comments under business from the floor in Engage Chico and I will check with Danny to see one public comment and who was that public comment from Danny?

We're going to reach somebody on the phone. All right. It might only be three minutes, but we'll do this. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Item 5.2, Affordable Housing Fund Loan Agreement with North Creek LP for an affordable housing project located at the northeast corner of Little Chico Creek. And I assume we're doing the phone aspect of this first, or should we have Marie go first? If the council has questions, then we will unmute and get this going, but it's all up to the council. All right. Good evening, Mayor, Vice Mayor, and council members. Good evening. North Creek Crossings will be an apartment community serving 105 households between 30 and 60 percent of the median area income and one manager. So a household of four with income between $21,200 and $42,420 per year could qualify for one of these apartments. Project-based housing choice vouchers have been committed to 26 of the units, providing affordability to the lower income households while maintaining operating cash to the project. The majority of the units are one and two bedrooms in size, for which there is a very high need in Chico. The project will be located north of Little Chico Creek. North Creek Crossings will be an apartment community serving 105 households between 30 The project will be located north of Little Chico Creek and south of Marsh Junior High. This area was included in the $22 million infill and infrastructure grant, or IIG as we lovingly call it. The city was awarded to improve Bruce Road. Besides improving Bruce Road, the grant includes funding to build a road to provide connectivity for North Creek Crossings and the Creekside Place Affordable Senior Project that will be built on Notre Dame Boulevard. Creation of affordable housing is a requirement. The project will be funded to $1.1 billion in the U.S. dollar for the purchase of the IIG funds. The developer of the project, Affordable Housing Development Corporation, or AHDC, has a long and successful track record developing affordable housing and has been a great partner with the city on three other developments, 1200 Park Avenue, Harvest Park, and Parkside Terrace. Just as they did with 1200 Park and Harvest Park, they are partnering with the Housing Authority of the County of Butte on this project. Sincere construction of Chico will be done in the following years. the general contractor. In order to sustain long-term affordability, these developments greatly rely on low-income housing tax credits to generate the equity needed to finance the majority of the project. Typically, these developments also require a substantial amount of local, state, or private soft financing to be competitive in their tax credit applications. Due to advocacy at the federal level, the state of California was awarded a special disaster allocation of approximately $93 million of the low-income housing tax credits to respond to the severe loss of housing caused by the wildfires in 2017 and 2018. Approximately $40 million of that $93 of these credits were made available for projects in Butte County. Regulations and competitive leveraging requirements for these credits were modified and relaxed to facilitate a more streamlined financing process with a goal of replacing lost housing as soon as possible. North Creek Crossings was awarded the disaster tax credits, but is in need of a bit more financing to bring the project to fruition. The city has affordable housing funds to be used for this purpose to support the development of units serving extremely low, very low, and low-income households. Staff recommends a residual receipts loan in the amount of $1 million with a term of 55 years at 2% annual interest. These terms are in line with historic financing for similar local projects. With that, I'll conclude my report and happy to answer any questions. Laurie Doyle of AHDC is on the line and available to answer any questions as well. Alright, any questions? Council? Don't everybody speak at once? Alright, how about public comment on the issues? Yes. Yes, we received six comments in Engage Chico. And, Danny, did we receive any? No public comments. Okay, so no public comments via email. And in the Engage Chico system, Lisa Currier, Catherine DeBosch, Kathy Mann, Nicole Nava, Robin Engel, and Ruth Sarnoff all submitted comments that are in front of you. I do have one quick question. Go ahead. And there's probably no real point in it, but I noticed the breakdown in the one-bedroom, two-bedroom, three-bedroom, and you emphasized that there's a huge need for the one- and two-bedroom. However, we're actually building more three-bedrooms than one- and two-bedroom. Is there a law on the breakdown that we have to build all different kinds? Could it not all be one-bedroom and two-bedroom? I mean, I'm sure the builder has a reason. So this is the way this project is. It's called a large family project. It's over the tax credit. You have to have a higher percentage of three- or four-bedroom units. Gotcha. Yeah. I figured there was something like that. Okay. Thank you. You said how many of the units are currently taken? How many? So there's 105 units. Affordable units and then one manager unit. So the whole project is 106. Okay. Gotcha. Yeah. This is phase one. There will be, hopefully, a phase two as well. Correct. Yeah. All right. We'll give a few minutes, one or two minutes here for public comments. If you want to read through those. And there was one additional comment via public comments from Grace Marvin. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. It's a very short comment. Okay. All right. All right. Everybody ready? Yeah. All right. All right. So at this time, we'll entertain a motion. I'd like to move that we adopt a resolution of the Chico City Council authorizing the city manager to enter into an affordable housing fund loan agreement with the Chico North Creek LP for an affordable housing project located at the northeast corner of Little Chico Creek and Notre Dame Boulevard portion of APN 002180198. I'll second that. I have a first and a second. Second. Madam Clerk, take the roll. Council Member Brown. Aye. Council Member Denley. Yes. Council Member Huber. Yes. Council Member Morgan. Yes. Council Member Tandon. Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds. Yes. Mayor Coolidge. Aye. Carries 7-0. Thank you. All right. With that, we'll move on to, and thank you very much. With that, we're going to move on to the next item. We're going to move on to item 5.3, amendment of title 10.52 of the City of Chico relating to the abandoned vehicle abatement. Mr. Tony Lindsay. Welcome. Thank you. Good evening, Mayor Coolidge, Vice Mayor Brown. I'm sorry, Vice Mayor Reynolds and Council. Tony Lindsay, Community Development Director, Building and Code Enforcement. I'd like to present to you this evening an introduction. This is an introduction and first reading of an ordinance of the City Council of the City of Chico amending title 10.52.080 through 10.52.085 of the Chico Municipal Code relating to abandoned vehicle abatement. The focus of abandoned vehicle abatement program is to remove abandoned vehicles from public property but can also assist private property owners for the disposal of their vehicles. A few months back, Council approved an ordinance amending these same. This is an ordinance amending the Chico Municipal Code sections. However, in light of a recent decision made by the Ninth Circuit Court, further amendments are required to be made to ensure this Chico Municipal Code is consistent with current state law. This ends my presentation. I'm available for questions. Any questions? No? All right. Public comment? No? So on this item, we received 10 comments in the Engage Chico platform. And I believe we received a public comment from Tom Bond on this item. I'm looking. It's the only other one unless Danny has. Okay. So one public comment, email, and then 10 Engage Chico. And the ones from Engage Chico, while you're reading those comments, came from the Council of the City of Chico. We received 10 comments from Marcy Pittman, Crystal Maddox, Jessica Haggard, Karen Wilhoit, Rob Berry, Matt Dutton, Erica Witowski, Nicole Nava, Ruth Sarnoff, and Jessica Montgomery. You know, in there we did have a question about the time constraints on it. Okay. Can you tell us how those are just dictated in terms of the length of the time the vehicle has to remain? There's a 10-day requirement. So we notify the owner, current owner of record, if we can identify it off the vehicle, as well as we post the vehicle, put a posting on the vehicle. And so is that pretty much across the board with most cities in terms of the time period that they take? Correct. So that's consistent with the county, CHP. We're consistent with state law. Okay. Perfect. Thank you. All right. A quick question on this. Does this add any extra cost to the city, or would the owner of the vehicle be paying for it? Those questions again, please. Does it make any extra cost for the city? Okay. Because if you pick up private money... The vehicle, will the owner of the vehicle, is there a cost involved for them? No, there's not. It's reimbursed through the county's abandoned vehicle abatement program. All right. Any other questions? No. Seeing none, entertain a motion. Move to approve. Motion by Vice Mayor. And seconded by Councilmember Morgan. Just a moment. It's not taking it. And who was the second? I apologize. Mr. Morgan. Thank you. Motion by Vice Mayor Reynolds, seconded by Councilmember Morgan, to introduce the following ordinance for first reading by Title only. An ordinance of the City Council of the City of Chico, amending Title 10.52 of the Chico Municipal Code related to abandoned vehicle abatement and amending, adding, or repealing provisions in Title 10.52 of the Chico Municipal Code for the administration and enforcement by the City's Code Enforcement Division. Council Member Brown? Aye. Council Member Huber? Yes. Council Member Denley? Yes. Council Member Morgan? Yes. Council Member Tandon? Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds? Yes. Mayor Coolidge? Aye. Vice Mayor Tandon? Carries 7-0. All right. Okay, we'll move on to Item 5.4, Council Member Reynolds' request, Petticab, and it was at the time, Council Member Reynolds, sorry, when you made the request, Petticab bar PubCrow. So, and at its 9-15-2020 meeting, the Council voted to agendize this request. Thank you. I'm just simply asking. I'm just saying that we're going to have to allow some staff research time on this. It's going to take more than an hour, and our rules state that anything that takes more than an hour, we bring to Council. I'm not saying that we definitely should approve this. The applicant has a bike in Sacramento that's waiting for her. She just needs to know if and how this is something that our Municipal Code would or could possibly allow, so she can move further forward with her business decision. I would expect it to come back to us, and we would have to actually... You know, vote at that time whether or not we want this type of a business in Chico or not. I'm just asking to find out if it's something we can do. Vice Mayor Reynolds? Yeah. Would you be amenable to moving this to Internal Affairs for further discussion with staff time dedicated to it? Council Member Brown, could you just go a little closer to the mic? It's just hard to hear everybody with the mask. Do you hear me? You're asking for it to go to Internal Affairs for further discussion? Yeah, with staff time dedicated. I'm not opposed to it. It seems like items like this could use a little bit more discussion in fleshing out. So it's kind of a standard lean item that would get referred to Internal Affairs. Gotcha. Mr. Jarrod, or... It's going to take further research and it's going to come back either way. I'm guessing, is this prolonging it, or can you get us a reasonably quick answer so we can decide whether or not... I think we can get a reasonable quick answer. I think we can get a reasonable quick answer and get it to Internal Affairs probably the first meeting of the year, frankly. Council Member Reynolds? Okay. I'd also like to know if the ABC has any regulations that would apply. Exactly, and that's all we'll have to be looked into. Council Member Morgan? Well, I'll go after any public comments. Yeah, sorry. I'm not... We're all being very polite, so I'm not chasing everybody down knowing what I'm saying in terms of me calling on people. It's always kind of awkward. You guys are doing well. I was going to say something, and I'll wait until after the public comment. Okay. Thank you, sir. All right. So let's move forward to public comment on this item. Okay. So we received eight comments in Engage Chico on this item, and then we received just recently one from Tom Bond in your public comment. So the comments coming in from Engage were from Jackie Smith, Julie Threat, Jessica Haggard, Rob Berry, Nicole Nava, Robbie Sorensen, Jessica Montgomery, and Ruth Sarnoff. All right. So please take a minute and read over those. They're all fairly short. Okay. All right. And then the issues related to the issues related to the issues related to the issues related to the issues related to the issues related to the issues related to the issues related to the issues related to the issues related to the issues related to the issues related to the issues related to the issues related to the issues related to the All right, everybody good? Yeah? Good? Okay. Um, some further discussion at this time? Mr. Morgan? Uh, I will make the motion to send this to Internal Affairs with staff looking into the various implications of alcohol in the park, what the ABC has to say about it, uh, and then the applicant could also come and have plenty of time at Internal Affairs where there's more open discussion and then Internal Affairs can send it back here with a recommendation. That would be my motion. Second. Thank you. I have a motion. Do we have a second? Was that a second by Councilmember Brown? Okay. Motion second to send it to Internal Affairs. Councilmember Brown? Aye. Councilmember Denley? Yes. Councilmember Huber? Yes. Councilmember Morgan? Yes. Councilmember Tandon? Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds? Aye. Councilmember Brown? Mayor Coolidge? Aye. Carries 7-0. All right. Next item is 5.5, Vice Mayor Reynolds' request on police staffing. So when COVID first started, we spent, um, took a very conservative approach at our, um, funding and where things were going and we froze some things and, uh, not knowing what was going to happen. And it appears that I think we're at a point where we're at a point where we're at a point where we're in a decent position. And so I would like to consider unfreezing the staffing of our police department and maybe Mr. Orme, you can speak to that for a minute. Sure. Uh, Vice Mayor Reynolds, it's, it's been a real trying past, uh, almost a year now, it seems. And so, uh, obviously the council was very supportive of moving forward with freezing positions. Uh, at the time when we commenced into COVID-19, um, it was the prudent fiscal thing to do. At this point in time, we'll have to, we'll have to, we'll have to, we'll have to, we'll have to continue the work and the work and the work and the work and the work and the work and the work and the work and the work and the work and the work and the work and the work and the work and the work and the work and the work and the work and the work and the work and the work and the work and the work and the work and the work and and the work and the work and the work and the work and the work and the work and the the work and the work and the work and the work and the work and the work and the work and the work and the work and the work and the work and the work and the work and the work and the work and the work and the work and the work and the work and the work and surprising us to not freeze those positions. As you know, I've been trying to be judicious in my management of each of those positions. I called it a slushy at one point because we know that there are some positions that we can't go without filling. But hearing that affirmed from the council, it looks like that's what you're requesting to do, is music to my ears and allows me to know the direction this council would like to go as it relates to those positions in particular and gives me a clear path forward knowing that you're good with the unfreezing of those positions. So at this point in time, if that's council's affirmation, then that's what I will do. All right. May I? Yes, please. Mr. Orme, could you just refresh our memories as far as what those positions were that were frozen? Yeah, I don't have them in front of me right now, but I know that the majority of the positions on that frozen list were associated with the police department. Obviously, they're our largest personnel department. You had a number of positions that were frozen from the folks in the area of animal control to office staff to police positions. And one of the things that we've had difficulty is we've had a larger number of retirements recently. And so that really impinged our ability to have the staffing levels where we would desire them to be. They're already difficult positions. They're difficult to fill to begin with. But there were positions throughout the department. So if I'm understanding you correctly, I feel like I'm getting the sense from you that your picture, your view of the local economy is such that you're comfortable with the unfreezing of those positions and how that affects our budget. I would be at this time for, if nothing else. I would be at this time for the fact that we won't be able to fill those positions as quick as we would like to. And so that allows us to have that time in order to continue to evaluate. But knowing if it's the council's desire to move forward with not freezing those positions, I have full faith and confidence that we can see through this financial time with that direction. City Manager Orm, just to follow up on that. Are there... I know that we're... We're kind of in a difficult position with staffing across the board. Have we frozen other positions in other departments? And what does that breakdown look like? Yes, we have. And as I am... As you're asking the question, I'm trying to look at my original list of frozen positions, which Chris obviously has. What are we going to do without that guy? Exactly. So the positions that were frozen were the assistant associate planner position, community development department, fire division chief, and the fire department. Police officer, seven total police officers. Police sergeant, one. At the time, the police chief. Obviously, we didn't freeze that one in perpetuity. A park ranger, two park ranger positions were frozen. Dispatchers amounting to four. Animal services technician, there was one. Animal services associates, 2.5. Maintenance worker in public works O&M. Admin assistant in public works O&M. And a senior maintenance worker in public... And a senior maintenance worker in public works O&M. And finally, the airport manager. Thank you. Council Member Brown, any follow-up? Okay. Anyone else? So I'm going to ask a question. Please. What about all the other positions? Yeah, so at our meeting in January, I'm going to speak to a number of those other positions. And candidly, I think I'm going to see through that. I think that we're going to end up filling a lot of those. I'm going to recommend it at least. Because candidly, we have to continue to operationalize our services to the community. And for that period of time where we were in dire concern that we weren't going to be able to fund new positions, we went ahead and froze current positions. And so we're seeing now the light at the end of the tunnel to a certain degree. And if in fact we're going to have to pull back, then I will be the first one to come to you, sir, to say, you know what, we need to reverse course and go in a different direction. I'm looking at ways of bolstering our ability to attain a level of success that I know that this Council desires. And candidly, even in one of the positions that was on that list, the airport manager, I have some ideas on how to move forward with that in a way that won't impact the general fund. So we're looking at creative ways of how to continue to fund these positions. And I'll be coming back at the second meeting in January with my list of all of those. So, to say, here's how we would like to proceed as staff. Okay. Yeah. And you're confident that we can wait until that point in time to unfreeze those positions if we choose to do so? Absolutely. All right. I see Chief Madden here. Would you mind coming up for a sec? I'd just like to get your two cents on this. And I know we're already kind of missing the deadline. I mean, we might have someone we can draw from another department or someone out there, but I know we're missing the deadline. I think we're missing the deadline for the new, for training at this point in time, because I believe that's already passed. But maybe you can enlighten us a little on that. Well, yeah, I mean, exactly. The, you know, when we headed into this pandemic, you know, the city manager and council froze those positions. That was a prudent thing to do, just not having any idea what our economy was going to end up looking like. We got to October. Okay. We got to October for that budget presentation. And so just on the sworn side, so we had a sergeant, seven officers frozen during that time. But we had some other positions as well, dispatch, one of the more important positions in the organization. You know, of course, our animal shelter. So in the meantime, you know, we've had a lot of different things occur as well. We had some retirements occur. We had some long-term investments occur. We had some industrial injuries get resolved. And unfortunately, we've had a few officers leave the organization for other agencies. So for some of you that sat on ad hoc, you got to see really the hiring and recruiting process. It's very, very thorough. It takes time. Then the idea of finding that quality person to get into a police academy, that's a six-month program. And then our field training. Our field training is approximately six months. So from the time you actually find an academy trainee position, which is an hourly position, it's a year before you'll ever have somebody seated in that position on our budget. So one of the things that city manager and I talked about is as we move forward, if we pick up these positions, it allows us to get that part of it started and, one, go through the hiring process, which is extensive. Two. Get somebody in the police academy. Knowing that that also buys us time to come back and if city management came back to me and say, hey, it's not looking good for a couple of these positions, these academy trainees would actually be in a better position than they were to begin with because they've already completed a very thorough background with the city of Chico. They're in the academy. We're not the only ones experiencing hiring and recruiting issues in the state of California. So we're going to have to get some of that. So what it allows us to do is get caught up with this kind of snowball effect that occurred with the police department and our staffing levels. All right. Any questions for the chief? So in terms of training a lateral coming over from another department, what's the period of training for that? It depends on the lateral and how their level of experience and training. To be honest with you, when I started here, I was a lateral. I started here 23, 24 years ago. But because hiring and recruiting and retention is so difficult for a lot of agencies, you don't see lateral movement as much anymore. The uncertainties of city budgets leaving, going to another city, and then, of course, trying to compete with salary and benefits and just a multitude of issues there. We do the best that we can. We did get one here about two months ago. That officer was highly experienced at a former agency and is really moving quickly. And so we're trying to find other creative ways. I know that we just signed a side letter agreement with the police union to do a lateral signing bonus to try to generate interest in coming to the city of Chico. All right. And do you see any benefit in unfreezing our other positions tonight? I don't even know if we could. I don't know with the way it's agendized, but we could ask that. But, I mean, in terms of, like, the animal shelter or the park or dispatch particularly is a huge area of concern. Yeah, it is a balance because, like, with dispatch, our training program can only train so many at a time. So that's the other, you know, as much as we want to hire, we've got to kind of stagger that. So I'm always in communication with city manager, making sure he's up to speed. We just had a discussion about the animal shelter. And unfreezing one of those positions. And so we're in constant communication. My staff is constantly reaching out with me and prioritizing the needs. There are a lot of positions there. But, you know, this isn't just about police officers, right? We've got four dispatcher positions, you know, in that group. And that's a vital, vital part of what we do. And then, you know, we're a 24-7 operation. So that support staff is also equally as important. So I will continue to communicate with the city manager, making sure that we're prioritizing the needs of the organization. But just recognize that if you've unfreezed some of these positions now, you're probably not going to see a person on the ground in that position for quite some time just based on those training needs. Okay. Thank you. Any other questions for Chief Mapp? Thank you very much. Thank you, council. We appreciate it. All right. At this time, I'll move to public comment if there's no other questions. Okay. So on this item, we received 21 comments into the Engage Chico platform. And we received one comment during this meeting from Tom Bond on this item. So while you're reading those comments, I will read the names of the Engage Chico commenters. A.J. Lung. Marcy Pittman. Jackie Lung. Jackie Smith. Paula Brackett. Larry Coleman. Jeff Creed. Jessica Haggard. Mary Kay Benson. Karen Wilhoyt. Tina Ortega. Andy Wilhoyt. Deborah Bird. Rob Berry. Gary Vertel. Daniel Rodriguez. Matt Dutton. Nicole Nava. Kayla Christina. Susan Smead. Jessica Montgomery. Kimberly Burke. All right. Council members, if you'd take a few minutes to respond to the comments. Just read those comments. Let me know when you're done. Let's see. I believe there was one more from Roxanne Eldridge. I will double check. I know the city attorney is getting them faster than I am. So. I'm sorry. I think he can be the clerk for the rest of the meeting. I'll gladly turn it over to him. Okay. Never mind. I'll stick with my job. . . . . . . . . . . . . Let me know when you're ready. Good. All right. Is everybody good? And if you guys ever need more time, please just let me know. I'm more than willing. All right. You know what? At this point, I think I'd like to make a motion. But. but I'd like to ask the city attorney too. So if we move this to staffing within the animal shelter, both of our park enforcement positions as well as dispatchers, do you see there any problems with doing that as well? No, I don't. Okay. Then I will move to unfreeze the animal shelter, the park enforcement rangers, police dispatchers, as well as police staffing. I'll second. All right. Just a quick question for the city manager. Did I understand you correctly that you would have brought this item forward in January for further discussion? The budget we're bringing back quarterly, so we continue to bring it back quarterly. So, yeah, we'll be talking about all budget in January. Yeah. All right. Any other comment? Just for that reason, I'm going to be voting no on this particular item. I'd rather have the discussion more fully in January. All right. Madam Clerk. Council Member Brown. No. Council Member Denley. Yes. Council Member Huber. Yes. Council Member Morgan. Yes. Council Member Tandon. Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds. Yes. Mayor Coolidge. Aye. Carries 6-1. All right. So now moving on to item 5.6, Council Member Denley's request, ban of needle programs. Council Member Denley. Yes. Thank you. I am excited to have this conversation tonight. I think that it is something that has kind of been a hot-button topic, if you will, in the community. I think it definitely needs to be hit on the head at this point. So I am hoping to, to garner support to have the City Attorney look into what our neighboring communities have done to ban the needle programs in their communities and see if we can replicate something similar with the proper language in our community. Just a quick point of order. Any questions? No. I'm sorry. Go ahead, Council Member. Quick point of order. This may be for the City Attorney, maybe for the City Clerk. It's my understanding that Council may not take up an issue already discussed and voted on in previous years, unless it's brought back for consideration, reconsideration of a vote. We've received several emails from residents who are confused as to why this request would be brought up after having been voted on previously. Can you help me understand how this item is able to come forward and help the public understand as well, given that it's been voted on in the previous year? Well, I'm not sure that this exact thing, this entire thing was voted on. I mean, the issue was discussed, but I'm not... I do believe there was a motion to implement a ban on needle exchange programs. Is that not correct? Honestly, I don't recall that. So we could look into that. Okay. That's... Yeah, would that affect a new Council Member anyway? I haven't looked at that issue either. Yeah. These are the Council rules. You know, self-imposed. It's not a state law requirement or limitation. It's something that the Council has put into play as an AP&P. My understanding was, through the AP&P, that a Council Member couldn't vote on something that had already been brought forward, but I didn't think that applied to people who at the time weren't Council Members. Well, and, I mean, the reason for that rule is to have, certainly, certainty on votes. This, as I understand it, is a slightly different issue of banning altogether. Thank you. We had received a lot of questions about it in the email, so I wanted to make sure the public was aware. So, Mr. Mayor... Yes, sir. Mr. Reynolds. I believe the spirit of the AP&P is that so someone in the minority on a vote can't keep bringing things back. I got voted. I'll bring it back. I'll bring it back. I'll bring it back. So someone in the minority can't bring it back for another year. I'm not exactly sure how it reads, but I know that that's the intent. So Council Member Denlay bringing it up is appropriate. Well, and I think to that point, too, is we don't know what the actual motion is yet. You didn't make an official motion as of yet, so we don't know what the actual motion is either. So if it's different, and I don't believe... At least in my recollection, I'm watching meetings at the city attorney. Well, we'll let her make the motion and go from there. So why don't we... Any other questions at this point in time? I have some comments. Council Member Heber. I get that some people are afraid of SSPs or Syringe Service Programs, but that fear overlooks the overall benefits and net positives of those programs. Here's what the Center for Disease Control states on its website about SSPs. SSPs, Syringe Service Programs, are proven and effective community-based prevention programs that can provide a range of services, including access to and disposal of sterile syringes and injection equipment, vaccination testing, and linkage to infectious disease care and substance use treatment. SSPs reach people who inject drugs, an often hidden and marginalized population. Nearly 30 years of research has shown that comprehensive SSPs are safe, effective, and cost-saving, do not increase illegal drug use or crime, and play an important role in reducing the transmission of viral hepatitis, HIV, and other infections. Research shows that new users of SSPs are five times more likely to enter drug treatment and about three times more likely to stop using drugs than those who don't use the programs. SSPs that provide naloxone also help decrease opioid overdose deaths. SSPs protect the public and first responders by facilitating the safe disposal of used needles and syringes, and that is from the Center for Disease Control website. I agree that the program as it existed in Chico did not adequately address used syringe disposal. I personally believe that a syringe exchange is a needed compromise, but the banning of any and all future SSPs eliminated eliminates a useful tool in reducing disease and reducing IV drug use. All right, any further comment? I do have a question for the City Attorney. We had previously discussed a ban on syringe access programs, and at that meeting I had, when you had discussed some of the bans from other communities as is being requested today, you had mentioned, I believe, that if a program seeks a permit from a state entity rather than a local entity, that that state approved permit could not be essentially outlawed in the local community. Does that still stand today? So there is a preemption issue that needs to be evaluated further. In general, that holds true. I don't know. I have not researched it. I don't know whether there has been, you know, that still stands or if there is an exception. I do know several cities have gone about this process. And just because something, there might be a preemption, potential preemption issue, it might also be that a city can go forward and adopt a land use regulation on this. Someone would only know the answer to that question if one of these cities that has implemented a ban on syringe access programs then received confirmation that a program in that city had received approval from a state and started to operate and then whatever else ensued. I don't know of any city that's adopted a ban where that's happened and litigation has ensued. That would be something that we could evaluate as well. I'll have more comments after public comment. All right. No more questions and we'll move forward with public comment on this item. Okay. So on this item, 5.6, we received 59 comments in Engage Chico. We also received an email comment from Tom Bond. And while you're reading those comments and the information provided, I will read their names. A.J. Lung, Marcy Pittman, Kirsten Norris, Lisa Currier, Jackie Smith, Herbert West, Julie Threat, Larry Coleman, Kristi M., Steve LaFaurie, Catherine DeBosch, Crystal Maddox, Suzanne Wong, Jessica Haggard, Karen Wilhoyt, Tina Ortega, Andy Wilhoyt, Deborah Bird, Rob Berry, Stephanie Stomp, Gary Vertel, Daniel Rodriguez, Matt Dutton, Nancy Doherty, Kathy Mann, Christina Palm, Amy Marie, Jamie Strigge, Nicole Nava, Tenille Gates, Kaitlyn Lube, Lisa Salzman, Kim Dietz, Chanel Fowler, Amy Stolman, Oscar Madison, Natasha See, Gina Backs, Joe Steffi, Michelle Ritlinger, Robbie Sorensen, Cindy Walker, Jameson Bomer, Roxanne Eldridge, Taylor Skinner, Cassandra Lee, Heather Clark, Brian Bullen, Susan Smead, Michelle Cooper, Ashley Jones, Deborah Jones, Ruth Sornoff, Jessica Montgomery, Michelle Hale, Suzanne Campbell, Carolyn Ai, Kimberly Burke, and Amanda Riley. And the emails. And you also received an additional one. She spoke and engaged, but Nicole Nava just sent another email through the public comments. I got that one too. Okay. And the issues related to the issues related to the issues related to the issues related to the issues related to the issues related to the issues related to the issues related to the issues related to the issues related to the issues related to the issues related to the issues related to the issues related to the issues related to the issues related to the issues related to the issues related to the issues related to the issues related to the issues related to the issues related to the issues related to the Where were we at on the time? Where were we at on the time? I'd like the extra time. I timed myself so I could finish these. I timed myself so I could finish these. I timed myself so I could finish these. If not, we can entertain a motion. I have some comments that I'd like to make before a motion. So I'm going to vote no on efforts to ban all syringe access programs for multiple reasons. One, we may or may not be able to do that. We can ban a city-approved program, but based on what we've been told, we can't override the state with a local ban when they approve applications for SSPs. So let's vote tonight. We won't actually do anything to end SSPs, but it will be a symbolic effort to say we don't like needle programs. Now, you're each entitled to make that statement, but when we recognize or we believe that something happening in our community may do more harm than good, but we also recognize the good that it does, as indicated by a breadth of evidence from state and federal public health entities, it does seem prudent that we approach the issue with collaboration in mind. We know that SSPs significantly reduce the spread of communicable diseases, we know that they increase entry into treatment by intravenous drug users by creating relationships, we know that they lead to discontinuation of injection drugs at high rates, we know that Butte County has confirmed that we're seeing an uptick in precursors to HIV and Hep C, we know that the county won't take this issue on and collaborate with local organizations or implement a program of their own, we know that the organization that previously operated an SSP has been searching, had been searching for any means to get out of the public space and into a building, but to no avail, because they recognize, as well as any of us do, that for a multitude of reasons an outdoor public location is far from ideal for a program of this kind. We know that they actively consulted with stakeholders since the program started, and that the current SSP, the syringe exchange program portion of that program, is inactive. So knowing all of this, why are we starting at a ban with little chance of success, instead of considering how a program like this could be successful? And achieving all of the good that SSPs have proven to achieve? Why are we so intolerant of something that none of us are experts around, that we can't work toward a solution that benefits everyone? Why aren't we discussing syringe disposal sites, indoor locations for a program, collaboration with the county, and negotiation with any organization that comes forward with a program of this kind, perhaps one that fits our community better, according to the folks on this council? It seems illogical, and frankly a little bit lazy of us, to regard the evidence and the benefit with an action like this. Just because it makes us fearful, concerned, and uncomfortable doesn't mean it's wrong. It means it's time to engage more thoughtfully in dialogue. So I will not support a ban on all SSPs within the City of Chico. I believe that it's lazy and that it's a callous action that we could take. So, Mr. Mayor, if I may. Please. Ah, wow. Illogical, lazy, afraid, and callous. That was all in 60 seconds. Sorry, I'm a little stunned. I'm going to go ahead and make the motion that we direct the city attorney to do the research to find out exactly what can and cannot be done as far as banning needle distribution inside the city limits, recognizing fully there are some constraints, the state, who I am not terribly impressed with much they're doing these days. So if you could... I don't know, Mr. Jarrett, I guess I need to know if you need to bring that back to us so an ordinance could be crafted. In other words, I can't necessarily make a motion to ban the needles because you've got to figure out how to do it. Correct? Actually, you know what? Let me rephrase it this way. I'll make the motion that we direct the city attorney to find any and all legal means to ban needle distribution programs within city limits. Okay, we have a motion. I do have a comment, if I could, before we continue. Yeah, absolutely. Okay. Just as bringing this forward... I was just waiting for a second. No, totally. We have a second. Fire away. Yeah, I just wanted to clarify. I do appreciate the data that Councilmember Brown and Councilmember Huber have provided from organizations like the CDC and others. I appreciate the research and looking into it. I think we all do care about this issue and want to get the best understanding we can about it. I think it is important to acknowledge that the majority of the data provided by these studies do focus on the population being served by the SSPs and not the community as a whole. In addition, these reports and studies are not based on the data that we have provided. They are based specifically on our community. When making decisions on issues that are so controversial for our community, I do think it is important to evaluate the firsthand experience that our community has had with SSPs. When we look at Chico's experience, we can see that within the first few months of the Needle Handout Program operating in Chico, needle litter reports with Chico PD went up exponentially. Needles were found by the dozens and even at times hundreds at school campuses, playgrounds, creeks, and parks, areas intended for our most vulnerable to safely recreate. When an operation is in progress, it is important to recognize that the data is being used to help our community. When the Chico program was first launched, it was recorded providing syringes to a minor and was also known to be handing out hundreds of needles per participant. While only accompanying these needles with sharps containers, it would hold a slim fraction of those needles. This disregard for the safety of our youth as well as the direct causation of hazardous needle litter in our environment is unacceptable. Once this program began operation in Chico, it rapidly became clear that the consequences were far more numerous than the claimed benefits. I understand that the claimed benefits of the needle distribution are related to reduction in Hep C and HIV. When we look at the numbers, overdoses account for three times the deaths in America when compared to HIV and Hep C deaths combined. For example, based on the most recent numbers available from 2018, Butte County has listed having five new cases of HIV. In comparison, so far this year in Chico alone, just Chico, not the whole county, it can be observed that there have been well over 50 drug overdoses documented via the Chico Police Scanner. The difference between these claimed benefits and apparent risks is really upsetting for a lot of us. And I've heard that from the community. These are people who care and who don't want to see these people sick and continuing to depend on needles. The risks associated with intravenous drug use is proven to be associated with increased instances of domestic violence, child abuse, child neglect, sexual assault, sex trafficking, aggravated assault, increased property crime and more. And personally, thinking about this over the last almost a year, I'm sure time flies by, but personally thinking about the idea that one of the volunteers in our community could be handing another $1,000 to a volunteer. Another community member, the needle that their life is lost to is truly devastating beyond words to me. While the benefits of proponents, the proponents for these programs, I don't doubt that they're well intentioned, but when I look at the effects on our community, not just generalized studies, I can see personally that the risks far outweigh any claims of redemption. Our neighboring communities such as Oroville, Gridley, Biggs and several more have already taken steps to protect their communities from the harm caused by these distributions. I think it is worth any gray area in the law to pursue this as they have. And when choosing whether or not to allow operation in our community, we need to look at data that assesses the risks and benefits on the entire community, not just a small portion of the population being served. We need to look at this data, not larger cities or cities in other states around the country. What do needle programs look like for Chico specifically and uniquely? I believe when we look at the community as a whole, the solution is clear and Councilmember Morgan already made a point. We need to look at the issues and issues related to the issues related to the issues related to the issues related to the issues related to the issues related to the issues related to the issues related to the issues related to the issues related to the issues related to the issues related to the issues related to the issues related to the issues related to the issues related to the issues related to the issues related to the issues related to the issues related to the issues related to the issues related to the issues related issues related to the issues related to the issues related to the issues related to the issues related to the issues related to the issues related to the issues related to the issues related issues related to the issues related to the issues related to the issues related to the issues related issues related to the issues related to the issues related to the issues related to the issues related to the issues related of time of which they would talk, which would far exceed what we gave the public, which is on a standard notion, three minutes. And everybody who's spoken since we started last week has stayed under that three minutes, so I really appreciate that. I think that's just respectful to the public that we serve. So with that, Madam Clerk, could you take the vote? Okay. So there was a motion by Council Member Morgan, seconded by Council Member Denley, to direct the City Attorney to find any and all means to ban the needle distribution in our city limits. Council Member Brown? No. Council Member Denley? Yes. Council Member Huber? No. Council Member Morgan? Yes. Council Member Tandon? Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds? Yes. Mayor Coolidge? Aye. Carries 5-2. All right. So item 5.7 is Council Member Morgan requests reconsideration of a vote. And I believe we also have a report by Chris Constantine, Assistant City Manager. Come on down. Chris is really here to be able to speak to any questions that Council might have. I know it's Council Member Morgan's item. So if he wants Chris to give a briefing. I mean, we're happy to. But Council Member Morgan? Well, I think I owe it to the Council and the public to understand. I mean, I know I said it when we brought it up the first time. So through a variety of time has gone by and there was a vote and the City of Chico, or at least those that voted, the majority said we would like retail cannabis in this community. And here are all the wonderful things that come along with all the horribly negative things. And the only positive things that came with it. I mean, other than people that need it. I mean, people that need it for glaucoma and things, even whatever, recreational, that's fine. But they kept saying, oh, we'll have all this revenue, there'll be this, and we'll have tax dollars when you hire more police officers, and on and on and on and on. So that was all talked about. And that was part of the package that was sold to us as a Council when the ordinance was passed. And we said, yeah, four retail sites and unlimited distribution and all these things. And I'm opposed to most of that and the way it went on. But I get that's what the people want. So I am in no way. I'm trying to say no retail cannabis and no delivery in Chico. First of all, we know that delivery is being done anyway. And we can't say no. People can come from out of the community to do that. What I am asking for, well, I would like to reconsider my yes vote on the fee schedule because the fee schedule included no revenue generator, which is just a fancy word for taxes, which I'm generally against. But we know that there are some serious downsides to retail cannabis. And unlike in some other times when people have said, oh, there's evidence, there's research, and studies have shown on more than four occasions, I have given all of that data. I'm not going to do it again. I'm tired of reading it. And it's not from very good sources anyway. Johns Hopkins and Harvard and Boston Children's Hospital, these guys have no credibility. However, if we are going to take all of the downside, and we have spoken as a Council and a community that, yes, this is something we want, we should also get the promised upside. Which would be the revenue generator. Which this fee schedule did not have. So my request is to revisit the fee schedule and determine the best way to move forward to make sure that the city gets the revenue, the promised revenue that goes along with retail cannabis. I don't know exactly how many cities there are in California that allow for retail cannabis, but I know the vast majority of them do have a tax measure attached to them. So one of the things that we would do is go and look at how much are they charging, how likely is that to happen. Okay. So we can move forward with this in the manner in which it was sold to us. This is about the integrity of following through on the things that we had a committee for and a vote for and the Council talked ad nauseum about six different times. So whether this was omitted accidentally or on purpose, I don't know. It's not relevant. But to do the right thing, we've got to give the city the revenue that was promised. This fee schedule does not do it. All right. Thank you. Do you want to refer anything to? Well, sure. And so I realize that creates a number of challenges. We've had one applicant so far. I'm sure I've heard from very many others that are like, oh, I was going to apply, I was going to apply. What's going to happen here? And I said, this is not me trying to keep you from having your business or doing any of those different things. But we were promised this. Please don't be upset with me. Be upset with whoever did this wrong the first time. And we'll get through this. I know Mr. Constantine. Soon after my request for reconsideration, put a pause on it because he didn't want to take anybody else's application money because that would be wrong to be holding on an applicant's money and not knowing exactly how we're going to move forward. And then it was my understanding he's got a report on perhaps some ways we can move forward and then we might need to request the city attorney. How do we go from here? How do we legally add a revenue generator at this point so we maintain the integrity of this entire process? So with that. Chris, is that a good enough opener? Absolutely. It provides the clarity that we were looking for in specifics. So in terms of pausing the program, here's we've seen a lot of questions about what's happening. What's the direction? Where's council going? The fees can under Prop 26 can only be cost recovery. Cost recovery of the process we have for evaluating these applications. The process for which is defined in the resolution. The resolution which is premised on all of the obligations and requirements of the city's ordinances and state regulations as it pertains to cannabis. So while seemingly small in terms of reconsidering fees, it could potentially be a very dramatic change in the program and have a dramatic impact on those who are trying to apply. So what we did is we paused the internal evaluation of applications that were coming in. And so we had one applicant who's paid $10,803 plus $154 for zoning verification. Zoning verification. It's the first step in the process. And what we did is we set up the process so that if you ended up landing on a property that wasn't eligible, you didn't lose all $10,000 because that's not good for any business. And so we would just refund the fee and minus a refund fee of $38 and the $154 zoning verification fee. Folks were very happy that we've set up a process that was business friendly. The concern that we had, while we paused the process, of the program, so we didn't incur costs in processing this first application or any subsequent one that would come in, if an applicant came forward to provide their application and fee, we wouldn't deny them. We would accept it, but it would sit, and so we wouldn't incur the cost. So if something changed in the program, they know that they're going to get their funding back. Their primary concern has been all the investment that they put into. Some of them have signed leases because there's an obligation to either have a lease or a letter of intent because there are so many people that want similar properties. It's a property owner's market to determine, who do I go with, the guy or gal with the letter of intent or the one that wants to sign six months of a lease? Well, I'll go with the one with the lease, and so there's a lot of security and risk associated with this entire program. In terms of accomplishing the goal that Councilman Morgan has talked about, the fee schedule that was brought forward was intentional. The fees are not all the fees that are required as part of the cannabis process. So the only fees we brought forward were the initial application, initial background fees to be able to start the application process, the initial application process. We still need to come forward with fees for the annual renewals of the permit, the annual renewal costs that were going to be something subsequent because we were trying to get the program implemented as is required under the ordinance. In terms of the tax, understanding that a tax, while that was not the direction that came out of the program, was not the direction that came out of the program, was not the direction the issues related to the obligation and obligation related issues related to the obligation related issues related to the obligation related issues related to the obligation related issues related to the obligation related issues related to the obligation related issues related to the obligation related issues related to the obligation related issues related to the obligation related issues related to the obligation related issues related to the obligation related issues related to the obligation related issues related to the obligation related issues related to the obligation related issues related issues related issues related issues related issues related issues related issues related issues related issues related issues related issues related issues related issues related issues related issues related issues related issues related is akin to the type of process we talked about with a sales tax measure. We can't just vote, I believe, a tax and we have to go through a more laborious process, but it's something that many cities have done that have implemented this program. So what we would need would be the direction from council to pursue a revenue measure associated with cannabis and to determine what amount, extent, and whatnot, or to ask for the research to be done first, to come forward to see what are other cities doing, how can we do this, pros and cons, and then provide direction to staff. But initially, if that's the, you need to make a policy decision, do you wait on awarding permits until this is in place, if that's the intended goal? If that's the case, then the first item we recommended was to pause the program so that we don't get into a quandary of somebody applying or incurring obligations and then the whole program changing on them somewhere in the next few months. And then secondly, to give us that direction, do you want us to go out and do the research as to what's happening on the tax and revenue side and to bring it back to you, or do you just want to provide direction and say, bring forward the item to initiate a revenue measure? Either one of those. And I'll go one step further than what Chris just mentioned in regard to decisions about awarding permits, decision about continuing to accept applications is a significant action. I think it's important to note that the decision about awarding permits is a significant action. I think it's important to note that the decision about awarding permits is a significant action. And so that's why that's included in the staff recommendation in order to not give those false indications of what really would be allowed and also to not have a situation where we're faced with holding money and holding an application and then circumstances change, et cetera, et cetera. So. Understood. Any questions for Mr. Constantine? I have a question. Mr. Chair. Thank you for your report. During the Cannabis Advisory Committee meetings, we discussed different types of applications, the CUP or Conditional Use Permit Development Agreement as part of the licensing issues. One of the things that came up with the development agreement, somebody from the public had voiced, is that you can essentially implement a revenue generating agreement. Is that a percentage for that business to operate on that specific property by using the development agreement rather than a CUP? So I know it's not sales tax revenue specifically, but it is a percentage of those profits that would immediately be going toward the city from the revenue of the business operating on that particular property. Can you speak to that? It seems that it, I'm fully supportive of talking about a sales tax measure. It was absolutely the appropriate next step. I would have supported it in the last ballot or the last election, but because we had a sales tax measure we were already discussing and when multiple are on a ballot, it decreases the likelihood of both of them passing. We, I did not push that one forward. So I think it is absolutely appropriate and time to start having that discussion. However, there is also an opportunity as far as I understand it, and please confirm this or not, to immediately get revenue by moving to a development agreement rather than a CUP. As far as immediately moving to development agreement, that would take an amendment of the code or an addition to the code. And then it also layers on some additional approvals and that weren't considered under this current ordinance and the approval method. Of course. That makes complete sense. And let me speak a little bit to a development agreement because we've been working on one with a major tax generator. We've been working on one with a major tax generator for a number of years. It provides the flexibility of an arrangement of a development that is a beneficial vote for both parties in the development agreement. The question that I'm not educated enough on, and I don't know the case law and what applies here, is the use of a development agreement as a purposes of generating revenue. That's a question that I would defer to the city attorney to be able to answer. There are agreements out there that have resulted in abatements. Whether it be a property tax abatement or sales tax abatements, those are now disclosable on our annual financials. It's an involved process. We have to demonstrate what the public good is from that implementation. But I would defer the question to using that as the mechanism for revenue, as a revenue generating tool to the city attorney's office. My language may be haphazard, but I would love to hear that as well. I don't have an answer on that tonight. I'm sorry. I know that there are issues out there and cases out there of a number of cities who have used development agreements for revenue. I know there have been some problems with the application of those. And so we'd have to research what the latest is on that 2020. Great. I would definitely be interested in finding that out. All right. Any further questions? All right. With that, we'll go to move to public comment. Madam Clerk. Okay. So from Engage Chico, we received 23 comments. We also received one additional public comment through the public email account, and that was from Tom Bond. And I will read the names of those from Engage. Anita Hoy. Marcy Pittman. Lisa Currier. Jackie Smith. Catherine Dishbach. Crystal Maddox. Jessica Haggard. Jennifer Pratt. Andy Wilhoyt. Deborah Bird. Rob Berry. Gary Vertel. Matt Dutton. Amy Marie. Erica Witowski. Nicole Nava. Robin Engle. Michelle Cooper. Ruth Sarnoff. Jessica Montgomery. Michelle Hale. Curtis Bortle. And David Peterson. Thank you. Any others? No. Did you say Tom Bond? Yes, I did at first. All right. Okay. So we'll give a few minutes, and then we'll move forward from there. Not a break. We'll just take our time. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Okay, if everybody would just let me know when they're ready. Okay. Yeah. All right. Okay. So moving forward from here, I'm going to start with a comment, actually. And it sounds to me like additional discussion was already. And actually, Mr. Constantine, would you mind coming back up for just a second? Sorry. No, we're good. So just the yes or no on these. So it sounded like additional discussion was already needed for the fees, correct? Yes. As we move forward, at least in terms of renewal fees, those things? Yes. Okay. And then the city did tell people that there would potentially be taxes that they would have to pay in regards to this business? Yes. Okay. And then? That's it. I just wanted to make sure that that was clear so the public doesn't have an understanding that we're doing something necessarily out of the ordinary, that this issue would have had to come back in some way, shape, or form, at least for both of those items. Thank you. Yes. You know, and I don't believe necessarily a development agreement is the way to generate revenue for a city. It's pretty clear that taxation is generally what's used in terms of, you know, because fees are only recoverable for the actual cost. So, I guess that's my two cents worth. I think we really understand that, you know, the city has voted on this. I know in terms of looking at the city, in terms of what the city voted exactly, in terms of our citizens voting on this when it was on the state ballot, they voted to approve it. Obviously, the state of California voted to approve it. I don't know if everybody up here is against it or not. I'm certainly not against it in terms of the overall, overall opinion about our voters making a decision. And I'm not going to doubt their intelligence to move forward on something. You know, we make mistakes occasionally, and sometimes we push forward and it proves to be better. So, I'm willing to give it a try based upon what the voters of California said and the voters of Chico said. But I do think we need to proceed very carefully, and I do think this does need to have some revenue generating side of it as well. So, any other comments from council? I'd like to make a motion to direct staff to just pause and delay while we investigate the possible fees and or taxes to include a sales tax, sorry, sales tax and the development agreement. Sales tax for the future, but can we proceed with a development agreement or a fee schedule agreement or something sooner? I'll second that motion. Okay. All right, we have a motion and a second. Any further comment? Mr. Consonant? Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Just a clarification, depending on the timeline. The reason having an application in is it establishes the application date, which is the date that's used for if a sensitive use occurs after that date within 600 feet or 1,000 feet if you're a junior high or high school, it makes that possible. It's not a good time to have a property ineligible. So, if you're in now and something shows up, you're good. The question for the council is, based on the amount of time that the evaluation would take, is there a desire to, when we pause the program, to retain or not retain somebody in the process, or would you want to leave that at the discretion of staff to determine whether to do so? Mr. City Attorney, sir? Yes. What do you think? Well, there is one argument. As Chris is putting it, there are other arguments that you don't get vested until time of actual award. The more conservative approach for cities is to interpret it the way Mr. Constantine has stated it. So, the person, there's only one application. There's one that is in right now that's in that kind of vested. It's within that time frame. So, I think Mr. Constantine raises a good issue. If this motion does pass, then that pauses the program as of right now, meaning tonight. Tomorrow morning, someone couldn't drop off an application and say they are vested. This isn't an ordinance. This portion of pausing the application process was winning the vote. the application process was began, it was per the ordinance, at the discretion of when staff was ready to take applications. So at this point, we're no longer ready to take applications, then causing the implementation of the ordinance and the application process. And so a yes vote on this would cause there to be no more applications being accepted while the fees are evaluated for that purpose. And so then if I heard Mr. Constantine right, then we could leave it to staff to evaluate the proper new date once we had proper fees? So there's a lot of there's a lot of compliance. The ordinances in the two ordinances in the resolution, there's a lot of requirements. There's a requirement for a 45-day period from the start of an application process. And so we started that on November 20th. And that 45th day fell on a holiday, which under the resolution would say it goes to the next available date, which was January 4th. We did the pause of the processing and we would evaluate whether to add whatever amount of time, let's assume today we didn't need to to to pause it. Do we add seven days to that period to ensure there was 45 days of unfettered access to the process? The question that we really have to grapple is a pause means, as the city attorney had said, we are not going to accept, we are suspending until we determine what next course we're going to take. But then the question derives around an individual that's in the process. The resolution in the ordinances specified the analysis of sensitive use of the obligation and the obligation used to be around the obligation date. So in my mind the obligation date for the one individual has occurred. In which case if we suspend this for three months, the person's property if it passes zoning verification and there were no sensitive uses and it proceeded through the process to get a provisional cannabis permit and then the state permit and then the conditional use permit process and then the end and the requirements and the go, go and here's the your official authorization to operate and that no sensitive uses came up as that application date, then they're good. Or the alternative, no, we're pausing this. It's going to take a substantial amount of time. We don't want to hold onto somebody's money. We want to restart a 45-day period. They could reapply, in which case we will refund the individual's money. The application date is null and void because we canceled that process, and then we begin again. Since we're only talking about one applicant, can we leave it up to them? We did that for this initial period until this council meeting, so we could do that also. We're only talking about the one person. No one's going to come apply tomorrow, so I'd make that part of my motion, however they want to handle it. Okay, perfect. So to clarify, we will pause the program, not accept any additional applications, or conduct any additional processing, and allow any applicant who has applied to decide. We'll let them decide whether they want to refund and rescind their application date or to maintain themselves in the process. So that's a friendly amendment to my own motion, which will require... Oh, it wasn't my motion. Would you accept my friendly amendment to your motion that I seconded? I would accept that. Can you repeat everything Mr. Constantine said? Vice Mayor Reynolds, just because so much time has passed since the motion, I want to make sure that I'm understanding. The motion is to have staff bring back information about sales tax measures and the possibility of developing a new one. So I'm going to ask the motion to be approved. So, Mr. Castillo, we're going to have a motion to approve a new development agreement at a future meeting. Yeah, and I said development agreement slash fee agreement. I mean, I believe we as a council can be creative and do anything that we can, and I know that can come back a lot quicker than a sales tax measure can. I'd like to know about putting it on the sales tax, or on the ballot for two years, obviously, but I'm more interested in getting something sooner than later. I'm absolutely not trying to drag this out two years by any means. Thank you. Okay, Madam Chair. Clerk, do you understand that motion? I do. I just want to clarify, though, I have Vice Mayor Reynolds making the motion seconded by Council Member Morgan to pause and delay the application process while looking at the fees. And while the fees are being evaluated, whether that be development agreement or some other innovative way, those are my words, I apologize, to not accept any additional applications. And I believe that there was a friendly amendment. Okay, thank you. Okay, so, we're going to move to the next item, which is, we're going to move to the next item, which is to check with the one applicant, to see if he would like to get a refund or resend his application process. Is that accurate? Yeah. Okay. I think get a refund or maintain his application and date process. Okay. Thank you. Any further comment from Council? All right, with that, Madam Clerk. Council Member Brown. Aye. Council Member Denley. Yes. Council Member Huber. Yes. Council Member Morgan. Yes. Council Member Tandon. Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds. Yes. Mayor Coolidge. Aye. Carries 7-0. All right. Okay, at this point, any items added after posting of the agenda, of which we have none. So, we'll move on to reports and communications. The following reports and communications are items provided for the Council's information. No action can be taken on them. We'll provide the functionality and functionality related to the issues related to the issues related to the issues related to the issues related to the issues related to the issues related to the issues related to the issues related to the issues related to the issues related to the issues related to the issues related to the issues related to the issues related issues related to the issues related to the issues related to the issues related to the issues related to the issues related to the issues related to the issues related to the issues related issues related to the issues related to the issues related to the issues related to the issues related issues related to the issues related to the issues related to the issues related to the issues related issues related to the issues related to the issues related to the issues related to the issues related and basically acknowledging the city of Chico's tremendous and overwhelming effort during the campfire to help support them, our brothers and sisters up on the ridge. And so I just wanted the community to celebrate this as well, because it was not only the city that stepped up as an organization, but the entire community as a city that stepped up. And so this proclamation goes to everybody here in Chico for the yeoman's effort that went into that extraordinary situation that unfolded before our eyes just a couple of years ago. So I just wanted to make sure and recognize that to the public, because it feels good when you get acknowledged for a tremendous effort that was done just here recently. So in addition to that, I will also just share with the public that we did receive some information today from the town as well, and I anticipate that we'll further that discussion in January surrounding the city of Chico. And I also want to make sure that we get some information about the city of Chico, because it feels good when you get acknowledged for a tremendous effort that went into that situation. So that's on the horizon for those that are interested in that. But with that, that's all I've got to report this evening. Thank you very much. City Manager Orme? Yes. I saw a press release go out about a warming center. I was wondering if you could update the public during this meeting about that as well. Yeah, absolutely. So looking at the criteria surrounding our initiative to put forward a warming tent, we are proceeding with that tomorrow. They're very far and few between, candidly defined, and it was being taken down in another city. Fortunately, we're able to get that, and they're going to be setting it up tomorrow. So Public Works did a tremendous job to make that happen. Obviously, a lot of the parameters that are within our policies and procedures dictate that if the humidity or the rain and the temperature and the winds, there's a lot of varying components, and tomorrow it meets that criteria. So we will be putting that up tomorrow, and it's likely to stay up for at least a couple of days. Thank you, and thank you to the staff for making that happen. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, thanks for bringing that forward. That's a good one. All right. Okay. So moving on to Boards and Commission biannual recruitment update. Madam Clark. Thank you, Mayor Coolidge. And, Council, I just wanted to just seize this moment to bring up the biannual recruitment, which is currently underway. We had started it the 1st of November. We had to extend it because we had very few applications. We are still getting it. We are still getting applications in. I extended it until January 4th. We have six boards and commissions and a number of positions to be filled. And so I wanted to let the Council know I also sent out information with the application and the general process. The applications can be found on the City's website. If you're interested in applying, you have to be 18 years or older and a registered voter in the City of Chico to be considered. So I just wanted to let you all know that and to encourage you, if you have individuals that may be asking about different boards and commissions, to please send them our way. We would love to have them apply. Again, that deadline is January 4th. In terms of the appointment process, in the past, we've always actually had interviews. Obviously, with the COVID restrictions that are currently in place, we need to be creative, and I'm working on that. I'm thinking about having some of these. I'm thinking about having some type of a Zoom meeting where the applicants could address the Council in a safe manner and be able to answer any questions that you might have in consideration of their request to be appointed. In addition, two years ago, we actually made those appointments, the Council did, at a meeting in February. And due to the COVID, I would assume that we'll be making those appointments in February as well. And the functionality of the functionality and functionality of the And the functionality and functionality. And the functionality and functionality. And the functionality and functionality. And functionality and functionality. functionality and functionality. functionality and functionality. functionality and functionality. functionality and functionality. functionality and functionality. functionality and functionality. functionality and functionality. functionality and functionality. functionality and functionality. functionality and functionality. functionality and functionality. functionality and functionality. functionality and functionality and functionality. functionality and functionality and functionality. functionality and functionality and functionality. functionality and functionality and functionality and functionality. interested, that would be great. And again, you can send them my way or send them to the city's website. Please let them know that they have to not only complete the application, but they also have to provide the required supplemental for that particular board. So if you have any questions, I'm open to answer those. All right. Any questions? I have one, but Mr. Morgan, do you have a question? My question, Madam Clerk, I don't remember how long ago it was. It could have been two years, but it could have been four. We changed the way we appointed commissioners. It used to be for the commissions that had seven members, every council member got an appointee, and we voted on all the other ones. And we still had everybody come speak, but you knew you'd get the person you wanted. Then we changed it to an overall vote. Can we go back to the other way? Oh, let me ask this a different way. How would we go back to the other way? Well, it would just be... It was messy and, what was the word I was called earlier? Callous the last time we did it. There was a lot of consternation. You are correct in the fact that the council did in 2019, I believe, in January, change it back to appointment by a majority vote. Prior to that... The council had put into place an individual appointment because we have a number of boards and commissions that actually have seven members. The council at that time felt that it was important to just make individual appointments. And selected by the body and confirmed by the full council. So you may make an appointment, may make a recommendation, you bring that forward, the full council gets to... And then the board will vote on it. So you're in compliance with the requirements of that appointment process. So all you'd have to do is direct me to bring back a policy update to our current process and get that in place before you make your appointments. Thank you. You're welcome. And at what time will we make that request now? Well, it says, yeah, you can't act on it tonight, but you can direct me to bring it back. And I can do that at the next meeting, if that's something that the council wants to discuss. So for the newer council members, we have it set up where the seven-membered advisory bodies, we have four positions on each one that will be in... That are in concurrent... They run concurrent with the four incoming council members. We also, for the Bidwell Park and Playground Commission, as well as Climate Act, we have one additional position that was an unscheduled vacancy. So for those two positions, it would require a vote of the full body to appoint for those positions. But the incoming council members, the four of you, would actually make selections. And then in two years, for the other districts that are coming in, the three council members would make their individual appointments for a four-year period. But to be clear... The four incoming council members could make the appointments, but the entire council has to vote yes on them. Absolutely. It's making... You're basically nominating your individual, and then you are bringing them back, and the full body has to act on it. Yeah, because I was unaware that the council had actually done away with those in my absence. And just to make a plea to my other council members as we think about this, whatever group has... I don't know if it happens to be in the majority. I'll just say group because it's easier than one side or another. They can pretty much, particularly if they're in the majority for an extended period of time, they can stack the entire committee with their opinion, which I think is incredibly unhealthy. Plus, voting as a group, you don't have council members who are directly responsible for the comments made by individuals, which we've seen come back to haunt us in the past. So, you know, I think... At least a group in the minority would have some representation on the committee instead of none. And because this community often switches horses, I think that's healthier for our community. So I'd like to see a return to it. I just think it'd be good to have people with differing opinions on these committees. And I don't think a six-year run for either side is healthy. If... For stacking a committee, I don't think it's healthy. I think it's better to have a committee full of one side or the other. That's my two cents. But did you have a motion there, Mr. Morin? Or was there any more discussion? I didn't make one. I thought that's what you asked. Should we wait until council member requests? Say that again? Should we wait until council member requests? Well, that was going to be my question. And the city clerk said we could do it now, but it did seem more appropriate at council member requests. But it's... It's next, so, I mean... Yeah. But I do think that's the right process. Okay. So, we're going to move forward. Council member, what's your thought? What's your thought? Where's it more appropriate? It's however you want to do it. If you notice under reports and communications, it indicates that no action can be taken unless it's brought back at a future meeting under reports and communications. So, but we're almost near, right next to the council member request, so, I'm happy with that. Mine was just an update. Okay. We'll move forward with council member requests. Council member Morgan, we'll let you start. Okay. Oh, okay. Where are we? Council member . Oh. I got to think about the words you said. I would like to request an agendized... I'm not ready to say this. Sir. Discussion on the... To ask the city clerk to bring back a policy update on the appointment process. I'll second. Okay. Just a quick note. I'm happy to discuss it. I know we had a little bit of discussion around it. I think one of the things that gets lost by moving to that system is that people who would apply freely by virtue of not knowing anybody on this council might do so under the current mechanism. And I think it really does take away from the public's ability to participate in that process. And then that selection to be... To have us use our connections and networks to appoint people. So for that reason, I'm probably not going to support it when it comes back. I'm happy to have the conversation, but I would like us to consider how we might be shutting out members of the public by moving forward with this process. All right. Any other questions? Discussion? All right. Madam Clerk. So a motion by Council Member Morgan, seconded by Mayor Coolidge to bring back a policy and to direct the city clerk to bring back a policy update on the appointment process. But is that an actual... So if you do it on a... I think it's under this item. You're... Is that I... Am I supposed to bring... I just need clarification. Do you want me to bring a policy back that includes that change back to the way it was before or are you going to have the discussion and then... I think we have to have a discussion first. Okay. Perfect. I think if you had the policy ready, we could put it in place so we can then appoint our commissioners. We're going to be late anyway. Well, I mean, we have the wording from when a council did it before. So it's all... I'm getting a nod by the city attorney. So I think that means we're okay to do it that way. All right. For just a discussion. Discussion, but have the policy ready or... You could do it either way. Yeah. My concern is that if you have commissions that are engaging in quasi-judicial approvals, applications, say planning commission, ARHPB. And... And we don't have a sufficient number of people on those boards to have a quorum because people have either lost interest or we've had vacancies that need to be filled. And so we just can't meet quorum. And then we run up against statutory deadlines in the Permit Streamlining Act or other state law. And we end up forfeiting our rights for local control because a permit needs to be granted. So I would recommend whatever you do with this, do it as fast as possible and make your appointments as quickly as possible to fill those boards. All right. Okay. And if we have both, we have both. No, that's fine. It's all there. I'll accept that. If that's an amendment or whatever, we're going to reorganize the motion. So that's fine. Go ahead and call the vote. Okay. Council Member Brown. Just to be clear. This is just to have a discussion, but there could be a vote on it at the next meeting. Okay. I'll say yes. Council Member Denley. Yes. Council Member Huber. Yes. Council Member Morgan. Yes. Council Member Tandon. Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds. Yes. Mayor Coolidge. I'm going to vote yes, but I'm also going to thank Council Member Brown. I think you have a valid point and I think that's something I need to think about. So yeah. Thank you. All right. Any other questions? Any other Council Member requests? I have one. Fire away. I don't... This doesn't really help our situation of getting people appointed, but it seems how we're on a stay-at-home order. I don't... I think we should maybe discuss at the first meeting in January if we should go back to doing essential business only. And I think we're working on a way to get public involved, but I really would like to have as much public involvement as we can. And having these typed up things just the... It doesn't feel the same as having either Zoom or whatever we have. So anyways, I'd like to bring back in January a conversation of whether we should go to essential business only and until we're more opened up as a community. So is that your motion? Yeah. I'll second. All right. Madam Clerk. Council Member Brown. Aye. Council Member Denley. Yes. Council Member Huber. Yes. Council Member Morgan. Yes. Council Member Tandon. Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds. Yes. Mayor Coolidge. Aye. Carries 7-0. Any other Council Member requests? Okay. I actually have two. So well... And prior to that, just a quick thank you to our staff for moving so quick from one agenda to another. We basically had two days to do committee meetings. We had to take appointments and prepare everything. You guys did an excellent job. So thank you for that because that was a fast-moving process because we were done here on Tuesday night and had the new agenda out by Thursday. So I think it's breakneck speed. That was pretty amazing. The two items I want to bring forward is one is a discussion of a road bond and whether that ends up in the Finance Committee, which I would assume would be the best possible place for it. But with our roads failing like they are. And many places in our community, particularly my district and some of the other Council members' districts, I think it's important to start having a discussion about some of the other topics that are a priority in our community. So just a wide-ranging topic on a road bond issue as a possibility. So back to Ms. Brown's point. So yes, I will second your motion to have a discussion about that knowing the discussion will likely send that idea to Finance. So it's not going to... It's not going to add to an agenda if we start... Not much to an agenda if we start doing essential business only. I imagine that would come up and would refer it very quickly to Finance. So I'll second your motion. All right. Madam Clerk? Council Member Brown? Aye. Council Member Denley? Yes. Council Member Huber? Yes. Council Member Morgan? Yes. Council Member Tandon? Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds? Aye. Mayor Coolidge? Aye. Carry 7-0. Um... The next is... Well, it's a fairly easy request and it's one that happens in our community on its own. But I'd actually like the city to take some involvement and staff to just look to assisting and possibly partnering with an agency to have a community-wide cleanup of our creeks, of our parks, of our bike trails. The community is absolutely hungry for this. You know, a lot of us have just spent time going door-to-door throughout our community. And I can tell you, people on both sides of the street are really hungry for this. They want to see our park clean, they want to see our park clean, they want to see all these other things, you know, graffiti, wherever it might be. I think obviously there's some partnerships with Beck. They've done amazing jobs in the past. But I'd like to really schedule something for the spring and have the city support that with the full weight of the city and really invite our community forward to be a part of this because I think they're just starving for it. And I think it'd be amazing what we could do. I think it'd be amazing what we could do in a weekend. So... This could be a cool way to see the power of our public information officer. That too. Get behind the whole campaign. That too. And that would be an added benefit. So this time. I'd second that motion. I think it'd be great. Thank you. So, Madam Clerk. Councilmember Brown? Aye. Councilmember Denley? Yes. Councilmember Huber? Yes. Councilmember Morgan? Yes. Councilmember Tandy? Yes. Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds? Aye. Mayor Coolidge? Aye. Carries 7-0. Microphone on. Anything further? No. Okay. I would just quickly request that moving forward for those who aren't aware or we could have a quick discussion about it that we do when making council member requests submit that narrative. It is really helpful to be able to review that stuff ahead of time. And so just moving forward. If we can agree to that or if we don't that that can be said. I would appreciate it. I think that's a valid concern. And you know particularly and not even purposely just recalling that we only had two days from meeting to agenda. So if everybody could just make a note of that. That we will move forward in that way. So at this point in time we will adjourn the meeting. Wait. Mr. Mayor. Just everybody understands what Ms. Brown is talking about. I think that's a good point. Yeah. Okay. Thanks. Okay. So at this point we'll adjourn the meeting. No, no. And we won't adjourn. We'll recess to closed session in conference room one. And do we have any closed session public comments or council disqualifications for any of the items? All right. Hearing none we will be back for a report out. Cool. Thank you. Bye-Bye. Bye-Bye. Bye-Bye. Bye-Bye. Bye-Bye. Bye-Bye. Bye-Bye. Bye-Bye. Bye-Bye. Bye-Bye. Bye-Bye. Bye-Bye. Bye-Bye. Bye-Bye.
