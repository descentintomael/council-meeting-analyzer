 Okay, it's a little bit after one o'clock, so we'll get back started and we probably got a straggler or two, but in case somebody's still coming in, I'll show you guys a couple pictures and maybe a video. This was our glass fire in 2022, and so I spent the first 27 hours of the incident on a water tender and then got released. Thank goodness I was able to go home and get some sleep. And then the city called me up and said, hey, we need to have you go around and start doing some assessments, some damage assessments. This was a house up on a ridge that was under construction. And I thought. It was going to be gone because where the fire was burning through this area, I was really shocked. This was up on Big Rock Road in our jurisdiction, and it was in, you know, construction phase. So there was no protection except for our fire marshal who made these guys do a whole bunch of clearing. And so they did some clearing and he came up there and said, that's not enough. You guys got to do more. And I think in the end. Yeah. Everybody is happy that he put his foot down and made him do quite a bit of clearing because when the fire came through, the house survived. So anyway, let me see if I can get my clicker to start working here. Maybe not. No. No. No. No. No.! I went around and did some assessments. You'll find this a lot. Plastic sewer lids were all melted off. So when I went out there, nothing was flagged. We start trying to flag them so nobody walks around and falls into a septic tank. A lot of hazards after a fire. So you get rid of that. This is a house that survived. I went up to look at it. The deck burned off in the back. But this homeowner ended up giving me a video that I think is in here that I'll show you to show the fire behavior that came up to the backside of this house. And he's fortunate. He just lost the deck around the pool. The house survived with some help of, I think it was an LA County fire crew that was up there doing structure protection. There's our rescue. This was interesting. This is a winery that. Burnt to the ground. Every building on site. Their vineyards were on fire. This was their winery cave. I was shocked to see a wine cave. These wine caves go like into the middle of the hillside. And inside there was wine barrels on fire and the wine was running down, red wine running down the gutter. It was pretty shocking to see, you know, the devastation from this fire. This was that. This is an actual video. This is one in the morning. I took this looking down towards the hospital, kind of up behind St. Helena Hospital. And when you see stuff like this, if it will play, maybe it's not supported. Sorry. Anyway, the flames are shooting up above the trees. These trees, I don't know how tall they were. Hundred, 120 feet tall. To see the flames shooting up above the tree tops and then crowning, you know, jumping from one tree to another. You kind of get a healthy respect for it. You know, it's a little bit of a And we were sitting there and I think we were doing pretty good. We had some spot fires, which we put out. And then they said, hey, there's a spot fire up by one of the houses up there. So they sent us and five other individuals. We were in the water tender. And they said, go up there. We went up and it's a little rickety road. It's completely dark, middle of the night, which as an inspector, this opened my eyes. Because narrow gate to get through couldn't have been more than like, you know, I don't know, maybe 11 or 12 feet wide. But our fire engines are around eight feet wide. So we got up there driving up there. We all get up to the top. The first. Engine crew gets up there and gets on the radio and says nowhere to turn around. And we've lost this fire. We can't get it. So everybody back down. We're the last rig coming up. So I jump out of our water tender. I'm running or walking downhill. The water tender is backing faster and I can walk and trying to make sure he's not going off on one side of the cliff or another, trying to fit through this narrow gate. And so we all made it down. OK, but we're all backing down. And. You know, fires burning all around. And so when that happened, I started thinking, you know, when we get another house under construction and this was in the county, so it wasn't my jurisdiction. But we do have some areas that are a little more rural, still in the city limits that people want to put in gates. We are fire department on their fire code amendments, widen the gate provision to 16 feet. And I do the inspections and they're not getting less. And 16 feet for me because I was out there and I don't want to be backing at one thirty in the morning trying to figure out how to get our water tender back down this hill. It's usually you're into the side of a hill on one side or you're dropping off. I'm going to roll down embankment on the other, you know. And so, you know, people don't think about that. They build these houses way up in these remote areas and they don't think about it until there's a fire. Right. Right. Right. We've had some structure fires in our area, especially in the winter where only our battalion chief can get up there in his four-wheel drive pickup. We just don't get engines up there and the house usually burns to the ground. So summer, it's usually the roadway's okay, but we still want to make sure stuff is wide enough and, you know, we're not going to be in a bad situation. There's the water tender I was working on. This is a glass fire. This is about two hours into the incident when it started. They were saying try to prevent it from jumping. Silver. Auto. Trail. I don't know if any of you have been to Napa Valley, but Silver Auto Trail is kind of the main road. One of the main roads. There's two, Highway 29 and Silver Auto Trail up through the valley. And we were successful for a few hours and then it jumped the road. The wind came up and we couldn't keep it. There's one of our crews. This was, that was a Hennessy fire. We brought everybody dinner. So, unfortunately, I guess it says this computer doesn't support. The video, so I can't show you the video. It's going to show you the video of that one house where the guy, he had it on like a ring camera. And you could just see the fire swirling around it as it's coming up the hill towards his house. And the wind, you could hear the wind blowing. Unfortunately, I guess it's saying this computer doesn't support that for whatever reason. I'm not a tech guy. So, I don't know how to fix that. So, anyway, sorry about that. The last fire, extreme wind speeds. That is true at different times. And the Hennessy fire, too. So, the Hennessy fire, I was the first on the first in engine. The way I got there, so we were actually toned out for a tree on fire on Silver Auto Trail. There was light. There was lightning strikes all over the area. And so, we got toned out by dispatch around maybe 6.15 that morning. And we could hear the county was running all over. There was like 100 lightning strikes in our area. Probably more, but I think 100 that had some kind of little fire going. And so, we're on our way to the one on Silver Auto Trail. We're coming down Rutherford Crossroad, Highway 128. And dispatch came back on the air and they said, hey, the RP thinks that. They've got the fire on Silver Auto Trail. The tree's out. But we got a smoke check on Hennessy Ridge. When we were coming down Highway 128, we could see up on the ridge, we had smoke showing. So, we said, no, we pretty sure there's a fire. And sure enough, we got up there. Took a long time to get up Hennessy Ridge. We got Pierce engines, pretty good quality engines. But up some of these real windy, rickety roads, floor it out, you know, you're doing like 20 miles an hour. And if the thing shifts, it's going to be a lot of wind. And if it shifts up to the next gear, you have to slow down to make the turn. You know, so a whole bunch of switchbacks. So, it took us a long time to get up there. Fire wasn't doing much until maybe like an hour later where we have some weather monitoring equipment that we carry on our engine. Tells us wind speed and humidity and a few different things. And we were monitoring that. All of a sudden, the wind just started increasing dramatically. And next thing you know, we heard on the radio. You know, they're going to ground all the aircraft. And this was pretty early on in the morning. The sun was just barely coming up. And we were hoping to get aircraft to hit it. And all of a sudden, we just had, you know, this like 80 mile an hour wind come in with another lightning storm. And it just blew the fire sideways. And then it was off to the races. And the Hennessy Ridge fire that started, you know, it's like maybe seven miles from my house, turned out to be. For a while there, it was either the second or third largest fire in California history. And so it ended up being a pretty large incident. It was pretty shocking because what happens with CAL FIRE, you get assigned a division. And we kept getting driven down the hill on the Hennessy Lakeside. And so you kind of, you're just working in your one division and paying attention to what's going on there. And later on, we got a call from the fire department. And they said, hey, we're going to fire you. And later on that day, I took off about Sage Canyon Highway 128 and got the survey later that afternoon. And realized the fire just burned out that way east. And I was shocked at how fast and how much it had burned in a short period of time. So, yeah, wind driven fires, yeah, you get a healthy respect for fire behavior. And so anyway, but it's all good. You know, the codes. We try to make sure that we're not going to get caught up in the fire. We mitigate these factors. We can't stop all of it. We're just not going to. You know, we have some drought periods where we get really dry years. We were fortunate the last couple years. We geared all up. My son who works with me at the fire department, he did a bunch of pre-positioning. And I know we had a big fire up in the north part of the state up by Oregon border that he went and worked on for about ten days this year. But relative to other years, 2021, we had a lot of fire. And I think 2021 and 2022 have been kind of quiet years. So hopefully it stays that way, at least in our area and probably some of you in your areas. You're not wanting another fire. These fires are horrible. And so we definitely don't need more fires. But probably going to have to contend with a couple of them now and then. So back to the electrical code. The changes in the electrical code. This wasn't like a, you know, earth shattering change here in 210.11. But it was interesting that when I was reading on this code change, I had a contractor tell me that a jurisdiction told them that there could only be one circuit in the bathroom. And it had to be this 12 gauge, you know, 20 amp circuit. And that was kind of a misreading of the section. And apparently the code body picked up on that. And so now they added that one or more. So if you want to add another circuit, the code is just trying to prevent you from running one circuit that has a whole bunch of stuff on it. And, you know, years back when I started in construction in the 90s, we had like 15 amp, you know, circuits, 14 gauge run into a bathroom receptacle. The only problem is by the time you run a 1500 watt hair dryer. You know, it's not going to run. You've just about maxed out that circuit. And then if you add on a curling iron, if you're like my wife, she's got about three or four of these things that seems like plugged in. You're tripping the breaker all the time. So if you want to put in like five circuits, go ahead. But you have to have at least this one 20 amp circuit. So you're not going to get nuisance trips. So just be aware that, you know, the code is not saying you can only have one. You just need at least that one. And that's why they added the wording or more. I don't know if that was an issue anywhere, but I heard about it. Say again. No. So it depends on how you wire it. So you can wire every bathroom in the house on one 20 amp circuit. Or you can pick a bathroom group and hook the lighting and the receptacle in this one bathroom on that 20 amp circuit. So there's two ways to do that. That's kind of tricky, by the way, to do when you're doing rough inspections. You know, then you got to pay attention. Did they hook lights in? Or are they actually looping out to another room? When I was in Arizona, we had an inspector that they looped out to a closet. It was a huge master bathroom. The closet was kind of in the bathroom. And he interpreted that going to the closet for the light was not permitted. And we had a big discussion with the contractor. I think we finally ended up letting them put it in the closet. But the idea is so the code is just trying to prevent you from hooking a whole bunch of stuff to it. So you overwhelm the circuit. And if I got like 14 lights on and I'm plugging in a hair dryer and then maybe a curling iron. Well, I wouldn't use a curling iron. I don't need a hair dryer anymore either. But if I was using all these appliances, I'm going to trip the circuit. That's all it is. It's just trying to get enough circuits in there so you don't have nuisance trips. Okay. The garage receptacles. So they clarify. They clarified this to this change would allow additional garage receptacles on a 15 amp circuit as long as you meet the 20 amp circuit. The whole purpose for the 20 amp circuit is back to the electric car thing. They said everybody is going to hopefully buy a plug-in Prius or some kind of electric car that you can plug in. The 20 amp is about the minimum to recharge. And I think that takes like hours and hours. So they will. They want at least a 20 amp circuit for each bay you need a plug so I can plug in my Prius or whatever electric vehicle I have. But then if you want to pull in a 15 amp circuit so that you have a receptacle to run a radio or something, go ahead. So they just want to make the distinction that you can have additional circuits. You just need the minimum 120 amp circuit. Okay. Arc fault protection. Additional areas have been added. So we kind of talked about this earlier about making sure you're in a metal raceway or you start with the arc fault breaker at the beginning of the circuit. I think most people understand that. I put a little bit of this in there. Because they started kind of clarifying a little bit of language, maybe just a restating of it in number five on this code section. Okay. So that's the first one. And then the exception was that arc fault protection is not required for a fire alarm system. And because the branch, you know, is going to most likely be in a metal raceway anyway for that. Anyway. Okay. Arc fault protection. Low expansion. This is kind of bumping a little bit out of residential. But just I threw this in there to let you guys know that, you know, like guest rooms in a hotel. Patient sleeping rooms. Nursing homes. We sometimes see a residential house kind of converted to, you know, a little boarding care. They might have four or five people there they take care of. So it could require arc fault protection as well. Reconditioned equipment. This is something that's really showing up in the new code here. Maybe more so now than other codes. You know, previous code additions didn't address this. And I don't know what's driving this. I don't know if the supply chain issue. Nobody can get. Because I talk to electricians. They tell me they can't get anything anymore. Can't get a panel. You can't get breakers. We get to houses where we're trying to final. And I'll say, when are you going to call and final? And they'll say, well, probably two months from now because I'm waiting for breakers. So there's a supply chain issue. And I don't know if as part of that we're starting to see a lot more reconditioned equipment. But the code is saying, hey. Maybe some of this stuff we can't recondition. So just pay attention. You'll see this as a common theme in a whole bunch of sections throughout the code. I threw a couple of them in here. But just be aware of that. Countertops and work surfaces. They rewrote this section. Not so much that it was a new requirement. In this picture. And I stole this picture. I didn't take this picture. I stole this. But from somebody. But it's an island and a peninsula. And just be aware of that. You're probably going to end up with a receptacle on each one of these ends. And the code is just clarifying that. You know, it's making it clear. Because almost always, I don't know why it is. But in the kitchens, the contractors, at least in my jurisdiction, you guys probably never have this problem. But they always argue with me about number of receptacles. They always say, well, I don't need a receptacle there. I've got one over here four feet away. And I say, yeah. But have you ever seen the appliances for kitchens? There are always this real shortage. And I say, well, I don't have a short cord. So if I go to plug in my coffee maker or my toaster oven, it won't fit over here. So now I've got this section of counter space that's not usable to me. And the code does not want you plugging in an extension cord. Extension cords are fire hazards. So in a kitchen, we want a receptacle all over the place. And this is clarifying. We should have one no further than four feet from each other. And probably no further than two feet from a break in the kitchen. And, you know, from the edge of the countertop or whatever. So just be aware of that. For some reason, they try to fight over it. Sometimes they say the homeowner doesn't want one there. Well, code does. Garages, it just added this for multifamily dwellings. Not a lot of change here. But if you're doing apartments, it would apply there. Equipment servicing. So, yeah. So there was a little bit of new language here. Trying to remember what this was. So on commercial buildings, a lot of times, like this is off a commercial building. These guys had a light up there and a receptacle. But just be aware, you know, the code's going to require a receptacle. Hopefully it's GFI if it's outdoors. It's now, you know, going to be a GFI. It's still going to be required even if it's indoors. But a condenser outdoor. And you don't have to do a light necessarily. But just make sure they have a way to service it. My brother is the air conditioner contractor. Says he doesn't need a receptacle. He said he'd rather have a water spigot for cleaning than a receptacle. But the code requires receptacles. So just make sure that you get one there. The lighting. Habitable rooms. So they added this. Information about a listed wall mounted control device. I don't know that we have switches that were not listed before. I don't know that this was an issue. But there was a whole bunch of sections they kind of added in this language. So just be aware of that. Okay. This is a big change for us. So guarding. So what the code bodies were saying is that a lot of people were getting electrocuted. They'd go to service. And you know it's unintentional. But their screwdriver would somehow come in contact with an energized part. And so now the code is requiring guarding. And so you see over the terminals of this breaker. They ended up. And again my pointer doesn't. But straight down here. They'll put some kind of a guarding. Here's another picture. This is a picture. These yellow plastic guards. Over the top of the termination screws. And then this is an older panel. To be on your right side of the screen. That I took from the. This is a picture from probably five years ago. Before guarding was required. So just be aware that the code is now starting to require a little more protection. That you know if they just pull off the dead front to replace a breaker. Hopefully they're being careful. But you know we're going to add in a little bit more guarding for them. So all the panels. That you see starting in January should have this. Also surge protections required. They're saying with the GFI arc fault smoke detectors. All these electronic devices. That if there's a spike in the you know or surge in the electricity. It could damage them. So surge protection is required. And this includes change outs. So not only new panels in a new construction. But if you go to do a service change. You have to do the surge protection. And it's either class one or class two. This is a class two I believe. Somebody I snapped this picture. They did a service change out. And they had this in there. I'm like hey why are you doing this? They go like I said I don't know. Boss said just start putting these in. We bought a whole package of them. So they're complying before the code kicks in. So this is a class two. The difference between class one and class two. Is one is integral. And one is like an aftermarket. But that's what they look like. And then there's a little bit of change on the number of disconnects. So historically the code has always talked about six switches or less. If I had six switches I didn't need a main breaker. And the code was just recognizing that if there's an emergency. I can shut off six switches pretty quick. I don't need to hit a main breaker. If I got 42 switches then I want a main breaker. But there's a difference. There's been a little bit of change on this. And so make sure you familiarize yourself with this. The big issue is. So I think I got to. So you have to meet all these requirements here. But the big issue is like a panel like this. Now this panel complied. Because you can see there's a main breaker on the service there. But then it's feeding four apartment units. And each apartment service has like a. I think these were 125 amp breakers. The idea was is that if I pulled this dead front off. To change out one of the breakers. And so can't see it. But on between the main service. And you know this big old box here. And the meters. I had the four breakers there. I could pull that whole front off. And. And then all that would be live in there. And so now the code's saying. Hey you got to have a main breaker to disconnect. Or de-energize that. So you know before they. Might have been changing one breaker. And still had three that were live down below. So if they hit this main breaker. It shuts everything off. So I think the manufacturers already knew this was coming. From the 2020 NEC. So you're probably not going to find any of this old equipment out there anyway. You'll probably start seeing this. But just be aware of it. Okay. We'll speed through. How we doing on time. So some of this stuff. Was related to photo the take systems. I don't want to spend too much time on this. But just be aware too. As an inspector. If you ever see somebody in PG&E's poll section. That's probably not a good idea. In fact. I don't know the utility that permits it. So just be aware that sometimes people go into the. PG&E poll section. Want to do connections for whatever reason. Either the bus bar can't handle the amount of back feed or whatever. And that's a problem. There's a way to do this. And that's not the way to do it. So anyway just be aware. There's some of these meter switches. You guys can read through that. Usually it's PG&E or whoever the utility is. It's authorizing this. So make sure you get a letter. Saying that they will allow this. If you don't get a letter. Probably not going to be allowed. So 230.85. The wording change that has to say emergency disconnect. Rather than main disconnect. They said this was done for firefighters. As a firefighter. I always understood what service disconnect or main disconnect meant. But maybe they want to make sure it's clear. It has to be in red. And it has to say emergency disconnect now. So this was a newer panel on a duplex. I believe we were doing. And that's what they look like. It is important. You know if I see a meter in a main. I'm not too worried about it as a firefighter. But it is important. I've been on a few fires. I remember I went on a barn was on fire. It was right next to the house. And I saw a service out front. And they told me go secure all the utilities. And so I shut off the power. And there was still power. So I started looking around. I couldn't find another service. So the property owners owned like another property next to it. That somehow was feeding this barn. We never did figure out how to shut off power. So we run into that as firefighters. Now that one was during the day. We just work around it. We were able to. You know if the fire was extending to that. Because we had to expand it. We had a little exposure problem. The barn is right up against this house. And it was just venting right in against the house. So we're spraying water on the side. We were able to save the house. But did a little damage on the outside. But just remember firefighters are coming to fight this fire. And we want to de-energize everything. And sometimes we can't figure this out where the disconnect is. I went on a fire a couple of years ago. And we just couldn't figure it out. It was the middle of the night. All we could see was a meter. Sticking out of the wall. No main disconnect anywhere. The house was like a half a mile off the road. So maybe down at the bottom they had some disconnect. I don't know. Anyway I thought about it afterwards. I thought you know I should have just cut the meter seal. And pulled the meter. And we would have shut off the power. But I wasn't thinking about that. The house was already almost on the ground anyway. But just you know be aware that firefighters are trying to de-energize stuff. And that's what a lot of this. I mean you look at it. And you go as an inspector or contractor. You go come on. I know where the disconnect is. But if I'm coming in at 2 o'clock in the morning. I don't always know where the disconnect is. I'm unfamiliar with the property. And it's really getting interesting now that they have battery backup. Generators will hit the main breaker. And all of a sudden a generator fires up. And everything's back on. So we want to make sure everything's clear. And group it all in one place. So make it easy for us. So we're not getting electrocuted. Over voltage protection. Let's see. This was with the surge protection devices I think. Okay. Some fittings. Not a big change there. So this on the services. So I don't know how many of you guys remember in the previous code. A couple codes back with residential. Not commercial. But with residential. We always got a little bit of break on the feeder side. So when I go do a service change. I always knew on a 200 amp service. I could have a two odd copper. Four odd aluminum. And we had a little chart in the code. In the NEC. Or the California electrical code. And I think in 2016 they took that chart out. I don't know why they did. Then they came up with this thing about 83%. So you have to do this calculation. And I don't know about you. But I'm not good at math. Not on the fly. So I don't know. I usually have to get a calculator. And I love the old chart. Well they brought the chart back. And I just typed in what the chart sort of looks like. I didn't put in the whole chart. But generally. Copper number four for 100 amp service. Or two odd for 200 amp service. If this was commercial. It would be a three odd copper for 200 amp. And the reason is. Because the commercial building. We're expecting everything on. Like we're in here in this building. All the lights are on. The air conditioning is going. But that's not the reality in a residential home. Most of the time. You know. Somebody might be in one room with one light on. They might have the AC going. But if it's two story. They don't have all the lights on upstairs. And downstairs. Generally not. Unless you've got kids like me. They sometimes turn on all the lights. But generally. We're expecting lesser loads. We're not expecting 100% of every load on. Like a commercial building. So there was always this chart. 310.12. They brought it back. And then. Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg and you see conduit pulled apart all the time because that conduit in you know 100 plus degree temperature it's like 130 on the roof metal is going to expand and contract it's going to pull fittings apart and stuff like that the wire is going to get hotter than a firecracker so it's just recognition that if you're in a hot climate if you were in vegas or in arizona you have to do a d rating on the cables to make sure that you know they can handle the amperage that you're placing on them replacement receptacles just be aware that a lot of people don't realize this if you're going to start changing out receptacles you're going to be tasked with arc fault or ground fault requirements just because you're changing out receptacles so that's what 406 is all about so there's a little bit of new language in there you receptacles and damp or wet locations so the big change here is we always had the three foot by eight foot horizontal or three foot horizontal from the rim of the tub or top of the shower stall threshold and then eight feet vertical above that and that's an all-encompassing space so if you took this three foot by eight foot box and put it there there should be no receptacles or lights or ceiling fans anything in that space so the the issue is going to be though is that when you get to a situation like this where you have a shower and this i don't know if you can see it but right up against at the end of the vanity i don't know why this centered doesn't work on the pictures but but I can't point to it, but there's a receptacle right at the end of that vanity, and that's within three feet of that shower. And so the code is saying you can't have one there now unless there's no other place to put it. But, you know, generally, especially if you have two sinks, they put one on each end to comply with the requirement of having a receptacle within three feet of the edge of the sink basin. And they can meet that criteria by putting a receptacle right in the middle between two sinks, but they don't want to put a hole in the mirror. But we just need to look at that. Like in previous codes, and I'm not saying this is the right way to do it, but it's the way I've always done it, is if I got to the edge of the shower pan, I would say this is the shower stall and this is outside of the shower space. But. Now we're getting some language that maybe I got to look a little closer. And so I would always say, well, this is the tub or shower space over here, and I can have a receptacle here. It's not really the best way to do it because ideally we don't want receptacles close by to a water source like that. I mean, I think I've told contractors before, ideally the code doesn't want any electrical in the bathroom. And that's the starting point. But we have to be respectful. We have to be realistic. We need lights. We need receptacles. So then we have to look at placement. Make sure someone doesn't plug in a radio or something that's going to fall in the bathtub. Or, you know, have a light fixture that they're going to come in contact with. So we just have to, you know, just be aware. So when we're roughing in, this is the time to catch this. Not at final. At rough end, hopefully you're looking for this stuff. Make sure that we're keeping receptacles, if we can, three feet away from a tub or shower space. Going to be kind of tight in some small bathrooms. But just be aware the language is there. Tamper resistant receptacles added a couple locations. You know, we always thought, well, okay, tamper resistant. Here, this picture's got this. I took this picture inside a kitchen. Had a tamper resistant, had a big TR, and the one right next to it had nothing. So they're supposed to be tamper resistant if they're in a location that's required. The code is now asked to be tampered with. It's asking us to put them in garages. We're worried about a kid trying to jam that paper clip or coat hanger into the receptacle and getting shocked. So this is for kids. But the code is now saying detached garages, accessory buildings, common areas of multifamily, assisted living facilities. Just be aware that tamper resistant receptacles kind of expanded. Okay. California Energy. So, 408 of the electrical code recognizes that we have here in California some additional requirements in our energy code. And so they're now noting it that, you know, we're going to have to have panel boards to service all these additional electrical requirements. And we're going to see in the next book here, we're probably going to pick up the pace on it. But the energy code's going to recognize that. It's going to require us to go all electric. We're trying to get away from natural gas and propane. And so if we're going to do that, we're going to need some service panels that can be able to handle that. And that's why the service panel, the minimum size is going to be 225 if you build a new dwelling unit. And that's going to be an ADU or single family dwelling. Any kind of new construction is going to require the minimum of 225. So, we're going to have to make sure that we're going to be able to do that. So, we're going to have to make sure that we're going to be able to do that. And then we got to the reconditioning of equipment. It's talking about you can't recondition it. I took this picture to just point out that water and electricity don't mix. I was down in Porterville. Fire department called me and said, hey, we ran a structure fire and just thought you'd like to be aware of it. The panel burned up. It was raining that day. Water was coming in. It started dripping. It started dripping. It started dripping. Here's the bus bar. So, it kind of started ponding on the top of the breaker and then spread back to the bus bar and shorted out. Electrician came in, wiped it all clean, put in a new bus bar and was off and running. But that was before this new code. So, now we're going to probably slow down a little bit and say, hey, can we do this? And so, just be aware there's a lot of new code sections. Start talking about this. Can we recondition or replace parts on the service like this? So, just be aware. So, bathtub and shower areas, luminaires installed in a bathtub, kind of back to that three foot by eight foot all encompassing zone there. And then it talks about luminaires located within the actual outside dimension of the bathtub or shower space. Shall be marked suitable. For wet or damp locations, we're subject to shower spray. And I don't know if this light fixture was rated or not. Probably not rated for a wet location. But just be aware of that. May meet the first part of the code section, but then maybe the second part. Maybe it's not rated for wet locations. Installation and fire resistant construction. There's some information there. Appliances that reference. Energy code. Okay. Some of this is going to apply to commercial stuff a little bit. Okay. Disconnecting means we talked a little bit about this, but again, we want disconnecting means everybody's got the generators now. Make sure that they have a disconnect switch. And make sure that it's all grouped at the service. So, we should have remote shutdowns. Because sometimes they'll put the generator like, you know, like a power outage. You know, on the backside of the property. Long ways away. And we want to make sure that we can shut them down. They're easily accessible. And then here's where I talked about the Ford truck. It's all electric. Can be plugged in to power his house if he wants to. Or he can go the other direction and charge his truck. And so, we're going to start seeing a lot more of this as these vehicles become popular. There's the receptacle. It said that it needed to be GFI'd. And so, I asked him if I could test it. I went and grabbed my tester. And sure enough, it was GFI'd. It's built into it. I don't know if all the electrical vehicles have that. But this Ford did. I don't know how we're going to enforce this. But anyway, the code has some wording on it. Okay. Don't want to spend too much on pools. Little bit of changes on pools. If they're changing a pool pump, they're probably not coming to you for a while. They're going to have to get a permit, but they should. If they do come to you, then you're going to look for GFI protection. It's important that we get our pools and anything around water should be GFI'd. And then, they changed the language on the wet niche luminaires for the spas. If you can drain the spa down a little bit, you may not have to put that light all the way up on the cool deck. I don't know. This technology is getting really old. All the old. Halogen fixtures. Everybody seems to be doing LED. So, but there's still some of these out there. And then, you know, some of the bonding requirements. I'm going to kind of skim through. This was one of these little kits that you can buy. So, flips up, you know, interlock kit. Flips up to let the breaker on for the generator. Plug and then shut the main off. And this is a pretty good quality product. I was allowing this in our jurisdiction. I probably wouldn't have a problem with that. Although, I think the new code, the way I read it is this is kind of going away. And saying you got to do a listed transfer switch. Make sure they get a warning label. So, if they have a generator on. The premises that we know about. And it's even better if they show us a location. But at least have a remote switch there. And, you know, same with photovoltaic or batteries. We want warning labels right at the service there. Again, it's not for as much for the homeowner or the contractor. They are pretty much aware of it. But we have to think about the emergency responders coming in. Especially if they come in the middle of the night. Nobody's home. Nobody is there to tell them where the stuff is. And we have to think about that. So, you want to make sure they easily find it. Here's the warning labels. Got kind of a little diagram. Little map showing where everything is. So, that's good. A lot more stuff about warning labels. Disconnecting means. And some information on storage systems. Did you guys want to take a break or keep going? Okay. Try to power through this. We're going to go through some of the stuff. Plumbing code and mechanical code will fly through this. Not a lot of big changes here. But I'm going to point out a couple things that I think are kind of interesting that they change. So, you know, the big thing is a lot of temperature limiting devices. Probably most of this is going to apply to commercial. Because I think they're even saying like, you know, hand washing sinks. We've got to have some kind of temperature limiting control. But you can do it through, you know, a hot water heater control. And you can do it through a, you know, a hot water heater control. Or you have a device in the faucet itself. So, there's a couple different ways to do it. Provisions. There's new provisions for backflow. Although, I don't know if your city is like my city, Public Works handles backflow devices. So, I don't really get into that. But if your jurisdiction, you're looking at backflows, just be aware there's some new language on that. Temperature control. We talked about that. Guardrails on top of roofs. I'll show you a couple pictures. I'll show you a couple pictures on that. Pressure relief valve discharge piping changes. This kind of changed. They want us to now put the discharge into a readily visible location. So, new standards for DWV, the drain waste and vent piping and their fittings. I don't know that that's going to be a big change. But just be aware the code has some. And circuit venting, that's more related to commercial stuff. Updated fuel gas provisions. And then, you know, the language about that the permits are good for one year instead of 180 days. Just reflecting what the other codes are saying. So, the big thing here is both the plumbing and the mechanical code basically have the same language in their sections. Talking about guardrails on roofs. Historically, the code is just required. It's a little different. Because then, like if I've got a stair rail or, you know, a guardrail. I don't know. I don't know if it's going to be up at the top of stairs or balconies. That I'm expecting kids to be up or the general public to be up and on. You know, we have to have, you know, no more than four inches in between the guard spacing. So that, you know, a kid can't stick their head through there or fall out. But that's not the same for like a mezzanine in a commercial building. They're required to have a guardrail. But they could have up to a 21-inch spear go through. So they still have to have some kind of guarding. But we're not expecting the little kid to be up on the roof servicing an air conditioner. But we have to worry about a maintenance guy if he loses his footing that he just doesn't go falling off the roof. So there was a little bit of language added to this. And it just kind of mimicked the commercial code about the 21 inches. So, just a little bit of language added to this. Just be aware of that. I'll show you a picture of an older guardrail that we had in the mechanical code. So the plumbing code talks about dead legs. It has to have a method of flushing. I know with our sprinkler systems, if you have a sprinkler system that does both the mastic water and the fire sprinkler system, a lot of times we had like a toilet connected, you know, at the end of the line that every time the toilet flushed it would keep the water clean in the pipe. But the code's just kind of anti-air. So we're adding some language. If somebody runs a piece of piping for future, like to their backyard or something, they're supposed to have a method of flushing it. I don't know if that's a little angle stop on the end or something. But showers and curbs and thresholds. So everybody's doing these curbless showers now. So what ends up happening is we're waterproofing the whole floor. And the idea is it kind of goes back to aging in place. But they want to be able to roll in their wheelchair. They want to be able to easily get in as they get older. And so no problem there. The code language had that if they were going to do this, that they had to waterproof the adjoining room. And the intention was to just do the bathroom, not the bedroom next to the bathroom. And so it just clarified that language. So nothing really changed as far as the intent. They just maybe it was misinterpreted. And maybe somebody was requiring them to waterproof half the house. We don't want that. It's just in that one room we should waterproof it so a little water spills out from the shower. We're not damaging the flooring. This is temperature limiting stuff. California energy code. Just be aware we keep on getting references back to the energy code. Because the energy code has a lot to say about water heaters and other different appliances. Check valves and leak detection devices. Gave some standards there. Okay, the discharge piping. So the discharge pipe has to terminate to a point that's readily observable. So before we would just drop this, you know, outside into a flower bed or maybe to the garage floor. Just be aware the code is giving a little more clarification on the flow. The location. I don't know how this is going to really work out. I don't know if you have this water heater in the garage, does that mean dump it out by the front door? So if this TMP activates that I can see there's, you know, actually a problem. I think that's kind of what the code is getting at. If it's on the other side of the house that I never go to, this thing could be, you know, dripping water out there and I have no idea. So the idea is though that this is gravity flow. So we have to get this to a location that's readily observable. But we can't do it with a pump or, you know, can't run it up hills. So, I mean, there's going to be some challenges there. So, you know, we're going to do the best we can with it. If the front door is right on the other side of the wall, that's pretty easy. Just punch it through the wall and put it there. But if not, maybe we're going to have to get creative and see where we can get a good location on it and still meet the code requirement. Pumps. I don't know how many of you deal with well pumps. But probably out in the county jurisdictions. You probably do. A little bit of information there. The code requirement for insulation. The plumbing code just got aligned with the energy code. I think there was like a little bit of a difference. Subtle differences. But basically they made it pretty easy. They just refer back to the energy code. Energy code is pretty easy. If I got a three quarter inch pipe, I need three quarter inch thick insulation. If I got a one inch pipe, it's one inch thick. And so on. It kind of follows the trade sizes up to I think about two inch. And then it changes a little bit. The plumbing code, our current 2019 code had a whole section on residential fire sprinklers. And they deleted that. They should have. It's already in our California residential code. And we have NFPA 13D. So it's kind of just being repetitious. They took it out. This is the part that I think is interesting. I don't know how many remodels you guys do. In our town, everybody's remodeling a bathroom it seems like. This is a really common project. So they take out a tub because nobody wants the tubs anymore. They want a shower pan. And the code has always said if I have a tub, I've got to have it an inch and a half, which is probably what the house is built with. If I have a shower pan, I have to have a two inch drain. So it means if you have a slab, I've got to chip up the slab and get back to the two inch line. So I can get in my two inch P-trap and so on. The code added this footnote that if I'm changing my tub to a shower pan that meets this dimension, basically the three foot by five feet, approximately the size of what a tub is, then I can go ahead and just use the inch and a half trap. You know, the truth is, years ago, we used to have shower heads that, I don't know, they put out like five or eight gallons of water a minute. Or whatever they did. I mean, it came out full force. With all the water conservation, if you guys have a newer shower head, you can barely get a dribble out. So I don't think the inch and a half drain is really going to be an issue for us. I mean, it might be if we have a lot more water volume. But with all our water conservation efforts, you know, probably the inch and a half trap is fine. I guess we'll see how it does. Maybe over time we'll realize, hey, this isn't a good idea for a shower pan. Maybe we'll change it. Maybe we'll change it back. But right now, the new code allows it. So you don't have to tear up the slab or go all the way back to the two inch line. Some wording on clean out. It's not a big deal. The fuel piping, this is important. Okay, if you're going to add something, and again, we're getting away from natural gas. So maybe over time, that's not going to be as big of an issue. But in our town, everybody's getting rid of their tank water heaters. And going to the on demand tankless water heaters. No problem there, except that a tankless water heater is about 200,000 BTUs. And a tank water heater might be like 35 or 40,000 BTUs. So a lot higher demand. And it's really interesting, the stuff we see. I actually saw a bid a couple weeks ago where the contractor bid to the homeowner and said, I'm going to come off the half inch gas line over by the garage for this new appliance. And it will work. But it won't meet code. And so I guess they weren't going to get a permit for it. But the code is telling us, hey, if you're going to do this, you need to relook at the whole gas line. You can't just go, hey, I got a gas line over here. And it's close by. And rather than starting back at the meter and running a larger size line, which is always seems to kind of be the fight. At least it is for me. Because I tell these people, you know, you're putting in this 200,000 BTU. You're putting in this water heater. Plus it's like now way back at the house. They usually put it kind of back by the bathroom. That's fine. Except that now it's such a long run. And gas at, you know, half a pound of pressure. If you don't have a sufficient size gas line, that's kind of your reserve. And it's like your gas tank. You're going to be drawing out that gas out of this little tiny gas line faster than it can replenish at half a pound of pressure. So. You know. Need to up size the lines. And Dakota is saying that. So anyway. Just be aware of that. We kind of need to look at the whole existing system if we're adding on a large appliance. And some new pipe standards. The piping materials. You know, stainless steel. Non-corrugated stainless steel tubing. That section. There was some rewriting. On it. Potable water. This is getting popular. We're probably in our town. There seems to be a push for gray water systems. Most everybody is contending with water issues. So, you know, we're going to have the purple pipe. And there's some information on that. Where, you know, they're not going to always have water available. Or maybe they don't need water available. Like if it's raining outside. I don't need to capture my shower. Or water to water my landscaping. So I'm going to be able to have a bypass valve hopefully. And there's some information on that for this. Mechanical code. Indoor ventilation changed. Mostly to the kitchen exhaust requirements. Here's the guardrails talking about. So this picture I took. This was installed in the Central Valley. Probably, I don't know, seven years ago or something. And if you notice, the guardrail really doesn't have anything in between. Obviously. That's more than 21 inches in between there. So I guess if the guy was up on the roof on a 100 plus degree day. And started getting light headed. He might fall right through that guard. And it's going to go off the edge of the roof. And again, we're talking if we're less than six inches. I mean, you're right there. One wrong move. And you're going to be on the ground. Maybe not so bad from a single story. But, you know, if it's a two story house or something. It's probably, well, even single story is probably not going to feel very good. So the code is now saying, you know, maybe we're going to put some heat. Intermediate bars. No further than 21 inches apart. So somebody starts to fall. They hopefully are going to stay up on the roof. Okay. Indoor air quality. So the bathroom exhaust. So, you know, Cal Green code requires humidistat. And then there's, you know, some wording in this section about exhaust for the bathrooms. You guys can read through that. The kitchen exhaust. The big change here is so I don't think the code was real clear in the mechanical code anyway. And probably not the energy code. So when I was building houses, we could do a non-vented hood range fan that had charcoal filters. And it would just basically, you know, filter out the bad stuff. And then it would blow the air right back up over the top. And the code was. The code is now saying you can't do that. You got to go directly to the outdoors. So it has to be terminated outside. And then the big issue was the exhaust rates. And so in the energy code, they talk a lot more about this. Kind of the CFMs that you need. So if I have an enclosed kitchen. And what they mean by enclosed kitchen. If I have this really small kitchen, that area is going to get polluted a lot faster. If I'm burning something on the stove. That's going to get polluted a lot faster than if I have this large open, you know, living room, kitchen area. I have much more air volume. And so I can get away with a lower ventilation. Also, they give you credit if you're using electric ranges rather than gas cooktops. So little incentive to use more electric. So if you have gas. You have to have a higher air exchange. Little higher CFMs. Okay. Ventilation for openings. I think a lot of this kind of goes back to what the residential code has. You know, if you have a window. Half of it had to be openable. Kind of getting back to the same language there. Some sizing. A ducting. This changes. Was not required for alterations. And now it's kind of pointing to sizing even in alterations. The big thing here is on this energy code requirement for duct sizing. And I kind of put this in the mechanical code. Because we run into this all the time. Especially on additions. For some reason, maybe it's just me. I'm running into. You find they'll put in this new AC unit. And it's got this little cold air return. So does it work? Yeah, it probably works. But it makes the unit work harder. It's less efficient. Plus the people have to change their filters a lot more often. Because you're bringing all this air through. A very small cold air return. And the code is just saying, hey, you got to have larger cold air return filter grills. Larger ducting. So the larger it is, the less restricted it is. And it's going to make the system work more efficiently. And especially with energy code, we're trying to save energy. So the duct sizing. And this kind of shocks people. Because you can see here by the chart. The two ton unit is going to require 600 square inches. Which is a 20 by 30 grill. And half the time we're seeing like these 20 by 24 grills. So they're not even getting close to that. And they might have a three ton unit. So just be aware. Want to make sure we have plenty. Plenty of air flow through that unit. In fact, I just went to inspection the other day. And the lady said, you know, my heater just runs and runs now. With a little tiny grill. And yeah, it works. But maybe not as efficient. She said it just don't run for like an hour before it shuts off. It just takes that much longer to circulate there. So be aware of that. Okay. Plastic piping for venting. With all the new efficient gas appliances. You know, we're seeing PVC vents. The code just says we've got to have, you know, listed and labeled piping. And venting materials for this. I took this picture. This is not crazy about this. When somebody does this. They're converting from an old D vent to putting their PVC up through that. That's a maintenance issue for the homeowner. That caulking around there is going to crack. And they're going to be up there every year. And they're resealing that. So I tell them no when I see that. I'm going to fix that. The code talks about plastic piping where a primer is required. It should be contrasting color. So they do make a clear primer. Which you can't see. But the inspector doesn't know that the primer was used. So if we got purple smeared and spilled all around it. Then I usually have a pretty good indication that primer was used. And we want to see primer. So that we know they properly glued those fittings together. We don't want them coming apart. And a little information on hydronic. I don't know if you guys see a lot of warm floors. We do in our area. The big thing for me is I tell the contractors do not test these things with 100 pounds air. If it's just air by itself. You're making a pipe bomb. Don't ever test plastic by itself. No more than five pounds. If you want to put air and water in it. Water is a great diffuser of some kind of an explosion. The old thing where you take a gun and shoot the bullet into a five gallon bucket. It stops the bullet. That's what we want. But I see all the time people because they see in the code. You got to have this at 100 pounds. Well yeah that's air and water. That's not just air pressure by itself. If that pipe is cracked. It's going to maybe give way. And get somebody really hurt. So anyway. So the code put in there. If it's copper tubing. It can be tested. Not less than 80 pounds. I don't know. A little bit of information in here. Referring back to the energy code for slab insulation for heated floors. Keep going if everybody is good to go. Heat pumps. And all electric is in. So the code is really pushing all electric. And we're going to see the goal for the energy code is to generate and store energy on site. And so that's why they want us to put PV on new houses. I think there's a few areas. Like I think it's up in Shasta. Has a special dispensation where they don't have to install solar. Because all their energy is already green. And I think maybe like smud down in Sacramento. Maybe a couple others. But basically the code is requiring us to do all electric. And then we're going to generate electricity with our solar panels. And then we're going to have energy storage systems. To store whatever power we create. And then we can use that when we get home. In the evenings. So heat pumps are in. Gas is out. And so the mandatory requirements of the code. We have to do the mandatory requirements. They always have to be met. They can never be traded off. There's two approaches to energy compliance. And one is prescriptive. And one is performance. But you still have to meet the mandatory requirements. Regardless of which direction you go. So you either meet the hard and fast prescriptive requirements. Or you have a computer. And you have to do it. You have to build the right wiring. You have to build the right wiring. You have to build the right wiring. You have to build the right wiring. You have to build the right wiring. You have to build the right wiring. You have to build the right wiring. You have to build the right wiring. You have to build the right wiring. You have to build the right wiring. You have to build the right wiring. You have to build the right wiring. You have to build the right wiring. You have to build the right wiring. You have to build the right wiring. basically grouped everything together that was residential and they kind of broke it apart so it used to be low-rise residential buildings and they changed it now to single-family or its multi-family so this is probably one of the most difficult codes to understand and enforce because there's some definitions that are maybe unique to this code that are in other codes so and then it's just maybe the way it was set up so they're trying to make it easier which I'm glad and so breaking apart the single-family and the multi-family requirements hopefully is going to get us to a little better and easier enforcement of this so we have the multi-family buildings and they just kind of broke some of this stuff apart so I give an example of the roof recover and roof replacement so you can see the definitions and just have to be careful because when I did this PowerPoint for our contractors they thought well roof replacement means I'm just completely tearing off the roof no I'm just recovering well the roof recovers I'm just going over an existing layer for example of shingles that's a roof recover by the code Roof replacement is I'm tearing off the shingles and either I'm replacing the sheathing or I'm not but I'm just replacing the roofing material so and then a whole bunch of requirements kick in based on those definitions and then there's also definitions for the ESS which is the energy storage systems because we have to get ready for those. A few changes here for heat pump technology a lot of stuff to cover we won't cover that or bore you with it. So the next 33 slides we're going to talk about are mandatory requirements we have to do this and this is California's way of getting us to an all-electric house. Some of these requirements are going to reply to alterations and additions but the bulk of these is going to say for new construction. So there's some requirements depending on what climate zone you're in if we're changing. Let's see I think I might have got a slide out of order here on this one let me fast forward. I might have got a little bit out of order for some something. So I'm going to go ahead and start with the first one. So the first one is the lighting. So the first one is the lighting. So the first one is the Well the residential lighting. Well I got totally out of order I think for some reason. Anyway okay we'll start talking about some of this. So the lighting controls dimming controls came in for the new residential lighting. So the new residential lighting was a little bit centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered In the past, we've never really had these gasketed, but now it's going to require a little closer fitting around the filter grills. We'll probably start seeing that. This is an old picture of a filter grill. There's not really much sealing on that, and they're wanting us to make sure no air gets by there. On the water heaters, whether gas or propane, again, in the 2022 code, you can install a gas appliance, but you're going to be heavily penalized. Usually what ends up happening is in order to make this work, probably the homeowner is going to choose what they want for gas if they're going to install gas. The code prefers you to go to electric, but if you're going to install gas in order to make this work, you're probably going to choose if you want cooktop, gas at your cooktop, you're probably going to choose that. Then you'll maybe have to increase something else along the way to make the system work. You could install a natural gas water heater, for example, if you want on-demand water heater that's natural gas or propane, but then you're going to have to prep it for electric ready. We've already had the electric ready. We've already had the prep in the code, but what is changing now is we're now going to have to make sure the space can accommodate one of these heat pump water heaters. The space has to be two and a half by two and a half feet by seven feet tall. That's to accommodate the tank. We have to have the hot and cold water lines routed through the designated space, and we have to have a condensate drain. This is what these heat pump water heaters look like. They'll have a tank generally like this, and then a condenser outside. These tanks get pretty large, so it's really tough to fit into maybe a traditional water heater space. That's why the code is requiring this larger size to make sure that we can accommodate these. That's what the condenser looks like on the other side. We need to have the 10 gauge, two. 140 volt branch circuit, and we need to have no obstructions there. Both ends have to be marked as spare, and then we have to have that future space in the service panel to accommodate a breaker, a two-pole breaker, to someday install a heat pump water heater. Then a little bit about the condensate drain. If the... If the dedicated space is more than three feet from the water heater, then this space has to include the following, and then it just kind of goes through the requirements. You got to have the 240 volt branch circuit. You have to have the future two-pole space in your panel. Cold water and hot water have to pass through that space before reaching the gas or propane water heater. And then you have to have that condensation drain. Um... No... No more than two inch higher than the base of the installed water heater. So it allows natural draining without a pump. There's some new requirements for the central fan. And so... If you're... installing one of these systems, this is a new house that's going in, and they happen to be complying with the code long before the requirements kicking in, but... Basically, we're going to see some motorized dampers is what the code is requiring. Um... I guess that's so that no cold air comes in when the fan's not on. Um... We're... Again, we're going for energy efficiency and trying to keep cold air out when it's cold. And so we have the motorized dampers and those dampers will open when the fan's on and then they close when the fan is off. Um... Um... Okay, so the kitchen hood is open. So the kitchen hood is open. Um... The... Um... Ventilation rates have increased. Um... If it's a gas range, requires a higher ventilation rate. Um... And I just threw an example. If it's a 1500 square foot home, requires 50% of capture efficiency or 110 CFMs for an electric range. Or it's a higher standard for a gas range. So you're going to be bumped up to 180 CFMs. So it's going to be a little higher speed fan. Um... And this is a mandatory requirement for indoor air quality. Um... It just talks about whether it's an enclosed or non-enclosed kitchen. Um... Again, the principle behind that is we're just trying to make sure if we have a small kitchen, it's going to require a higher efficiency rate, a little more ventilation than if it's this large kitchen or large room. Um... So that's the principle behind it. And then you have to have readily accessible to occupant on and off controls. Um... Pool pumps, um... They have to meet the federal standard for 10 CFR. Um... Um... Um... Fenestration, um... This changed. So skylights, um... Have a maximum U factor of 45. This changed from, um... 0.58 in the 2019 code. Solar ready buildings. There wasn't a lot of changes in this section. Um... For the ESS ready single family dwelling, um... This is a new section that now requires, and this includes, um... ADUs. 225 amp minimum service panel. And the reasoning... Um... Actually I should back up. It's the bus rating. So as long as it has a 225 amp bus, that's the important part of it. The reason is, is because with the requirement to have solar generation on site and the energy storage system, and then all the electric loads, we want to make sure we have enough electrical infrastructure there for the home. So... 225 amp panel is the minimum. Or the bus rating at least. Um... So... The panels, uh... Are probably going to grow in size that we're going to see. And, um... I guess time will tell if we can get these materials, uh... From the supply houses. All the electricians are saying good luck in finding these panels. I'm telling them this is a code change that's coming up in January. And they're saying you can barely find 200 amp panels right now. So we'll see. So would you say... 200 amp... 225 amp bus water would be the same as it is? So it is the bus... It is the bus rating that's key. So they could have a 200 amp breaker... Main breaker. But the bus has to be capable of 225 amps. You see that a lot in services where they'll say, um... The bus is rated for 125 amps and it might have a 100 amp breaker, main overcurrent protection. Can it do that with a solar one? Yeah. So it's the bus rating. Um... I probably typed that in wrong by saying minimum service panel. Um... It is the bus rating. It's kind of a technical thing. But... So the key is, is can that bus handle it? Because you're basically having all this power feeding onto that bus. And that's what we're worried about. Is the bus going to have a problem? You know, even with solar, we're getting energy from the utility and then energy from the PV. And the idea is that we're not going to, you know, cause a problem for that bus. It's not going to melt down or something. So what's everyone rating the service speeders at? The bus rating or the break... It's a D-rate breaker. Yeah. And then you've got Joe right on there. You're like, hey man, it's supposed to be 200 amp breakers. It's only 135. Yeah, that's a good question. Um... I just wanted to get some of this... Yeah, maybe that's going to be up to the jurisdiction. So in my jurisdiction, I like to look at what that bus rating is. Cause that's the potential. You know, the big thing for me is... So if I have a bus that's rated for 200 amps, for example. Um... If somebody goes to that panel listing, regardless of what breaker's in there now, they're going to look and go, Oh, my bus is rated for 200 or 225 amps. When they buy a replacement breaker, the main current, um... Overcurrent device, um... That's going to be the issue. That's why on solar, um... On PV installs, I always make them... Hopefully you guys that are in building inspectors are requiring them to put a little label that says, This breaker has been de-rated per 690. So, like, we could take a 200 amp bus and we can downgrade the main breaker to 175 amps. And I just bought another 25 amps of back feed on a 200 amp bus bar that I could do 120%. You know, I get my 40 amps. Cause I have 200 amps plus the 120. You know, the 120% is 40 amps on that. If I de-rate my main breaker to, um... Um, 175 amps, I bought another 25 amps. So now I can go up to 65 amps of back feed. And that bus is still protected and safe. So, um... That's the issue for me as the authority having jurisdiction. Because, I'm going to be honest with you, um... That's usually what we're going by. What does that label say? If it's still on there. We run into services that have been there for 30 years. And then it's a guessing game. Like, what's this bus rated for? And of course the contractor is always going to say, Well, that's a 200 amp bus. And I'm looking at it going, Really? Okay. Looks like a 125 amp to me. But, um... You know, you're trying to make sure that you're not going to put on a larger size breaker. So probably I would be looking at the feeders for what the bus rating is. Just me personally. Maybe another jurisdiction has a different opinion. Anyway. So, in San Diego, how much do you allow them to de-rank the breaker before you require a load cap? Well... If they, let's just say, have a 200 amp. Yeah. They want to swap down to 150. And so that's a... But they have a swimming pool, a hot tub, and all that. So that's a good question. That's something to pay attention to. I don't know that there's a specific... There's a specific number where I require that. But something to pay attention to because... So the code... Historically, the electrical code has always said, We got to have a minimum 100 amp service. But you're right. If they got a pool and a hot tub and a bunch of other stuff... I mean, at what point are they getting down so low that they... Are they going to have nuisance trips? I don't know that it's going to be unsafe. They may just, you know, be tripping that main breaker. And so that's something to look at. I... I don't see an issue with asking for load calculations. I try not to go too crazy if it... Like if somebody comes in and says, I'm derating my main breaker from 200 amps to 175 amps, I don't get too excited about it. If they were all of a sudden saying, I'm taking it down to 125 amp, then I might start going, Hey, wait a minute. But keep in mind too, this is my opinion. The world is different from when I was building houses. I mean, holy cow. We were building houses and incandescent light bulbs, 100 watt light bulbs everywhere. And I know there was LED technology out there in the early 2000s, but it was expensive. But now I don't know. I think you can still buy an incandescent bulb, but hardly. I mean, everything's LED. So you buy an LED bulb that puts out what a 100 watt bulb put out and it uses like 11 watts. So the loads are got to be really reduced in lighting. Significantly, which is a good thing. But I mean, we still have the issue. Like you mentioned, if it's a hot tub in a pool, I don't know. We've probably gotten a little more efficient on our pumps, but we still have some pretty good loads with air conditioning and everything. It's a valid point to look at it. Because we don't want nuisance trips. I mean, yeah, we fixed the solar problem, but the guy is resetting his main breaker every other day. We don't want that. Because then you see all the other things. All kinds of crazy things. I went on an inspection one time and behind the breaker was a little, they cut a stick to fit right behind the breaker. I said, what are you guys doing here? And they said, well, that breaker keeps tripping all the time. So we're going to stop it from tripping. Okay. That's a good idea. Works. Okay, energy storage system. So with the energy storage system, you're not required to buy the batteries yet. Thank goodness. That will probably change here soon. But as of right now, so what the Energy Commission says, in order to require a requirement, it has to pay for itself. And unfortunately, the batteries are so expensive right now. I think they're like $12,000 or $15,000 for like a 13.5 kilowatt power wall. They may be more, but I think that's about the target price. The Energy Commission couldn't get that to pencil out. So now what they're going to do is just make you get ready to go. So you have to have a, you know, panel with minimum 60 amps and four backup circuits, which would be refrigerator, a bedroom circuit, outside lights. And then I think another, or maybe lighting in the house. And then I think there's one circuit they can choose whatever, wherever they want it. So minimum of four circuits, or you can, you can do choice B, which is provide a dedicated raceway close to the main service there with, you know, basically it all ready to go with a one inch conduit to have a sub panel and a transfer switch, get it all ready there. But the idea is that we're going to get ready for energy storage because they want it to be plug and play. They don't want the homeowner to have to come and rewire the whole thing. They want the whole house five years down the road if they want to add batteries. So, so it's an entirely new section. So, you know, whichever method you choose, essentially we're getting this house prep while it's being built and everything's opened up. We're getting this thing ready to someday have some batteries that could easily be installed. And they're off and running. Yes. . I have a question. Is PG&E on board or are these companies on board for service feeders? I don't know because a lot of the stuff, the old technology, you know, we build about 100 amp panels, now we're 200 amp panels. It looks like we've got two homes in the road. So, that could be taxing if we have a big shop or if we do the . Yeah, I don't know exactly how to answer that question except that I, I saw a letter from PG&E. I forgot who it was going to, maybe the Energy Commission. And they were just asking the question like, hey, we know there's a lot of requirements. And I think they said in the letter, don't quote me, but as something to the effect of we support what's happening with the electrification of everything. Their question was, is how is this going to function? And it was kind of, that's the way I took the tenor of the letter was it was an open-ended question. And it's, it's a valid question. So, this is going to be one of the things that is going to cause a little bit of heartburn for the jurisdictions and the contractors both because I hear this all the time. And I cringed when I saw this when it said, okay, we're going to need a minimum bus bar of 125 amps. Well, in our town, we have a lot of older stock and I've got services that are like 100, 125 amps. And somebody wants to build an ADU in their backyard. I mean, that's the popular thing now. The state has made it very streamlined, very easy to build ADUs. No problem there. I'm all for it. So, everybody's coming in with a permit to build an ADU. Okay. So, I'm going to tell them, you need a now a 225 amp panel. So, they're going to go to PG&E and PG&E is going to say, hey, you've got 100 amp or 125 amp panel there now in your main house. We don't have the services to, or the infrastructure. We don't have the transformer. So, it's going to require all this engineering. It's going to be buku bucks. And you know what's unfortunate is then they come back to me as a building official and go, you know, you're requiring this 225 amp panel. And PG&E wants like $25,000 to buy a new transformer and do all this engineering. And they're looking at me as the bad guy. I'm trying to tell them it's the state code. I, you know, I'm St. Helena and I enforce the state code. I have to. I don't have a choice. We have to enforce it. But I'm kind of looked at as the bad guy. And I know we're going to run into this. We were already running into it a little bit. We're going to run into this every day now. Because it's going to say this is the minimum. So, if I'm building a new house on a brand new lot, I mean, that's their problem. They're going to have to figure out how to get the utilities there. But this is going to hit all the ADUs. And it's not going to be a fun conversation with the applicant if it is going to cost them a buck. You know, we centered the room centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered having people tell me that PG&E won't even come out to look at the engineering for eight or nine months. We finished a commercial building and the people didn't get in front of this thing. And PG&E told them, we'll be there in a year. And I just shake my head at that. So it's the world we're living in. I'm not blaming PG&E so much. I mean, I think they just, they've had a lot of issues. But I'm, so I don't want to beat up on PG&E or anything, but I'm just saying that we're living in a different world now where it's taking a long time to get power. There's going to be a lot higher cost. And the energy code is requiring this minimum 225 amps. So it's something we're going to contend with. So on small family units, we're still looking at 225 per unit. Let me say, we're going to do a lot for the spring here. Yeah, I think that's what it's saying. Single, well, single family. I don't know if that applies to multi-family. It might be a different definition. Single family. Single family. Might be. I think this is just single family. Yeah. If you're going to see that regardless of the size of the residence. Regardless, well, because I asked the energy code or commission about this, and they said it included an ADU. That's why I put that in there. I don't think that's, the code doesn't say this includes an ADU. That's what the energy commission told me. So I was actually asking, we have an energy commission person that communicates pretty regularly with me because I'm on the board of our Napa Solano ICC chapter. He gives me all the code updates. And I saw some of this stuff. I'm reading through to try to, figure out what the code changes are. And I kept emailing back and forth. And I said, is this really saying this? And he goes, yeah. Yeah, it's really saying that. So I was like, okay. Yeah, to include an ADU. That's what I put in there. It's not what the code language says, but it's any single family dwelling. So yeah, it could be this 300 square foot ADU and you're putting it on this monster panel. But it's what the code requires. I don't know if, maybe that'll change on the next code cycle. Maybe they'll get some pushback. I don't know. But that's what it's saying right now. Okay. So the idea is that we're getting ready for this stuff. In our jurisdiction, we seem to have a lot of people already complying with this stuff. These things are getting put in long before we require it. It seems like everybody now has backup batteries, Tesla solar roofs are really picking up speed. So I mean, it's, in our area, we're seeing a lot of this stuff. I don't know that I'm going to get into a lot of infrastructure in our jurisdiction. Maybe on ADUs, but on new houses, they're just automatically doing this stuff. Because they want to be energy efficient. So we usually don't have a problem with that. Okay. This is just more kind of restating. You've got to have at least the four backup circuits, refrigerator, lighting, bedroom, outlet, etc. And then future space for a transfer switch within three feet of the main panel and raceways from the panel to the future switch location. Okay. So heat pump space heating, and that's, you know, this is a big change because a lot of people for years have used natural gas, and we're going to now be pushing for them to have a heat pump. Probably not an issue for air conditioning, because, you know, a heat pump just runs in reverse for heat or air conditioning. But I think the issue's going to be, I've had some people already question on the central heat. I've had some people say, really, does it work very good? Takes a long time to heat the place. This is kind of the things I'm hearing from the air conditioning contractors. I don't know if this will play out. On a couple houses I built, I installed the little mini splits, the Mitsubishis, and those things, I mean, they get hot right away, and those were heat pump technology. But the central heat pumps, from what I'm being told, is so I had a contractor that I was talking to this about, and he said, you know, like a natural gas heater would heat up the house in like, you know, two hours, that same size house would take four hours, you know, it's like double with heat pumps. I don't know what we'll see. You know, years ago you'd see a heat pump put in with a little heat strip to kind of get that thing going, and the code doesn't want us to put in any of that, those heat strips. That's old, old technology, very inefficient. I mean, it heats the house, but they don't want it. So, anyway, it'll be interesting to see. And then same thing with the heat pump water heaters. The recovery is a long time. So I had a contractor, he just put one in, and he was telling me it takes about six hours. If you deplete that tank, it takes about six hours to recover. And that works fine for somebody with, you know, two or three in a family, but if you had four or five people trying to take a shower all about the same time, that might be a problem. I guess the good thing was the tank was like 60, five gallons. So while these systems are very efficient, the recovery is a lot slower than natural gas or propane. Natural gas or propane, you know, it's when my kids gets in, takes a long shower, you know, it's cold, and then like 20 minutes later, you can start feeling it's already getting hot again. That's not going to happen with the heat pump technology, but we're required to go this direction with the energy code. So, again, if they are able to use performance, you know, title 24 calculations, and they can show a gas furnace, they still have to put in the electric infrastructure for the heat pump someday to be installed. So they're still going to have to have the 240 volt, 30 amp circuit, space for the two pole, or probably what's going to end up happening is most people are just going to put in a heat pump and call it good. That's the direction the energy code's trying to, um, direct us to. Um, so that's more information on that, just kind of restating that. Um, okay, so mandatory electric ready, um, cooktops. So, you can do a gas cooktop if you can perform your way out of it. Maybe do more efficient windows or something to, um, show that your building is still energy efficient. Then you can do a gas cooktop, but again, you've got to put in the electrical infrastructure. You know, on a lot of the custom homes we saw, they would, in the laundry room and at the cooktop, they put the electric plug, but then it also put a gas stub out, so they could go either one, but this will be required even in a, you know, a track home or, um, some, any home that somebody's building. So it's just going to be a requirement. And this was the laundry, so you can have a gas dryer maybe, but, um, you've got to have the electric ready for it as well. Okay, um, one of the things that they, uh, changed, and I won't spend too much time on this, um, but newly constructed buildings, they want, so they've always had, like, three metrics to look at. Now they, I think it's four metrics, and it has to do with, um, time-dependent energy calculations. Um, the, the concept there is that if I buy power from PG&E or really any utility, I'm going to have to buy power from PG&E. You know, from nine in the morning to, I don't know, nine o'clock at night, it costs more money to buy that kilowatt than if I'm buying the kilowatt at midnight. And so, um, they're trying to, um, get a real world, like, when is this energy being used, what's the actual cost? And so you're doing these calculations, and that's how, basically, in a nutshell, I'm probably oversimplifying it, but we're trying to come up with, you know, what is it costing to heat or cool or, you know, cool or run the energy for this house. Um, and so they, they added that metric, and then, um, you know, um, more information about how we move the multifamily to a separate, um, subchapter, kind of make it a little more easily to understand and read. Um, the photovoltaic requirements, um, the thing I'd point out on this, so the minimum was always required, two kilowatts or more, and the minimum was always required, two kilowatts or less. So, um, so if I did the calculations and it said that I needed a, say, a two kilowatt or 1.9 kilowatt system, I didn't have to do solar if that's what it said that I needed for size, the size of the system. And the, the reason for that is because, again, the energy commission says that it's, this is cost-based, it's a cost-based, um, code. So, um, if, you know, to, by the time I buy the, um, inverter and the solar panels and put all this stuff in for a little two kilowatt system, it's costing me a ton of money and I will never get that back, especially if I, let's say I was building a little ADU and I'm using $20 of electricity a month in this little 300 square foot ADU and I buy this $15,000 solar system, I will never recover that money. Um, not in my lifetime, maybe my kids will. So the code, the energy commission recognized that and said, so if you could prove that you needed a system or your system calculated out to less than that, you didn't need to do PV solar. Well, um, as with anything else, solar is getting cheaper. Um, it's like cell phones when they first came out, they're, you know, cost an arm and a leg and now everybody has one. They're, they're, they've gotten very cost-effective. Um, they're getting very cost-effective, I guess. And so same thing with solar, at least that's the understanding. And so now they've lowered this down. So now the minimum requirement is 1.8 kilowatts. It sounds like they've lowered in the favor of the builder, but it's not. It's, it's basically saying before it used to be if, if you were two kilowatts or less, you didn't need to do it. Now it's saying if it's 1.8 kilowatts or less, because they're recognizing the cost of solar panels and inverters have come down. So, you know, so the size, um, requirement, the minimum size has dropped just a little bit. I don't know if that's a huge difference, but just be aware of that. Okay. Um, some requirements, depends on your, um, climate zone. Um, so, um, I think you guys are in climate zone 11 here. Most everybody's 11 or 13 maybe. Um, so you're going to want to pay attention. The big thing, um, here is that, so when I was in the Central Valley, um, if somebody came in for a new furnace in their attic, we had to start looking at what their insulation was. We also had to do this for, we had to, um, ask, um, when they were re-roofing, you know, are you doing a cool roof? What's your insulation level in your attic? And, um, and the reason is, it kind of made sense in the Central Valley, it would get, you know, 105 or 110 degrees there in the summer and it would never cool off at night, not significantly. Your attic is just charged with all this heat, takes hours and hours to dissipate. And so the energy code was saying, hey, if you didn't have like, you know, you had some old houses that had like barely the two by four, uh, ceiling joists had insulation. So they were like, for our climate zone, if you didn't have insulation, you wouldn't have at least R30, I think it was, or maybe it was R38, I don't remember anymore. Um, you have to increase that. And so I would stand at the counter and try to sell someone a HVAC permit and they would say, so you mean I need to buy a thousand dollars worth of insulation too? And I would say, yeah, you have to, you have to increase it. Well, this is starting to come to some other climate zones and I don't know if it hits your climate zone, but just be aware of the, you know, you know, you've got some areas that you used to be like, you know, 13 and 16 and maybe 12 or something. I don't remember, but it was, it hit our zone down in the central valley. And now it seems like they've added. So the requirements always been there. It is kind of added some climate zones. Um, so just be aware of that. They lowered down the minimum, um, or the trigger requirement was 40 feet. So if I had somebody come in doing an addition set, I'm doing less than 40 feet of duct, um, extension. I didn't need to have, you know, I didn't have to worry about, um, duct ceiling or anything like that. They've lowered that down to now 25 feet. So it's going to be pretty difficult if somebody adds on a bedroom to convince me that it's only 25 feet to where their air handler is or air handler to have to be, you know, right at the gable in there to where their new addition is. So I don't know. Um, it's something to look at. They're lowering it down. Um, same thing with the leakage test. They lowered it from 15% to, um, 15% to, um, 15% to, um, 15% down to 10% for all climate zones. So kind of getting a little tighter on the, um, requirements. Um, and then this was the new roofing products in climate zone four through eight. And this, this changes where they added some climate zones. Um, so, um, you know, I dealt with this again in the central valley. Um, I don't know if you guys are already contending with, um, with it here. I don't remember what the original climate zones were anymore, but I know they added a couple, um, got pulled into that, but basically the solar reflective index has to be 16 or less. Um, so if you go on the energy commission's website, they have a calculator. So sometimes this is done for you. Um, the manufacturer already has this SRI number, but sometimes they don't. Sometimes you'll just get the solar reflectance number and the thermal emittance, and you can enter that into the energy commission's, um, SRI calculator and see if this hits this target number of 16 or less. So, um, you know, something that maybe a couple other climate zones are going to have to start doing. So it just slows you down a little bit. Someone comes in for a reroof permit. I used to have to run back to my office or, you know, um, one of our, uh, plans examiners and they'd have to just pull up the energy commission calculator and then you can print out the report saying that it meets it. So, um, you know, we're getting into more pool roof type of products. And again, just so you guys understand, um, the idea is, is, um, these two numbers is, one is, um, how does it reflect the sun? So we keep the heat from, um, accumulating in the attic. And then once we get the heat in the attic, how fast does it dissipate? And that's what these two numbers are trying to represent. So, little sloped roofs, um, probably going to have to start looking at, um, you know, uh, additional insulation for the attic space. It's not just a reroof. Maybe some insulation required. Um, okay. Um, so they just kind of clarified here on ventilation equipment, um, and what's a, you know, you know, you know, what's a complete or new replacement because, you know, some of the requirements kick in if you're doing an entire replacement and basically they're saying 75% of new duct material, um, and up to 25% of reused parts, um, including grills, registers, boots. So it kind of gives us a standard of what can, you know, what constitutes a complete replacement. Um, new doors, they increase the exterior or, um, if you increase the exterior door area, then the, uh, maximum new factor, um, is .20. Got a little stricter there. Okay. Um, the Cal Green Standards, and we're almost done. We'll try to wrap up, um, close to 3 o'clock, which is what I was trying to do. Um, so on the Green Building Standards, not a lot of huge changes. Um, some EV requirements, mostly, uh, this is going to hit multi-family. So if you're doing apartment complexes, you've got to be able to pay attention to that. Um, because they, there is a lot of new requirements. Again, we're trying to go to, um, you know, all electric vehicles in California. And so, you know, most apartment complexes don't have a way to charge if you, everybody gets an electric vehicle. Well, they're, they built in a lot of stuff. I didn't cover it real, um, you know, heavily in this thing. Just be aware that it's in the Cal Green Code, the number of parking vectors and parking vectors and parking vectors and parking vectors and parking vectors and parking vectors and parking vectors and parking vectors and parking vectors and parking vectors and parking vectors and parking vectors and parking vectors and parking vectors and parking vectors and parking vectors and parking vectors and parking vectors and parking vectors and parking vectors and parking vectors and parking vectors and parking vectors and parking vectors and parking vectors and parking vectors and parking vectors and parking vectors and parking vectors and parking vectors and parking vectors and parking vectors and parking vectors and parking vectors and parking vectors and parking vectors and parking vectors and parking vectors and parking vectors and parking vectors and parking vectors and parking So the requirements for water conservation, that didn't change at all, which was kind of surprising. Our city manager was asking me about this a lot because in our city, and maybe you guys are contending with this, I think the whole state's got some drought issues. And he was asking, hey, has the water conservation tightened up? And I said, no, it hasn't. And so he wants me to bring or at least talk to the council about maybe doing a mandatory gray water systems. So the plumbing code already has lots of information on gray water systems. You can put them in at any time. But maybe we'll be a city that requires it as mandatory as a way to mitigate our drought issues and our lack of water. But I don't think we can get much more. We're efficient on our water conservation. We're flushing the toilets with practically about three quarters of a gallon of water. And then we're creating other issues. I remember when I was in Arizona, we had a sewer line that because it wasn't getting the flow required, it was building up a lot of methane gas. And so our water department had to keep going out there with a water tender and flushing additional water down just to keep the. Explosive level down to a minimum. So the manhole cover wouldn't blow up in front of, I think it was an A&W restaurant. So anyway, you know, it used to be we flushed the toilet with five gallons of water and it washed out a lot of the methane gas. Now the sewer guys are telling us public works are saying, hey, everything's so water efficient. We don't have the water volumes coming down the sewer pipes we need. So anyway, I don't think we can get much more efficient than we are. But at least not on. Water in the house, maybe on some landscaping things. But so the one thing that did change. So if you build a new house, you're supposed to supply the homeowner with a manual in that manual. You should have all the instructions on how to run your air conditioning and your appliances and thermostats, all that good stuff. That should all be in a binder. There's supposed to be information on how the how to contact the utilities and hook up utilities to the home. But they did add a couple things to that. And one is the information from CAL FIRE on maintenance of defensible space in our area. Because we're kind of back up to the wildland fire. This is going to be an issue. We want to make sure that the homeowners have this because they might move in. It might be all cleared for them today. But five years from now, they might not realize that everything grows up and they're supposed to maintain that defensible space. So. We have to include that information. And then, of course, as we said earlier, the location on the grab bar reinforcement. Any questions? Okay. Yes. I have a question related to solar. Does any of this apply to manufactured housing? Or is that covered by violence? So manufactured housing is a little bit different animal. So what happens with. And I've been. Challenged on this with HCD. So manufactured housing in California is considered affordable housing. And so we got to be careful as a jurisdiction. There's some things that we can require. But I had somebody challenge me on just fire sprinklers. We have a local amendment that says you're going to install fire sprinklers even in a manufactured home. It's in our local ordinance. Well, a contractor didn't like that and called HCD. And HCD called me. So I got a phone call from the state. And he said, hey, I got this complaint. And he was real nice about it. And then he asked me, how's your fire department organized? If you're a fire district or a fire department, it's how they're set up was whether we could require sprinklers. It turned out we were. We had the right organization for our fire department that we were able to require that. And that's when he just told me, he said, okay, you guys are fine. You can require the fire sprinklers. But just keep in mind. And you'll find that HCD recognizes manufactured housing is an affordable housing. And so that's a factory-built home. And they really don't want the jurisdiction adding additional requirements. It comes from the factory. We have jurisdiction on, you know, hooking up utilities and if they're going to pour a foundation around it. And I don't think anybody has too many issues with that. But just be aware that, you know, I wouldn't, like, say, hey, you're going to put a solar system on that. Or, you know. I know when I was in Porterville, I don't think we required fire sprinklers. I had one manufactured home go in and we didn't require fire sprinklers. But here in St. Helena. Yeah, I have to tell them it's in our local ordinance and the contractor didn't like that. He was like, no, you guys can't require that. Title 25. And anyway, so it's kind of interesting. Any other questions? So before you guys. Go, I'm going to give certificates. The other thing is I'm going to leave my business card. You guys are welcome to call me. My cell phone is on there. That's the best way to reach me. You can call me anytime. I won't answer if it's at 2 o'clock in the morning, but you can call leave a message. I will call you back. If you have a question or think of something you can email me. I have no problem with that. I'm glad to help out. I am busy like everybody else. I'm sure. But if you guys have a question or something that you think I can answer, feel free to contact me. And I really appreciate you guys coming out. I hope you guys got something out of the presentation and I know it's kind of a lot of information to cover, but hopefully it helps you guys in your jobs. All right.
