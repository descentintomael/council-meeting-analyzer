 All right, everybody, welcome to the regular City Council meeting. November 1st, 2022. We will call the meeting to order and start with an invocation by Minister Chet Rutledge from the Chico Church of Christ. Welcome. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Councilman, do you bow with me? Almighty Sovereign God, we praise you for being our creator. Your wisdom, you've seen fit to give us life. Your life, abundantly, extensively, expansively, we praise you for being that creative being. We praise you for creating this world we live in.

So, if you please stand and join me in the Pledge of Allegiance. Pledge of Allegiance. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. All right. Welcome, everybody. And we will start with roll call. Madam Deputy. Council Member Bennett. Here. Council Member Brown. Here. Council Member Morgan. Here. Council Member O'Brien is absent. Council Member Tandon. Here. Vice Mayor Reynolds. Here. And Mayor Coolidge. Present. All right. Speaker Card Announcement. Anyone wishing to speak on an item should first complete a Speaker Card located in the back of the room and turn it into the City Clerk. to my left to your right. Speakers will be taken in the order the cards are received. Once the first speaker begins, no additional cards will be accepted. And we will start with the closed session announcement from City Attorney Vincent Ewing. Mr. Young. Thank you, Mayor Coolidge. The Council met with the staff in closed session on the listed agenda items. No action was taken. Direction was given. That concludes my closed session report. Alright, thank you very much. And could Emily Pereira, Program Manager for the 6th Street Center for Youth and Heart, meet me down at the podium? Welcome. How are you guys? Good, thank you. Thanks for being here. So today we're presenting a proclamation for the Homeless and Runaway Youth Awareness Month. So whereas California has an estimated 200,000 children who are homeless, including some 1,500 K-12 students in Butte County, and approximately 25% of youth exiting foster care will experience homelessness. And whereas a high percentage of homeless youth have been physically, sexually, or emotionally abused by their guardian and are frequently re-victimized and exploited while living in the streets and or shelters, and whereas the natural disaster and lack of affordable housing have exacerbated youth homelessness across rural California. And due to that lack of stable housing, homeless youth face great difficulty in accessing, stabilizing, and succeeding in school, reducing the likelihood of successful graduation. And whereas LGBTQ young adults are 120% higher risk of homelessness when compared to their peers and comprise 40% of unaccompanied homeless youth population. Whereas the citizens of Chico are key to preventing youth homelessness by acting as mentors and role models for the youth, guiding them towards available resources, productive choices, and creating opportunities for the youth to successfully transition to adulthood. Now, therefore, it be resolved that I, U of C, the mayor of the city of Chico, on behalf of the city council, join advocates in communities across the country in taking action to prevent youth homelessness and runaways. And do hereby proclaim November 2022 as Homeless and Runaway Youth Awareness Month. And do commend this observance to all of our citizens. Thank you. And you can say some words. Thank you very much. We have a number of events going this month, so check out our social media and join us for our candlelight vigil on November 17th. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks so much for being here. Take care. All right. At this point, we'll move on to the consent agenda. All matters listed on the consent agenda are to be considered routine and enacted in one motion. Speakers may submit a speaker card for any of the items on the consent agenda. Do we have any speakers? Not on consent. Not on consent. All right. Well, the council. Move approval of consent. Second. A motion by Council Member Brown, a second by Council Member Morgan. Madam Deputy Clerk, if you could take the roll. Council Member Bennett. Yes. Council Member Brown. Aye. Council Member Morgan. Yes. Council Member Tandon. Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds. Aye. And Mayor Coolidge. Aye. All right. Item three, business from the floor. Members of the public. May I address? Council at this time on any matter not already listed on the agenda with comments being limited to three minutes or based upon the number of speakers. The council cannot take any item, cannot take any action at this meeting on request made under this section of the agenda. How many speakers? We have one. All right. James Hutchinson. Three minutes. Three minutes. Still a bit confused with our voting. We have a voting system here. Still a bit confused with how we go about doing these things. We have a person drive around in a bus determining what voting districts there are. How do you tell which houses are rented? How do you tell which places are apartment places that have students? How do you tell we have retired people? We now have an editor driving around for two hours looking at signs. Enterprise record editor driving around for two hours. To see there's 310 signs out there. I guess that's important. It's not to me. It just, this doesn't make sense. It starts out with two people who are harassed out of office. We have two city council people on either side of the spectrum. Harassed out of office. Nobody looks into it. Nobody checks it. Council has the power to subpoena witness. Subpoena people who appear in front of you. It's in the charter. Take a look at it. Did you call these people in and try to find out what's going on? Did you try to get some testimony on it? I'm still trying to figure out how you're doing this. You've got three council people right now that live in the new district. From what I understand. I don't know where Mr. Morgan lives particularly, but I believe he's the third person. With Mr. O'Brien and the mayor. Three people are going to be voting from the same district until the new council comes in. Until the new people come in. Is that fair? I'm not going to be able to vote for the second election and vote for a council person. I brought this up before. I made my argument on it. I don't know what's going on with this. You know, Mark Twain pointed out, it ain't what you don't know that gets you into trouble. It's what you know for sure that just ain't so is the problem. And I'm wondering, everything's by the law. We had a press release from the people. From the clerk's office. Saying that, hey, you know, a small handful of people, District 3, won't be able to vote. From the area I live in, I pointed out to you, it was a lot more than a small handful of people. That wasn't brought up. You don't see that in the newspaper. You don't see the editors caring about the fact that almost a thousand people got voted. They got thrown out of voting again. Second time. It's ridiculous. I don't know how you can be proud of yourselves for this. I really don't. I don't understand it. I don't understand what's going on here. Best of luck to y'all. All right. Thank you. Move on to public hearings. Item 4.1, hearing for the abandonment and vacation of right-of-way easement in the vicinity of 951 Walnut. And I'll move on to public hearings. Item 4.1, hearing for the abandonment and vacation of right-of-way easement in the vicinity of 951 Walnut. And I'll move on to public hearings. And I'll move on to public hearings And And And And And And And And And And And And And And And And this right away because it's not needed for the road anymore and they can build more lots on the property if we're able to abandon this portion of the front of their property that used to be in the road right away and so the resolution of intent was passed on October 4th 2022 and today the intent of today's agenda item is to have a public hearing and for the council to vote on the item the four utility companies were asked whether they had any objections and they did not they submitted a letter to the developer that they did not all right any questions thank you we have any speakers on this item all right public hearing closed public hearing will the council move to approve motion vice mayor rounds a second from council member morgan and you're ready council member bennett yes council member brown council member morgan council member tandon yes vice mayor reynolds and mayor coolidge hi all right moving on to the regular agenda introduction of the ordinance adopting the 2022 edition of the california building standards codes and local amendments and we have community development director brandon v and i believe fire chief we need him i'll fly solo here good evening mayor coolidge vice mayor reynolds and council so every three years following input from various state agencies and other interested parties the california building standards commission adopts the latest model building codes which include building residential mechanical plumbing energy electrical fire historical building existing building and green building standard codes collectively referred to as the 2022 building or california building code cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting However, there are certain local conditions that staff believes warrant some minor modifications. First, as part of your resolution, staff is recommending the readoption of previously enacted local amendments relating to fire regulations regarding locations for above ground tanks and storage of liquefied petroleum gases, as well as restrictions on fireworks. So that would be readopting things we've had in our code previously. In addition, staff is proposing a new modification that would require addresses at the rear of properties where rear parking lots or alleys provide vehicular access to those properties. While more restrictive than state codes, this amendment considers local conditions and seeks to protect the life and safety of residents and property. The ordinance before you tonight provides for the adoption of the new 2022 California Building Code and makes the required findings and determinations to support those local amendments. Staff recommends that council introduce... I think we've already introduced the ordinance tonight. And either me or Chief Stambridge are available for any questions. All right, questions? Yeah, just a quick question, Mr. V. If you could expound just slightly on that point about alleyways for the good of the public. I'll take my first shot, and then if I don't hit it, we'll let Chief Stambridge weigh in. You know, we're an older community with a lot of alleys, and we have a lot of residences and businesses that take access off of those areas. I think the goal, as we worked with the fire marshal, was to ensure that new development has proper addressing and visuals for approaching a situation that might require first responders. So just that the address would be visible and there would be access through the alley to the property? Is that what I'm hearing? Correct. Thank you, Chief. Thanks. All right, further questions? Thank you very much. Any speakers? No speakers. All right. Entertain a motion. I'll read it if you don't mind. Motion from Council Member Morgan and a second from... No. You'll do it? Okay. And Council Member Tannen will be the second. And that's an ordinance of the City Council of the City of Chico amending Title 16R of the Chico Municipal Code relating to the adoption by reference of the 2022 edition of the California Building Standards Code, including the 2022 editions of the California Building Electrical and Mechanical Plumbing Residential Energy Green Building and fire codes and standards, as well as the adoption by the reference of the 2021 International Property Maintenance Code and amending, adding, or repealing provisions in Title 16R of the Chico Municipal Code and the administration of the enforcement of the City's Building Division and Fire Department. I legally have to read that. Thank you. Fire away. Council Member Bennett? Yes. Council Member Brown? Aye. Council Member Morgan? Yes. Council Member Tanden? Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds? Yes. Mayor Coolidge? Aye. All right. Item 5.2 is a resolution approving the Community Wildfire Protection Plan. Chief Standridge. All right. Wanna Wanna Wanna Wanna Wanna Wanna Wanna Wanna! Wanna Wanna Wanna Wanna Wanna Wanna Wanna Wanna Wanna Wanna Wanna Wanna Wanna Wanna Wanna 21-22, and it allows us to develop our own community wildfire protection plan. And instead of relying upon the county plan that doesn't have nearly the amount of information and depth of analysis that we need to understand the risk within our city. So the purpose for doing this is adapting to the new normal. And that is to say, over the last few years, five, seven years, we've seen some significant fires in the North State and within the county itself. And so being able to look at the city as a whole and more holistically, we want to develop our own CWPP that goes into more depth. And so it gives us an ability to take and look at all the risk within the city and then identify projects in the way of preparedness. Defensibility and mitigation projects. I won't read all the goals, but the primary goals are to develop that assessment, identify critical areas of risk, be it infrastructure, property, lives, and other land resource management areas, and then identify specific projects to either mitigate, prepare for, or prevent those instances. We're wildfire encroaching upon the city and other residents, structures, and so forth that we can deal with those through the projects. One of the key attributes of a CWPP is that you have to collaborate and seek stakeholder and community involvement. And so we met those thresholds with the resources we had. We had a lot of work in our hands, starting first with the stakeholder meeting that involved key internal directors and managers and personnel that had a vested interest in the CWPP. And then we did a community survey to assess the level of understanding of the risk of wildfire, what preparedness activities households or individuals have done, as well as hardening their homes to make it more resilient to wildfire. So we started off with the wildfire assessment. And with the goals being to identify the high potential areas where fire and critical rates of spread are significant. Identify ignition points, places where larger regional scale wildfires can come into the city and then also conversely can leave the city and run up the hill to the city. Then we also had a community survey to assess the level of community involvement in the community and then also the potential fuel treatment projects on the fire behavior models as well. Now it's important to understand that we use the same company that the Parks Department did to develop the vegetation management plan that was adopted last year by the council. And we used Deer Creek Resources and they had a significant amount of data that they could then impart into their or import into their modeling to look at the city as a whole. So they take into account the elevation, slope, aspect, fuel loads, and weather conditions, specifically the winds and when they hit, how hard they hit and the direction. What that did in the vegetation fuels management plan, which is a tremendous amount of data, and it's a tremendously helpful document that focused primarily on exclusively on the parks, waterways, and greenways of the city. That allowed the Parks Department then to prioritize projects based on the priority of where we wanted to or where the city wanted to focus their efforts to reduce, mitigate, or reinforce areas. What's advantageous about this plan is that it really goes into granularity. And cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting areas. So these plant, the vegetation management plan really gets into detail that we didn't need to replicate. So when you look at our map, it'll show areas of red, but that doesn't mean that that entire area is of high risk, but instead that they may be higher priority for us to get out and do other mitigation activities, education, outreach, and so forth. So the real value for us in this plan is the development of the maps that show the vulnerability in different areas of our district on a house-by-house or parcel-by-parcel basis. So this is a tool that we'll be using within the fire department and code enforcement to look for areas and opportunities to help reduce the impact of wildfire on a home-to-home or parcel-to-parcel. And that could be just education. It could be targeted activities such as house hardening, working with the owners to build their resiliency on a home level. So from the analysis then and taking the feedback from the community and taking feedback from our stakeholders, we developed five areas to focus on that had proposed solutions and projects that we could pursue. Those fell in the broader category of information, education, and planning, reducing structural and ignitability, suppression capabilities in public safety, hazardous fuel reduction, building a greater support for and understanding of prescribed fire and wildfire management, and building a greater capacity. So I want to reiterate that this does not supplant or replace the vegetation management plan. In fact, they're very complementary pieces. We actually integrated the link to the vegetation management plan into the county CWPP when we revised it last year, this last spring. And now we are building our own CWPP. And this will just be a complementary piece to that. And we'll build off of what's already in here. So it does nothing to undermine this. And in fact, it helps complement it. So I want to be clear, too, that the solutions and recommendations that come out of this process aren't necessary things we're bound to as a city. We prioritize, look for opportunities for funding by grant, general funds if they're available. And then we choose those that give us the best bang for the buck given our resources. So there are a number of things that we're looking at. We're looking at the numerous suggestions that come in the way of things like in education and planning, homeowner consultations, emergency preparedness, wildfire evacuation planning. And I'm happy to say we we've taken a huge step forward. Fire Department developed a wildfire specific evacuation plan for the operational end of what we do, and then coordinated with PD to incorporate it into their citywide evacuation planning efforts. Those efforts then made it into the city. And then we've also incorporated it into the countywide evacuation plan. So there's continuity from from a tactical standpoint all the way up to the planning standpoint from the county's perspective. Educational information and displays that opportunities where we might want to set up a display in city events such as Thursday night markets, something to that effect, helping communities become recognized as fire wise communities. We do have a great project that has been started off the Piccoline area that has adopted the fire wise strategy and are pursuing that designation so that that community can go after grants on its own and help facilitate its own mitigation work. And they work with us. They work with the county, the fire wise committee committee at the county level. So there's a lot of merit. And so we're very, very important to communities developing their own fire wise efforts. We also found that it has been helpful on the front end when we're working with the community. For example, Valley's Edge has worked with the fire department significantly on developing fire wise tactics and practices into its master plan. And we're we've been very happy with the efforts of that developer to incorporate those to help us. So that's a great point. Yeah, cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting resistance practices that help us strengthen our building and construction to weather those types of incursions. And then defensible space. We're very big on getting large properties that have a lot of fuel load and creating defensible space around your home as well. That has not made its way necessarily into a code, but we will use that as an opportunity to educate and inform the community about their ability to harden their home by creating additional defensible space. Suppression and public safety capabilities. We're looking at primarily fire protection access and water systems. And I'll go back to Valley's Edge has done a remarkable job of taking our feedback and building that access into their plans, specifically north-south access, which we struggle with. For example, in Canyon Oaks, it makes it very difficult for us to put resources deep into that community and then relocate them to other more pertinent or critical areas. Valley's Edge has done a very good job of creating that north-south access for us deeper into the community, as well as building access on the exterior where it's possible to do so as well, because it creates additional fire breaks as well as access for our crews to get out there with type threes, as well as type ones. And then water systems are really critical. Obviously, getting water on the fire is paramount. And so building into these plans better access to water, whether it is fixed systems, hydrants, or it is ponds for pumping out of, or helicopters dipping into, or water tender access in remote areas where we don't have any water supply whatsoever. Hazardous fuel reduction. As I talked about the vegetation management plan, that accounts for all the public parks, waterways, and greenbelts. This is talking about vegetation management on developed lots, vacant lands, city-owned lots. It will help the code enforcement folks identify higher priority predicated on the risk and the areas that those would affect other areas. And cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting We're prioritizing those risk areas that we know can contribute to a large wildfire. So it's become part of one of our goals. Building prescribed fire and wildfire management capacity. Pre-planning is another critical aspect of being a fire department. We pre-plan the best as possible so we have a better understanding of access, water locations, logistical support, and so forth. So that goes to the plan we created in addition to the evacuation plan. It was also an operational plan for those types of aspects of operational continuity and efficiency. Enhancing and creating fire breaks. After the Stony Fire, we got so much success with those dozer lines that were built in there that we've asked that those be maintained and, in fact, actually enhance others. We've also built in more areas of the park so we can actually create boxes by which the fire can be contained in. And that goes along with the prescribed burns that we've had very good success with and also demonstrates the importance of having good breaks to include pre-burned areas as part of prescribed burning. And that was evident last year during the park fire where we had previously in the spring burnt off several hundred acres on the west side of Horsetooth. So when the park fire started, we had a lot of fire. When the park fire broke, we were able to divert resources that would have otherwise been necessary on the eastern or western side of the lake. And that fire break then became a natural area so the fire stopped. And then the last two are enhancing land management objectives and then building non-agency prescribed fire capability. So actionable. Actionable items. This is strictly from the fire department. There are other actionable items that other departments may tap into and integrate into their own planning. But from a fire department standpoint, education by way of action items A-1, A-2, A-5, and B-8. Fund public education. And that could be general fund or it could be grants where possible. And we will identify the most appropriate. Public education efforts that we feel is the best bang for the buck. I will tell you probably one of the better investments is people having someone dedicated to actually reaching out to these high risk areas and involving discussions about hardening their homes, preparedness and so forth. So that would be one area we could look at as a city as well as using grant funding to propagate. Literature, messaging and so forth. A-3, expand awareness of wildfire issues related to land use and planning. We've talked about that. Evacuation planning. Talked about that as well. And then A-7, provide education resources to expand use of prescribed fire. It is becoming much more acceptable to use burning as people become more comfortable with it. They recognize that value and importance of it. So we've done a good job of getting that. We've got a lot of information out there and we want to continue to breed that kind of support in the community. B-1, strengthen building standards in existing and new structures and attachments. One that was already pointed out in the vegetation management plan. C-3D, looking for better access at the top end of Upper Park to be able to get resources from the north to the south or vice versa at around 10 mile area. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah, Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah and I'm available for any questions. All right, questions? Thank you. Do we have any speakers on this side? We do not. All right, entertain a motion from council. I'd just like to compliment the fire chief on this plan. I think it's great. And I really liked this one excerpt that with the CWPPs are given priority for funding of hazardous fuel reduction projects carried out under the Healthy Forest Restoration Act. So that's another avenue, another way in which we can tap into additional funds to help our community. So thank you. Move to approve. Motion from Vice Mayor Rounds, a second from Council Member Morgan. Before we take the roll, I'd also like to say, you know, it always surprised me when we don't have folks here, while we have folks here to speak on certain matters and the chamber's packed, and then it's something like this that's so important to our community. Having the vegetation fields management plan come through in the last couple of years, having this come through, substantial progress for our community, particularly on an issue that's so important. And it just, unfortunately, it's a shame that we don't get the crowds for this kind of stuff, but hopefully the reporters will get it out and into the community. And I think the community will recognize what a huge thing this is. And of course, you know, the education and planning everything in terms of the follow throughs is gonna matter immensely, but you know, this is the big stuff. This is what matters. So thank you for all your work on this. With that, if no one else has any comments, we'll take the roll. Thank you. Council Member Bennett. Yes. Council Member Brown. Aye. Council Member Morgan. Yes. Council Member Tannen. Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds. Aye. And Mayor Coolidge. Aye. All right. So we'll move on to item 5.3, consideration of the Bidwell Park Playground Commission rules of recommendation revisions to the Chico Municipal Code regarding park rules. So this was original request that I had sent to Bidwell Park and Playground Commission review certain, the park's rules, and we will hear a report from Park and Natural Resources Manager Linda Herman. Welcome. Good evening, Mayor, Council Members. So yes, as the Mayor said, it was directed to the commission to look at some various rules and concerning Bidwell Park and also our greenways and other areas. In particular, they were, the commission was looking at drug-free zones, park closing times, enhanced signage, open carried weapons, bicycle road safety, noise and code of conduct. Of course, some of these are larger topics and some are smaller topics, but they, over several meetings, they were able to go through these topics and had some recommendations for the council on some changes. For the drug-free zones, we used to have drug-free zones designations, but there was a law that was rescinded, but I did check with the city attorney and we are able to do drug-free zone signs again. And what that does is it has enhanced penalties in those zones. So the commission is recommending that we designate, all city parks as zones. And then the next one was closure of parks. So in 2018, we had come to before the council and we had changed the closing times of the parks and made them consistent so that they closed at 11 p.m. And that was also consistent with the card parks, but the commission was talking about possibly reducing that time to a 10 p.m., but they had concerns about city plaza and the observatory because the observatory has events up in, until 10 o'clock sometimes. So they would like to, so the recommendation is that they, we close all the parks at 10 p.m. and the closing time is 10 p.m. to 5 a.m., but that the upper park road, upper park area and for the observatory and city plazas remain at 11 p.m. So the next topic was a broader topic, bicycle and road safety. They discussed several aspects of that, but what came out of the immediately we are looking at, we are doing a traffic analysis of the lower Bibble Park and also a Bibble Park. So some of the decisions we want to wait to see what that analysis is because I think that's going to drive some of our recommendations of their recommendations, but they did immediately want to reduce the speed in lower park down to 15 miles per hour and that they are able to do that under the code as well as under the vehicle code. So that's a recommendation that they would like to do that now, even before the speed survey to reduce the speed to 15 miles per hour. They also talked about, let's see, they also had a suggestion by one of the commissioners to require bells on bicycles. So the commission did discuss that, but that failed for a lack of a second on the bicycles because on the bicycle bells. So then noise was discussed. We have several sections in the code that deal with noise. We have the section nines as well as our 12 Rs in the code. There are numerous regulations that relate to the noise level. So the commission felt that the regulations we have were sufficient and that we just need to enforce them when needed. The next topic that was discussed was enhanced signage. This is kind of not something for the commission or the council to really weigh into. It was just to, we have these larger rule signs. They're kind of modeled after cards, big rule signs if you've seen theirs, and we've had them. And so we just want to, some of the decisions that we make tonight might change some of those signs like the closing time. So we have a lot of rules that we need to be able to do that. We can't put those up, but we want to move forward with putting those larger rule signs in the park. The next was a discussion about carrying knives and machetes and axes. We also have a code section that deals with firearms and other projectile weapons, but it doesn't specifically address open carrying of knives and weapons of that type. But my understanding, and perhaps PD can help me on this one, but my understanding is that the existing law says that people can openly carry knives, and dirts and daggers, as long as they're not brandishing it or threatening people with it, that there really isn't anything that can be done if it's out in the open. So that was something that the commission didn't feel that they could change any as far as that law goes. And so they didn't really make a recommendation on that particular, just left it with what it is now. And then code of conduct. Again, this was just more of a consensus item. We think that all the rules signs and there's all the items that we just discussed as part of the Commission. And the changes that might come out of these rules and regulations were sufficient enough to hope, drive that code of conduct in the park. And then the last one was fire restrictions. And back in 2018, the advice of our, with our fire department, we had made some changes to the fire restrictions and had where fires are not allowed during the night. And that we can only have briquettes and no wood in the fireplace, in the barbecue, excuse me. And that we also not allow fires during red fire flag warning days and high wind days and other days that are fire danger days. But there was a discussion about whether we should ban propane tanks. And propane tanks, we do allow if it's in the barbecue area that has, you know, barbecue and concrete, people can bring their own propane barbecue if they'd like. So there was this discussion that, but there's that propane tank is not allowed anywhere else but in those designated barbecue areas. So there was discussion about that. We felt that, that was a discussion that we should have. And the commission felt that the current regulations are sufficient, but they just need to be enforced. And so the enforcement of any of these regulations in our code, both on the 12Rs, the 12Rs are generally infractions, which are generally administrative fines. And then we also mirrored a lot of the 12R park rules in a new code 12, as an ordinance under 12.18. And that, under that code, it gives us a little more strength and those can actually be misdemeanors that could either be fines or criminal or jail time. So it does give us, that other code gives us more chance to further enforce these regulations instead of just doing the admin citations by having that new 12R chapter. So right now the restrict, the fines for most of these would be in the admin site would be from 150, then 200, then 300, and then it goes up there three, because you get three fences. And then, but for the fire restrictions, the first fee is $300 for a fence, then it goes up to 600. And then it goes up to $1,200. So that pretty much concludes my report, if there's any questions. And then, so basically what we're asking, and just to repeat is the commission is asking for the city council approval to designate all city parks as drug-free zones, changing the closing time for city parks and greenways to 11 p.m. from the 10 p.m., except for the city plaza and the observatory upper park. Reduce the speed for the vehicles and bicycles in lower Bibble Park from 215 miles an hour, providing more and more parking space for the city. And then the other thing that came out of the noise is that because they're in different sections of the code, they thought that it would be helpful if we did the little cheat sheet for both the rangers and the police department that where the codes are and what those codes are regarding noise. So that's a suggestion by the commission. And then install the new signs as I had discussed. I own those places where camping restrictions are enforceable because right now those signs say no camping. So we'll put in Bibble Park, we could put them in Bibble Park, but there's some areas we may not do it, be able to do them yet until those areas are closed. So we'll put in Bibble Park, we could put them in Bibble Park, but there's some areas we may not do it, be able to do them yet until those areas are closed. All right. Thank you. That's quite a bit. Thank you. Do we have any questions? I was hoping the city attorney might be able to speak to what allows the drug-free zone signs to now be available after or be postable after we were told that they aren't. I can take a look at that, Councilmember Brown, and I don't have an answer for you. I can take a look at it and get back to you. I could ask to say that the city attorney did help out, but it's been a while. But there was a different code section that was repealed and now there's two new code sections that now allows it to, that was adopted that now allows it to be drug-free zones. That was what the city attorney had provided to us earlier. And when was that? I'm sorry, what was that? When was that? I can't remember. We've talked this over since May of last year. So I can't remember. I think we talked that, actually I think we did drug-free zones at the very first meeting. And so probably it was May or July. And the actual code section, health code sections is 11353 and 11353.1. Okay, thank you. Thank you. Just a quick question about the reducing of speed limits. Is there data to support reducing from 20 to 15 miles per hour? I'm sorry, was there? I didn't. Is there data to support reducing from 20 to 15 miles per hour? No, but that's what we're doing the traffic service to. That's what we're trying to do. So there is a vehicle code that allows parks, specifically parks, to be down to 15 miles per hour without having to do a traffic study. So that's what the commission was going over. But we are looking at the speeds also under this traffic analysis. And when is that set to be completed? I'm hoping soon, like in the next month maybe. Okay, thank you. I appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Vice Mayor. I was just wondering if I could get clarification on the propane tanks from either possibly the city attorney or the fire chief. I know the propane tanks have been something that has been discussed in the past. Why would we not just not allow propane tanks at all seeing as how we just had, what, 12 of them go off in a park here recently and cause a pretty big problem right behind some homes? Propane, is there a reason we can't do briquettes or? I actually haven't answered that. Okay. Just because some people in the community bring their barbecues to the park. I've been at several get togethers at the park where a lot of people just back up their barbecue and bring it into the picnic area and use it. So I think it's differentiating between that and what chief do you have. Those aren't the propane tanks that are typically causing fires in our park, so. No, but if you eliminate one, you're eliminating both, so. Okay. Yeah. So I think the picnic area regulation on that is the difference. Okay. Is that right? Yes. Yeah. It's the parking, yeah, where there are existing. So if they're outside of the picnic area, then they're illegal. Right. If they're inside the picnic area, then it would be allowed. Well, specifically a picnic area that has a barbecue because some picnic areas don't have barbecues. Yeah. Not to get, but yeah. So if there's a propane tank that's not in the picnic area, it's an enforceable offense? Yes. Okay. Thank you. All right. Further questions? Comments? Do we have any speakers on this side? We have three. All right. Three minutes. First speaker is James Hutchinson followed by Julia Keener. I hate this, but the second time I agree with the Mayor of bringing this subject up. But here's what I'm looking at. I appreciate the focus on Bidwell Park. It needs it. No question. I agree 100% on that. Yeah, let's Yeah, let's Yeah, let's Yeah, let's Yeah, let's Yeah, let's Yeah, let's Yeah Yeah there to try to get it moved out. It took as much as I could. The other guy took as much as he could. It's still there. It's sitting there. The big problem that's happening out there is we've got a group of people out there that are dumping stuff. You'd be surprised who they are. A third of the garbage out there can be directly attributed to developmentally disabled and mental health cases out there. Many of the developmentally disabled think that they're helping, helping, that they're laying this out there for the homeless. They bring clothes. They take them out of the garbage cans, set them out there. They bring out packages of stuff. One person brought up a bunch of towels and stuff that they had, but what they did was they put a makeup kit on top of it out in 105 degree temperature. Makeup drooled all over it. Another guy, who wasn't as nice as these other people were, put out some baby clothes out there. Well, inside those baby clothes, he'd taken a bottle and broken it, put broken glass inside it. I watched a four-year-old girl almost start going into it. Fortunately, I got to her in time. I'd seen the guy working in the garbage can and saw that he had some broken glass in there and gotten out to check to see when he put it down. Those kind of things. The other thing that's happening is people are making their own trails out there. They're going out there with weed cutters and cutting their own trails. They call it a nature trail. This is going down from forest, heading down toward the footbridge area. There's several cut paths. These was all dry grass. These things are happening out there and they've got to be dealt with too. These green build areas are not patrolled much. They don't have the kind of people out there that you have at the park. They need to be considered seriously as part of the problem. These places light up. There's a lot of houses along there. District 6 is full of houses along that stretch. Most of those people had to put up new fences because they got to the point where it was so threatened. 1661 Forest, they put up fences all the way out to Amanda Place. Anyhow, please consider the green builds. Julia Keener followed by Jeff Glatz. Hello. I am here to speak for Upper Bidwell Park. Fire Chief talked about it. He talked about it. Issues. I heard that you, the commission, has directed the Parks Department to open the Upper Park Road at Diversion Dam two days a week to the end of the road. That is true. It scares me. And I have a lot of concerns of creating problems in areas. What happens down below will happen up above. So if anything is going on in Chico, in the parks, in town, it will also go up that road as far as you open it. So my understanding of the project on the road, it was supposed to be funded for erosion, and it was supposed to be funded for erosion, and it was supposed to help the creek. And then also, it seemed like it was for service vehicles, for emergency vehicles, if they needed fire trucks and such up there. I am asking you to reverse your decision on opening that park at Diversion Dam and keeping that closed. So the problems that I see will be created are, first of all, you need more services. You're going to need garbage disposal. You're going to need porta-potties. You're going to need all the things that we don't have enough of already in Chico. All the services that we are completely maxed on. And no matter what the taxes, if it passes, if a parking fee is goes through or whatever to try to raise money for the city and for the parks, it will never be enough. It will never be enough. For the infrastructure that is needed and the maintenance that is needed throughout all the parks in the city. It just won't be enough money. So I feel like that road needs to be closed at Diversion Dam permanently except for non-motorized vehicles. Anyone can go up there. It's always open. You have to go under your own power. So I'm in the park a lot and I always take garbage bags. With me every day I'm there and I'm always picking up garbage and it is completely relying on how much garbage I pick up is how far that road is open. So the more that road is open, the more that people bring in and leave. If it's fishing line for their fishing, if it's diapers that they just left, if it is dumping their truck load of garbage just because they don't want to deal with it and then the city has to remove it. We don't have the services we need now. Please keep it closed. Jeff Glatz. Hello, council members. Mayor Coolidge. Didn't come really prepared. Only found out about this about an hour and a half ago and that I was going to be on the agenda tonight. I just wanted to add some color to a couple of the items that were before you. But first of all, thank you, Vice Mayor Reynolds, for bringing it up about the propane. Thanks, because immediately that happened. I reached out to the chief and got this on the agenda and wanted to talk about it because it does seem that you have the ability to enforce that. It's just not being enforced yet. So maybe that's something you guys can direct people to start enforcing that thing. Closure times. When you look at the notes here, we did agree on 10 because that's what I thought would get passed. But it was only four people who were there when we were talking about other times and it was 2-2 where they should be doing this at dusk plus, say, 30 minutes. It's to dawn. None of these ideas I came up with are original. I tried to look at other communities. New York City, Sacramento parks close at 8 p.m. at night. I'm trying to look at areas. What do different communities do when they're having an increase in crime, increase in population, that sort of thing? This is a common rule. Closing at dusk. It is not out of the box. So two people on the commission agreed with that thought. Two people didn't agree with that thought. There's only four voting. And that's why I'm just bringing this up to you guys. Because these are tough decisions that have to be made. Generally, a commission is reluctant to make tough decisions, but the council's responsibility is to make tough commissions. So I would just like you to consider that, perhaps consult with the chief of police, as I have done, and to see his thoughts on what is a good park closure time. Knives, daggers, etc. I understand this is a state law. However, at some point communities need to challenge some of these laws, and then I would ask you to reach out to our attorney because I believe there's been two stabbings in the park in the last year. If you can't have a dagger in a school, should you have it in a public park? These are questions that need to be asked. If you can't take them on planes, should you have them in public parks? I think it's the ability of a community to ask that question. I don't know what the answer to that question is. It's more of a legal question, but it certainly seems worth the ask and worth the time spent to determine, you know, can we protect some of these kids in our parks who are in danger. Let's see, moving on to, I already talked about the fire stuff. I guess that's it. You know, if you have any questions, of course I think we should have bells in the park. It doesn't make any sense. I talked to Chico Velo and Chico Corsa, and everybody was behind that, but, oh well. I'm overreaching is what I was told. Yet, the state of South Carolina does it, the state of New York does it, Amsterdam does it, but hey, you know, it is what it is. So, that's it for me. I just wanted to give you guys a little bit more color on some of those items. If anybody has any questions, I can answer, but that's it. Thank you, guys. Thank you, everyone. Alright. Further discussion or questions? Council Member Tam. This question is probably for City Attorney on the propane tax too. You know, if in the transient camps, can it be, can it be enforced to not allow the propane tanks at all? You have to take each encounter with a person on a case-by-case basis. So, if there's a person who has a propane tank and they're somewhere in the city, that is an enforceable offense, but you have to evaluate each encounter on its facts. And so, I can say, generally, yes, but from an enforcement perspective, you have to talk to the officers who are actually having the encounter with that person to see what the facts are about the enforcement. Vice Mayor Owens. I was just going to ask maybe staff's preference of the difference of dusk versus the 10 p.m. or 11 p.m. Dusk seems maybe that it could be challenging, because of, you know, and what do other parks do? You said Sacramento does it, New York City does it. You said they do dusk, do they run into lawsuits on, well, it's not dusk yet, it's still light outside, you know. We had dusk to dawn for many, many years, and it is so subjective of what's dusk and what's dawn, and we found it was hard for people to know when it was dusk and dawn. So, that's why we changed it to have a hard closing time, and I think at the time, actually, police department was looking for a more hard closing time. And so, we had it for many years, but it just was really hard to get people to know what dusk and dawn was. Perfect. Thank you. Chief, what would you prefer? What is your preference regarding closing time? I was involved in this conversation a while back, actually, and my first preference was that we have a consistent time across the board, so there's no ambiguity on when the park is closed. I don't like dusk as a reference for closure, because as I sit here and look at the dusk time for tonight, it says 6.33 p.m. So, every day, you would have to get on the weather channel and figure out what time the park closes versus having a hard closure time that is a known rule for the park. It's known for the users. It's known for the officers. It's known for the officers that would be enforcing the closure time. So, my preference would be that we have hard closure times. Linda and I spoke today about this topic on times, and my recommendation to her was to have a consistent closure time across the board for the park system, with the only exception being the observatory, because that's when they operate, late at night, especially in the summer, when it stays light out much longer than it does during this time. So, they would start their event much later. So, I think extending them with a later closure time would be appropriate. But the remainder of the park is to have a consistent closure time. That makes it easier for everyone, in my opinion. All right, further questions? All right, entertain a motion. I'll make a motion to accept the recommendations of the Bibball Park and Playground Commission. I'll second the motion, but I'll also just follow that up to say that I hear your comments, Julia, but unfortunately that was not on this particular, but I think that is something that can maybe be a conversation at a further date. But, I'll second that. I'll second the motion that we have here tonight. All right. Council Member Bennett? Yes. Council Member Brown? No, and particularly on Item 3, Reducing Speeds. If we have a traffic study coming out, I think we should probably be making data-driven decisions. Thanks. No. Council Member Morgan? Yes. Council Member Tandon? Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds? Yes.

Thanks, cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting a two-week sunshining period for the draft International Association of Firefighters MOU, which was negotiated via the union group's annual reopener provision. This evening, we're seeking ratification of the finalized document. The fiscal impact for the contract for the remainder of this fiscal year is anticipated at $290,000 to the general fund and $5,000 to other funds. And over the life of the contract, the cost will be $1,474,000 to the general fund and $25,000 to other funds. Key updates from this contract include the prior contract term ending June 2024 has now been extended to June 30th, 2025. The annual reopener language has been modified, limiting it to one reopener in 2024. A 5% general salary increase for 2022 with a 1% employee pickup of CalPERS costs. I want to note there that the prior contract that we already had in place already gave us a 5% increase in the annual reopening of the contract. The current contract is a 5% general salary increase for 2022 with a 1% employee pickup of CityCalPERS costs. I would also like to note that one page of Exhibit B was left out of the original uploaded staff report. However, it has previously sunshined and has been added to the packet as of this evening and provided to council via email. I'm happy to answer any questions you might have. All right, questions?
