 Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right, welcome everybody.  We are here at the adjourned meeting of May 17th.  One o'clock budget.  We're going to have a four-hour session,  and six o'clock will be the regular meeting.  So we'll call the meeting to order.  And a reminder, which is notable,  is this is dedicated to the memory of Scott Dowell,  our Administrative Services Director.  And for anyone who went to that service,  it was a very beautiful service honoring his life,  and he'll be greatly missed in the city of Chico.  And we will start on that note with an invocation by Chaplain Peter Hanson.  Welcome.  Thank you, Mr. Mayor.  Let's pray.  Thank you.  Almighty, merciful, and loving God,  the Council meets to join their strengths, ideals, and desires.  We meet our common cause, all who want a good life,  all who want safer streets, happier homes, better schools,  and well-educated citizens to lead rewarding careers,  to enjoy our families and marriages,  and provide loving care for elderly,  and the poor, and the infirm,  to lead lives that honor you and respect each other.  Let this Council seek a meeting of minds,  agree on goals, and share our vision,  and hope for future things,  but in agreement on the ways and means they may achieve great things together.  Our best hopes are met only in you,  to walk paths of peace and harmony,  with gracious manners and patience,  to seek and to see more clearly,  and to see the world through your eyes.  We ask that you would be with us,  and with one heart,  to begin again.  In the praise and comfort of your Spirit,  may you receive our desires and dreams.  Through your grace and mercy,  we approach you,  knowing you are always more ready to hear  than we are to pray,  and willing to give us more than we ask for or desire.  In loving memory of this God, Father,  as we pray in your most holy name,  amen.  Amen.  Amen.  Beautiful.  Thank you.  All right, if you please stand and join me in the Pledge of Allegiance.  Pledge of Allegiance.  I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America,  and to the republic for which it stands,  one nation, under God,  indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.  All right.  We're going to start with the Pledge of Allegiance.  All right, we'll start with roll call.  Sorry.  Okay.  Councilmember Bennett?  Here.  Councilmember Brown?  Here.  Councilmember Morgan?  Here.  Councilmember O'Brien?  Here.  Councilmember Tandon?  Here.  Vice Mayor Reynolds?  Here.  Mayor Coolidge?  Here, present.  And here.  All right.  We will start with our budget presentations.  And NRM City Manager Paul Hong, take it away.  Thank you.  Good afternoon, Mayor, Vice Mayor, members of the Council.  Today I am pleased to present to you basically the recommended proposed budget for the fiscal year 22-23  that is balanced and responsible and allows the city to move forward in a number of positive ways.  This is actually pretty impressive given the chaos that's going on in the world today, especially the volatility and frankly the craziness in the world of finance and budgeting.  And I mean that's across the planet, literally.  On the international front, we all know there's the whole issue that's going on in Ukraine, sanctions that are affecting the world.  Basically, COVID is making a comeback in China, which is shutting down supply chains, which we just started to see.  We're starting to get over the last time of COVID supply chain issues, and now we might have more of those.  The cutoff in energy supplies in Europe is affecting energy prices worldwide and certainly in our country.  On the national front, inflation is hitting highs that we haven't seen since the 1970s and early 80s.  And that's offsetting some actually positive news that we saw wages finally rising.  But now, even with wages rising, inflation is rising and people just can't seem to be getting ahead.  I already mentioned supply chain bottlenecks internationally.  That comes down to us at the national front.  And we continue to try and find a car on a car lot these days.  You can't find a new car.  You still have to wait three or four months because of electronic parts and other things.  The stock market is absolutely crazy and volatile.  We've now entered bear market territory, and this comes after last year's earnings of over 23 percent.  So every single day, we're going to see a lot of new things.  And if you are watching your 401 , you are going up, down, up, down.  One day you're retiring and you think you're going to be rich.  The next day, you're working for another five years.  This ultimately also affects our budget here because that volatility in the markets affects CalPERS and their earnings and our liability.  So it's not just an issue that affects individuals.  It affects us directly.  Go to the state front.  Things are also a little bit crazy.  And it's just obvious.  It's up and down.  You don't know which way is which.  On the positive side, we have, depending upon whether you talk to the governor or the Ledge Analyst's Office, a $68 billion surplus or a $90 billion surplus.  Good news.  Except at the same time, things are kind of goofy in the sense of $6 gasoline prices.  And all you have to do is look up and down the state, and you see the issue that we're grappling with here on homelessness and affordable housing and other issues.  And you kind of have to scratch your head.  How can we be doing so well on one hand and yet still have all these different problems from a budgetary standpoint?  Locally, as we all know, all these problems that are above us tend to flow downhill.  And we're still dealing with some specific issues here.  The Camp Fire, we're still not through with the impacts of that on our community and all the other disasters that affected Butte County.  The prevalence of homelessness, which we're very familiar with, is, again, another additional thing that we're grappling with here as part of the Camp Fire.  So put simply, in this kind of chaotic and volatile world, I think, and I don't care what economist you talk to, it's kind of the wild, wild west out there.  With that said, even with all this craziness and volatility and our little Hamlet of Chico, we're doing our best in attempting to navigate these currents and eddies.  And I am pleased to present to you, like I said, a fully balanced budget that does allow us to basically go forward with your direction and leadership, your talent and your expertise.  And I'm proud to say that the Hamlet staff has put together a blueprint for continued stability that pursues your stated values of a safe place to raise a family, an ideal location for business, and a premier place to live.  In saying this, I don't, by no means am I ignoring some obvious issues that we have in our community.  Our roads continue to be deteriorating faster than we can maintain them.  Our sewer infrastructure is beyond its planned lifetime.  Homelessness is still something we're striving to solve and achieve a better way of dealing with that.  Thank you.  Our workforce and benefits are not where we would like them to be, and we're losing some of our competitiveness there.  And our revenues just aren't simply keeping up enough to meet our unmet needs and demands.  Still, even with all these challenges, the fiscal year 21-22 saw some significant milestones.  The completion of the Park Avenue Rehabilitation Project, which not only helped revitalize that area, but is offering pedestrians, cyclists, and motorists much better traffic and flow and safety during that important corridor.  We opened basically the Pallet Project, the non-congregate housing site.  While controversial and expensive, the filling of the shelter will ultimately help several hundred individuals  that are currently sleeping in our homes.  We're able to build parking lots, rent parks and waterways, get adequate shelter, and other support services to aid them in their way back to getting life off the streets.  We're able to fund new pieces of equipment that can better serve our citizens, including a new fire engine for Station 2.  We've added badly-needed affordable housing units.  The number of units that are entitled, permitted, and under construction will ultimately produce almost 1,400 units.  We utilize the American Rescue Plan resources  to avoid the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our residents.

We've got some stuff to go over for this afternoon.  What we'll be bringing to you today is an overview of our budget.  We have some new things in the budget that I will go over in terms of the budget document,  and then some financial projections to give you a perspective of where we are,  and then presentations from each department about what they are requesting  and what we have included in the budget going into the next year.  And with that, here we go.  Back in a few months ago, you all met for a strategic planning session over two sessions  and developed some visions and goals for the city to go forth with.  In the budget that you see this year, you will see some new symbols in there  that are symbolic to the goals that you have developed.  As you can see, we have balanced budget,  that you are planning,  looking for the infrastructure that you are strategically planned,  funded and maintained,  public safety,  and housing,  comprehensive housing strategy,  economic development,  and then a desirable place to live.  These icons that are in there are kind of be your guide as to what is in the budget,  what each of departments goals are,  and how they associate with your overarching goals that you've developed for our city.  What's new in the budget?  We have a couple areas where we have developed a couple changes that we want to go over.  The first one that I'll go over is our budget policy changes.  We have a new fund structure that is our Fund 307 that I'll go over in a moment,  and then we also have a new summary page that will show you new capital projects,  so it's easier to see what we have put in the budget in that regard.  So first, with budget policy changes,  we went over some changes.  The two first sections that you see there,  D1F and D2,  we went over this with our finance committee.  Our intention here is to increase transparency,  but also provide internal efficiencies so that the day-to-day operations of the departments can go  without having to come back to council for certain minor changes that we have in our budget process.  So I'll go over those.  Let me show you them,  so you can see.  Oops, I didn't have that up yet.  Page.  Okay.  So the first thing that we did was we added a level of transparency and reporting for you.  What we are going to do is all budget modifications,  whether they're approved internally or externally,  will be provided in some sort of report to city council.  Currently, you see all of the things that you are approving on supplemental appropriations that come to you on the agenda,  and you see those.  But those that are done internally that are for city manager approval or administrative services director approval,  you don't always see those except through the changes that come through the monthly monitoring process.  So we're going to develop a new summary report that we'll put with our monthly monitoring reports.  It'll come on reports and communications so you can see everything that we do internally fully transparent to you  so you can see what's happening within the city.  And then the next thing that we discussed was this idea of personnel to non-personnel expenditures.  It comes up quite often, especially with our recruiting situation and things that happen day-to-day,  where we may need to hire a consultant to do personnel work,  or we need to move monies because there's savings and we need to use it for a different purpose.  We are looking to have some authority within the departments to make those changes without having to come back to council to do that.  This is a pretty standard thing throughout the industry, and it's a limited value that we can do that.  So if you have anything that is under $100,000,  we're asking that we can do that internally and then report back to you.  Over $100,000 will still require you all to see that we're actually moving funds out of personnel to pay for other things that are going on.  Can I ask a quick question about that?  Yeah.  The previous number was $50,000, is that correct?  The previous number was zero.  So all personnel to non-personnel had to come to council.  This is not related to things like contract.  You said something about contracting out, so I was curious about that,  because there is a budget policy related to...  Okay.  So you're saying that we can go over $50,000 and over?  Yeah.  Purchasing policies are still in place.  So anything that's over $50,000, we still need to go through the normal purchasing procedures.  This is just moving the dollars so that if we have a situation where we have a professional service agreement  and we need somebody to come in to do some work, they can move those dollars over kind of on a day-to-day basis.  The thing that we're not doing is, and making sure that everybody still goes along with that,  is that if there's any change to...  If we're changing an FTE to a consultant, which is changing what we call the B appendix,  which is all of our allocated positions, that will always still come back to council.  That's for you to approve.  All allocated positions, all permanent positions that we have been allocated as the city  will always come back to you as city council to be approved.  Thank you.  Yeah.  And then going into our...  We didn't change anything going between departments.  And then going into the operations...  We didn't change anything going between departments.  We're only operating expenditure categories.  Now, this is the non-personnel variety that we just talked about.  Sometimes departments have to move things from material supplies to professional services or something like that.  This is all within the same department, within the same fund.  Anything that's changing anything on the fund level always comes back to council no matter what.  But this is just giving the full authority to do that internally without having to go back to the city council for approval.  And this is only operating categories.  This doesn't have anything to do with capital or personnel.  And then going down a little bit further.  Now, moving on to our capital improvement program.  We have many times where we are moving items within the same year.  The projects have already been established.  They are in the same fund.  But in terms of timing or in terms of bandwidth or in terms of this project is getting going before the other one,  many times we have to move funds from one project to another.  This is giving that authority to the city manager to approve.  The projects have already been approved on an overall whole.  It's within the same fund.  It's not changing the value of the dollars being spent in that funding source.  It is just moving between projects due to timing issues and things like that that come on.  And then we actually added a level of more restriction.  So before there was this ability to move monies between years.  We don't really like that.  Once a budget has been approved for a certain year, we want those dollars to stay in that year.  And if it does want to be moved from year to year, we want you all to approve that.  Because that's really looking for a change.  And we want to move that further than what our bandwidth is for that certain year.  So this is actually making that more restrictive with the exception of what we do on an annual basis in terms of rebudgets.  And that's in our Section E3.  That's a standard procedure where we haven't spent all of our monies in capital projects or encumbered funds at the end of the fiscal year.  And that gives us the ability to roll those into the next year so that we can spend them into the next year,  which is standard procedure just as it's a timing issue.  So we're still continuing.  We want to do that.  But in terms of moving things from year to year, otherwise, we are saying we don't want to do that.  And then the other thing that we are looking at is the breakout of phases of capital projects.  So right now, if we have project 5100 that's for the Esplanade reconstruction, a significant phase of that project is over.  But we still have much more to go.  Right now, in order to say that phase is completed, let's start a new one and let's start tracking the numbers on that one,  we have to come back to you and establish a new capital project for that.  This is just saying, okay, we've already established this full funding for this capital project,  but we need to break off that phase here and start a new phase.  We would like to be able to do that internally and then report back.  It doesn't change the funding level of the overall project.  It's just being able to break it into phases.  It's just being able to break it into phases for efficiency and for tracking purposes.  And then finally, we would like to be able to, if a grant has already been approved by the city council, has already been established,  we finally get the grant funds.  We haven't been able to put it in the budget yet because we didn't know the details of what we were awarded.  This is just the ability to establish those budgets without having to come back to council.  They've already been approved and it's already been allocated in there.  And there's no need to go back and do it again.  There's always revenue and expenditures that match each other.  So that's it in terms of the financial budget policy changes.  We have one more change that was requested by our human resources department,  and it's actually adding a level of review and scrutiny on when we promote folks.  So we have the ability to promote individuals in our organization,  and right now the language that is throughout the city and throughout a lot of the labor agreements  is that we can provide at least 5% increase to individuals.  There's not any language about the sky's the limit kind of a thing on the back end of it.  And what this language is saying here is that if somebody's wanting to go over 10%,  that needs to be reviewed and approved by the director of human resources and also the city manager.  That's practice that is happening now.  And so we're not saying that we're going to do it in any way.  It's just not codified somewhere so that we can say this is what needs to happen.  I mean, these are situations where we have somebody who's being promoted into a job  and let's say that they are offered a job somewhere else.  Sometimes there's a need to pay them more than 10% on that promotion.  It's a negotiated thing, but it's something that needs to be scrutinized  and it needs to be reviewed and it needs to have a cause for it,  not just because.  Today is Wednesday and we decide that that's what you need to be paid kind of a thing.  So that's putting in there just to add that level of control in there.  And that's it for our budget policies changes.  And also I wanted to say throughout this presentation for any of us,  if you have questions like Council Member Brown asked,  please ask them along the way.  It's a long day.  People forget and stuff.  Please interrupt us and just let us know what you have going on throughout the day  so we can get things answered along the way.  Okay.  Moving on.  We have, it's not a new fund number, but it's a new format for our Fund 307.  It's now called the Streets and Roads Fund.  And what we've done is everything that is related to streets and roads,  road activity, we've put it all into one fund so you can see all the activity  that we're doing road related.  It used to be that all of these costs were in this fund, that fund, et cetera, et cetera,  spread out through all the days.  So we're going to be able to see all the different funds throughout the city.  It's harder to see what we're actually spending on this activity.  We've changed it and flipped it and put it into all but one fund.  And what's in there is what is eligible according to the streets and highway code.  When it comes to our gas tax, we have to do a yearly report to the State Controller's Office.  And there are certain activities that are allowed within this street and highway code.  So everything that is allowable through there goes into this fund.  And I will give you an example so you can see it.  Oops, I did the wrong thing here.  So this is a little bit hard to see because it's a budget page.  But we still have all the revenue coming from the gas tax.  And then we have all of the different departments that contribute to road activities coming in here.  So it used to be that the street cleaning department, the right-of-way department, the street trees department were all represented in the general fund.  And we used to do a transfer of $2 million plus to the general fund to pay for those activities from the gas tax fund.  Now we're saying these are all the activities for the road fund.  And if the general fund needs to pay for any of that or wants to pay for any of that or can pay for any of that, you'll see it as a transfer into this fund going forward.  The other departments that are in here.  And here are the transportation departments that have been in our transportation fund previously.  So as you can see, all of the capital projects that we are planning to do for the next few years are represented in this.  It includes bikeways.  It includes sidewalks.  It includes, like I said, the operating activities of street cleaning and right-of-way maintenance.  It includes all the rehab projects, paving, et cetera, et cetera, that comes right into this one fund.  You mentioned that the gas tax fund is not represented in this fund.  It is.  It is.  Okay.  Sorry.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's still all the revenue for the gas tax fund is still up at the top here.  Thank you.  And then any of the contributing factors come in as what we call transfers on the bottom.  So now you can see that the general fund is going to be paying $4.7 million plus.  There's an asterisk there because we have the public infrastructure fund here, which I'll explain in a minute.  Parks fund.  And then the bulk of our money that's coming into this fund is from grants.  So a lot of times we have projects that we use things like gas tax, et cetera, to match.  And then we have grant funds that pay for a big bulk of what is going on in here.  So these are all the funds that contribute to the activity of our roads.  This public infrastructure, this is kind of something that we will also probably change going forward.  But as you remember, when we had the waste hauler franchise fees, part of what was the council adopted was,  a portion of that went into this public infrastructure fund to pay for roads.  So we have this fund, 943, that's set up as a direct transfer from the general fund for roads.  And now that is going back into this fund to pay for road projects.  So this is really, this $1.9 million is really general fund monies that have circled around back to this fund.  Going forward in future years, we will most likely show that as just a direct transfer from the general fund.  But just for your purposes and so you know what that is.  And as you can see, these numbers here where we used to transfer back to the general fund,  those were dollars that were going into the general fund from the gas tax fund to pay for those activities that I talked about earlier.  So this is just an easier way to see what all is going on here.  And then finally, we have a new page called new capital projects.  It's a new page.  It's hard to see here, but it just will give you a reference.  It's on our page 379 of the budget page.  It's just a listing of all the new capital projects that are in our capital projects activity.  We have many, many, many projects listed and it's hard to tell what's new and what's not.  So this is just a summary so you can see all of the different things that are going on.  This snapshot here isn't everything, but it just shows you the example of what we have in there so you can see what we have going on.  Thank you.  Okay.  Now on to the fun stuff.  Okay.  Moving on to our five-year projection and kind of where we think things are going to be and where we are, et cetera, et cetera.  Our budget page 33 has our five-year projection showing what we anticipate to happen in the general and park funds going into the next year.  The general funds revenue sources, 43% comes from sales tax.  Okay.  And then we have our property tax.  Between the property tax in lieu of ELF and property tax general is 32%.  And then we have some utility user tax, transportation or TOT tax, et cetera.  But the bulk of it is sales tax and property tax.  Over the last few years, talk about volatility, it's been challenging to predict what our revenues have been doing in the general fund for many different reasons.  This is an example of our sales tax.  In 2017-18, which was the fiscal year right prior to the campfire, we were at about $21 million per year of sales tax generation.  And then in that year with the campfire, suddenly we jumped up to over $25 million of sales tax.  And then the next year, we had a kind of a cooling off period of that where we went down a little bit.  And then COVID happened.  And then here we are sitting at home buying cars.  And buying things from Amazon, et cetera, et cetera.  And we had a big jump.  We also had what is commonly known as the Wayfair decision go into play here where all online sales are suddenly we are getting the local sales tax from that.  So it had a huge jump there because of those sales that weren't previously part of our sales tax are now part of it.  And then going into this fiscal year, we're kind of seeing the final phases of people spending.  All the stimulus money and everything that has been going on through the COVID period.  And actually all the latest projections that we're looking into going into next year and what you'll see in the budget is actually a reduction in our sales tax of about a 1% reduction because of inflation, because people have stopped spending, and because of the environment that we're in right now.  And then going forward, we're looking at a more steadier, slower-paced growth going into the future.  Oops.  I'll do that one in a minute.  Okay.  So looking at our five-year projection, we have, let me make this bigger.  Oops, that's too big.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  So we have what we're looking at for revenues for this year and next year.  And if I can get rid of that, that would be lovely.  We are looking for next year to increase our revenues by about 0.7%.  Again, we do have increases in many of the categories, but we are looking at a reduction in sales tax, which is our biggest piece there.  So we are looking at just a slight growth over this year into next year.  Property tax will continue to see growth, but again, that's just not as big of a thing here, partially because of the 2% cap on people who are living in their dwellings.  We get the biggest jump when people turn over their properties.  And then also when we do have new properties that come on to the books, you just have to keep in mind that a million dollars still only, of property value still only generates about $10,000 in income for us, so 1%.  So that's what we're looking at going forward for that.  And then our utilities and our transit occupancy tax still will be increasing.  We did see quite a big of a jump in our TOT this year compared to last year for obvious reasons due to COVID.  But we're looking at that kind of easing off a little bit as well just because of the environment that we're living in right now.  And then salaries and benefits.  This is a little bit of a misnomer because as I said before, all of the street cleaning and right of way, et cetera, that's represented in this number for this year is not in this number.  It's in the roads fund going into next year.  So that increase that's here that shows very slight is actually more than that.  But it'll show as a transfer when I go on to the next page.  So going forward, we are looking at increases in our salaries and benefits going over the next year.  And then the next few years, we do have a slight reduction in what our employer contributions are in the out years going for CalPERS.  This is due to a couple reasons.  First off, one of our biggest salary and benefits payments in the general fund is our police department and our CPOA union has agreed to pay going into 22-23 an additional 3% of their costs as employee contributions.  And then again the following year, that's going to be the same.  So that's part of that.  And then also with the big returns that we saw from CalPERS this last year where we thought that there was going to be the peak of the unfunded liability here, it's kind of backed it up a couple years.  So we're actually going to see a fall off of that.  And that's also with an asterisk, which I'll talk about in a minute because it could actually jump back up again in the out years because of the returns that we're seeing right now.  But I'll talk about that in a minute.  So going forward.  We are seeing increases in our salaries and benefits, just not to the extent that what could be in those regards.  And then just really in the out years, it's kind of a 2% projected increase in the costs going forward for different parts of the operating activities.  So as you can see with operating activities, we are in balance.  We have a surplus.  We're not spending as much as we are gaining in terms of revenue expenditures.  But this also does not include what I've said before about the transfers.  So we'll talk about that.  And then we have capital improvement programs that add to the expenditures and then our financing sources and uses, which is on the last page.  So we're looking at the end of this year of fund balance in the general fund of about $7.6 million.  Now this is higher than what our desired operating reserves are.  However, if you can see, we started this year.  Fiscal year 21-22 with a $21 million balance.  We're spending that on one-time activities, big purchases that we need and ongoing.  So even though we are looking at a $7.6 million balance going into the end of next year, that will be used in certain ways going forward.  So we're not uncomfortable with that balance because of the unknowns and because of the activities that we see going forward.  Now talking about actually where we spend our other dollars, we have a couple significant places.  This specialized community services is a fund that we've established for our health and human services activities, homeless activities, providing shelters, providing facilities, providing warming centers, etc., etc.  All goes into that fund.  You'll see that in 22-23, we only have about a $700 million balance.  We have a $100,000 contribution from the general fund.  This is thanks in part to the American Rescue Plan dollars that we're able to use for some of the activities.  But going forward, we are looking at that it's going to cost us some millions of dollars to provide those services going forward.  And then in our...  Sorry, I'm losing my...  And then the streets and roads, we're looking at about a $6.3 million transfer this year.  That includes that public infrastructure piece that I was talking about.  Earlier.  And then going forward, we're looking at $4 million average per year going into that fund.  And then the other big one that we have here is our fleet replacement fund.  We have a few apparatus that we are going to be purchasing this year that we'll be talking about, the other departments will be talking about later.  And so that transfer is larger than normal because of that for this year.  And I do want to note that you can see the airport fund.  The general fund does not have a transfer in here.  This is the first time that we will have seen that the general fund has not had to support the airport fund in many, many years.  It's a balanced fund now.  And going forward, it looks like it will be that way into the future unless things change as they can.  And then the only other fund that I want to kind of put a little bug about is our parking fund.  It was the one fund that really took a hit with COVID.  Because we didn't have people parking downtown.  So we did recommend this year we have a, we have a, sorry, I lost my spot.  We have a $150,000 transfer that goes from our parking revenue fund into its reserve every year.  It's part of our budget policies.  We're asking that you put that in there.  We're asking to suspend that for one more year.  There, we have suspended it for the last two years due to COVID.  And we just don't have the fund balance or the ability to put that into the reserve.  The reserve is there to pay for renovations and build up things so that we can pay for big capital expenditures.  And we're requesting to suspend that one more year.  And then in the hopes that now that the students are back, now that activity in downtown is back, that the revenues are back to where they were before.  That we'll be able to start that up again in 23, 24.  But as you can see, fund balance is deteriorated quite a bit because of COVID.  And, but we are looking that that will turn itself around in the next year or so.  Okay.  Any question about projections before I move on to CalPERS?  Okay.  Okay, CalPERS.  Looking into next year, we're looking at our, for our unfunded liability payments, we're looking at a miscellaneous payment of $5.47 million.  And then the safety plan, $5.9 million.  That's our annual payment that we pay to the unfunded liability.  That includes the discount that we get for paying it upfront every year.  So that's what we, our actual cash out will be.  As of the actuarial from 6-30-2020, which we received last summer, the balance and unfunded liability and the miscellaneous plan was almost $70 million.  And then the safety plan will be $80 million.  Now that's kind of a fluctuating number and kind of a funny thing to look at because as you all are probably aware, as of 6-30-21, the interest received from CalPERS is about $5 million.  the investment return was 21.3%.  What that's going to do is suddenly put us into,  instead of being 65% to 67% funded in the miscellaneous plan,  we'll be looking at, or in both plans,  we'll be looking at 74% to 75% funded.  It's because of the investment return,  suddenly our balance is going to go way down.  We expect that to go back up again at the end of this year.  The other thing that triggered is the discount rate  or what they expect to receive in investments  went down from 7% to 6.8%.  That will affect, actually, in a positive way,  our unfunded liability,  but in a slightly negative way, the normal cost  because what we have to pay on a day-to-day basis  to pay for the benefits,  they're looking at the investments on those dollars  won't receive as much,  so we have to pay more on the normal basis  to achieve the goals that they need to pay for retirees.  The other thing that's going to happen  is that we're looking at,  I have kind of been trying to look into  where they're expecting their returns to be.  The last solid information that I received  was they were looking at about a 2% return  for the year at CalPERS.  I have since heard that they may be looking  at negative returns this year.  So if that's the case,  we do have the ability to kind of weather  that storm going forward.  We have a couple different places  where we have a lot of opportunity to look at  and we have pockets of reserve  for this kind of a thing.  First off, that won't affect our rates until 24-25  because everything is on a two-year wait cycle.  And then we also, as of the end of this fiscal year,  we have our pension stabilization trust fund,  which will have over $3 million in there this year.  And then we also have a reserve built up  in just our unfunded liability reserve fund  where we'll have over $4 million in there  at the end of this year.  So with that,  taking into account the actual rates that we need to pay,  if we need to, we can kind of smooth that out  and not make that such a burden going forward.  This is kind of just a history  of where we've been with CalPERS  and why it's a difficult thing to estimate  and a thing to kind of project out going forward.  Their investment returns are kind of all over the place.  If you take...  If you take 2009,  which is when their big reduction happened  and all the reform kind of stemmed from that and everything,  up to this last 2021,  the average is about 8%.  Looking at some of the kind of five years in different...  I've looked at it in a couple different ways.  It's anywhere from 6% to 9%  is kind of their average return over this span of time.  So, you know, good years and bad years  and hopefully the good years...  win over the bad in the long term.  And then going into the normal cost,  I just wanted to highlight that...  what the employees are paying.  We have made efforts with our different employee groups  that they're picking up more of the employer cost  of the normal cost that we pay in our miscellaneous plan.  Right now, our city cost is for next fiscal year,  depending on the group that we're talking about.  Each unit has kind of a different structure.  Our city cost will be from just under 6% to the highest,  which is the normal cost for the plan of 12.65%.  And then employees are paying anywhere from 7.5%  up to 14.68% for that cost.  And then on the safety side, the normal cost...  the total normal cost is 21.7%.  And we're paying anywhere from 15.7% to 21.7%.  And the employees are picking up either between 12% and 16%.  So, we're paying between 12% and 16.75%.  To put it in perspective, social security payments are 6.2%.  So, we would be paying 6.2% and the employees would be paying 6.2%.  So, we're doing a lot better in terms of what people are paying  from that perspective.  Okay. I am done with financial projections and information there.  Do you have any questions before I move on to our administrative services department,  and what are our goals for this year?  Okay.  So, administrative department is really an internal service department throughout the city.  Our obligations are to provide solid financial reporting,  give safeguards to our financial transactions, monitor our cash,  and to provide those services that are needed throughout the department  so that they know that they are spending their money.  So, they know that they are spending their money appropriately, etc.  And then we also have information systems,  and they are working hard to provide a very good computer network system  that is current, and that is providing, and that is accurate,  and that is also functioning well and doing what it needs to do to provide the service for them.  Our mission in the administrative services department is to provide  the best services to serve the citizens of Chico and the departments  with accurate, efficient, and timely information, service, and support.  We have a total operating budget request of $5 million with personnel costs of $3.1 million.  The one change in terms of personnel that we are requesting this year  is for our information services department.  We have a senior information services analyst position that we're asking to download.  We want to downgrade into two lower positions to provide more bandwidth  within the department to be able to serve the departments better  and to make them be able to do the activities they needed to do.  So, we have a senior information services analyst that we're reducing down to an information services analyst  and an information services technician.  So, that's the one request there in terms of personnel.  Now, some of the goals that we have  and some of the projects that we're doing in finance,  we are looking to stay the course, first and foremost.  We have a request in, it's a $20,000 request for budget book software.  Currently, this budget that you put together is a whole bunch of different documents  and a whole bunch of different sources of information that we put together into one big document.  Budget book would actually provide us one central location to do everything.  It makes it so that we have more control over it.  It makes it so that departments and us can communicate better with it.  And it's just an easier access and more efficient way to develop the actual budget itself.  And then in information systems, we have a couple different projects that are new and ongoing.  As you all know, we have a fiber utility project that was paid for by American Rescue Dollars.  That is ongoing.  The pilot project is still going.  And we're looking to continue that and kind of start actually seeing some activities  and some onboarding of some facilities with the new broadband.  And then cloud, DR, and ops, that's a cryptic way of saying disaster recovery and operations.  We're looking more and more, we're looking to keep our data safe.  And in terms of a disaster, we have ability to pull it down from the cloud  and to have places to save it in case something happens.  And then also, we're looking to build a network.  So with our IS security audit, that's information.  A firm comes in and audits where we have weaknesses in terms of security,  something that should be done every once in a while,  and also provides us with more ability to know where the weaknesses are  so that our systems don't go down and we aren't hacked by nefarious folks.  And then we had the big RIMS project that has been happening over the last year or so,  and we need storage for that.  And we're looking to build a network that's able to do that.  And then we have the other side of the information systems house.  We have radios.  This has been a big project over the last few years.  It has been a big time and something that has needed to be done over many, many years.  We have radios that were very antiquated.  They were kind of held together with,  glue and duct tape.  And we are looking to,  I mean, they are the critical infrastructure to many of the departments here,  safety, our public works, etc., etc.  We need these radios to provide all the coverage that we need,  and we can't have them fail.  So we have a couple different projects that are continuing in that regard.  We have a lab creation expansion.  We actually are looking for a space so that our,  our radio specialist in auto actually doesn't have to be doing it out of his car,  or, you know, that sort of thing.  He needs a space to do what he needs to do, lots of parts and things.  And then the in-building radio coverage,  that's actually something that is so,  for instance, in City Hall,  I don't know if you've noticed,  but sometimes our service kind of has a tendency to be bad in there.  And this is actually to provide so that in our facilities,  and what we will want to have throughout public buildings and throughout the city,  that if safety comes into a building,  they have the ability to use their radios without any kind of interruption.  And then ongoing radio system upgrades.  And then finally, fire mock alert system expansion.  Those are related to when 911 calls,  it sends an alert to the different stations and kind of turns on the lights  and turns off stoves and things like that there.  So that's an expansion of that.  And then finally,  the fire station one,  and that is it for administration services department.  Any questions on that?  I'm on a roll.  Okay.  Our human resources and risk management department,  and normally I wouldn't be speaking to this,  but Amanda of Strand is off today,  and they are light on people available.  So I'm here to represent them,  and tell you that they are also an internal service department.  They serve over 400 employees.  They launch many, many recruitments on a daily basis,  and they help support the different services throughout the city,  and the employees throughout the city,  both on a professional and personal level.  Many things that happen around here.  And really they're rolling their budget that is in there this year,  with the exception that they are asking for one more human resource,  and they're asking for one more human resource technician.  They have a very small department.  There's not a lot of redundancy,  and there's not a lot of ability to spread the work.  So that is being requested as a mid-year add.  So the funding is in there for a January in service for that position.  And that's their budget details.  And then I am done.  Any questions for me?  All right.  No questions.  All right, Barbara.  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right.  Good afternoon.  Mayor Coolidge, Vice Mayor Reynolds,  members of the council,  Jennifer McCarthy,  and the deputy city manager.  I'm just going to hit on a couple items related to the city manager's department,  also known as the city manager's office.  With the staff of four individuals,  the city manager's office completes its mission of providing ethical,  and trusted leadership while building a sustainable government structure,  and effectively and efficiently directing city operations.  The request this year from the city manager's office is in alignment with prior years,  with no,  whoopsie.  I've been canceled.  Thank you.  As I was saying,  the request this year is in alignment with previous years,  with no major additions,  and no current additions of positions as well.  In an effort to foster operational success of the city of Chico,  the city manager's office remains committed to some major goals.  That includes providing fiscal leadership,  operationalizing council policy,  and really strengthening strategic partnerships within our city itself,  and as well with outside agencies.  So I'm just going to take a second and talk about a couple of the successful projects  that we've worked on in 21-22 that will continue on into 22 and 23.  The first is a Lost Park redevelopment project.  As all of you are aware,  this includes the property that is associated with Municipal parking lot 5,  as well as the two buildings at 25 and 35 Main Street.  This is a very unique project for the city of Chico.  It will involve a cooperative agreement with the development team,  as well as Chico State University and Chico State Enterprises.  We are in the process of  reviewing RFQ submissions,  and we'll have something back to the council next fiscal year.  Obviously, the emergency non-congregate housing site  has taken a lot of effort and a lot of time in the city manager's office.  It goes to show that projects that may be led through this office  really involve important collaboration with all of the departments within the city of Chico.  And this is one of the prime examples of that.  I look around here,  and every single one of the departments,  here for your city of Chico,  has been involved in this project  and should be really proud of their involvement in that project.  Cannabis,  well,  21-22 was the year that the city began the application process  for retail manufacturing and distribution of cannabis.  The retail applications have gone through three of the four phases of review  with the fourth phase public hearing to consider the top three applicants  to be anticipated in June of 2022.  In addition,  five permits have been awarded for manufacturing and distribution.  This effort has been led by management analyst Dilg  in the city manager's office  in cooperation with the community development department,  police, finance, and fire.  The economic development front has been busy  with the reboot of our Team Chico collaborative organization.  It has brought back business outreach,  labor pool development,  and coordinated response to expansion,  retention, and recruitment  to businesses here within the city of Chico.  In addition,  the council has allocated over $2 million  to various economic development projects and programs  utilizing one-time funding through the American Rescue Plan.  These projects included such things as $200,000  towards enhancing business storefronts,  $250,000 towards creating a citywide tourism and marketing program,  and over $1 million towards small business support.  These funds are definitely going to go a long way  to helping to stabilize the business community  as we move out of Chico.  The City Manager's Office has been working  with the various aspects of the community educational campaign  associated with the potential sales tax initiative.  I'm not going to go into that today  because we look forward to coming back to you  in your June meeting and providing you more information on that.  Again, what I provided you today is just an example  of some of the projects and programs  that the City Manager's Office had been working on in 2021-2022  and will continue on into 2022-2023  with the understanding that we have a lot of work to do  to help the community.  While projects may be led through City Management Department,  it really takes the collaboration of all the departments  here within the city to make success happen.  So, happy to take any questions.  Thank you.  Well, good afternoon, Mayor, Vice Mayor, Council Members.  Believe it or not, this is my fifth budget presentation.  I can't believe I made it that long.  It's taken me that long to learn about my budget.  It can be quite complex.  And if you ask Barbara, I make it way too complex for her.  So, I really appreciate the work her and her staff do  to keep us running.  So, and actually, I'm up here, obviously,  to talk about my favorite topic,  which is the fire department.  Second only to myself,  but I'll keep it focused on the fire department.  So, we have seven strategic goals we identified in this budget  that support the city's goals.  Attain long-term and sustainable staffing solutions.  Update our radio and communication systems.  Create an effective planning process for facilities and maintenance.  Develop a fire fleet program for maintenance and capital replacement.  Evaluate an EMS priority-based response policy and program.  Develop a public education program that aligns with our mission.  And develop training programs based on best practices.  Those come straight out of our strategic plan,  and those are our basic framework for how we go and approach  each and every strategic goal,  and then our budget priorities as a result of that.  And our mission is pretty straightforward,  to provide the highest quality fire rescue and emergency services  to our community.  And do so in as compassionate and caring a manner,  as well as professional as we can be.  So, for those in our community that may not know what the fire department does,  other than race down the street with our lights and sirens on,  and our big red trucks,  we actually have a wide range of services we provide our community.  The predominant response for us,  the predominant service is emergency response.  Fires, EMS, rescues, and just any general emergency that can't be handled any other way,  we respond.  We are the toolbox, I guess, of the emergency response world.  Sorry, Matt, didn't mean to call you out on that one.  We are also responsible for emergency management and pre-incident planning,  and hopefully this budget will help us continue to make inroads on that effort as well.  And then,  code enforcement is our proactive risk reduction outreach to the community,  and to our development community as well.  And then public education,  predominantly done through both code enforcement and our crews getting out into the community,  and working with the public to educate them and inform them of safety elements that are essential for them to be safe and secure in their own community.  So this last year was another  productive year for our community.  I want to take a moment to recognize that we are one year,  nearly one year into Captain Steve Andrews passing last year,  and his loss is felt as it should be.  Now normally,  I wouldn't highlight this because  any time we don't achieve our minimum staffing,  which we've been maintaining at 17 a day with five apparatus and 16 crews,  and then one battalion chief,  normally it would be cause for concern to say we went to 90% through this time last year,  and relative to the previous year.  But it's saying something because we've had an extraordinarily high number of vacancies due to retirements,  to people leaving for other agencies,  long-term work comp,  and then COVID itself has had a huge impact on our community.  And so we've had a significant impact on our staffing levels.  And I point this out because it shows extraordinary commitment and dedication that our folks have had having to work a lot of overtime,  being held over,  forced over in some cases to maintain our minimum staffing level.  And while we had instances where we've dropped below that level,  that was only done because it was for the safety of our crews,  because they were working so many hours,  and we had so few people available during certain stretches of this last fiscal year.  And I want to also recognize that the council,  understanding the impact of that,  helped us achieve two additional,  or three additional firefighters to add one additional floater to each shift,  which has been amazingly successful,  because it's provided relief for those individuals that were being held over.  So I want to thank you for that.  Thank you.  The new training captain was another much needed position.  We have extraordinarily high training requirements,  over 240 hours per year,  each firefighter's minimum training level that they're constantly achieving.  And then for other positions in the fire department,  whether it's a specialty team,  captain, fire engineer,  they're required to get additional hours as well.  So it's a really onerous training regiment for us,  and having a dedicated training captain allows us to keep our battalion chiefs focused on the day-to-day operations,  while the training chief allows us to enhance our training.  As was noted,  the CAD-to-CAD interface will successfully be completed here in the next week or so,  and this will be the second phase of the CAD-to-CAD interface,  the computer-aided dispatch interface between CAL FIRE and Chico Fire was completed last year.  This one will be done in this fiscal year.  And it automatically transfers the data between the agencies,  so it becomes much more efficient,  and it takes some of the pressure off of our dispatchers to make the phone calls between the two dispatch centers.  So we're excited to have that go into effect here soon.  Our Community Wildfire Protection Plan,  that was funded last year,  and we're at the last phases of it.  It's the community input.  We'll be bringing forward the draft plan to the council to review and approve,  but this will give us a really nice ability to recognize the micro areas of wildfire hazards we have within the heart of the city,  as well as augmenting the information we already know about on the site.  So we're excited to have that go into effect here soon.  And it will go in concert with the Vegetation Management Plan,  and provide an additional resource for them to tap into in order to prioritize the management plan itself.  And then finally, as was already noted again,  we placed a new fire engine into service at Station 2.  This has been a really positive move.  High tech,  which was the event that we had,  we had a vendor that built it from the ground up with firefighter input and involvement.  This was a piece of apparatus that high tech has been displaying as one of its marquee builds in the last several years.  It's a terrific piece of apparatus,  and we will be replicating with the funding that came this year,  two additional engines that will be the prototype for those.  So this year's goals,  as I suggested,  we'll be designing and building three new,  I said four,  I apologize,  I'm not adding to the budget,  I swear.  Three new apparatus,  and that's two engines and one teller truck.  But if you're willing to give us the fourth one,  I'm happy to throw it in there,  but I'm seeing poor Paul shake his head.  But we'll be replicating the,  we'll use the template,  look for the engine we got last year,  and then we'll be getting a second teller truck to replace the,  put the current teller into reserve to replace the ladder truck we have now that is slowly becoming obsolete and difficult to maintain.  Again,  we are excited about the upgrade to the radio and communication systems that will go to the P25,  which is a huge improvement to the system  and to the safety of both police,  fire,  as well as our EMS agencies that will have access to it as well.  Along those lines,  we talked about the mock alert,  and it ties into both communications as well as our dispatching,  and I'll talk about that in just one moment.  That mock alert not only alerts our stations,  but there's a module in there to take a text and convert it to voice,  so it reduces the amount of impact that we're having.  We're also going to be taking the text notes and translating them into voice commands,  which will reduce down the amount of dispatch time and the amount of time it takes the dispatchers to actually communicate the information.  So it's one way for us to make it more efficient and reduce the impact on our beleaguered dispatch center.  Reorganize the prevention bureau.  They work here in the state of Texas,  and they're working with collaboration and collaboration with our finance department.  We found a more efficient way to collect on the existing fees for inspections  that right now are difficult for us to collect that money,  and quite a few of those funds are outstanding.  And those relate, for example,  to our state mandated inspections of our apartments,  our parking lots,  hotels,  motels.  And so now this will create a more efficient way to get that money,  and allows us to offset the cost of reorganizing,  adding a fire marshal,  and then reorganizing our salary schedules down for our fire prevention officer and our inspector  to go in line with our operations side of it or our suppression side.  And this will give us a lot more capacity to get into our communities,  into buildings,  high risk buildings,  and things right now that we're incapable of doing and filling positions that we can't fill right now.  A goal of ours is to secure funding to build a much needed station on the north end of town,  Station 6.  That would help provide better response times.  With Station 42 and Station 6 closing,  it created a big gap in that area.  So Station 6 is high on our priority list.  We do have the apparatus and the staffing to move from Station 2 to that station.  So it's really just about taking that land that is already allocated for that purpose and building a station.  So we hope to accomplish that next year.  We will be looking at creating a new standard of cover.  A lot has changed since the last one,  and we need to have a better roadmap for where we want to go.  And what kind of expectations our community has.  So these are community driven processes along with our strategic plan that will mirror the recommendations that come out of that,  as well as supporting the city's strategic plan that the council developed this last year.  And then lastly,  and I'll just cover this briefly because Chief Madden will go into more depth about this.  We will be reorganizing and bifurcating the fire and PD dispatching function.  To give the dispatch center on the police side the PSAP,  or the Public Safety Answering Point,  which our city is one of,  it gives it more sustainability over a system that,  quite frankly, has had a lot of difficulty maintaining staffing.  And meeting its mission.  And by bifurcating that for the fire side,  it will allow us to recruit without the same stringent requirements that PD is required to have,  as far as their training and their recruitment and hiring.  So we'll be able to manage our side of the house more effectively,  and give better service to our community by creating that separation between those two functions.  And with that,  I am ready and willing to answer any questions you may have.  Question?  I do have a quick question.  Yes.  About how much is a fire truck and how many years is it good, is its life?  Roughly speaking, I'll let Eric answer that.  So the Type 1 fire engine that you know is about $660,000.  We get about a life cycle of about 20 years out of it.  That's the identified life cycle.  But we've gone several years over that.  As Steve knows.  And then the ladder trucks, the last one we bought was about $1.2 million.  And same life cycle, roughly 20 years.  And by 20 years, it's 10 years front line and 10 years in reserve is what we look at.  Gotcha.  And then on the Station 6, you said you're hoping to identify funding for it by this year,  or actually start building this year?  Well, if you could give me the money this year, I'd do it this year.  Okay.  We're looking for the funding.  Funding.  We're looking for the support moving forward.  We have a team together that is looking at the fire station design,  and we'll start to put plans together in the hopes that we can find funding to support that.  It's not a cheap endeavor, that's for sure.  Perfect.  Thank you.  Great.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right.  Good afternoon, councils.  Appreciate the opportunity to be here today to talk about the police department.  It's actually my privilege to be up here to do so.  So, thank you for that opportunity.  One of the things I want you to know is we have worked really diligently in the years  on creating a 2021 Police Department annual report.  We haven't done one in a few years,  simply with all the things that are going on, low staffing.  But in an effort to continue to stay engaged and transparent,  we were able to do that.  Unfortunately, based on your agenda schedule,  I was not able to put that in front of this,  and I wish that I could have.  But I am coming back on June 7th to your meeting  to do a staff presentation on that annual report  and then release it out to the community  so they can see what's going on with their police department.  So I won't get into a lot of the strategic goals  because I'll be back up here in a few weeks to talk about those.  But really, from the police side,  obviously it's provide a safe place to live, work, and recreate within.  That's our motto.  One of the things we're intentionally focused on as well,  outside of normal police reduction of crime and solving problems,  is we need to find creative ways to start reducing  the fatal vehicle accidents that we have experienced in this last year.  And we'll do that through education and enforcement.  We've been gracious enough to receive that CHP cannabis grant,  which provided additional funding to...  It didn't come with FTEs, but it came with overtime  so we can continue to do impaired driving checkpoints,  those types of things.  And it also provided additional equipment  for us to be able to provide that service.  But this is an area of concern for all of us.  We've had some very tragic incidents happen,  and we just can't accept that on the roadways.  In this city.  So that's a focus for us.  Our commitment,  ongoing commitment to community engagement and partnerships,  that occurs every day at your police department.  And again, the transparency within the organization  and the community is key for us.  It's a focal point for us.  And like I said, we'll be back up here in a few weeks  to talk about that in depth.  Our mission at the police department  is to create a safer Chico and improve quality of life  by partnering with our community  and providing dedicated service.  You can see the numbers.  There are a current number of positions  with the police department,  your largest department in the city,  at 171.18.  I'm not sure where the .18 goes, but...  So one of the things that this police administration  has been really focused on  is being fiscally responsible.  And we understand coming into budget,  being the biggest department,  that we have to be responsible  in what we come and ask for.  So one of the things that we've been doing  as a command staff and an administrative team  at your police department  is constantly going through quarter by quarter  and making sure we're tracking our finances,  working closely with Barbara and her team,  and then find creative ways throughout the year  to find supplemental ways  to get some of those capital projects  and some of that equipment and training  that is always ongoing,  and that's what we're doing.  at the police department,  rather than come here on this day  and ask for a lot of things.  So I think you'll see that for council  that you've seen the police department  presentations before.  What we're not going to be asking for this year  is police officers,  but as a 24-7 operation,  it requires support staff.  And we'll be talking about that.  So when it comes to public safety dispatch,  I'm going to be talking about this concept  that we're working on and looking for approval.  But essentially, I just want to explain,  your public safety dispatch center  at the Chico Police Department  is a state-required answering system  for the 911 system.  We're required, the sizes of this city,  we're required to provide that service to this community,  not only in this community,  but to the county and to the region.  And I know you know that as all the cases that the 911s,  the police officers,  and the other things that have come in  and how all the agencies work through that.  So that really is the priority.  It's called a PSAP,  but it's the 911 system and the 911 dispatcher.  At this point, we've been operating at very low levels.  I know this council,  we have come to you before,  looking at creative ways to try to find hiring recruitment to get their levels positions up  and other creative recruiting ideas and retention issues. And so I know the council, you're familiar  with some of the things that we've gone on in trying to maintain the staffing levels to provide  that type of service to our community. So we're asking for two FTE dispatcher positions. This  really is a staffing model that's been in place and looked at and developed since 2000. So that  gives you an idea. This isn't a new concept. Working towards what I'll be presenting towards  the end of this projection. We're asking for an evidence technician. This would really backfill  the potential of a promotion of an evidence supervisor. Evidence system is one of the  greatest liabilities that I face as a police chief. And so maintaining and  implementing that is a very important part of the project.  Having oversight and accountability of the evidence system is paramount. And so we're asking for that  to convince on January of 2023. We're asking for two community service officers. Our community  service officers are assigned to patrol and they really, a primary function for them  is to maintain and operate our holding facility. That is a state  overseen holding facility. And so we're under the direction of the state.  And we're also under the direction of the state and department of corrections to maintain that.  And so staffing is always an issue to make sure that we can do that with all the folks that come in  through arrest for that. This actually is really an over-hire for animal control. We currently have  two. However, our senior one has been on light duty and unable to be in the field for quite some time  and is also planning on retiring in the next fiscal year. So really, I'm asking for an evidence  in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in  And then some of the equipment needs. One of the things we've done as we've continued to focus on de-escalation and really looking at what we do, critical incident response, is we have taken all lethal shotguns from the police department and converted them all to less lethal munitions.  We no longer have lethal shotguns. The reason we did that is, one, that piece of equipment, that type of use of firearm, we really don't think is appropriate in more of an urban environment such as Chico.  We have other tools in our tool belt. And we only had four less lethal shotguns, and they were typically kept in a supervisor vehicle.  Well, we know there's times where the supervisor's not going to be able to be at that call.  So now every police officer in a vehicle has additional less lethal. They already carry less lethal with them, but this particular item is going to be in their cars and accessible to them if it's appropriate.  So with that, that came with some expense there to not only do the conversion, but to buy the munitions and the equipment to make that happen for us.  Okay.  Due to the staff.  Due to the staff turnover we've experienced, and the large amount of vacancies we have in the organization, when we do hire and recruit, that's a uniform cost for all the safety equipment that we provide, and the safety equipment that we're upping when we've gone to body cams and all the different things, is we need to expand that equipment because we're working very diligently and focusing on hiring and recruiting and getting those positions filled and getting those officers out on the street.  So we're going to be working very diligently and focusing on hiring and recruiting and getting those officers out on the street.  One of the other things that we've been having very difficult, especially right now through COVID and the different things, is subpoena service.  Typically our community service officers were responsible for doing that.  One of the things that's happening in the court system, right, is constant continuances and court cases not going.  And so we're just spending a lot of time going back and reserving and reserving, and we're spending a lot of time and manpower in that.  The district attorney recognized that all the agencies in the county were experiencing that problem.  He's put a plan together.  And so we're going to be working very diligently and focusing on hiring and recruiting and getting those officers out on the street.  And so we would like to get on board with that cost associated for the district attorney and provide that service to the city of Chico.  And other agencies in the county are also going to that as well.  This is really, this is interesting for me.  This is some new technology that is really, I think, going to change police training moving into the future.  And that is virtual reality crisis intervention tech training through Axon.  Axon is a company that currently we use a lot of their.  Their equipment to include their body cams and some of the other things in our interview rooms.  So it really is a perfect match for us.  But essentially what it is, is it is going to be out of our training cadre, be able to train our officers in virtual reality.  Simply standing right here in this room.  These are designed for crisis intervention, de-escalation and use of force training.  So give you an example.  One of the training modules.  In this system and they continue to update and change them as issues come up in law enforcement.  Is a mental health crisis scenario.  And so you can put the officer in that scenario.  Walk them through your instructor standing right there with the laptop.  They're watching what's going on.  And then we can respond.  The results based on the officer's actions.  So if the officer does is doing a really good job and using those techniques.  They trained him to.  Right.  They're going to win and they're going to they're going to work through.  And have a positive results in that training.  If they're not, it's going to point out to us those areas.  It'll know the officers tone of voice.  The other really interesting thing is once the officers done it records everything.  We can actually put the officer back into that scenario.  Watch it.  And you can also even put the officer in the person's purview.  Like the mental health person that was in there.  So they can actually see.  You know how they approached how they stood where their hands were.  I mean the whole nine yards.  So.  For that type of cost to totally reinvent the type of training that I know is is expected for law enforcement.  We talked a lot about it right here in these chambers.  This is really going to.  Get us to where we need to be.  And then as far as the animal shelter.  You know the police department does oversee our animal services.  There was a lease at a cost of 75 annually.  This was in regards to the human.  You can mean society bleeding their new facility.  And we also saw an increased in disposal of animal remains with contractors.  So there is some contractual services in our budget.  To transfer funds line items to absorb the increased cost for the current operating budget for the animal services department.  So the bifurcation of police and fire dispatch services.  So I've explained that.  You know.  The dispatch center is really the 911 center at the police department.  And so.  In order for us to hire a dispatcher.  Because that dispatcher not only is got to be trained and have the level to be able to provide that service of 911 dispatching.  Which is a very difficult job.  They also have access to all the police databases.  So a dispatcher has to pretty much go through their hiring process the same as a police officer.  They have to have a.  Clean background.  They have to go through psychological examinations.  I mean it's a.  It's a big deal just to get somebody through the door that even meets those type of requirements.  That training for that dispatcher is over 18 months long.  Because not only do they have to train and get certified.  In 911.  They have to learn the entire police side of the room and be able to dispatch.  Police.  We also provide up until this point.  We provided that service.  Dispatching service to the fire department.  So.  Since in 2000.  Since in 2018.  Since in 2018. What has happened over the years since 2000, since this has been talked about with my predecessor and his predecessor and Steve's predecessors is how do we how do we we were going in two different directions in 2000 and it's not changed.  Since in 2018.  Since in 2018.  Since in 2018.  Since in 2018.  Since in 2018.  Since in 2018.  Since in 2018.  Since in 2018.  Since in 2018.  Since in 2018.  Since in 2018.  If it's a fire call, but then also if it's a co-response with fire, we send that, but then we're also dispatching fire and police potentially at the same time.  So a dispatcher right now is wearing three different hats.  They're doing three different jobs, and it's not working anymore.  We have low, low numbers.  We're currently at 15.  That's three supervisors and 12 dispatchers.  In 2021, they handled a total of 161,261 phone calls.  That includes all inbound and outbound calls coming out of your dispatch center with 15 people.  The supervisors are working as active dispatchers.  They're not supervising because our staffing levels are so low.  So we've gotten to the point where, frankly, as your police chief, I lay in bed.  I'm scared to death because if our staffing level drops anymore, what are we going to do?  There is no backup.  We have to provide 911 service.  It's where all calls come in for anything related to any type of emergency in this city, this county, and this region.  So I want to thank Steve Standridge, fire chief, for finally us getting down, rolling up our sleeves, getting collaborative, working together,  come up with a solution for this long-term problem because it's not sustainable.  And so what we're asking for is July 1.  The police department is willing to give up.  We're going to get three FTEs out of the dispatch center and give allocated those positions to the fire chief.  The fire chief then has in his budget the ability to build out a fire dispatching for his department.  Essentially, if you think about when I talk about they're wearing three hats, if you take 100% of what a dispatcher does, 911, police, fire,  we're essentially taking 33% of the workload out of the room.  And that's what we're asking for.  And that happens.  You're just going to see your hiring and recruiting numbers go up.  You're going to see that training, that 18 months just to get to that is going to be reduced.  We'll still network and work with the fire department because we'll be on the same systems.  We'll still have that interaction.  But it's going to take that dispatching and all the calls that are associated with the fire needs and move it over under the fire chief's control.  And frankly, he needs some autonomy for that.  Because we're doing different things.  And that's just what it is.  So I'd be happy to answer any additional questions.  But what I do want you to know is we've asked for two, given up three.  There's nothing nefarious around that.  What it's saying is that we had this targeted level back in 2000 to get to where Cal OES recommends our staffing levels.  But if we take 33% out of that room, I don't need the number.  I can take the numbers that we had projected to be through the Cal OES PSAP recommendations, if that makes any sense.  And I can provide clarity if I need to.  And so with that, that's the police department's requested budget.  And I can answer any questions.  All right.  Do we have any questions for the chief?  Just a quick question.  In looking at the operating summary report, it indicates in the department total an 11% increase in budget total.  With like a 32% increase in non-recurring operating allocations.  Can you speak to what that is?  I'd have to refer to Barbara.  I don't have that information with me.  I'll have to look up the details.  Non-recurring operating are generally one-time payments for items that are $50,000 or less in nature.  They're not capitalized.  They're not put into a capital project.  So any of those kind of...  One-off items that are one-time payments that aren't going to be going on an operational basis.  But in terms of the details, give me two seconds and I'll...  Sure.  That's page 193.  The dollar amount on that for this year, $4,118,497.  Total funds from last year, $29,300,000 or so.  And now this year, it's $32,488,000.  Can we go back a page on the presentation to have a question about that?  Thank you.  Forward one.  Probably another one.  I don't know.  Are you controlling that?  I am.  Oh, okay.  To the part worth about dispatching.  Is that it?  Yeah, that's it.  Go ahead, Barbara.  Okay.  In terms of what's on that operating page, the $32 million, it represents all of the operations of the police department.  So there's an increase of about $2 million in total costs for salaries and benefits.  That includes about a $500,000 increase, $600,000 increase.  So that's a significant increase from this year's council adopted because we got the SRO grant that added the three police officers.  And then we also have a slight increase in material supplies, which the chief talked about, and then slight increases in the other places.  And then our allocations went up by about a million dollars.  That is specific to the information systems radio allocations that are primarily for safety.  And then also allocations in general have gone up due to just extra costs from our internal service funds.  So those are the kind of the gamut of things that went into that amount there.  Thanks for the breakdown.  Sure.  And just to clear up the acronyms for anyone watching and on the edge of their seat, SRO.  Oh, sorry.  School resource officer.  School resource officer grant.  Sorry.  Yeah.  Does anyone have more questions?  No.  I just wanted to see.  So I heard rumblings at the county that this would have some impact to them.  Would it?  The dispatch being broken out?  This plan before you?  No.  I would refer to the fire chief, but I don't.  This is a PSAP center.  I have it on hearsay only.  This is a city of Chico function that we're discussing here today and the communication center for the city of Chico.  Yeah.  And that's why I didn't understand how it would have any impact or ramifications on the county.  And then where are we planning on putting the fire center?  Call center.  Yeah.  I'll let chief talk about that.  We're looking at that DC and a small training room and the adjacent office.  Okay.  That's something we could outfit.  And are the costs for outfitting it in there as well?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  One of the things that we can do is you got to understand from that fire dispatching, they need a radio and they need high connectivity, essentially a laptop because they have software that walks them through these calls.  So they don't need all the other things that we have.  But because we're reducing that 33% still 911s, the way that we design that dispatch center right now is every console has a radio console.  We won't need all seven.  So we're going to work with the fire department and providing some equipment to get him up and running.  Okay.  And as far as dispatch center.  Okay.  Thanks.  Thanks.  All right.  So I think we'll take a break in between our next.  I should make a note too.  If you want to speak on the budget presentations, we will follow it with closed session.  After that, we will have a, the budget session will go to five o'clock at the regular council meeting.  We'll start at six o'clock.  Whereas we will start a regular agenda for the council and then have a business forum for public.  Hearings, et cetera, on that agenda.  Council will take a short break and we'll return after that.  All right.  Let's wait for the rest of the team.  Maybe.  Okay.  Should we just tell them?  Okay.  Sure.  I'm trying not to eat on Mike.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay. [inaudible]  in  in  in  in  in  in  in  in  in  in  in  in  in  in  in  in  in  in  in  in  in  in  in  in  in  All right, coming back from recess.  Mr. Veague, take it away.  All right, thank you.  Good afternoon, Mayor, Vice Mayor, Council.  As you know, I'm Brendan Veague.  I'm the Community Development Director,  and I have the honor and responsibility of overseeing the city's planning,  building, housing, code enforcement, and GIS divisions.  So while CDE's responsibilities touch on all of Council's goals,  I believe that the three primary goals fall under housing, economic development,  as well as a desirable place to live.  In order to support these goals,  the Community Development Department has identified a number of its own strategic goals,  including to expeditiously process development applications  in accordance with local, state, and federal regulations,  to ensure the city's general plan and land use regulations  are consistent with quickly evolving state, housing, and land use legislation,  to plan and administer affordable housing programs and funding,  to provide up-to-date GIS data and information to all city departments,  as well as the community,  to ensure residential and non-residential construction  is consistent with California's complex building codes,  as well as maintain and improve the quality of the community  through enforcement of local and state rules and regulations.  How do we achieve those goals?  We do so by ensuring that the general plan, the Chico Municipal Code,  and the Climate Action Plan are up-to-date and consistent with state law,  that new development meets or exceeds the goals of the community  as set forth in those planning documents,  and that new construction improvements and existing state structures  conform to the requirements of the state building code,  and finally, that the city is maximizing grant and funding opportunities  to develop and retain affordable housing.  So I'm going to go through each division, hopefully in a quick, expedited manner.  I'll start with the Planning Division.  It's primarily funded by the Private Development Fund  with support from the General Fund,  as well as some special revenue funds.  I just want to highlight quickly that over 200,000 of the city,  or planning's 954,000 general fund request,  although this says 961, my apologies,  is support as a pass-through to the Butte County Association of Governments.  It's a fee or a requirement of us,  and it doesn't go towards our operations.  The total budget request for planning is approximately $2,345,000,  with personnel costs representing $962,000,  and there are seven positions.  What do you get for your general fund investment?  We utilize it to be directly available to the community every day,  but there are also council priorities.  There are new state mandates,  as well as the need for regional collaboration.  Add to that that even three years later,  I still consider us in post-campfire mode,  and the need for coordination and planning with local, state, and federal partners  regarding housing and economic development remain top priorities.  So at its core, the Planning Division,  seeks to implement the general plan,  and to apply the city's development standards to propose projects  that ultimately help the city meet its jobs and housing needs.  In addition, we serve the City Council.  Planning also staffs the Planning Commission,  the Architectural Review and Historic Preservation Board,  the Map Advisory Committee, the Zoning Administrator,  as well as the Climate Action Commission.  As you can imagine, this requires significant coordination,  including agenda management, applicant communication,  engagement of all city departments,  board and commission communication,  public notice,  community engagement,  and ultimately providing an open and transparent decision-making process.  Development activity continues at an extremely high pace,  and we expect more of the same in the upcoming year.  The demand for both single-family and multi-family housing is strong,  and one of the city's first special planning areas,  the Valley's Edge project,  will be before the City Council and Planning Commission here later this summer.  Valley's Edge could provide for well over 10 years of residential and non-residential development demand.  The Planning Division also received an application earlier this year for a second special planning area,  that's Barber Yard.  The project proposes approximately 1,250 residential units,  as well as 180,000 square feet of commercial and office uses.  The environmental review for that project will also begin later this year.  To long-range planning,  activities also at an all-time high,  as the Division continues to promote the free accessory dwelling unit building plans,  implement the Council-approved Climate Action Plan,  coordinate with Re-Education, and the City Council,  and the City Council will also be able to implement the recently approved Island Annexation Plan  to consolidate the City's boundaries and provide efficient delivery of City services,  and to utilize funding from the State to pursue a series of Municipal Code  and General Plan amendments to streamline housing production.  The Housing Division.  The Housing Division is solely funded by non-general fund sources,  including federal housing and urban development funds,  the Affordable Housing Fund,  as well as fees that are collected.  The total operating budget for housing is approximately  $470,000.  Personnel costs represent $392,000.  There are three positions in the Division.  Affordable housing is the primary focus of the Housing Division.  The City receives funds from the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development, or HUD,  and staff coordinates with affordable housing developers to implement the goals identified in the City's housing element,  as well as the approved HUD consolidated plan.  Many new resources have been made available through the State and Federal government,  to address the growing housing shortage,  as well as impacts of the Camp Fire and the COVID-19 pandemic.  There have already been two rounds of disaster tax credits made available  for permanent affordable multifamily development in Butte County.  The City facilitated funding, and in some cases provided land,  for the 101-unit Creekside project across from Marsh,  the 160 North Creek crossings at Merriam Park project,  as well as the 59-unit 1297 Park project located at the previous Jesus Center.  Each of these projects has broken ground,  and is moving forward quickly.  Other projects using disaster credits have also received significant City support,  as they navigate the State's bureaucratic requirements.  Honestly, it's been an all hands-on effort by multiple departments,  supporting all of those projects.  In addition, due to the Camp Fire,  over $32 million in CBBG disaster relief funds have also been made available to the City,  again for multifamily affordable projects.  I want to highlight that the Chico was the first  to make a decision to make a decision on the project.  The City has already made a decision on the project,  and has already identified three additional projects for funding,  representing an additional 183 units.  In addition, Butte County received $61 million in funds,  and under their program,  they are proceeding with three projects in the Chico urban area for another 216 units.  If all the projects that I've referenced get built over the next several years,  a total of 1,393 new units will be made available.  This shows me affordable housing can get built in Chico  when funding is made available by the State and Federal government.  Also, the State-mandated housing element update will be before you very soon.  This extremely complex and involved planning document will build on recent successes  and provide an analysis of Chico's housing needs at all income levels,  and also strategies to address those needs.  The City's GIS division is funded by a number of enterprise funds with some minor general plans,  including the  General Fund Support.  The total budget for GIS is $330,000,  and the personnel costs are $246,000,  and there are two positions.  GIS supports every City department,  whether it's staff answering questions from the public,  field crews maintaining City facilities and infrastructure,  or updating 9-11 dispatch information to support police and fire.  GIS also provides critical information to the Chico Unified School District,  Cal Water, PG&E, Census 2020, and others to support their planning efforts.  GIS accomplishments for last year,  as well as what they plan to do for the next year,  continue to be the same.  That's to work with internal and external customers  to improve the input of accurate data  and enhance the usability of the system,  as well as to work with our key partner,  and that's the GIC Center over at Chico State.  Can I ask a quick question?  When personnel cost is on here, does that include salary and benefits and everything?  It's everything.  Okay, just to make sure.  I assumed so, but I didn't know.  Building.  The building division is also funded,  oh, I'm sorry, the building division is also busy,  but it's entirely funded by private development fund.  Total budget is $2,262,000,  with personnel costs representing approximately $1,672,000,  and they have 15 positions.  So while there may be 15 positions,  I have to highlight at this point that there are several positions that remain unfilled.  To be honest,  the last six months,  my biggest challenge has been trying to fill those vacant positions.  Even the outside consultants that we use to augment our staffing model  are unable to fill these positions for plans reviewers and inspectors.  So that will continue to be a challenge here in the next coming months,  hopefully months.  Given the importance of the building department  to economic development and housing production,  again, I'm hopeful they'll be fully staffed shortly.  Ultimately, the building division is responsible for performing architectural and structural plan checks,  scheduling and performing building inspections,  and regulating the construction and renovation of all residential and commercial buildings  throughout the city to ensure they meet the myriad California requirements.  From one emergency to the next,  the building continues to see steady growth in both residential and commercial development,  and seeks to utilize new technology to keep up with the growing demand.  In 2021, the calendar year,  there were 156 single-family residential units completed,  379 multi-family,  and 27 accessory dwelling units,  totaling 563 new residential units.  As of early April of this year,  1,033 multi-family units were under construction,  and an additional 569 were in plan review in the building division.  For single-family and duplexes,  there were 225 units under construction,  as well as 96 in plan review.  And for ADUs, again an uptick,  54 units under construction,  and 36 in plan review.  The message I'm trying to say is there's a lot going on,  and that's just residential.  Staff continues to learn how to better harness the power  of the new online permitting system, TrackIt,  which provides real-time project tracking for our customers,  as well as field personnel,  and also streamlines inspections.  And further, the building is nearing completion of a multi-year effort  to digitize and archive decades' worth of old, hard files  that will make critical information more readily available to the community,  and expedite response times to the growing number of public records requests.  The Code Enforcement Division is primarily funded by the General Fund,  and there's five positions.  The budget request is $671,000,  with personnel costs representing $602,000.  As you all know, Code Enforcement plays a very important role  in maintaining and improving the community's well-being  by responding to resident concerns  and addressing complaints before they fester into larger problems.  I'd like to share some impressive stats from last year.  In 2021, there were approximately 1,500 Code cases open.  95% of those cases were closed based on voluntary compliance.  And so that incredible volume of cases  was done by four Code Enforcement officers,  and doesn't acknowledge, again, the major programs they do  with the drop and dash and the wheat pavement program.  Further, in 2021, significant energy went into addressing  downtown blight issues, a Council priority.  Work remains, of course, but sometimes just a simple nudge  with Council support can make a real difference.  Moving forward in 2022, Code Enforcement will play an active role  in the Police Department Public Works role or efforts  in thinning up the city's creeks and greenways under the Settlement Agreement.  And then finally, Code Enforcement is also collaborating closely  with the City Attorney's Office on several long-standing open Code cases.  So as I mentioned, my primary goal at this point is to fill positions  Council's already allocated funding for in the Building Division.  With regard to new staffing requests for the upcoming fiscal year,  they're very minimal.  One, we're looking at a reclassification of an existing position  to a full-time permanent in-house plans examiner  to support quicker turnaround times on smaller plans,  like ADUs, porch covers, room additions, and single-family homes.  This position will be funded under the existing Private Development Enterprise Fund.  And then also there's a request for an hourly housing special assignment professional  to implement an anticipated grant for expanded sewer connections  in disadvantaged communities.  That position would only be paid for by the grant if it was awarded.  So that concludes my presentation.  So if you have any questions.  All right, any questions?  Just one, Brendan.  The amount of building going on in Chico right now, unprecedented?  Yeah, in my tenure for sure.  So I'm just curious because I'm up here every two weeks  and I get all these people come in and say,  build more, build more, build more, which is A, not something we do,  and B, have they not driven around town?  Because it seems like there's something going up everywhere.  And you're doing that short staffed?  Correct. I think what you're hearing.  Just take the credit for it.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Mr. Gofferson, you're next.  With the shortest presentation, right?  Oh, no, I just said that.  I knew.  Sorry.  We're going to time you.  Go ahead.  Thanks, Mr. Veague.  So yes, thank you for the opportunity to speak to you tonight, council.  You'll hear our presentation.  Really, this budget for 22-23 is really about staffing for us.  This is a fantastic budget, and I really thank council for the opportunity  and for hopefully recommending and approving this budget.  It means a lot of staffing for us, and it's positioning us finally in a sense  that we will be able to deliver the service that we want  and we feel that the Chico citizenry deserves.  So we're very excited about that.  So our strategic goals.  So I guess what I should also say, so this presentation,  also kind of is consolidated as an update to our staffing plan.  I know council member Topeka Tandon requested that several months ago,  and so we thought as we move towards the budget session,  since really this budget for me is mainly about staffing,  it would be a good opportunity to kind of kill two birds with one stone,  if you will, and not only present the budget,  but also give an update to our staffing plan that council last heard in 2017.  So really, there's a lot of slides here.  I'm going to go through them rather quickly, and I will keep it as short as I can.  So sorry.  Just strategic goals, pretty self-explanatory.  The first one, of course, is most important, really,  to enhance our infrastructure and recreation facilities to be world class,  inviting public spaces.  Our mission is to maintain safe, reliable, modern infrastructure  and services for the greater Chico community.  And again, you can see that number of positions,  that current position is what's included in this budget.  So it's adding nine, which is substantial for us.  We're at 82 currently, and with the approval of this budget, it will be 91.  And as you can see, we're at a state of emergency.  We have 10 divisions.  So we're quite diverse.  We kind of laugh about the jack of all trades, master of none,  but we like to continue that quote,  as jack of all trades is always better than a...  Jack of all trades, master of none is always better than master of one.  Okay, I got it correct.  So that was off the cuff.  But we commonly joke about that quote, that we're very diverse.  At one moment, we could have a meeting discussing fleet services,  right-of-way maintenance, and then we have to jump over to a meeting with Street Trees or airport.  So we're very diverse, and we handle a lot each day, and there's never a dull moment.  And then, of course, we have a new division, which is our outreach and engagement and encampment cleanup division.  So we're excited about that as well.  So 10 different divisions.  And I'm going to...  Kind of the format of this is just going to give a quick slide on what each division does.  And then we've done a self-assessment of each core function that each division does.  And if we feel we're providing that service adequately or inadequately,  some of you that were on calendar,  Council in 2017, remember that format.  And then we're going to give kind of a quick table on what each...  How many staffing or what our staffing levels are in each division.  So that's kind of a quick overview of our Division 620, which is street cleaning.  Here's kind of our core functions.  Street sweeping, leaf collection, weed abatement, and illegal dumping.  We feel that we provide those services adequately.  What we don't provide adequately is storm drain maintenance.  We have almost as much storm drain underground infrastructure.  We do sewer and not a dedicated crew to maintain that.  And it's really creating a lot of problems for us.  However, this budget gives us a storm drain maintenance crew.  So as you can see in column 2022,  we currently have three senior maintenance workers and two maintenance workers in that division.  We're adding a storm drain maintenance crew,  which is comprised of one senior maintenance worker and one maintenance worker.  So I'm very excited to add that crew to our inventory.  We also have this other column to the right here,  which is our optimum staffing levels.  That's in a perfect world, how many staff would we have in each division.  So I think that's an important point to know.  In this division, all we would add is kind of a new position we've looked at creating moving forward  just to really solve some span of control issues is a foreman position.  We don't currently have that now, and we're fine just implementing the storm drain crew.  So very excited about this budget proposal in adding a storm drain maintenance crew to our inventory.  Fleet services.  It's an internal service division.  We manage 381 vehicles and pieces of equipment.  We're responsible for many different functions within fleet.  Currently, we have a mechanic to fleet ratio of 1 to 76,  which is very difficult to manage and very difficult to support our fleet.  Industry standard is one mechanic to every 40 vehicles,  and that's assuming like vehicles.  And again, we have an extremely diverse fleet.  You know, one moment a mechanic could be working in a parks department lawnmower.  The next moment he has an airport credit.  He's going to have to go to a crash rescue and install.  So very diverse fleet.  And so we try to look at that industry standard.  And of course, we're way off of it, but we're excited to show you that.  And here's some of the levels of service that, you know, per our self-assessment,  we feel that we're a little bit inadequate in planned maintenance,  which causes us some untimely repairs.  But as far as regulatory compliance, unplanned repairs, and public safety support,  we feel we're providing those services quite adequately.  And then inadequately on our specialty repairs and installs,  such as, you know, public safety features and patrol cars and fire apparatus and so on and so forth.  However, as we work towards accomplishing that industry standard ratio,  we're adding a mechanic.  So I'm very excited about that.  Thank you very much.  We're adding equipment mechanic two in this proposed budget.  We're going to go to five to six.  Our optimum staffing level that would get us a little more closer to that industry standard  would add another mechanic two and then maybe a mechanic one.  And then kind of reclass potentially a mechanic to an equipment mechanic,  a senior mechanic, excuse me.  And that's optimum.  You know, that's further down the line as we continue to grow and add more vehicles and pieces of equipment.  And just as far as the job classification,  equipment mechanic one is equivalent to like an apprentice,  and equipment mechanic two is a journey level mechanic.  A couple of notable capital projects for this budget.  We have a very aggressive patrol car replacement system.  We're replacing a lot of the equipment that we had in the schedule.  So we're replacing six new patrol units this fiscal year.  And Fire Chief Steve Stander stole a little bit of my thunder that we are replacing three fire apparatus here.  It's great.  It's fantastic news.  Those are the actual apparatus we are replacing.  So one on either side are two type one apparatus that are over 25 years old.  It's very difficult to support those.  They've well expired their useful life.  Like I said, typically their life cycle is about 20 years.  And we've been squeezing a year, a year, just due to funding purposes each year.  So we're finally able to replace those two 1997s.  We're excited about that.  And then the ladder truck is over 20 years old.  It's 22 years old, I believe to be exact.  Same problem.  We're having a very difficult time finding parts to maintain that piece of apparatus.  In fact, in many instances, we're making parts ourselves.  And that's just not sustainable.  So we're excited to replace that ladder truck as well this coming fiscal year.  Facilities division.  We manage and maintain over 400,000 square feet.  And 33 different municipal buildings.  And really our objectives are to make existing infrastructure last.  And of course to continue to modernize and automate operating systems.  We're struggling a little bit in this division just because the age of our facilities.  Most of our facilities were built in either the 70s or the 90s.  So they've really started to expire their useful life.  And require a significant amount of updates, upgrades, and remodels.  And so you can see really the bottom section there that service provided is remodeled.  And while we feel we're providing that somewhat inadequately.  And then that kind of cascades down to the others.  Creates a lot more unplanned repairs.  We have significant HVAC maintenance requirements that we have to maintain.  However, it's not part of this budget because it was included in a mid-year supplemental.  But as you can see in 2022, we added two senior maintenance worker positions.  And the primary focus and function for those two positions was to support the pallet shelter.  And so we're putting those two positions under our facilities.  Division with the intent their first priority is to support the pallet shelter.  But once maintenance levels are maintained and things are operating okay at the pallet shelter.  They could jump over to facilities and help and assist in other city facilities.  So it's going to kind of really strengthen our bandwidth if you will in the facilities division.  So that's already included.  But we're excited about those two added positions that will be consistent through 22 and 23.  Some notable capital projects.  PD remodel continues.  We're replacing a generator at the police department.  Finally, we're accomplishing phase three in fire station one.  And some pretty significant asset management software that we're going to place citywide that will really help us strategically manage all city facilities.  I want to touch base on the PG&E SST program too.  Which is these projects are managed by our facilities division.  This last year we replaced almost 40 HVAC units and refurbished 20.  We replaced the HVAC.  We replaced our aeration tank diffusers as you see the picture on the right at the wastewater treatment plant.  And really a significant component is we're bringing online new blowers at the wastewater treatment plant.  A major function of the biological system in our wastewater plant is of course the aeration.  And so it's a major, major energy consumer or consumption scenario with those blowers.  So replacing them with up to date modern blowers is really going to save us a lot of money.  And so we're finalizing phase two of the SST program.  You can see this is our courtyard.  Our municipal services center.  And we've added solar on those two parking structures and even a little bit on the north side.  And then this is an overview of the solar field at our wastewater plant where we're able to replace the panels and almost gain a whole megawatt of solar.  That's substantial.  It avoids 22 million in utility costs over the next 20 years.  Eliminates about 7 million in near term general costs.  It's a great way to address the federal fund and sewer fund capital replacement needs.  It's improving performance.  It hedges against rising utility costs and time of use rates that we're all faced even at home in our residential connections.  And really with these phase two projects we're becoming, we're going to offset 80% over kilowatt usage once these are complete in the next couple of weeks.  And that's substantial.  When I first started in this role we were spending about 1.7 million on electricity costs with the investor owned utility.  700,000 of that was for street lights.  Street lights are a flat rate.  So that's when we immediately identified that project to retro with LEDs.  That saved about 300,000 a year on our street light cost.  So that brought that down to 400,000.  That leaves about a million dollars in annual electrical costs in all other facilities.  A big portion of that is at the wastewater treatment plant.  Finalizing these phase two projects will offset that consumption rate by 80%.  That's significant.  We've already identified and we're going to implement some phase three projects.  We're going to implement some phase three projects.  We'll achieve net neutrality.  That's been a goal of ours for many years and we're very excited to deploy that.  You'll hear more about that in the coming months as we put those projects together.  But I do want to note a big component of this is the real estate that we're using at our wastewater treatment plant.  I know there's been some discussions lately about the potential purchase of the sewer utility.  Our privatizing that in a certain way.  And I want to note that and caution the council that we would lose this capability of offsetting our electrical loads in other locations.  That was recently reported.  confirmed with PG through the RSBCT program that we're using that allows us to generate  electricity at one location and offset usage at another location. That program is only available  to government entities. So we would lose that capability if we lost the real estate out there.  So just wanted to give you a heads up on that. Our next division is our street maintenance division  650, which of course, you know, fills potholes, cracks steel streets, maintains the basic right  of way and does all those general functions. You know, we do struggle in that division as well with  general street maintenance. Our alley and shoulder grading programs are robust, but it takes, you  know, six to 12 months to really get to a service request just because of the backlog. We only do  our alley grading in about several months in the year. So the backlog continues to kind of  burden us. And then bike path maintenance is inadequate. Sidewalk maintenance is something  we feel we do a good job at.  We've done some recent programs. We'll talk about in a new slide. But you don't see any staffing  requests or additions to our street maintenance division of 650. We have a pavement management  plan. Their needs are identified. We'll continue to work that plan in conjunction with our friends  in engineering. And depending if, you know, new revenues of sales tax initiative or something  along those lines comes forth, then we'll be able to augment these services and really improve our  roadway condition index.  Part of 650 is our traffic safety folks as well that maintain traffic signals, signs, streetlights,  and pavement markings. And then, of course, 660 is our parking meter maintenance and collection  folks. Our parking meter maintenance and collection folks are performing all of their functions pretty  adequately. There's only two folks in that division. And as we have expanded our managed parking,  however, technology has come into play. We've been able to do a lot of work on that. We've been able to  in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in  We're very reactive, but we're not proactive on those functions.  Same with sign maintenance and pavement markings.  But we're doing everything we can, and we'll continue to optimize those and make improvements in those divisions.  There's no requests or additions in this 22-23 budget, but you can see the optimum staffing levels on the right-hand side.  If in a perfect world and funding was not an issue, we would add a couple of maintenance workers and a maintenance aide hourly to augment those services or those core functions that we feel we're not performing adequately.  Some of the highlights that we continue to do is work on our sign retroreflectivity project to replace old signs and meet federal highway administration standards.  We focus on our regulatory and warning signs, of course, and improve community safety for all.  Both vehicles.  And pedestrians and bicyclists.  Our street maintenance, again, program will continue.  We have a pavement management plan.  We're going to continue to work that plan.  There's roadway projects that are identified for the next few years, five years, 10 years, 15 years.  And depending on funding levels, that will determine what that plan looks like and what pavement condition index that we wish to achieve.  So sidewalk repair.  I do want to touch on this because it's been such a successful project.  If you remember in 2017-18, we brought a sidewalk repair program project to council.  Chico is like many municipalities in the state of California that follows the California government code that puts the responsibility of sidewalk maintenance on the adjacent property owner.  However, in Chico, and like other agencies, when sidewalks are lifted due to a city tree, where does the liability land?  Well, we had all kinds of those instances, and it was very tough to manage through those.  So.  We identified a big need, and council, thank you, at the time, funded $150,000 a year sidewalk repair project.  And then we've had some one-time funding and doubled that.  And council, you've continued to keep that funding at a higher level at $300,000 a year, and that's what this budget also includes.  It's just been such a fantastic program and really has helped reduce our risk and liability in making citizens happy, too.  When there's a city tree that's causing a lift, we put it on a list.  We get it repaired in a timely fashion, and that's an example of what those repairs look like in those two pictures.  So thank you for continuing that sidewalk repair project.  Sewer collection system.  This is all the sewer lines that are underneath the streets that collect sewage and transport it down River Road to our wastewater treatment plant.  There's almost 300 miles of sewer pipe, 5,776 manholes, and 19 lift stations that we manage.  And this division is doing quite well.  It's fully staffed.  We're able to clean our existing sewer infrastructure once per year.  So those are those two vacuum trucks that circumvent the city and clean each line on an annual basis.  We inspect adequately and continue those higher service levels.  So there's no changes there.  The staffing level stays the same.  Our optimum staffing level is the same until we develop and grow and expand a little bit more.  And once development continues on the track that we're on now, eventually we'll have to add.  So in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in  lift station close to there so we actually manage 20 lift stations we  manage a very aggressive pretreatment program with our industrial and  commercial connections we have a California certified lab we manage our  state national national pollutant discharge elimination system permit that  gives us permission to discharge to land discharge in the ponds that we have but  more importantly the Sacramento River which is our main discharge and of  course locally managed operations have ensured very positive rates for the last  several decades but we do have some areas that we feel for our self  assessment that we're providing inadequate levels of service our  laboratory you know state requirements continue to increase so we have to do  much more testing and monitoring and so we need some assistance their operations  for our current flows are adequate although we have had a hard time  recruiting for operators  but we have a lot of work to do to make sure that we're providing adequate  service to the population and the population is getting the job done and  the amount of positions we have allocated is is is good and we're able  to manage the flows that we have instrumentation electrical and  industrial maintenance is is inadequate however this budget helps us out we are  adding a laboratory technician as you can see here for the 22-23 budget and  in a senior industrial mechanic so we're very excited to add those two positions  out of our wastewater treatment plant and it will  greatly help the service levels out there and you can see on the optimum staffing levels there's not  many changes these the optimum staffing levels we're very close to that depending on the amount  of wastewater that we treat on average we treat between six and seven million gallons a day of  wastewater as that grows or as that expands to what we're certified for at 12 million gallons  per day or even our build out at 15.4 those optimum staffing levels will expand as the amount  of wastewater we treat expands so just wanted to put that disclaimer there but for now we're very  close we're very close to an optimum staffing level i just want to kind of touch on some of  the exciting capital projects that that we accomplished this year we rehabilitated a  secondary clarifier floor that you can see there that was quite the project we've done a lot of  programmable  logistic controls upgrades and retrofits our wastewater plant is extremely automated and  that's how we're able to get by with a low staffing level and still maintain an optimum  staffing level it's that's very automated and we did a handful of anaerobic digester cleaning  projects this last year now parks our parks and landscape division it's kind of the misnomer too  a lot of folks think that you know we only manage bidwell park and it's 35 hundred acres  we don't we also manage another you know up to 6 500 acres that includes our greenways and you know  with big chico creek little chico creek lindo channel uh comanche creek there's quite a bit  of greenway space that traverses through city limits that we also manage we take care of the  vegetation management plan trail and road work park reservations volunteer program excuse me and  also support the bidwell park and playground commission we struggle a little bit in the parks  division just because of the  of our staffing levels and a handful of our core functions. Again, on our self-assessment,  we feel like we're providing those services somewhat inadequately. And this is our public  plantings. This is our landscape division. I'm not going to talk too much on that because  we're looking at some internal options of this, mainly moving some of these responsibilities  around to potentially some different divisions to help. So I'm not adding any staffing on  our public plantings as we're continuing to work and optimize those internally. However,  this budget helps us out in the park division. We are adding a senior maintenance worker  for the 22-23 budget, and that's going to really be essential to help us maintain and  deliver the service levels that park goers really want and expect. Optimum staffing levels,  there's not many changes from here. I think optimally we would add landscape aid and maybe  a couple of maintenance workers to help manage our park zone. So we're very, very close,  and I'm very pleased with our staffing plan and the incremental increases as  budgeted.  So in the in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in  in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in  in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in  We have an over $2 million full caper acres rehabilitation project identified, recognizing that it's going to be difficult to get that type of funding to completely redo caper acres.  So we're taking one bite at a time.  We're taking one feature each year and redoing it.  And it's been a fruitful process.  So we continue to replace aging equipment, enhance the play experience in caper acres.  We're deploying our vegetation management plan.  And then kind of on a highlight, too, we received a $218,000 FEMA grant for Lindo Channel Defensible Space that will provide defensible space for homes and properties along Lindo Channel from Manzanita to Highway 99.  We're moving pretty quickly.  We're to the tree division.  So we're getting there.  Bear with me a little bit longer.  A few more slides.  We, you know, one thing that I'm an advocate for is good data.  We have to.  We have to have good information.  And we want to automate everything we possibly can.  And we used to think that we had about 40,000 city street trees that we managed.  We just completed a full assessment and inventory of each city street tree that we own and logged it in a programmable software set.  And we found that we have currently 32,814 city-owned street trees.  However, we have 9,426 vacant planting sites.  So over the course of time, you know, trees, they have a life cycle as well.  We've removed trees that pose a safety hazard.  We've replanted some, but we haven't replanted all.  So we do have some vacant planting sites.  And we still have some removals identified to take place.  So we're continuing to manage the tree inventory.  And we'll initiate replanting programs as we possibly can.  Also note, out of the thousands of calls for service that we receive each year in public works, operations, and maintenance, 30% of them are tree-related.  So the tree division is a big deal for us.  And we provide a handful of our core services adequately, but some of them we don't.  You know, formative pruning on young trees, safety pruning on mature trees, removal of dead trees and stumps, and then line-of-sight traffic pruning.  We're doing all those functions.  We just don't feel that we're doing them adequately because we're in a triage mode.  We're taking the worst of the worst and attacking the major public safety and public health hazards that we can in that division.  However, help is on the way.  Thanks to you, Council.  And thanks to you, Council.  In this budget, we are adding a couple maintenance workers.  It shows that we're adding two.  One is being reclassed from maintenance aid.  We're jumping, reclassing it up to a maintenance worker.  It's slightly, you know, a little bit more responsibility.  We'll be able to put those skills to use in the field.  And then adding another maintenance worker, too.  So we're adding two maintenance workers here, which is just fantastic.  I really appreciate the help and look forward to deploying those resources this coming fiscal year.  Optimum staffing levels are over here.  You know, we would add, you know, three more.  We would add three more maintenance workers and another senior.  In the tree division, the ideal crew, I like to have a couple of crews that maneuver around.  One in a crew makeup is one senior maintenance worker and two maintenance workers.  So that kind of gives you a snapshot of the crew.  But in the tree division, we kind of have a hybrid approach.  We're very sensitive to resources and we're stewards of taxpayer dollars, of course,  and we want to stretch those resources as far as we can.  So we perform.  Some of those core functions in-house, but we also contract out a lot of services in the tree division to outside contractors.  So we kind of have a good balance of, again, core functions that we perform in-house and then contract out a lot of those functions, too.  And we'll continue to deploy that service model moving forward, relying on our outside private sector contractor partners.  Just a couple of project highlights.  You know, we're deploying a walnut tree maintenance project.  We do have a pretty aggressive pruning cycle in the park.  In Bidwell Park, just due to the risk and liability there with a lot of those older valley oaks.  We're going to really focus on high grid pruning and our high priority transportation corridors.  And then we received a second CAL FIRE grant of half a million dollars to fund, plant and maintain a thousand trees citywide.  So that's fantastic.  And we'll kind of reduce that number of planting sites that we talked about a few slides earlier.  Almost there.  Airport.  Revenue generation.  Including landfills.  Leases and grants has been really a priority for us the last few years.  And as you heard Ms. Martin say earlier, this is the first year that the general fund is not identified to subsidize the airport fund.  So we're extremely proud of that.  And that's a tribute to you, Council, and the Airport Commission for assisting us and looking at every possible way we can to bolster the airport operation.  From improving and updating our lease policy to promoting general aviation out there.  Everything we possibly can.  And we're very happy with the performance of the airport thus far.  From a staffing perspective, it remains the same.  We have a half-time airport intern hourly from the University that really helps us with some administrative functions.  Optimally, maybe that position becomes full-time several years down the road.  But for right now, we're working quite well with just the intern only.  I do want to kind of highlight a few things.  Kind of focus on some of the capital project highlights.  Of course, we finished our apron and taxiway construction projects.  The next one is the runway.  We've identified the runway will start to fail in 2026.  So we have a project identified to rehabilitate the runway.  The FAA, as you recall a couple years ago, had some one-time funding and asked if we could deliver that project in a short amount of time.  We said yes.  Council approved a local match.  And then we waited and waited and waited.  The FAA had other plans.  But we've continued to let them know that this is a very important project to us.  We want to maintain the stability and safety of our runway.  They acknowledged that and have asked us to perform a study this year which will really determine the pavement condition.  And if we have to completely reconstruct the runway or if we could ground out or grind down several inches and just replace it with a top layer of asphalt and an overlay to deliver that project.  So we look forward to accomplishing that.  And having some direction in the following year to either reconstruct the full runway or do some major repairs as defined.  Our air service development efforts are continuing.  And our airport manager, Tom Barr, has really made this a priority.  We've had two large community stakeholder meetings.  One in the day in November and then one in evening meeting in March.  We are moving from those larger meetings to really a focused approach.  We're really focusing on different sectors of the community, different business sectors, whether it's education, agriculture, or even manufacturing.  And we're really asking for support to our revenue guarantee program.  We have that incentive package identified and we're partnering with North Valley Community Foundation to manage the fund which will really help us gain compliance and show that there's a third party, not the city, managing that fund.  And we hope there's a lot of participation in the community towards our air service development.  And I want to let you know, too, Tom is attending the 2022 Jumpstart Air Service Development Conference.  Thankfully, it's in Reno this year, so he doesn't have to travel far.  We've sent letters to airlines in preparation for the conference.  He's received responses from Frontier, AHA, United, Southwest, Breeze, and Spirit Airlines with some interest, expressed interest in Chico.  He has scheduled meetings with Allegiant and AHA.  And then he recently heard from Breeze and Frontier that they want to meet at the conference as well.  So those efforts are ongoing and will continue.  I ask that the community and the council be patient.  That type of market development or business development doesn't happen overnight.  But we're continuing to work hard towards that and hopefully we achieve some success in the near future.  All right.  Last but not least, our new division, the Encampment Cleanup and Outreach and Engagement crew.  And we're very excited to have this crew with, you know, the previously approved Encampment Cleanup.  And now the Outreach and Engagement.  Those folks will work hand in hand in not only, you know, assessing in conjunction with Target, performing enforcement in our public spaces,  but also cleaning those public spaces up and returning them to their original condition once the encampment is moved.  The staffing levels will remain the same.  I think they're optimum at this point, so there's no changes there.  We're struggling a little bit now with, you know, lower staffing levels considering the amount of encampments.  And people in those encampments right now.  But I know it's, you know, as we go through this process and work through our enforcement plan, we will maneuver to, you know, a point at some point through the settlement agreement where we're proactive.  And I think this is an optimum staffing level once we reach to that point.  I don't want to staff heavier now than have to lay people off in a couple of months.  So I think the current staffing level will work well and work well into the future.  A couple of the division highlights.  We've, you know, we've set aside some of the things that we've done.  We've set aside some additional funding for encampment cleanups once those larger areas are enforced.  We also have a, we've come across a lot of hazmat level cleanups, especially after the recent fires in Lindo Channel and some of the others.  Once a fire takes place, it's a hazmat level cleanup.  So we've had to contract a lot of those functions out.  Then we've set aside some funds to make sure we have the resources to do so.  And then we've set aside some funds, too, for some park and greenway restoration that will need to take place after encampments are cleaned.  Just a couple of before and after pictures.  This is an average day for those folks.  The picture on the left in the column is Cohasset Lane off Cohasset, before and after.  And then on the right is just right outside the chambers, outside the plaza perimeter on Broadway, before and after.  And then we built a pallet shelter this year as one of the accomplishments, too.  I just wanted to highlight and note.  177 units that have the capability of housing 354 individuals.  And then we built a new building.  So in 2018 we're in 2018 in 2018 in 2018 in 2018 in 2018 in 2018 in 2018 in 2018 in 2018 in 2018 in 2018 in 2018 in 2018 in 2018 in 2018 in 2018 in 2018 in 2018 in 2018 in 2018 in 2018 in 2018 in 2018 in 2018 in 2018 in 2018 in 2018 in 2018 in 2018 in 2018 in 2018 in 2018 in 2018 in 2018 in 2018 in 2018 in 2018 in 2018 in 2018 in 2018 in 2018 in 2018 in 2018 in 2018 in 2018 in 2018 in 2018 in 2018 in 2018 in 2018 in 2018 in 2018 in 2018 in 2018 in 2018 in 2018 in 2018 in 2018 in 2018 in 2018 in 2018 in 2018 in 2018 in 2018 in 2018 in 2018 in 2018 in 2018 in 2018 in 2018 in 2018 in 2018 in 2018 in 2018 in 2018 in 2018 in 2018 in 2018 in 2018 in 2018 in 2018 in 2018 in 2018 in 2018 in 2018 in 2018 in 2018 in 2018 in 2018 in 2018 in 2018 in 2018 in 2018 in 2018 in 2018 in 2018 in 2018 in 2018 in 2018 in 2018 in 2018 in 2018 in 2018 in 2018 in 2018 in 2018 in 2018 in 2018  two senior maintenance workers, a maintenance worker, equipment mechanic,  two, a laboratory technician, and I see that our industrial mechanic  out at the plant was not included in this, so that's where the other one is.  We're losing a park services coordinator and reclassifying the position to an  assistant park manager, and that's really to have direct oversight over that encampment  cleanup crew and outreach and engagement. So that's bringing the park services  coordinator classification was here. We're reclassifying it to just bring it  up a little bit to give that supervisory experience and compensation  to really have a narrowed focus on that division. And then part  of our reclassification plan that I believe you'll hear about later tonight,  with these 10 divisions, I believe I'm one of the only  departments without a deputy director, so we're going to reclass our public works manager  to a deputy position to really help with some span of control issues  that we obviously have, and we're really looking forward to that because the current org chart is  just really not sustainable long term.  And we're excited to be able to backfill that public works manager position.  So it's my honor to represent the men  and women of public works operations and maintenance, and thank you for the opportunity to present  tonight, and I thank you for the resources through this budget process.  I feel like we're finally in a position that we're going to, again,  deliver the service level that the community wants  and expects, and we're excited to do that.  All right. Any questions?  Thank you.  I don't have a question for Eric, but this might actually be Barbara, but is there a way that we can  code everything that we're spending  for the pallet shelter? Because it seems like part of the positions  are over here and parts over here and parts over here. It would be great at the end of the year to be able to look and know  everything that we've spent and have that, since it's all new.  Yeah, that's actually why we developed the new division, the 688 division.  Everything will be coded in there.  We can pull that information and see exactly what we're spending on all of that.  Great. Thank you.  Yeah.  Thank you.  All right. Last one, not least.  Good afternoon. I was about ready to say good evening, but good afternoon.  Leanne Sutton, Public Works Engineering Director.  I'll try to be as brief as possible, because I know  everybody's ready to move on.  Okay. So in short, the Public Works Engineering Department, we build public infrastructure.  There's a lot of words on the slide, but I just wanted to sum it up to say we build public infrastructure.  And if we're doing a good job, we provide excellent customer service.  We support the rich heritage of Chico, and we help the Community Development Department manage orderly development process.  We build infrastructure that's safe, meets codes, and is sustainable.  And in that process of doing that, we are consistent and fair.  And then as a result, our infrastructure is integrated, efficient, reliable, and cost effective.  So those are a lot of goals that we try to achieve in engineering.  I think if we're providing excellent customer service, we have 90% of our goals achieved.  The funding sources that we use, we have a lot of funding sources that we use.  In engineering, our general fund, capital project funds, and special revenue funds.  Our total budget requested for next year is $6.8 million.  That's our operations budget.  Total personnel is $5 million, approximately.  Current, it says current number of positions, but actually that would be the number of positions for FY 22-23.  Assuming that this budget is approved, right now we have 32, and we're looking to go to 37.  For a variety of reasons, succession planning to keep up with the workload that's coming in, etc.  So there are several divisions in engineering, capital improvement project division, traffic engineering, utilities engineering, development engineering, and engineering support.  So I just wanted to touch on some successes for this year, things that we either started or completed.  And so, I'm going to start with the first one.  So the Cohasset Road widening, everybody who lives in Chico or drives around Chico knows that that's under construction.  We're widening and reconstructing the roadway from north of Sycamore to Bryan Avenue.  And that's going to include storm drain, landscaping, and bike path.  The construction started in 21-22, and we're looking to finish it late 2022.  State Route 99 Eaton Road, the roundabout that is operating now.  We're going to be building a new roundabout.  It's a five-lane roundabout.  We substantially have that project complete.  We're finishing up the last items on that this summer.  Citywide systemic safety improvements, which includes traffic signal upgrades, pedestrians, crosswalks with rapid flashing beacons, and improved pavement markings at 55 locations.  That was started this year, and we're looking to complete that this summer.  Local roadway safety plan, that is a requirement of being eligible, continuing to be eligible for H-CIP grants.  So we finished that.  Emergency vehicle preemption system, phase one, we were able to get nine intersections along Esplanade hooked up to that system.  And we are looking to complete further phases of that this coming year and the following year.  Park Avenue rehab, which Paul Hahn talked about earlier, which was from East 9th to East Park Avenue.  We did a paving overlay, striping, lighting, ADA curb ramps, and bike lanes.  And citywide benchmarks.  This has to do with our surveying system.  It got to the point, due to attrition and destruction of our surveying monuments over the years, that we only had 10 or 12 surveying benchmarks in the whole city.  And so my team has been working really hard on restoring our surveying system in the city.  So now we have 150 survey benchmarks that are set and elevated to old standards.  But the survey, the federal survey agency is getting ready to update that to new 2022 standards.  So we're going to be working on updating that.  So that's exciting because that was causing conflicts with development and engineering projects.  And that's causing change orders and having to go back and redesign things during construction.  So that's never good.  And then I want to now talk about our, a little bit of detail about several of the divisions and the position requests, the five position requests.  So as I mentioned, I have utilities engineering.  And some of our goals are to be working on the storm drain master plan, sanitary sewer master plan, and continue complying with the MS4 stormwater permit.  And so as part of that, we need an additional associate engineer to be working on regulatory projects at the plant and the upcoming pipeline replacement projects that are going to be needed as part of the work that's coming from the sewer rate study.  Traffic.  Our goals for this year are working on phase one of the city's parking plan, which is eliminating, I think it's a three-way road.  A thousand single meters in the downtown area and replacing those with 80 kiosks that are smart meters and increased signage.  We're working on that.  Annual sidewalk repair.  We're working with O&M to develop a plan, develop the condition and an overall plan identifying the funding gap for the city's sidewalk needs.  Expanding traffic operation center system.  So the preemption system got us one more step closer to a traffic operation center.  Where we can remotely monitor and control the city's traffic systems.  And in this year's budget, we requested funds to upgrade the traffic signal controllers to current technology where we can remote control the traffic signals.  As part of that team, I'm very short staffed on that team and I'm having a difficult time filling the senior traffic engineer that's been vacant for a while.  And so we had to shift.  We had to shift work up and down.  And as a part of that process, we realized we needed another assistant engineer to manage projects in that division.  Capital projects team.  Some of the goals for this year are working on our continuing to work on the active transportation plan, which allows us to go out and compete for grants.  And it gives us a plan for all modes of transportation.  Include walking, biking, etc.  We're looking to complete that this year.  Standardized construction inspection.  We have combined construction inspection into one team under the capital improvement project division.  And now all of our inspectors are trained to inspect development and CIP projects.  Enhanced public project outreach.  We want to work on developing some standard operating procedures and policies for project communication.  And as part of that team, I requested a senior civil engineer because we have a lot of we have an increased workload on construction inspection.  And we're also having to employ a lot of outside consultants.  A lot more than we would actually need to if we had an in-house position.  And this would help us save some money there.  And as well as interns.  And development engineering.  I didn't request any.  I didn't request any.  I'm just saying that we have a lot of personnel other than an intern for that division.  Some of the goals that we're working on is to standardize the development process.  We've been working on the website providing tools, standard operating procedures, and C calculators.  So that the process isn't so much a mystery.  And the costs.  Continue with building permit review.  Work towards completion of complete streets.  And that's it for today.  So in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking  and manage all the right-of-way transactions  that we have as part of capital projects  and handle all the easements and abandons  that we deal with through the building  or development process.  And with that, this is a list of all the CIP projects  or capital improvement projects that we're working on.  It's a lot.  I won't read them all off.  But I wanted to highlight some of the projects  that we're getting started on in FY 22-23.  And that is the Bruce Road reconstruction  where we're reconstructing and widening  the roadway from Skyway to State Route 32.  We're bringing the roadway from county up to city standards.  So it's going to include curb, gutter, sidewalk, median,  streetlights, sewer, storm drain,  and proper road structural sections  for city traffic loads.  And it's going to include a new bridge  over the Little Chico Creek  and Class 1 bike lanes.  ADA storm drain improvements  and dedicated left turn lanes.  We're looking to start construction in the fall  and end construction in 2024 on that project.  And then State Route 99 corridor,  Bikeway 99 Phase 5,  that is underway  and we're looking to start construction soon.  We just recently completed several right-of-way transactions  that were needed to install that bike.  Bikeway.  And that will be the last phase of the bikeway  and it will complete the bikeway  east along State Route 99 by the mall area.  And we're looking to start construction late 2022,  early 2023,  and end in 2024.  2022 road rehab,  which is Pine, Cypress, and Mulberry  from Eastwood to 20th Street.  We're going to be using  the FDR,  which is full depth reclamation  and overlay process  to reconstruct the roadway.  That does include bike lanes.  We're going to be starting construction  summer of 2022,  ending winter of 2022.  State Route 99 Southgate Interchange.  I include that slide just to let you know  that we're going to be starting the planning  of how we're going to phase that project out.  It's estimated to be an $85 million project  and it's unfunded at this point.  So,  we're trying to figure out how we're going to phase it  and market it for grants  so that we can get a shovel ready project  moving forward that would be competitive for grants.  And this one is,  let's see,  connecting Midway and Skyway near Sunset Moulding.  So,  let's see,  the final project here is P18 Sewer Trunk Line.  That is a $16.5 million project.  It is a $16.5 million project.  It's not fully funded either,  but we're starting the PA and ED  or Project Approval and Environmental Document phase  so that we can get a shovel ready project  that we can compete for grants.  And that concludes my engineering presentation.  Any questions?  Questions?  Thank you.  Thank you. !  Okay, before we wrap up,  I just wanted to say thank you to all the departments.  Thank you to City Council for your time this afternoon.  Putting this together takes a lot of work  from all the departments and input from many people  to get this all put together.  I want to say a special thanks to Amanda McGar  and Becky Fairbanks.  They are the core of our budget team.  And without them, none of this would be possible.  They keep things accurate, organized,  and they are the liaisons for all the other departments,  keeping things organized and put together.  I want to say thanks to our Administrative Services Department  and the city staff.  We lost a great leader, coworker, and friend this year in Scott Dell,  and our team has remained strong and focused  on the course that Scott set.  And with that, before we break and before we wrap up,  I want to share a little lesson in allocations.  So in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in we've never really come forward and talked allocations. This is, we're getting into accounting, we're talking more theory,  speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in  speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in  speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in  speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in  speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in  we don't really have a good understanding of.  So this is my take on them.  They're no fun.  No one likes them.  Few understand them, and therefore we tend to not talk about them.  This is the big, big part right here until tonight.  So with that, I'll turn it over to accounting manager Scott Dowell.  Well, we got maybe a little drum roll later.  We'll see about that.  Wow, what a setup.  How do I go on from there?  We got something special here.  Well, anyway, I'll get to that in a second.  But it's kind of interesting.  I was on vacation three weeks ago and took my family to Mount Rushmore.  43.  300 miles round trip.  Had a great time.  And we were sitting there in a diner in the middle of Wyoming, nowhere Wyoming.  And for some reason, I looked over and the waitress brought out a big piece of pie.  Oh, it looked great.  And then she brought out the whipped cream, put it all over it.  And all of a sudden I said in my mind, I go, that's allocations.  I'll explain that here in a moment.  I really will.  Believe it or not.  Yeah.  Well, I didn't verbalize it.  That was what was going on in my mind at the time.  But allocations are really kind of like a piece of pie.  Or actually, they're like the whole pie.  And so.  Do you like apple pie?  I do.  Excellent.  I even brought whipped cream tonight.  That's good.  You can go ahead and bring it out.  We will.  In just a moment.  We'll work that in.  Because I don't want to entice you and not allow you to have partake.  But sorry, audience.  And those of you who are on TV, I apologize.  But this is a fresh baked apple pie.  I like apple myself.  But anyway, I was thinking about that is, what are we talking about allocations?  We're talking about.  Stop touching the crust.  See the distractions in time?  There you go.  Good job.  Good job.  We can have it for next time.  Is that all it took right there?  That's awesome.  That's great.  All right.  Well, I'll make this short and to the point here.  But basically, as we're talking about that pie, there's a lot of things that go into  that pie.  And we can sit there and go, who gets the pie?  Now, if it was myself and I was really hungry, I could eat the whole pie.  Who's going to pay for the pie?  Me.  But if we decide to split it, and Vice Mayor Morgan and I decide to split that pie 50-50,  well, oh, see.  Yeah, there we go.  We would split that 50-50.  And then whatever the cost was, we could split it 50-50.  So that's the whole idea of allocations.  And this government set up with all the funky terms that we use in government accounting  and everything, allocations shouldn't really be scary because all we're doing is we're  taking.  We're accumulating costs.  And then we're saying, how are we going to get those back out to different departments?  So that's really kind of what we're talking about.  So see how the pie analogy came right there in the middle of nowhere in Wyoming there  with my family.  Oops.  Okay.  So.  And with that, thank you, everybody.  There's pie in the back for you guys.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I'll certainly be missed.  I'm a wonderful person that we have the pleasure of knowing.  So at this time, we're going to take public comment.  Okay.  We have two speakers.  First one is Ruth Sarnoff, and I believe the second one is Lorenzo Nunez.  And I apologize if I didn't read the card correctly.  So, Ruth.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  So in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in  in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in  in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in  in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in  in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in  over about four and a half years.  And I think it will tell you, if you look at it,  that you can pick any date you want,  but frozen internal infrastructure,  such as frozen infrastructure in the underground apartments  all through on the northeastern coast in New Jersey, Maryland,  all around there, you have this.  It's different.  If you remember your history,  the first boats landed on Plymouth Rock.  Anyway, a lot of the parts of the country are artificial constructions.  That means that in order to enlarge for larger and larger ships,  you had to excavate.  Ms. Sarna, we just need you to address the budget on this one.  I know this is a project.  I've heard all about plans to do all kinds of different things.  The Hyperion, which is on the California coast here,  the Hyperion hasn't been updated for a long, long time.  You can't put two, three times as much into something and expect it to work.  So when it is rainy, then the toilet water,  the water floats in the ocean there, and that's Huntington Beach.  And we know the story of Huntington Beach if we've been reading anything lately.  So I just want to say in closing  that I would be happy to share that with anybody interested in looking.  It's not hard.  You cannot count how many cities are frozen  or how many...  How many cities are in extreme heat,  like 80s, 90s, and 100s, or all the cold ones.  And based on it, you will notice how colorful they are.  They're colorful because there's always been extreme weather  and it's become more and more extreme.  And now there's no moving back.  You don't clean up something that's underground  and who's...  The infrastructure is gone.  Thank you.  So Lorenzo Nunez, and we did receive a card from Todd Kimmelschuh.  All right.  Let's see.  I don't see Lorenzo in here.  Yeah.  OK. Go ahead, Todd.  I just wanted to take this opportunity to thank the council for allocating the funds,  the money that they're giving to the city,  and the city council for the funds to run the Pallet Shelter  and other services that are needed for the new homeless shelter.  I really appreciate the partnership that we have come together to form  in order to take on this monumental task.  And just so you know that the county is here for you,  maybe not financially, but we are here for the services that will be provided  at the Pallet Shelter. And I thank you.  I think I've heard from different sources,  I just had a presentation from the Jesus Center,  that it's going very well there, I think, 71 occupants now.  I just talked to Chief Madden,  no reported incidents there at this point in time.  I talked to Jennifer McCarthy,  there are services that are being provided by the county,  and many are taking part in that.  So, together,  I think,  I believe that we will make this happen.  I know it's a financial burden for the city,  and we will do what we can to help you in that regard.  But it's something that we hadn't counted on,  something we didn't really want to spend money on,  but it's in our laps.  So I appreciate what you have done,  and just so you know that you have a partner in Butte County.  Thank you.  All right.  Was that our last speaker?  All right.  All right.  So item B, resolution adopting the 22-23 proposed budget.  Interim center manager, do you want to say anything about this?  No, I think there's been enough said.  I do want to thank staff, and I just reiterate,  there's a lot of positive things you have heard this afternoon.  About how this city is moving forward with the resources that we have.  And thank the council, thank the staff for all their hard work.  And with that, I'd recommend that you approve the 22-23 proposed budget for the city,  as well as the successor agency to the Chico Redeveloped Nations.  All right.  Mr. Morgan, you have something?  Yeah, a couple things.  So this is my 10th time going through this.  The first time I was here, we were in the middle of concession bargaining,  cuts to all departments, massive layoffs.  We had a finance staff.  That was, I wrote not being truthful to council, but they were lying.  But none of them are here anymore.  And so, for a good reason.  Just really quickly, I want to talk about my perception of the amazing leadership  that's gone on in spite of all the changes.  People have left for a variety of reasons, some of them very unfortunate.  Paul, thank you for coming on and getting us through this spot.  Matt, thank you for being the bridge to get Paul here.  Because it would have been really, really easy.  For the city to fall apart really, really quickly.  And I think it was closer than we thought it was.  Barbara, thank you for being as strong as you've been through all of those changes.  And I know you've been there from the beginning when Scott and Frank before him came  and started cleaning up all of the things in finance and all of the loopholes and all the things  that went on forever that got us into those $15 million structural deficits.  And now we're here.  And this is just such a better way of doing it.  And I know that nobody here has a better way of doing it.  And I know that nobody here has all the people that they want.  And nobody here has all the compensation that you want.  I know that nobody in Chico realizes how many different things Mr. Gustafson is actually  responsible for.  It's unbelievable.  And while we don't have the turnout we're going to have for marijuana or camping or any other,  the hue of the Children's Museum or any of those other things,  this is the most important thing we do.  And we are super proud of the staff and all the things you do for the city.  And I would love to see you again.  I wish there was a better way for us to express it and also for the executive team,  for you three keeping this going.  I also know that through some public and some private conversations  that Jen has been a big help to Paul and Matt when they came on the most turnover  and turmoil I've seen in six months and to come forward  with a budget that's this clean and that straightforward.  So that's my thank you and I will make the first motion to adopt the budget  for 22, 23.  I'll second that motion  and echo exactly what you said as well.  Council Member Morgan, great job staff.

And for the second year in a row,  a team from Chico High School has brought home  the first place trophy.  So the Golden Panthers team is comprised of the students,  and I want you guys to raise your hands  when I say your name, Devin Chin, Simon Phan,  Soren Granlund, Joy Sheen, and Pablo Rigoza.

Good.  Good. [inaudible]  All right, we also have an Arbor Day proclamation,  and we're acknowledging that April 29th is Arbor Day,  celebrating the 30th year of Chico being designated as a tree city.  So we will move on from there.  We have the consent agenda.  All matters on the consent agenda are considered routine and enacted by one motion.  Do we have any public comment on the consent agenda?  No.  No, okay.  All right, any council disqualifications or no votes?  All right, entertain a motion.  Move approval of consent.  Second.  A motion by Council Member Brown, a second by Vice Mayor Reynolds.  Madam Clerk.  Council Member Bennett.  Yes.  Council Member Brown.  Aye.  Council Member Morgan.  Yes.  Council Member O'Brien.  Yes.  Council Member Tandon.  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds.  Aye.  Mayor Coolidge.  Aye.  Carry 7-0.  All right, item three, business from the floor.  A member of the public may address the council at this time on any matter not already listed on the agenda  with comments being limited to three minutes or is determined by the mayor based on the number of speakers,  and we actually have a way of doing that, so we'll see how many speakers we have.  The council cannot take any action at this meeting on requests made under this section of the agenda,  unless we already did an enclosed session earlier.  So how many speakers?  We have 43.  43?  43.  We'll do one minute apiece.  One minute apiece?  Yeah.  Council's limited to 45 minutes for closed session business from the floor for our rules.  Again, if you have a sign, you have to stand in the back.  No applauding or booing any speaker.  We encourage all opinions, so we ask everybody to be respectful,  despite keeping silent for each individual speaker,  so not to make anyone feel as though their First Amendment right is drawn upon.  So, go ahead.  Okay, and then I would like to, for those of you who are the first time here,  please note that I'll call two names, and if you hear your name,  go ahead and move to the center aisle so that we can get through to the next speaker easily.  So our first speaker is Tom Van Overbeck, followed by Trevor Luce.  Good evening.  Mr. Mayor, may I address a question to the city attorney?  May I address a question to you?  Not that I do.  I've been able to respond to you while you're out.  Okay, well, then let me do this another way.  It is my understanding from the report of the city attorney  that the Humboldt and Bruce campsite location has been taken off the table.  Is that, I'm trying to save everybody some time here.  Is that correct?  Well, so we can do this.  I know, but we have rules that we have to adhere to.  Yeah.  So why don't you go ahead and finish your memo?  Well, so what I heard is that that was taken off the table.  I came here and a lot of our neighbors came here to ask the council to reconsider.  But if you've already done that, we can all go over to the tap house and drink beer.  Not you.  We can't.  So unless I'm, my hearing isn't what it used to be,  but what I'm understanding is that the council has reconsidered,  because of the proximity to the school, the location of that campsite,  and I am extremely...  I'm extremely grateful, and thank you very much.  I'm going to speak as long as I can get away with before the mayor gavels me.  Okay.  All the sites are being reconsidered.  Wait, wait.  Every single site that we've been given is close to some school.  This was a list of bad choices,  and I'm not going to go into how, why, whatever until this is all over.  But see, I'm getting gaveled.  Sorry, rules are rules.  I have to be quiet now.  Yeah.  But so far, I'm louder than his gavel.  Yeah.  It's not a very loud gavel.  But I do, for those of you here, if you decide to leave,  please listen to what comes out of this meeting,  because it's not as simple as it may sound.  Yeah.  I just, I'm just liking getting into gavel.  Council Member Morgan.  All right.  Next speaker.  Okay.  So Trevor Lease, followed by representatives from the Chico High School.  All right.  And I will say, if you want to forego your time, you just don't have to come up.  Well.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Did you call?  The Chico High School will be next after this speaker.  Okay.  Go ahead, Trevor.  Hi.  I'm Trevor Lease, and I'm a student at Marsh, and I live in the area.  I'm also in the anti-vape club at Marsh,  and I think putting a drug camp right by my school is not okay for several reasons.  Firstly, I have to ride my bike to school every day, just like many other kids.  And for us to ride our bike right past a drug camp would be very dangerous.  Secondly, a lot of Marsh kids go to 7-Eleven and Great Harvest before school on Wednesday.  And having homeless people there would make it a very dangerous environment.  Lastly, in school we are taught to not do drugs or vape.  And this homeless camp teaches us the opposite of that.  It teaches us that if we do drugs, we will get food, water, and shelter for free.  In closing, my sisters will be attending Marsh next year, and they shouldn't have to wait.  They shouldn't have to walk by a drug camp with needles on the ground.  You guys need to do the right thing and come up with another solution.  This isn't it.  Thank you for your time.  Thank you for your time.  Okay.  So next time we applause a speech, we're adjourning to recess for 10 minutes and then coming back.  So you cannot applaud for anybody.  You can't boo anybody.  You can't applaud for anybody.  I'm sorry.  It doesn't.  Because it limits the ability of people to speak freely at the meeting.  For example, if everybody who got booed stopped coming,  that limits their...  speaking.  So that's the way it's always been done.  That's the way we do it.  I'm sorry.  So our next speakers are from Chico High School and then followed by Marsh.  Marsh.  Marsh.  Marsh.  Marsh.  Marsh.  Marsh.  Marsh.  Marsh.  These students are from Chico High School, and they are members of the Clean Club that  says the kids leading everyone against nicotine.  The podium is actually in the microphone.  So you have to face this way.  Okay, so they are here to talk about the dangers of flavored vaping and hopefully have the  City Council review the idea of maybe banning the sales of flavored vapes in our community.  So they're going to provide just one fact each.  Okay, go ahead.  Okay, what it's like in a Chico High bathroom.  Banning flavored vapes would decrease youth use.  Anywhere from one to ten people vaping.  The smell of flavored vapes, it's like, yeah.  You can smell the flavored vapor.  This helps prove students use flavored vapes.  Flavorings for vapes are popular among a vast majority of youth.  The bad stuff that you can inhale from the vapes can actually put you at risk for health conditions,  such as cancer, lung and heart diseases, and difficulty breathing.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  So the vape industry is constantly targeting young audiences and the minorities.  And so teens are constantly getting targeted by those industries,  while the teens, they don't actually know.  And so...  Yeah.  Thank you.  So if representatives from Marsh Junior High can come forward,  and then if Chico Junior High can line up, please, behind them.  So if you guys are all doing this as a group, you've got just the one minute, unfortunately.  Right.  Okay.  I think they should ban flavored vapes from Chico, because one vape, if you vape one vape,  it's equal to vaping 400 cigarettes.  Another reason they should ban flavored vapes in Chico is because there's 400 milligrams  of nicotine in every vape, and it's super addictive and not good for you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  So Chico Junior High, followed by Fairview, if you can line up, please.  Thank you.  Timer.  Okay.  Hi.  My name is Tiana Bing, and I'm part of the Chico Junior High Clean Club.  We are presenting facts on what happens when we have flavored vapes.  We have a lot of vapes being sold in our community.  You tend to buy a vape specifically for their flavors.  Flavors attract you to buy vapes, which get them addicted to nicotine.  Flavors make different flavors similar to candy or food that will attract teens and  cover up the foul taste of chemicals.  The flavors are specifically targeted at the youth because flavoring like cotton candy  and bubble gum is more appealing to the youth.  And not to most adults.  The youth are more attracted to flavor vapes because it makes it seem like they are not  harmful.  E-cigarette companies have taken advantage of the internet, recreational venues, events,  and also retail environments.  By 2016, four out of five middle schoolers or 20 million students have seen at least  one e-cigarette commercial or advertising.  A higher level of social media is associated with a great chance of using e-cigarettes,  and there were positive addictions.  iTunes trending in iTunes trending in iTunes trending in iTunes trending in iTunes trending Okay, representatives or students from Fairview High School. Yeah, usually they would have to all share the time. All share the time. Okay, all right. Okay, you know what?  iTunes trending in iTunes trending in iTunes trending in iTunes trending in iTunes trending in  iTunes trending in iTunes trending in iTunes trending in iTunes trending in  Okay, so this is Fairview, followed by Teresa Miller.  Sorry about the limited time.  All right.  To start off, e-cigarette sales reduced with statewide restrictions,  and there was a 94.38% reduction in Massachusetts  compared to the control states.  Between August 2019 to February 2020,  states who didn't ban flavored vapes had mean sales decrease by 28.4%.  Following that, from February through December 2020,  mean sales increased by 50%.  And whenever I'm playing a sport with my friends from school  or something like that,  all of a sudden,  my friends that do vape,  they're not able to breathe.  They can't move around.  They're always coughing and always saying,  how are you able to do that?  Just don't vape.  Avoid that group of people and try to stay good to yourself  knowing it's not healthy.  Thank you.  Nicely done.  Next speaker is Teresa Miller with Kristi Napoli following her.  We have this.  I'll just leave them right here.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Hi, Teresa Miller.  As taxpayers and citizens of Chico,  my husband and I are strongly opposed  to the alternative homeless camping proposed for Chico.  We are residents of the Humboldt Road  and have personally been victims of wrongdoings  going on with the homeless population.  The homeless that are in and around our neighborhood  have created a huge health and safety problem  in our once lovely and quiet neighborhood.  We used to have deer, quail, fox, raccoons, and turkeys  that wandered around our neighborhood.  Now we have a new norm,  population of drug addicts, thieves, and mentally ill.  On any given night at 2 o'clock in the morning,  there is a highway of homeless people  walking up and down Humboldt Road.  We know darn well they're up to no good  because we have been victims.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I wake up in the morning to find trash, needles,  mailboxes open, and property broken into.  My husband and I have called the police so many times.  Thank you.  Okay.  Thank you.  Christine Napoli, followed by Amy McConnell.  Do I just start?  Yes, start.  Okay.  Hi, I'm Christine Napoli, and I'm a Chico native,  and the option of the homeless camping  allowed to set up near Hank Marsh,  does not seem to be a safe choice.  Not only do I have a child attending the school,  I'm a principal in Butte County.  The number one job of an administrator  is to keep students safe.  I have found backpacks with needles and crack pipes  and had to call the sheriff for people  under the influence near my campus,  and that is without a shelter next to us.  Even having extra dogs on campus  can be a safety issue for our students.  On Sunday at 20th Street, there were four overdoses  in which two people died.  A 22-year-old woman lost her life  due to overdosing on May 2nd when she was visited  at Wormington and Comanche Creek.  These type of traumatic events are not something  any of our children should have to see or experience,  let alone have close access to obtaining any of these drugs.  Not all homeless people are drug addicts or criminals,  and I hope they can get the support they need,  but putting our children at risk is unacceptable.  I do not have the solution to these issues,  but allowing a camp next to a school is not it.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Amy McConnell, followed by Erin Gosnell.  Hello.  My name is Amy McConnell.  We live on Paseo Campaneros.  We have two children and two dogs,  and we live right on Comanche Creek.  It runs through our yard.  We had zero notification.  The areas around us had zero notification.  The businesses had zero notification  that there was this proposal of any encampments  that would be put in our backyards.  The city of Chico has the most pallet shelters,  of anyone in the state of California. These are virtually empty, and the city also offers the  homeless the tourist shelter, the Jesus Center, and the Esplanade House. Within the settlement  agreement, it is clearly stated that the city may provide the ineligible homeless person at  a list of three public places. It does not state that the city must or shall provide.  This is not a requirement. That's fine. Thank you. Aaron Gosmel, followed by Paula Hare.  Hello. I, too, also live on Paseo Campaneros, and I don't have stats or anything, but what I do have  is the fear of my children going outside. I ask them to feed the dogs. It's usually in the dark  time. They want me to go watch them turn on the light. We have Comanche Creek already.  Now we're putting another thing on Ferris Street. Our neighborhood is right in the middle.  We're doubling whatever people these are, and they're the worst of the worst because they can't  get in the Pallet Shelter. So for the sake of my kids, my neighborhood kids, our properties that  have all been ransacked multiple times in the last couple years, I ask that you please reconsider  moving this place to Ferris Street. There's no place for it. It's a nice, natural beauty. It's a  good walk at night. You can see beavers, all that stuff.  Nobody's going to be walking there now. So it's kind of a bummer. We've already been impacted once.  Now we're going to get impacted twice. So please reconsider. Thank you.  Our next speaker is Paula Hare, followed by Craig Jinks.  Hi, it's Paula Hare, as you all know. I'm not going to complain and bitch at you like these  people are because these people are doing what I usually do, and I thank them for it.  What I am going to tell you is,  you always miss the point. You go into private sessions, and you come out with solutions  nobody, none of the citizens want. Now you had the airport thing. It was a good thing. You had  the RVs out there. You had the tents out there. You had the water. You had the buses going out  there, too, and from taking them, people where they needed to to get back on their feet.  Open it back up and put them there. Then they got a place to go, and you solve your RV problem,  and you solve the people that don't want to go into shelters problem for now,  and in the meantime, in the meantime in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in  place into whatever we got going on right now.  It's not good. I live over by Lindo Channel.  The homeless problem is just  we're way out of hand. So I'm going to forfeit my time and thank you.  Okay.  So Dan George followed by Austin Barron.  Hello, my name is Dan George. My family moved here in 74.  We've been roofing around here since then and we've seen a lot of changes  and the ball dropped on a lot of things. I remember the old guys talking about  if we don't do something about the roads to paradise, we're really going to have a bad fire.  If we don't do something about the homeless in Chico or Oroville, it's going to get out of hand.  Here we are. Here's my dilemma.  I'm probably the newest person to move on this block  Fair Street. I'm moving in right now. My wife's stipulation  to move from Petaluma  here again is the homeless. I don't want the homeless. The homeless scares me.  So tomorrow when this is all over and I go tell my wife, guess what?  The homeless lives less than one-tenth of a mile from us now.  Thank you all. Appreciate it.  Austin Barron followed by James McDaniel.  Good evening, council.  I had a big nice speech prepared for you all, but it sounds like we're deciding to reconsider.  So I would like to...  Thank you for reconsidering before we all get up on our high horse here  and talk about how horrible a camp would be right next to Mars Junior High  where there's 11 and 12 and 13-year-olds going to school.  So, you know, I'd just like to say I think that, you know,  if we did a camp out by the airport, you know, I think we did it before  and we tried to get away with it. You know, if we improved that  on that concept and put this ancillary camp out by the airport  where there's no schools and there's no kids to be harmed,  that might be a good concept. We might want to think about that.  So thank you for the time and thank you for serving.  James McDaniel followed by Randy Waring.  Hello. My name is James McDaniel.  I'm born and raised here in Chico and I'm here on behalf of my girlfriend, Audrey Parker,  that passed away on May 2nd, a day after her 22nd birthday.  My concern is that the city of Chico Council has not come together,  to solve and fix the homeless encampments in Chico,  or just see it as our new reality.  My hope is that the city of Chico Council can come together to solve,  fix the homeless encampments like Comanche Creek,  and to help spread more awareness so that unfortunate events  like my dear Audrey Parker's passing don't continue to happen within our community.  I fear the longer the homeless stay within our community,  the more as we, a community, are exposed to violence, illegal camping,  and the more we are exposed to violence, illegal camping,  trespassing, dumping of trash, and the constant open drug use.  I don't want to continue to see or hear about any more unfortunate events  like my dear Audrey Parker passing to continue in our great community anymore.  Thank you all for your time.  Randy Waring followed by Sean Davison.  Thank you for reconsidering your solutions.  First of all, I applaud you for attempting solutions,  for trying to find a way to move the homeless out of the public space,  and also to give appropriate consideration.  However, I'm here to speak in opposition to the site next to Marsh High School,  or Marsh Junior High, because of the jeopardy that it puts the kids in  as they live there and have to travel past Marsh on their way to get any food.  So thank you for the work you're doing on this,  but let's keep trying and see if we can do a little better.  Thank you.  Sean Davison,  Katie Posey.  So,  I'm talking about Country Drive, Fair Street area.  Okay, so that's what my main concerns are, but all of them.  So, and I think I got a solution, which I would like for you guys to look at.  And number one, Fair Street is considered a wetlands area.  Apparently, the town has known this.  It's been a wetlands area for 20-some years.  So my other thing is for you to take into consideration is the property located as 2455 Carmichael Drive,  which is the bus barn area.  So that is city-owned property.  It makes sense to me.  Put them all there.  You take away the Marsh, you take away the Country Drive,  and you take away the north end of town.  Put them all there.  It's right across from the, whatever you call them, shelter things that you guys built up.  And apparently, there's some food.  There's some food there.  I don't know too much about it, but it's right across the street.  There's bus depots there.  I just want you to consider them.  Thank you.  Katie Posey followed by Mary.  Good evening, Council.  A resident asked me to check out an encampment.  It was 9th Street and Hazel Street.  There had been a fire there Saturday night, complete with explosions.  So one resident I spoke to yesterday said she was told the tents would be there for 3 to 5 minutes.  Yet a year later, they've increased and remained.  If you're able to go, you'll observe that it is overrun with what would appear to be trash,  and there is not one trash can in sight.  Be aware there's also an individual with a 15-inch knife.  Another resident said that people have shown up before sunrise to dump items.  One resident said they had contacted Waste Management, who said the city would take care of it.  Then they contacted the city and they said Waste Management would take care of it.  The residents have had items stolen from outside their homes and have had some trespassed on their property.  They need to know that their council members are aware of this.  They want to solve this problem and want to bring a solution.  We must work on restoring this relationship between the people of the City of Chico  and our elected officials in light of the impact of these encampments on those who live near them.  The people that are losing are both the ones in the encampments and the residents.  Thank you.  Mary followed by Marvin Root.  Good evening.  How can the City work with the County in collaboration with the City?  I'm very excited to identify a more suitable location for these designated areas.  I realize that options are limited, but people have legitimate concerns here.  People are concerned about environmental impacts of the current encampments  as well as the future ones.  What services will be present there?  What number will people call if they need to tell the City about the safety and environmental concerns that they're hearing and seeing?  I've heard from people who have been in the City for a long time.  I've heard from people in the City that when they call about a particular issue related to these encampments, no one responds.  Please provide a number for people to call so that they can at least let you know what's going on.  Thank you so much.  Thank you.  Marvin Root followed by Pamela Boger.  I'm Marvin Root and I've got a little more time on Fair Street than most everybody here.  Forty-five years in the same home.  So we've got the idea of what's happening on Comanche Creek, which is lucky right now, it's downstream.  So we know what's going to happen when they move, if you move into taking Fair Street and Country Drive, it flows down.  And we're going to be right in the path of that.  So I say, no, let's get them out of there.  Let's move them somewhere else.  There's no sidewalks there.  There's no lighting.  It's going to be tough and difficult for security, etc.  We've had people in our yards, trying to camp, using it for bathrooms.  And we're just going to fit up with it.  And we've done it for a few years.  We've worked with the city numerous times on numerous projects.  So we just like to see this one say, uh-uh, doesn't belong there.  Thank you.  Pamela Boger followed by Karen Hanson.  Hello.  I've been here for a long, long time.  And like many of the other people, I've been here for a long, long time.  I've watched Chico devolve into a place that no longer makes me feel happy.  And, um, you know, to get here, I've passed so many homeless camps and so many homeless people, which I have never had to do before.  And the thing is, I've never had a choice about that.  But we have a choice here tonight.  We have a choice to make a different decision.  And I'm grateful.  I'm grateful to you all for reconsidering and making Chico a safer place for all of us.  I truly appreciate you. Thank you.  Thank you. Karen Hansen, followed by Sherry Root.  Hi, good evening, everyone.  So my name is Karen Hansen, and I live in South Chico, right on Paseo Campaneros.  And it's a street that has creeks on one side and then pistachio orchards on the other.  So I'm concerned because if you put the proposed homeless encampment,  there's duck ponds that are called the retention ponds that are actually unusual and quite beautiful  with all kinds of benches so people can walk and enjoy.  That will be destroyed if you put the homeless next door.  It's wetlands, they're wild land, and it's really important that we just really pay attention to where we put this.  Also, like the last speaker, there are no lights, there's no sidewalks on Fair Street.  Many times we've found cars and RVs parked there, and when they leave after a couple of days or they're chased off,  they leave all their garbage behind, and that's disgusting, actually.  And the last thing is, is that the fire danger in this proposed area is a serious safety problem.  We live also between Comanche Creek, the Greenway, and we hear noises, we hear sirens, we hear gunshots.  I believe that's time.  Okay.  Your clock disappeared at like five seconds left.  Sorry.  Okay.  Well, anyway, if there's a fire there, it'll go right up the creek.  There's lots of heritage, 100 oak trees and everything else, and it would just devastate our whole neighborhood.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Okay.  So I can see it on my screen.  No, we can see it now.  Okay.  I want to thank you for reconsidering those three options.  I know it's a difficult choice for you.  I know it's a very difficult choice.  But I do hope that you will reconsider Fair Street.  There is no lighting.  The road is narrow.  You can't get emergency personnel very close in soon.  And it floods there.  So putting them there would be a danger to them as well.  So thank you for reconsidering.  Thank you.  Debra Ray Jarrett, followed by Pam Mays.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  My name is Debra Ray Jarrett, and I've lived in Chico my entire life.  And I just want to let you know that I object the location of the homeless resting site at Bruce and Humboldt to the proximity of Marsh Junior High.  Please reconsider this dangerous decision.  It's a public safety issue of the highest order.  Protecting Chico's children is most important.  I've raised all my children here.  And I don't know how.  I don't know how the legal part works.  But I do know that I go to cities all over California, beautiful cities that don't have the issue we have.  I've been here for a long time.  So I don't know how the legal part works.  But hopefully we can figure that out and find a place for them.  Thank you.  Pam Mays, followed by Kellyanne Seitz.  Good evening.  Thanks for your service and for helping and for reconsidering those three sites.  However, I'm very concerned about the decision to locate homeless campground near Marsh Junior High, particularly given the profile of the residents that will be approved to be there.  The safety of Chico's children must be everyone's number one priority.  Our kids walk or bike past that exact location to get to and from school every day.  Campers will continuously walk back and forth directly in front of Marsh Junior High to reach food and transportation services.  We will also be providing food and transportation services at Forest and Humboldt.  Additionally, the local Great Harvest Bread and 7-Eleven stores are there.  Our kids hang out before and after school.  Please reconsider this dangerous decision.  It is a public safety issue of the highest order protecting Chico's children.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Kellyanne Seitz, followed by Dori Franklin.  Hello.  I am here to protest the resting site at the corner of Humboldt Road and Bruce Road.  It's my understanding that the legal agreement that the city entered into prohibits you from screening residents of these resting sites for prior crimes or active warrants,  potentially allowing convicted sex offenders, violent felons, sufferers of untreated mental illnesses, and active substance abusers to reside within footsteps of a school.  This is knowingly putting kids' safety in jeopardy.  The site has no water or shade.  So it tends to make sense that they would want to stay in the area.  I want to rest in Bidwell Park.  The route most direct there would be down El Monte.  My 13-year-old and many other children use this route to commute to and from Marsh.  They'll be directly exposed to all of these people.  How many lockdowns can we expect to see at Marsh Junior High School?  How many people?  We've seen shootings at Comanche Creek and Tigert Ponds.  Will we have an active shooter situation at Marsh Junior High School?  I'm here to say that crimes against children will go up if you allow this site to happen.  And the City Council will knowingly have a participant in that.  Thank you.  Dori Franklin, followed by Nicole Creech.  Hello, everyone.  My name is Dori Franklin, and I'm up here today standing as a community member but also as a mother.  We live about a block and a half from the proposed Humboldt and Bruce Road site resting place.  And I am here asking that you must remove that as a possibility.  And at this point, I think all three of the proposed resting places are not a good idea.  I think they're not a good idea for the community or for the homeless people.  There has to be a better resolution.  Our children's hands and future...  Sorry, our children's future are in your hands.  And I'm asking as a mother and a concerned parent for the community that we make the right decisions for both the homeless people and for our children.  There has to be a win-win resolution.  And at this point, what we're seeing proposed I do not feel is the correct resolution.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Nicole Creech, followed by Sean McCreary.  Hi, everyone.  Hi, good evening.  In manufacturing, there's a policy where safety is concerned.  Zero incidents.  The same principle applies to anything regarding children.  The Humboldt-Bruce location for alternative homeless campsite introduces the possibility of one negative incident regarding the safety of children, which is one too many.  It is the responsibility of this council to protect the safety and well-being of the children of Chico.  Too many negative factors have the potential for harm where children are concerned.  You had the power to reconsider this decision, which I thank you very much for doing so.  Thank you for working on this issue for the town, and we look forward to your next steps.  Thank you.  Sean McCreary, followed by Carlton Lowen.  So, Sean McCreary.  Yes, ma'am.  Thank you.  Okay.  Carlton Lowen.  Followed by Christy Parker.  I apologize.  Okay.  Good evening.  Carlton Lowen, 40-year developer, broker here in town.  For years, we've worked on projects where it takes two or three years to get through EIR reports, planning.  We've worked on these 2020 vision programs.  Walked the town.  Try to make it pretty.  We go through planning.  We go through ARB.  And all of this criteria.  And you've had some criteria for when the cannabis companies came to town.  You had a punch list on certain criteria that's important.  So what I'm saying is we have new hotels expanding here in town.  We have new ones that have come.  We have a lot of bed tax dollars.  We have private developers that want to doll up old buildings.  We are a developer.  We're a developer in the wedge.  By our street.  We're trying to clean that up and spend money.  I asked the city council members to think about being good planners and the long-term vision that we all have been involved with.  Thanks very much.  Thank you.  Christy Parker followed.  I just slowed down my conversation with my wife tonight.  Christy Parker followed by Susan Smead.  Christy Parker.  Susan Smead.  Karen Williams.  Jessica Giannola.  Oh, she's coming.  Is that Karen Williams, I think?  Is that?  Yeah.  Followed by Jessica Giannola.  Esteemed council members, I'm so pleased to hear that you are reconsidering the  location of the home shelters.  I'm very sympathetic to the plight of trying to assist and offer help and services for the homeless and those that are mentally ill.  I would ask that you consider a site that's not next to a church, or excuse me, a school, not next to a neighborhood, and certainly not next to a wetlands.  I've been a resident of Chico for 30 years.  I've owned my home for 23.  It backs up against Comanche Creek.  We actually own two homes, and it kind of incaps the LifeTouch field.  And putting the shelter right there in Country Drive and Fair, I used to think that my home was an idyllic place on that waterway.  I was so proud to live there.  Now when I hear the name Comanche Creek, it's littered with the stories of drug abuse, of thefts, et cetera, et cetera.  And I would just ask that you consider to not put it certainly there, but not in a neighborhood either.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Jessica Giannola, followed by Brad Thurston.  Brad Smith.  Council, again, we're going to run into not here, not there, not anywhere with any account proposed.  That's just how it's going to be.  I'd say we need to look back on the council, and just like someone mentioned a while ago about planning, when it comes down to it, the buck stops with you guys.  We do not have any inclusionary zoning requirements in this city.  We do not have enough affordable housing to house the people in this city.  When we talk about safety, we need to consider that.  We need to consider the safety of all of our residents, including the ones that can't afford to pay the rent on the standard home, or buy a home that is going for the price it is going for now.  The bills like the Valley's Edge is not going to serve Chico.  That's going to serve people outside of Chico.  It's going to mean HOA, using water we don't have, and destroying roads that still haven't been fixed.  So the buck does stop with the city, and doing what you can to help ensure that affordable housing is built so that people are not living in encampments, not living in a city that's not going to be a place for them to live.  That's going to mean a state of desperation, and having other citizens scared of where the people are.  Thank you.  Brad Smith, followed by Julie Threatt.  Good evening, council members.  My name is Brad Smith, and I came here tonight to object to the homeless resting site near Marsh Junior.  I enjoy the parks on a near-daily basis, and I've engaged with many of the people experiencing homelessness in Chico.  Through my interactions with many of the people experiencing homelessness in Chico, I've been able to build a strong bond with them.  I've come to understand that two of the most common issues facing these people are drug addiction and mental illness.  While this does not make the homeless bad people, and there are certainly other issues facing those experiencing homelessness, this does make the close proximity to a middle school unsuitable as a resting site.  I would ask that the council continue to provide resources to address the underlying issues of addiction and mental illness.  I appreciate the difficulties.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you. Thank you, Julie Three, followed by Curtis Anderson. My gosh, there's so many people here. I'm Julie Three, District Six, advocate for the vaccine injured, which is why I'm always here, but District Six, I live up there, bad idea. There's a whole huge development up there. That's like your biggest development zone. Affordable housing, it's all being built up there, like over 1,400 units.  Thank you.  over 1,400 units. So it's all up there.  There's a hotel going in across the way at Bruce.  It's got all the seniors pissed off.  And you've got your third high school planned for that community too.  So back off District 6 would be my view.  Vaccine injuries.  Ever since HHS Secretary came in here  to town March 14th, he comes into town  specifically to Chico to talk to  the pediatricians about why  our parents are vaccine hesitant.  Got the pediatricians in a locked room. He blows  out of town. Next thing I know, I've got a vaccine clinic at the mall.  I've got one at the library last week.  Two more are planned this month.  June 21st, Sierra Nevada Brewery is opening up  their big room to a vaccine clinic.  That's wrong in so many ways. I've got the vaccine  injuries. I'm on Vaccine Safety Research Foundation  calls. I just did a  radio show in Jamaica. This stuff is  bad. It's starting to pour out.  Prosecutenow.com. Go pull down those filings.  Go email your  representatives. That's going to tell you  what exactly is wrong with this  crap.  Curtis Anderson,  followed by Rob Berry.  Hi, Curtis Anderson.  I'm here to express my concern about homeless  camps and people living in Lindo Channel.  I live on Riverbend Lane  and recently there was a fire at the intersection  of West Lindo and Riverbend  at 5 a.m. in a homeless camp.  The fire showered my neighbors with sparks  who were evacuees of the campfire  and needless to say, they were  very upset and very  concerned. What the video  didn't show was my doorbell camera on the  news. If you saw action news was  that a propane tank exploded  about five minutes after the fire started.  And I could hear it down at the end of  Riverbend on my doorbell camera.  This is just the latest example of the  hazards of having these homeless camps  in close proximity to our neighborhoods  and private homes. Other issues are the  lack of any type of collection of  garbage or waste facilities.  Please continue to take consistent and  constant legal action to help people and  to move these camps out of our neighborhoods.  And if it's going to take a long time for  the camps in Lindo Channel, I request the  city provide trash and bathroom  facilities. Thank you to the staff that  cleaned up the camp and thank you for all  of you for your hard work.  Rob Berry followed by Kim Nott.  I thought I was going to speak during the  closed session, but you guys have already had a closed session.  So I'm not here to talk about  what decision you made. I'm really  here to talk about how you made it and  how you've been making your decisions.  Ironically, had you considered  a resting site back in April  when it was suggested to you,  we might not be standing here debating  whether or not we should now identify  three resting sites  in addition to the six million dollars  we spent on a pallet shelter.  What I'm here to talk about is  the way that you are conducting your  governance function and the  fact that you are conducting and have been  conducting your business in closed session  and cutting this public out  of the process of their own government  and merely announcing your  decisions after the fact  and now putting people in the position to  have to come here and beg you to change  your decision as a de facto  edict from you.  You're violating  the letter of the law  with the Brown Act, but more importantly  you're violating the spirit of the  Brown Act, which is an open meeting law.  You should be conducting your business in public.  Thank you.  Alright.  Instead of recess, if we did it again, guys.  You know,  people have different opinions.  Again, please  do not applaud or boo anyone at the podium.  Thank you.  Kim Knott followed by Gina Bax.  Good evening.  Thank you for being here and listening  to all of us.  I just wanted to make one point that  may not  be really clear is that  you guys are, the Council is  under the  restrictions set down by this settlement  agreement.  I don't know that a lot of  people really know how this settlement  agreement came into being,  but there's a lot  of parts of it that make it  very difficult for you to function  to get the  camps in the right  places, etc., etc.  I don't know if there's a way  to do it, but I think  that maybe we should revisit  our legal strategy and  see if we can get out of this  situation where it appears  you have to put camps somewhere.  In some neighborhood,  somewhere, and someone's not  going to like it, nobody's going to like it.  I just think that maybe it's time  to go back to court and see if we can do better.  Thank you.  Thank you. Gina Bax followed by  Eric Root.  Hello.  I'm here on behalf of the Hispanic  population. Well, I prefer  a speech, but since things have  taken a different direction, all I want to say is  thank you for reconsidering the homeless  camp situation, and I'm asking  you to put our kids' best interest  first on every decision you make,  and also make the public  and residents of Chico  part of your decision making,  especially when it involves the safety  of our kids. Thank you.  Thank you. Eric Root  followed by Patrick Newman.  Good evening,  Council.  I was going to talk against  asking you to reconsider  the locations, which it sounds like you're open  to doing. One thing  I wanted to point out is that  in these  things, it keeps being referred to as a  homeless camp.  It's not a homeless camp. It's for the  people who are 290 registrants  or who are drug addicts  or who have mental illness.  That's not safe  or consistent with the school  or with the neighborhood.  That's pretty much my concern.  And Mr. Davidson had a  great idea, I thought, of moving  it to that city-owned property  where the school buses  and stuff are taken care of.  Thank you.  Patrick Newman followed  by Jeff Creed.  I had three minutes for tonight,  and I know you guys are as  disappointed as I am that I'm not going to be able to read this.  60 seconds.  What I hear in a lot of  this is, this is your rocket fuel.  This is what got you elected.  Needle species.  Lots of fear.  Lots of  hysteria in the community.  Very little understanding in any depth  of why we have so many homeless people in America  today. Very little understanding  of how to approach that in a reasonable way.  I think that this particular site  could very well be not  the right site, but that's not really the question.  The question is, why doesn't the city  step up and make what's happening  functional? Comanche Creek is  deliberately engineered  to fail. We know this because of  the way all the services have been  delivered there.  I'm out of time. Thank you.  Our final speaker is Jeff Creed.  So Rob mentioned April.  How about May 2018?  I stood right here, and I said  if you continue down this path,  this is where you will end.  Now all these people behind me, they don't  have the benefit of all the years I've spent  watching this council, arguing with  the chief about his whack-a-mole program  that led to this over years.  This has not been building  in a year, two years, three years.  This is almost a decade in the building.  Sat here for years listening to Sean  Morgan, be the single most  obstinate person when it comes to  taxes, but he won't explain how to run a city  without... Not personal in a tax place.  Say again? Not personal  in a tax place. It's not a personal tax. I have every  right to speak about him. You have no right to talk to...  I do have a right. Our rule is clear.  I have every right to speak to him, about him.  You are violating  Supreme Court ruling right now.  Okay, that's nice. I want my time back.  You'll get your time back.  But do not insult members of this council  or members of this community, or we will  not... we will recess.  Calling facts is not insulting.  I said he's been objectively...  The way you did it, you did. The way you did it,  it was.  If you can't understand that, I'm sorry.  It was. You can make  comments about our decisions.  You cannot make comments about people personally.  Alright? We are trying to  maintain decorum.  That's for everybody's benefit, including yours.  Go ahead and restart this time.  So for years, the council  members and former mayors  have pushed forth the idea  forcefully that you can run a city  on a budget for half the size of this  city. That you can do things you can't  do. That you can do things like wax  them all and that will work.  People behind me don't understand  what they're facing now.  The whole lawsuit is a direct reflection  of the councils  before you. People like  the mayor here who gets up at the city...  state of the city and tells  all these lies. He'll throw in a bit of  fact and he tells lies about it.  And, you know, just like  he said, this thing can be  renegotiated.  Said in front of a lot of people on camera.  So go renegotiate.  The problem is  most of these people, they're going to complain about their little  thing. They'll go away and you'll go back  to doing what you're doing. You guys  are running the city into the ground  330 hours.  It's not my problem. You all enjoy.  Jeff was our last speaker.  Alright. Thank you  very much. We will move on to public  hearings. Item 4.1.  Mr. Mayor, really quick.  Go ahead.  I do have a question. A couple  questions of staff.  Alright.  I'm just trying to decide how to ask them.  Because we don't make our decisions  in a bubble.  And I appreciate all the speakers  and I understand where everybody's coming from.  And I'm going to  I'll direct this question to the city attorney  about the, you will  put encampments in place or you may  put encampments in place. The question I got,  well, I'll just ask the question.  I'll just ask the question.  The difference between you will put  a certain amount, the settlement says three,  versus you may.  And my understanding is if we don't,  and we don't necessarily have to,  but then anybody that is deemed  ineligible for the pallet  shelter for whatever ridiculous reason  they may come up with, and I think they're all ridiculous,  can then go camp wherever  they want. That's  the point of the three sites is to help  the police chief,  the police department,  enforce, which is where we've been trying  to get. Is that not the case?  Thank you, Councilmember Morgan. That is the case.  The city has the  discretion about designating  the sites. The use  of the word may in the settlement agreement  is the common dictionary definition of that  word. So,  you don't have to, but to  touch upon one of the comments that you just made,  you, the city  could face this situation  based on input from the  enforcement arm of the city that  if you encounter a person  who is deemed ineligible for  the shelter site, you're  not able to enforce against that person  unless you tell them somewhere to go.  So, if you're enforcing a particular area  and you want to clear it out of  homeless tents and so forth,  or a person's tents,  and let's say the city plaza, for example,  and a person there is  deemed ineligible for the pallet shelter  site, that person can  not be enforced  against. So, the city has  the discretion to  determine where that person may go.  Okay, that  answered one question, which is  why we may  deem sites if we don't necessarily  have to. The second  part of that question is, is  there a better location, which we're going to have  this discussion in open session  later, can tell you  we'll just have a whole different group of people.  I'm not picking on you. It's going to be a different group of people.  I'm not picking on you. It's going to be a different group of people.  But we hear what you're saying.  My second question, Mr. City Attorney,  is because I've heard this a lot,  usually it's criticism of  you or the city manager or the police chief  or something. Go back to the  judge that has been so  flexible with the city  and willing to bend  our way and people like,  oh gosh, you guys just bent over.  You gave them everything.  It doesn't take a year of negotiations to give  somebody everything. That takes about a minute.  But in regards to Los Angeles,  when LAPD  and the Los Angeles City Council  pushed back on their judgment,  I want to get the law term right,  received a consent degree. What did that  mean for the city of Los Angeles?  Council Member Morgan,  I represented the  Los Angeles Police Department and the city of  Los Angeles at that time.  Based on the  pushback of the city  council and the chief of police at that  time on civil  rights activists  complaining about the conduct of the  police department, the more  well-known  situation involved the Rampart  scandal. So I represented  the department and the city at that time.  And when the city council did  not  come to the table and negotiate  with the civil rights activists  and plaintiffs who filed civil rights  lawsuits against the city,  the Department of Justice and the Federal  Court interceded  and the Department of Justice threatened  to file a lawsuit against the city of  Los Angeles and ultimately what  resulted from that lawsuit was a consent  decree. The consent decree in the  city of Los Angeles lasted approximately  12 years. I worked  under that consent decree representing  the Los Angeles Police Department.  So, if the city  of Chico were to push back against  the federal  judges in this case, that is  a potential scenario  that the city could face. If, of  the city has negotiated in good faith a relatively flexible document that can be revisited and  yet says we're going to dispense with this altogether, ignore it, and defy the order  that is signed by a federal judge, I believe that there's a very good chance that the city  could be going down that road of a consent decree.  Okay.  And then my next question is for Chief Madden.  In closed session a week or so ago, we discussed various different things about how many sites,  where they'd be.  You had some reasoning, Chief, as to why not one, why not two, why the three.  Can you share that with me?  Because I forget what you said.  It's just us talking.  Yeah.  Thank you.  You know, reading this settlement agreement, it's talking about three locations.  The issue is going to be is what we don't want to happen in enforcement is leave camps in that enforcement area  because we don't want to move them.  It's counterproductive.  Right now, just what we're seeing is what we've always seen since I've been the chief is we get into enforcement  and we get voluntary compliance when we get to the end.  And we're seeing that now.  You can look out the door and see that that's occurring.  So, you know, I know these are difficult decisions for you, council, trying to find these locations.  Some, you know, I don't agree with either.  But that's something that I appreciate that you're dealing with.  And I do appreciate the public being here and also your direction of having these public comments  and involvement in selecting these locations.  But I just have to say that as we move forward through here,  we're going to encounter people on our streets that aren't going to meet these shelter requirements  based on the settlement agreement.  And that's something that we're going to have to address because the whole settlement agreement  was direction to get back to enforcement and cleaning up our parks and waterways in the city of Chico.  So that leads me to another question, Chief.  No, I forgot what it was.  That was very good.  When we discussed this, I can't remember the question.  Oh, now I remember.  Sorry.  We asked yourself, we asked the public works director, Mr. Gustafson, and we asked everybody.  When we talk about these sites, and I think the public is correct.  Well, they're not correct, but they're imagining Comanche Creek at the site by Marsh  or they're imagining Comanche Creek at the site on Fair Street.  And we were told it's more likely to be what?  Oh, it's definitely going to be.  Wait, let me be transparent for a reason.  Because nobody up here would ever vote to do that.  And I know some of you know that.  Some of you clearly don't.  It's like, oh, they decided to move Comanche Creek next to Marsh Junior High.  It's like, I don't think I've done anything recently to make people think that I'm stupid.  They didn't already think that.  What was...  What did you tell?  What did you tell us in that meeting?  Well, I don't think the numbers are going to look like what probably our community is envisioning  of those people that don't meet those requirements.  And I say that because we're being very systematic, working with our outreach engagement team  and being very, very...  Tracking the data so that we're not getting people or allowing them to try to use...  Or say certain things that's going to get them to not go to this shelter site.  Okay?  And so we're working with all the different service providers and whatnot to make sure  that we're accurately assessing folks and getting them to the shelter site.  So I don't think that number is going to be very high.  But again, you're talking about moving these people who have these issues into area parts of the community.  Okay.  And...  And...  And that's...  That's...  That's where...  That's where the decisions for council are going to be difficult.  And they're difficult tonight.  And you can see the community here and the reasons why.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Mr. Ron, can I ask you a question?  Because you're going to know off the top of your head better than I am.  Of the nine proposed sites that fit all of the criteria, some of the criteria is access to transportation,  access to food, access...  Because one gentleman came up, which I thought was a phenomenal idea.  Let's reopen the airport.  Which is...  where we started this whole process before.  And why isn't that on the table?  I've had questions like,  why aren't you using the Kmart parking lot,  which we don't own?  What are some of those criteria?  Those criteria basically are,  we have to be within a half a mile  of a transportation line  so that they can move around.  And we have to have food very, very close by,  a half a mile to a mile for food.  So the airport site does not have food  within that kind of criteria.  And transportation would be difficult  unless we provided it,  which is what we were talking about  doing the last time.  So when you start looking at the number of sites  that the city has under its control,  which is very limited,  we just don't own land  that we're not utilizing very much.  So you look at those kinds of issues,  how many sites we have,  the need for transportation,  the need for proximity to food,  and it becomes very narrow.  And as you pointed out earlier,  within the city boundaries,  you're going to,  you're going to get into some real difficulties  in not finding a child care facility close by,  a school close by,  or some other sensitive use.  So this is a extremely difficult process  to find sites that is not going to  create some kind of issue with a school,  a community, a neighborhood.  We just don't have a site that's out  somewhere far away from communities or schools  that has access to food, water, shelter,  you know,  those kinds of issues.  So that's the task that's before the council  and before the community.  Except one, maybe.  You don't have to name it, but just one.  So Mr. City Attorney, I'm going to tee up here in a second.  Mr. Hahn, I appreciate what you said,  because it's not a hard task, it's an impossible task.  And I think when we come back  and discuss the other two possible sites  that may or may not be on the table now,  and the public goes, wow, this is harder than we thought,  and we'll probably move away from where we are.  One of the reasons, honestly, the March site was picked  because there is no shade and there is no water  and there is no anything else.  And somebody said, probably no one will go.  We're like, perfect.  They'll go to Portland or whatever it is.  But Mike was on.  Mr. City Attorney, could you just placate me  and read the closed session announcement again?  Or, Mr. City Clerk, somebody?  Clerk would be most appropriate.  All right.  Council direct on item 7.1, Warren case,  council directed staff to move forward only  with the Eaton-Cohasset site, and to agendize an open session,  the discussion of two additional sites at the June 7th meeting.  All right.  Thank you.  Vice Mayor Reynolds?  Well, thank you for taking all of my thunder  and leaving absolutely nothing left to question.  You did a great job.  I thank you, and the airport was told by the judge  that we cannot use that.  None of us are happy about having to make any of these decisions.  This is by far the hardest thing we have ever been through as a community.  And I just want to thank you all for coming tonight, for speaking,  for sharing your heart, and hopefully in two weeks, we can come back  and have an open conversation.  And you guys can all see everything that we've seen and help make the decision  and help me there and put your input in.  And I'm sorry that that wasn't able to happen last night.  You've been heard.  It's been reconsidered.  And we look forward to having the conversation out here in a couple weeks.  So thank you for your patience, and thank you for coming tonight.  All right.  So if I can do this in 90 seconds, I'm going to try.  So you guys know the history because I think some of you don't.  And we do because we've had to live through it.  So I was elected in 2020 for the idea of cleaning up a lot of the bad areas in the city of Chico  that were facing environmental damage and damage.  And, you know, just absolutely being destroyed.  So I was frustrated, like a lot of you were.  So and then we got here, and we started enforcing our laws, and we made them a little tougher,  and we went to work in the parks, and we charged the police department.  And Chief Madden, him and his guys and gals have just been through hell and back over  the last year and three months.  I mean, absolutely.  Just the same with public works.  I mean, just some good folks trying to clean up the town.  And, you know, we were frustrated.  And I think that's what we're doing.  We were frustrated.  And we were starting to make some progress.  And then we got sued.  Got sued by some local attorneys in town.  They believed that we were being too hard.  Some people here probably have that opinion.  I know they do.  And that's fine.  And we can disagree on that.  But, you know, a federal judge also disagreed with us and granted them an injunction because  that's what's happening in this district court of the United States.  And there's many districts.  And all four of them have different rulings on this particular issue.  So eventually, somebody's going to be rich enough to do that.  And we're going to have to take it to the Supreme Court.  But it's not going to be us.  And then, you know, we had the injunction.  And then we moved forward with a lawsuit.  And the judge said, nope, air support site doesn't work.  Sorry.  I'm not going to grant you that.  I'm going to make it a permanent injunction unless you move forward with some other solution.  So we're sitting on a pallet shelter.  We begged the county for $1.7 million to provide the pallets.  We used a bunch of COVID money, which we could use for it, so we wouldn't have that huge  of an impact on the city budget.  But we are going to have an impact on it moving forward.  And now we've got to have three sites, which no one's going to like, because I will tell  you, there's not a piece of land in the city of Chico that is open and available that isn't  around something.  And most of them are within a half mile of the school, because we have schools everywhere,  all over town.  So some of these sites were by other schools that we didn't choose.  And they're not here today.  And you are.  And I totally understand why you are.  So, you know, we're...  We're going to probably try to do the best we can.  I think we might look at some private property.  Hopefully we can figure it out.  But we will not be able to move anybody long-term out of these areas unless we move to this  particular way of moving forward.  So I don't like it all.  It's not pretty.  I know we're facing it.  You know, blame a federal judge if you want to blame anybody.  But we'll do the best we can.  I'm glad we reconsidered these sites.  And I do appreciate everybody showing up.  So does anyone else have anything further?  All right.  So we'll take a short recess, actually.  So, 10 minutes.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  So we're in one in one in one in one in one in one in one in one in one in one in one in one  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right.  Okay.  Item 4, public hearings.  Item 4.1, hearing to approve  2022 annual action plan  for the use of federal community grant  development funds, CDG...  CDBG funds.  I almost...  I wanted to show you up, and I didn't.  All right, Joe.  Okay.  How do I get out?  Okay.  This is a modified presentation tonight.  But it always looks different when you're up here  and not at your desk.  Okay.  All right.  Good evening, Mayor, Vice Mayor, and Council Members.  I'm Mary Jo.  I'm the City of Alonzo Housing Specialist with the City.  And I'm before you tonight...  Oh, this is actually the wrong PowerPoint.  How did that happen?  Just give me a minute.  Huh.  I think...  Well, I don't know what happened.  I apologize.  It does not...  It does not look like I have...  Here it is.  I didn't delete the last one.  Okay.  Here we go.  I'm before you tonight to present the final public hearing  on the 2022-2023 annual plan as required for use of federal  funds from the Department of Housing and Urban Development,  which is HUD.  I'm just going to skip through because we talk about the CDBG  and the home fund.  funds are used for. Following last month's public hearing, staff has made minimal changes to the  draft annual plan, and those are included in attachment B to the staff report. They're  actually shown as read and underlined in the plan. Since that staff report was printed and  agendized, HUD did release next year's program year allocations, and we were able to update  our budget amounts, which you have, which is included in this PowerPoint, and a copy was  given to you, and I'm just going to briefly go over what those look like. Additional funding  was allocated for the 1297 Park Avenue project due to unanticipated and increased construction  expenses. We adjusted the public services funding, which allows 15% of our allocation to go to that,  and then administration was also adjusted.  And  and  and ! Here is the draft, the draft numbers which were included, and then our final allocation  numbers, which if you move to approve the plan will be submitted to HUD. And then as far as  changes to the home program, additional funding was allocated to the Habitat Wisconsin project.  Again, the administration cap was updated to reflect the actual allocation,  and then in the annual plan document, staff updated the resale provisions of the home  loan program. That's in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in  including all of the proposed amendments  and authorize its submittal to HUD.  And I'd be happy to answer any questions  that you might have.  Question?  All right, I'm seeing none.  Thank you.  We'll open the public hearing, any speakers?  Yes, we have one, Ruth Sarnoff.  Okay, Ruth.  And this is on the Federal Community Development Block Grant  and Home Investment Partnership Grant Funds.  I believe this has to do also with the HUD.  There are, I think, two more weeks of HUD hearings.  And I think the public would like very much to know  when and where  those are and have a schedule.  I track it in the classified,  which is humongous and a hard way to do it.  And this is just a,  in my opinion, it's just like a small part of it.  And I think it would be,  it's certainly relative to issues around housing  because it's housing and urban development,  and I think it's certainly relative to issues around housing,  and I think it's certainly relative to issues around housing,  and it is where the pre-funding money is set aside.  So I think they are related items.  I noticed that in terms of the shelter situation,  it was in the 5, 10, 22 copy of the enterprise record.  It was in the 5, 10, 22 copy of the enterprise record.  So in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in  that being able to track something when it's in three different little pockets is very difficult.  And just to clarify, and I think you'll find this is true in all legal documents,  one squiggle is for 1862, two squiggles is where it kind of morphed into, what's the next one up?  Hang on a minute.  Oh, it's a 72, 1872, and then it morphed again, and it's into like 2000.  And a lot of housing is being, they're defaulting and collecting taxes on that right now,  and they're just sheets and sheets.  Nobody that's in the public is going to be able to follow that,  and I will be happy to prepare for the public record something for you if you want  that.  That describes that whole process.  I mean, when your document talks about prohibition and this and this, it highlights where you're at.  All right, thank you.  So one squiggle, two squiggle.  All right, thank you.  I'm just asking if I have a request for it, I will do it.  And this is, I will put this because this is what I spoke to a bit today.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Public record.  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right.  No more speakers, correct?  Correct.  All right.  Close public hearing.  Will the council?  Move approval.  It's a motion from Council Member Brown, a second from Council Member Morgan.  Madam Clerk?  Okay.  Council Member Bennett?  Yes.  Council Member Brown?  Aye.  Council Member Morgan?  Yes.  Council Member O'Brien?  Yes.  Council Member Tandon?  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds?  Aye.  Aye.  Mayor Coolidge?  Aye.  Carries 7-0.  Right.  Moving on to the regular agenda, Item 5, Item 5.1, Amendment of the City of Chico Budget  Appendix B1 and B3 to the Classification Study.  And I believe it's Jennifer McCarthy.  There she is.  Yes.  Ready to go.  Thank you.  Good evening, Mayor Coolidge, Vice Mayor Reynolds, members of the Council.  I'm Jennifer McCarthy, Deputy City Manager.  I'm here tonight on behalf of the Human Resources Department and to provide you information about the classification study that was provided by the third party council.  So in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking  All right. Let's go with questions. Any questions?  I have questions and probably a statement.  So I asked, I think it was me.  Yes.  Yeah.  This be tabled and brought back.  There was some consternation amongst us when we talked about it in closed session.  This was a closed session item, right?  Because all those different things.  And then there was some turmoil.  So I said, I'm not really sure that, and we didn't all agree with the classification study in closed session.  We're like, oh, we need some more information.  We need some more information.  Someone was going to come back.  I asked that Paul and Jen take a deep dive into it and make sure that this looks copacetic.  I actually think that happened when the police chief was the interim city manager.  Because I was just concerned, given all that was going on, that it was right.  I don't have any questions and I don't need the presentation.  I'm happy to see it.  If my colleagues want to.  All I needed was the assurance of you two that, yes, this falls in line with what it should be.  And yes, I have reviewed.  I've met with staff and gone over this in fine detail.  And I think it's basically, one, it's absolutely necessary.  We haven't done this review in years.  The classes or many cases weren't reflecting the jobs that people were doing.  But we looked at it.  The process was good.  The consultant is excellent at these things.  The unions have vetted it.  We went through all the proper procedures.  And I feel very comfortable in recommending that you approve this study.  All right.  Further questions?  I'll make a motion, though.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Yeah.  Yep, yep.  No?  We don't have any.  Go ahead.  No comment.  Go ahead.  So I will make a motion to both receive the classification study recommendations  and approve budget dependencies.  This is B1 and B3.  Second.  All right.  We have a motion from Councilmember O'Brien.  A second.  It's well from Councilmember Bennett.  Councilmember Bennett.  Yes.  Councilmember Brown.  Aye.  Councilmember Morgan.  Yes.  Councilmember O'Brien.  Yes.  Councilmember Tandon.  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds.  Aye.  Mayor Coolidge.  Aye.  Carries 7-0.  All right.  Item 5.2.  Items posted after the agenda.  None.  6.  Reports and communications.  Following reports and communications are provided for the Council's information.  No action can be taken on items under this section unless the Council agrees to include  it on subsequent agenda.  6.1.  City Manager's Report.  I have none.  All right.  Thank you.  Item 6.2.  Councilmember Quest.  Pertinent to APMP 1010.  Councilmember O'Brien verbally requests an item to be agendized at a future meeting after  stating what the item would be.  A majority of Council is needed in order for staff to agendize.  Councilmember members may also submit requests in writing.  Any iTunes requests in writing in the speaking in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in  towards services provided to homeless community.  I'm happy to make that motion.  If I may, Mayor Coolidge?  Yes.  I'd like to add a little bit of information.  I appreciate the comment, Council Member Tandon.  That is something that the Council should be aware of that staff was looking into,  not to the broad level that Council Member Tandon brought in, which is a great idea.  We have contacted North Valley Community Foundation to talk about charitable giving  because we, too, have heard from members of our community that are really interested in supporting this effort.  So if it is the will of the Council and it is something that you're interested in moving forward,  staff can look at this, talk with North Valley Community Foundation further,  and create a broad-based program that could help with charitable giving related to homeless services in our town.  Okay.  So if we agendize it, you could just bring that back as part of that?  Okay.  That's so moved.  Do we have a second?  I've made the motion.  I'll second that.  All right.  Madam Clerk?  Okay.  Council Member Bennett?  Yes.  Council Member Brown?  Aye.  Council Member Morgan?  Yes.  Council Member O'Brien?  Yes.  Council Member Tandon?  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds?  Aye.  Mayor Coolidge?  Aye.  Carry 7-0.  All right.  I believe we have another court request from Vice Mayor Reynolds.  Yeah.  I would like to agendize a conversation.  I would like to have a conversation at a future meeting about the possibility of placing a voter initiative on the November ballot  that would establish the elements of quality of life as safety, cleanliness, beauty, and economic vitality.  It would provide a means for citizens and businesses to hold the city accountable.  I have a small sample typed up that I will email to you tonight to forward to the rest of the council members,  but I'd like to have that as a conversation at a future meeting.  All right.  I want to make that a motion.  I'd love to make that a motion.  Okay.  Do we have a motion?  Do we have a second?  I'll second that.  All right.  We have a motion and a second.  Madam Clerk?  Council Member Bennett?  Yes.  Council Member Brown?  No.  Council Member Morgan?  Yes.  Council Member O'Brien?  Yes.  Council Member Tandon?  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds?  Aye.  Mayor Coolidge?  Aye.  Carry 6-1.  All right.  Anyone else?  All right.  Mayor in speaking.  Yes.  Nothing else?  Are we good?  Woo-woo.  There.  Woo.  Woo.  Woo.  Woo.  Woo.  Woo.  Woo.  Woo.  Woo.  Woo.  Woo.  Woo.  Woo.  Thank you.
