But practice up at chico eye center.  And I' m chief of staff elect over at endlow medical center.  Beginning my chief of staff beginning in January.  Thank you.  City council for allowing us to talk to you about some of what we' re doing.  I was told to lead off a little bit with the ask.  And then kind of tell you how we got to the ask.  So the ask is we would like to ask you to do a little bit of a survey.  And we would request your support in our building an interprofessional campus for healthcare studies here in chico.  And that would potentially include building a medical school here in chico.  To help provide care for the patients that we all care for in our town and in our surrounding community.  So let' s talk about how we got to this ask.  Because this seems pretty big.  Seems like rather daunting.  Something that we may not be able to achieve.  So let' s talk about what we' ve done so far.  I would have to take you back to the camp fire.  Back then I was president of the bukeland medical society.  And so we were dealing with the devastation of the camp fire.  And what it caused in terms of pain for our community.  There was a loss of a lot of physicians in addition to the lives that we lost.  And we identified at that point that we needed to work on helping with our access to care issues here in the community.  And we did.  And one of the ways that we did that was there were a lot of organizations that were trying to get grant funds that required an organization to have a 501 c 3 designation.  And there wasn' t anything like that.  So we created healthy rural california which was initially intended to be the foundation arm for the bukeland medical society.  And we were hoping to be an umbrella organization so that like minded organizations that maybe didn' t have that 501 c 3 designation.  We would be able to use us to apply for grants.  We could administer those grants for them and allow those funds to be able to get out into the community.  One of the things that we did early on was we had a summit over chico state looking at access to care issues.  And one of the biggest access to care issues we identified was in psychiatric and behavioral health.  One of the things that we looked at to try to fix that is in medicine the common knowledge that we had in our community that we had to try to fix that.  And one of the things that we found that was really important to us was that the common knowledge is that there' s only two ways to bring physicians to your community.  They' re either trained at your community or you' re within 50 miles of your spouse' parents.  And we can only control one of those things.  So we said well maybe we can actually try to get a psychiatry residency here in chico which if you had asked me five years ago if something was possible I would have told you it was crazy.  Well we succeeded.  We did it.  We did it despite the pandemic.  One is we had a partnership with the v.A.  Northern valley Indian health.  Butte county behavioral health.  And we actually got a cgm accreditation.  Our first cohort of residents just started just this last summer.  And those four residents currently are doing their inpatient rotations down in sacramento but beginning next year the four residents will be up here in chico learning how to provide psychiatric care to our community.  We did this working with a couple of other organizations.  And effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively  effectively  effectively  have completed a family medicine residency three years thereafter. All of this is to try to improve  our access to care, primary care, psychiatric care. But we also worked on things downstream.  We don' t just do things for graduate medical education. We also need to show our kids that  they can pursue careers in health care, whether that' s medicine, whether that' s nursing,  whether that' s physical therapy, respiratory therapy, it doesn' t matter.  And we' re starting in elementary schools. I myself have actually done some eye dissection  labs in elementary school at Shasta Elementary, showing some fifth graders how to dissect an eye  and the parts of the eye. We' re actually going out, we' ve created med ed clubs, and we' re going  out into high schools in Glen County, out in Willows. We' re going up into Shasta County,  out and about in Butte County, and we' re actually giving presentations,  and we' re actually giving presentations to high school students so they can see themselves  in medicine, because we need them to go get the training and then come back and then care  for us when we need it. We' ve also worked with Chico State to try to help develop their  pre-med programs so that we can allow their students who want to go to medical school  be successful in that endeavor. We have scholarships that we provide people who are interested  in going into medicine, hoping that they come back.  Dr.  K.  K.  K.  K.  K.  Dr.  Dr.  Dr.  Dr.  Dr. described to you how we've got post-graduate medical education and how we're trying to inspire people in elementary, high school, Chico State to pursue a career in medicine. The one part that's missing  to pursue a career in medicine the one part that'  s missing right in the middle of that is medical education and that requires a medical  school. We'  ve already demonstrated that we can work with a whole host of people that are involved in  this whether it' s assemblyman Gallagher' s office in trying to get some state funding  working with Doug LaMalfa' s office in pursuing federal routes of financing for this we'  ve worked with uc davis with toro university chico state university butte college all of  the various boards of education of the various schools around our area. What we are looking  to do now is partner with we look at an all of the above approach here. Whether that is  potentially and these schools are very interested a branch medical school campus from uc davis  or a branch medical school campus from uc davis or a branch medical school campus from  toronto or a regional medical school from toro university or even a stand alone medical  school which is possible we are interested in trying to pursue this. This requires land  requires a footprint and so now there' s talk of developing an interprofessional campus  where we don' t have to just treat or teach physicians but we can also help with the education  of all of our allied health care teammates nurses physical therapists.  We need to have a sim center that allows them to learn how to start ivs do chest compressions  how to read ekgs and with the closure of endo behavioral health and their sim center there  they'  re going to need a location for that. We have already developed early plans for an  interprofessional campus that would allow us to provide didactic education cutting edge  technology to be able to teach our health care professionals of the future and work  to develop a system that would allow us to provide a system that would allow us to provide  a software software software software software software software software software software  software software software software software software software software software software  software software software software software software software software software software  software software software software software software software software software software  software software software software software software software software software software  software software software software software software software software software software  software software software software software software software software software software  software software software software software software software software software software  software software software software software software software software software  software software software software software software software software software  software software software software software software software software  software software software software software software software  software software software software software software software  software software software software software software software  software software software software software software  accentuate what is already  there. We don'  t have to reinvent  the wheel.  I can'  t thank you  enough for coming today do we  have any questions from council?  I think we'  ve all been  in the position where we'  ve had  people in the community go I  can'  t find a doctor in  town that was part of the  reason why I wanted you here we  all are facing that I think I  community and I myself have  called especially family  physicians when I had kids do  you have any openings no  openings you do that we  definitely have the need in the  area.  I was going to ask in your  research of looking at other  communities that have put  something like this in place  what'  s the time  frame start to finish 10 years  20 years 30 years?  we'  re looking at five  years and in terms of the  podem effectively effectively  effectively effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  willing to come here to be trained for those four slots for psychiatry residency in our community  we had 510 applications from medical students that were graduating from medical school and we  had to whittle it down to four and they were great candidates i'm very excited for you guys to  experience them when they come up here to chico next year and that's four psych residents per  year it's a four-year program so we're talking about 16 psychiatry residents and with the family  medicine residency that's going to be four residents for a three-year residency sets once  it's at full speed it'll be 12 residents they're all physicians they're just physicians in training  that's great and thank you so much jen you provided some resources to them as well i think  i did thank you mayor coolidge i had the honor of sitting in a meeting with your  ceo of healthy rural california christy bird mckee who's here and carrie lynn as well we pulled  together a meeting with the governor's office of business and  economics and i'm going to give you a little bit of a background on what's going on in the  development the go biz office I  gave them some background on  healthy rural California they  pulled five different experts  that cover various areas within  the governor's office to meet  with christine myself and  carrilyn to hear about what this  project is about their very  supportive of this especially as  they see the need in the north  state and understand this  specifically. They are  connecting with resources that  are available through the state  for example one of the  representatives is pulling  together information they are  aware of in terms of foundation  funding another is looking into  grant sources and a third area  they talked about is support they  would have for any type of federal  grant or federal funds that might  come down the state would go  ahead and support them I think  they are already in the process  will be able to support projects  when they come forward.  just in case we have  somebody at home that has a piece  of property that is burning a  hole in their pocket that they  want to give away or a beautiful  building they would like to  donate what type of size of  facility when you say you are  bringing a school how many square  feet approximately would a  building be and what size or  piece of property to start from?  we are looking at 60,000  thank you.  a six acre person.  if you have got it please.  there is some room on the  third floor of city hall.  any other questions?  thanks so much for being here we  really appreciate what you are  doing.  thank you for your time.  big need in our community.  with that and you guys are free  to sneak out of the door while we  move on to our consent agenda  we don'  t want to waste any of your  time not that our consent agenda  is a waste of time.  don't misquote me.  consent agenda all matters listed  on the consent agenda are  considered routine in nature  and effectively enacted in one  motion do we have any speakers.  we do not.  any councilors  qualifications or items to  be pulled seeking none to I see none.

Carries 6-0 with  one absent.  All right. We'll go on to public  comments. Members of the Public Managers  Council at this time on any matter not already listed  on the agenda. Within the jurisdiction's  authority, Council cannot take  any action at this meeting on requests made  under this section of the agenda.  I believe we have five.  All right. I'm going to call the first two names, and if you  could go ahead and line up in the middle aisle, that'll  help. Lori Mason, followed by  Steven Hazel.  Hello. I'd like to thank you for this opportunity. My name is Lori Mason. I'm a psychiatric mental health nurse practitioner. I've worked with homeless people since October of 1980, so I think I bring a little street cred to what I'm saying today. I'm also on the board of North State Shelter Team, and I volunteer with Shalom Free Clinic.  So, I'm glad.  I would like to do  something different.  Because a lot of times when we  come here, we criticize and we're upset  with you, and I've decided that that  doesn't really work. What I'd like to  say today is we just had an action at  the Eaton and Cohasset Campground, and I  think it actually went very well. I  think it was very well thought out.  There were  very lucky people. People, obviously, who were  stories. I have had officers come up to me and say, do you know so-and-so? And I'll say, yeah,  well, you know, so-and-so really needs this thing. Can you guys help her? You know, that's  community collaboration. You know, that's what we need to solve this problem. This is a big  problem. This is an international problem. There are very few countries that don't have the problem  of homelessness. The camp looks a lot better. People feel a lot better in the camp. Of course,  they're having some difficulty adjusting, but when I move to a new house, I have difficulty adjusting.  So I want to give a shout out to Public Works. I want to give a shout out to Chief Aldridge for  meeting with us and hearing our concerns. I also want to give a shout out to Sergeant Bailey,  Sergeant Ratto, and I hope I'm getting there,  and I hope I'm getting the ranks correctly, as well as Sergeant Clark. This was well thought out.  I mean, people got to stay in hotels while the camp was cleared. Animal control was there to  take charge of animals so that people didn't worry about their animals getting loose.  You know, I mean, I have to say this is the third one I've been to, and I've always been impressed.  So I know this is hard work. I know we need to do a lot of  effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively  effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively  effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively  effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively  effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively  effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively  effectively effectively effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  Steven Hazel.  Earlier, I want to apologize because I spoke earlier on the, I guess it was a closed session.  I didn't speak on something because I spoke at, I was a member of the city council and knew how the procedure worked.  I was going to comment on Warren versus Chico, but I haven't the time.  See, because it's short.  I spent 40 days and 40 nights at the Good News Rescue Mission in Redding.  I read it in Redding, and I came here after this guy, it was bad.  We did this overlaid.  She said she's going to Chico.  Well, Bill, he passed away after that, and the pastor passed away, too.  I know that, but I came here.  I stayed here 14 months.  I'm going to say, just briefly, so I want to comment on that.  Torch shelters, it saved my life, even though I can't die, but it really did save my life.  Because I can't really stand 10, 15 minutes, but they're allowed to stand it.  They didn't kick you out.  Probably the best shelter.  I'll get it.  Get you back with that.  But I was there.  So, when I told you that 6-12, when Trump stood up, what it meant.  See, what it's Anne Frank, O.J. Simpson, and Bush have in common.  H-12, 6-12.  See, that's the time that I was talking about.  He said, time is everything.  And what happened was, yes, God was there, but you were there.  And also, the honest piece of it, he changed the time, which is true.  But he had that.  He said, the Biden or the Obama secret service.  Point of order.  So, we're not here to talk about presidential politics.  No, no.  It has to do, I'm talking about, it's your thing.  It has to do with, you look at it in the wall.  It says, what?  See the memorial.  Local.  It has to do with, I'm giving you the insight you need to see.  I'm just saying.  Like, God is all seeing.  I was there.  Okay.  Pretty simple.  I am God.  You're not.  Am I not who or what you're expecting?  Hey, it's the way it is.  So, you're not.  You're a man.  I know who I am.  Do you know who you are?  Okay.  I'll be disrespectful.  My name is Stephen Hazel.  I was born in 1959.  I'm a product of two Berkeley graduates.  I was born December 6th at night.  At 11 on a night.  I was born at night.  I wasn't born yesterday.  I'm Pearl Harbor.  My father's Pearl Harbor.  You understand that?  So, 9-11 was originally scheduled for the 6th anniversary of 1941.  But what moved at the time was Enron.  You didn't see that.  So, you got started on the wrong foot.  The driving force.  The timing there.  If you have the timing.  They were expecting 5-5.  23 was skipped from the White House.  Which is W-A-Z-A-B-C.  You understand this?  This is a capital.  So, it's just a tower.  You understand?  The original plan.  Again, Mr. Hazel.  No, no.  You understand.  This has to do with everything.  And people died for this country.  You can stand it.  And you're going to get in the way.  Sir.  Who was involved with 9-11.  If I say, of course, you can't get involved with 9-11.  Or you can.  It's a terrorist act.  Okay.  You can't defend George Bush.  He's involved in 9-11.  All right, sir.  That will be the end.  No, no, no.  Thank you, Madam Clerk.  Sir.  People died.  The memorial out there.  People died for my right to speak.  Who are you?  Because you're a person.  All right.  We're going to take a short recess.  And we're going to inform you again.  Because you're, at this point, disrupting the meeting.  No, it's not disrupting.  No.  Yes.  We have rules there in place.  We will take a short recess.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  We will continue.  Folks, please.  Okay.  We have three remaining speakers.  Katie Posey, followed by Lori Monroe.  All right.  And just a word to the wives here.  We've done this before.  But local topics.  And then stay on the subject, please.  But this is public comments.  Go ahead.  I want this question.  Good evening, counsel.  I'd like to thank the counsel and the jury for allocating one-time funds to keep the  library here in Chico.  We open it up for day of the week on Wednesdays.  Thank you to counsel Lynn Lutand for raising this with the counsel before the budget was  approved on June 18th for us on this budget.  I'm sorry I couldn't be here that day.  I was in Copenhagen.  But I appreciate that the counsel does listen to their constituents on such an important  issue.  And especially as many of us spoke about the importance of the library in the past council  meetings.  This decision demonstrates that this counsel cares about the library resources being available  more.  More days of the week for people of all backgrounds and needs.  As you may know, there are benefits for the library all community members can experience.  For example, the library can support literacy needs of the homeless, provide technology  for men who don't have it anywhere else, and support personal productivity and cultural  engagement.  Also, our library, I don't know if I spoke about this in the past, but there's this idea  that the library is part of what some call a social infrastructure.  So this is like any physical.  It's a physical place that allows community members to interact in a public area like  parks, community gardens, athletic fields, and schools.  As communal areas, these are important because they foster relationships between people who  live near each other, helping people feel personally invested in the place that they  live.  Thank you again, and I'm looking forward to when we have the library open potentially  even more days.  Thank you.  Lori Monroe, followed by Julie Kenner.  Hi, I'm Lori Monroe.  Thank you for allowing me to speak.  I wanted to speak, address the Eaton and Capacit encampment, and backing up a little  just to review.  The grand jury wrote a report entitled Chico Needs a Plan, and in it they said that the  work that the city of Chico does needs to be planned and organized.  On July...  On July 25th, Governor Newsom made an executive directive to state agencies to clear encampments,  but he also required them to have a plan before they did that.  And so I'm here to ask you to encourage the city of Chico to have a plan for the encampment  at Eaton and Capacit that is workable.  What was going on there before the recent clearance was totally unworkable.  Some of the problems are probably starting back up.  For instance, I know the Hand Wash Station, I've been told by residents at Eaton and Capacit  that the Hand Wash Station recycles the same water, so you're washing your hand in the  water that your neighbor just washed their hands in.  That's not a workable solution.  That's not a solution to hygiene.  So the nurse state shelter team has developed a plan, you have been presented the plan,  city executives have been offered the plan.  I'm not saying that this is necessarily the plan that the city of Chico would choose, but  I really encourage you to consider that plan and the things that they offer.  Because as soon as the attention is taken away from Eaton and Capacit, things can change.  And at this point, there is no, unless it's Mr. Gustafson, there is nobody in the city  administration who is responsible for Eaton and Capacit.  He was responsible for the clearance and the cleaning up.  But he's not responsible for the cleaning up.  But I doubt that he considers himself responsible for the ongoing care.  And Chico needs a plan.  There needs to be a plan in place so that it can continue to be a safe and healthy place  for the people who live there.  thank you.  Our last speaker is Julie Kenner.  hello.  My name is julie.  I would like to speak to the state of chico.  I think about the general city of chico government.  And the first thing is about communication with the public.  I would very much like to see the city council members report at meetings about their own  districts.  I think it would be great for everyone to hear and learn about different parts of the  community that we do not live in.  I think there is generally a lack of understanding from the public about what the city of chico  employees do or are trying to do.  I assume that many city employees feel they are not appreciated.  And I do think that most of the public does not understand all that the city government  does.  I certainly don't.  But I would like to learn and understand more.  Because of that, I was very intrigued by the city council's response to the city council's  report.  I was intrigued by what the city of oarville did, offering a series of classes for the  public about the city government called civic 101.  The classes were to provide the public with an understanding about how the city works.  An opportunity to learn about the different departments in the city and what they actually  do and don't do.  The goal being learning to work together as a community.  The city government is here to serve the public.  I think that so many of our challenges in our community stem from distrust and lack  of understanding.  Building trust can be a long process.  It takes communication.  It takes willingness.  It takes honesty.  It takes transparency.  And it takes humility to know that we don't have all the answers.  If we can find what we have in common and work together, we can build trust.  If we can work together honestly, we can make huge improvements in our city.  Societal issues don't get solved, but we can work towards improvement.  We can work together or against each other.  I think Chico would be a better place if we worked together.  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right.  That was our last speaker, correct?  All right.  We will move on to item 4.1.  The long continuation of hearing on appeal of H. Hayes Sewer Building.  At its meeting on 6-18-24, the council held a public hearing on the appeal filed by Mr.  Daniel Hayes.  The hearing was open.  Testimony was received.  The hearing was closed.  The council referred the discussion related to the EDU Billing and Sewer Rates to Internal  Affairs Committee.  And the committee met yesterday.  And a verbal report will be provided to the council by the chair, councilmember Hayes.  podem !  podem ! !  podem  podem  podem  increase in sewer rates and also because  Which we changed the formula and how we did it so we had a really excellent presentation from David Keene who's on mr.  Odo boning staff  Explained it very clearly they spent a lot of time looking at this one more time and we came to the conclusion  that the city had a  Extremely equitable algorithm and that there were no  We couldn't fault it. We think they've done a great job of researching it and  Agree with the calculations in the way they're doing them. I don't know if Mike if do you have something else casey or Addison dad  Yeah, when we raised the sewer rates in January 2023, I had a lengthy conversation with mr  Gustafson about all that because some of the things looked a little fishy to me and he explained why they look fishy and  Yeah, I think that it all does make sense  I think that's a good point  I  Don't have anything other than you know, I understand there can be a misunderstanding and comprehension on what an edu is and how an edu is  Calculated and I'm sure we can put this up and make that available to the public as well because it is actually this we got like a  six-page  Compressed version that made it very understandable and there's a good way to appeal and to  Show if you had a leaky sprinkler or whatever that ran and you all of a sudden had it  A ton of extra water running you assured us that there's a way to go through that  So I appreciated the information and I have no other questions or anything  All right, and madam clerk because we had already had the public hearing on this we don't have public comment  I'd like to make a motion that we deny the appeal and  Align with the public works  director of engineering recommends accounts denied appeal on a whole the public works determination  And to deny the appeal and so that's my motion  Councilmember Bennett. Yes Councilmember Tandon  Council member Van over Beck Council member Winslow Vice Mayor Reynolds mayor Coolidge  carries six zero with one absence  And again just be stating for  The reason why we did not have public comment on that item is because that wasn't an official public hearing,  and we didn't already have public comment during that public hearing previously.  So, all right, with that, we'll move on to item 5.1,  consideration of the presentation of voting delegates for the 2024 League of California City Annual Conference.  And we have a report from our esteemed city clerk and elections official.  Thank you, Mayor.  Mayor and Council, it's that time of year again when the League reaches out to see if we want to send a voting delegate to the League Conference.  And I believe it is in Long Beach this year, and it's held October 16th through the 18th.  One thing to note, and I put it in the report, is that at the last League Conference, at that time, there were no resolutions to vote on.  And so we reached out to the League staff to see if they...  There were going to be any, because that was an expense to go, and then there was no voting.  Although networking is important, and I totally understand that.  So they have indicated that they're not sure that there will be any resolutions to vote on.  So it would be up to the Council, if you wish to send a representative for a possible vote, it's up to you.  All right. So let's do this first. Do we have any public comment?  No, we do not.  All right. So, second, I just want to say that I've been to a League, and the votes are kind of ridiculous.  It's a giant group of people, and they go, okay, don't, you know, stand up if you're against this kind of thing.  And if you stand up, you get booed.  Literally words like that.  But it's not very, you know, you're talking about literally hundreds of people.  But I think we had you last time.  I know we have an interest from the Vice Mayor.  No, that's a long...  Long Beach, I'm not sure.  No, no.  I think Council Member Tandem was interested as well.  So, Council's discretion, the Vice Mayor has said, but I don't know if you...  It was good.  I would encourage anybody else to go.  And even though I was kind of disappointed there were nothing to vote on, and it felt a little weird.  We didn't know that until we got there.  But some cities send multiple Council members.  The networking is valuable.  There's workshops I went to on stuff like special districts and pension liabilities.  Things like...  I wouldn't sit down and read about.  It was better to be in a workshop with experts.  I met a lot of people.  I reconnected with, like, these former assistant city manager here.  Chris Constantine is now the Los Gatos city manager.  Things I would encourage.  I have friends that are in other city councils.  As a result, it's been really helpful.  I think if you plan to be on the city council for a while, it's a good thing to do.  I would certainly be willing to do it again.  But if either of them want to do it, do.  I think that's great.  And when is the conference again?  It is October 16th through the 18th.  Okay, so we'll make Sean go.  Just kidding, Sean.  Well, if I could make a suggestion.  If the vice mayor wants to take this on, I think she would represent us very well.  All right.  Thank Mr. Winslow for doing it for us last year.  It was my pleasure.  Easy.  I will take it.  All right.  Okay.  Any further nomination?  Okay.  Can I add to that?  Sure.  Please, if I may.  Sure.  Sure.  I have an alternate.  And make that Council Member Tandon.  Okay.  If so, you did.  And then, so the alternate would go at the same time and then that way if one can't vote,  then the other one, or are you saying if the mayor can't, the vice mayor can't?  Yeah.  Okay.  You've got it.  One room.  Yeah, yeah.  One room.  One room, one vote.  Okay.  All right.  Council Member Bennett?  Yes.  Council Member Tandon?  Yes.  Council Member Van Overbeek?  Yes.  Council Member Winslow?  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds?  Sure.  Mayor Coolidge?  Aye.  Great.  Okay.  Council Members do have a $350 a year budget that they could use to attend on their own  if they so choose.  Isn't it $350, right?  It's $300.  $300.  $300.  For local events.  I already used mine, but I think you can donate it to another Council Member.  Yeah.  I'll take it.  All right.  Okay.  All right.  With that, we move on to item 5.2.  Confirmation of Deputy Director, City Clerk.  And we have a report from either Chelsea or Mark.  I'll take this one.  Thank you, Mayor and Council.  Section 605 of the City Charter states that the appointment of department heads is a subject  confirmation by the City Council.  So to meet this requirement, the City Council is being presented with an employment agreement  for the Deputy Director, City Clerk.  The employment agreement and its associated terms and conditions.  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem deputy director city clerk with an annual salary of 115,000 per year and a vehicle allowance of  podem  podem !  podem  podem  podem ! !  podem !  podem ! !  podem  podem  podem  podem  motion  second  Vice Mayor Reynolds  motion  Council Member Van Overbeek  got it thank you council  Council Member Bennett yes  Council Member Tandon yes  Council Member Van Overbeek  enthusiastically yes  Council Member Winslow yes  Vice Mayor Reynolds aye  Mayor Coolidge aye  carries 6-0 with one absence and thank you  council we're excited to have Keeper  all right  so we'll move on to item 5.3  consideration of utility box  art program and back  to  the city clerk  council it's a pleasure to  speak to you about this item  I'm very proud of the hard work that our  arts commission has been doing  they do a lot of work  they create a lot of we have  a lot of ad hocs that they go out  and they do the due diligence and put in the  hard work without  with minimal staff support so I'm very  excited to present this to you it's the  approval of a utility box art program  and this is so the utility boxes are  actually utility cabinets there's 14 in  the downtown area that they've  identified the ad hoc committee did all  the research into the programs what  other cities did and how they got it  going how they funded it as well as they  reached out to public  community members and they reached out to the  public works operations staff Skyler Lipsky worked really hard beside them  identifying which utility cabinets or  boxes our city owned and they're in the  downtown area the thought process behind  this is that obviously your arts  commission is here to look for ways to  beautify our community and to bring more  art into different areas but this was a  real opportunity to have artists share  their work in public spaces we haven't  had a program in many many years we  haven't had the funding to do anything  to bring new art pieces in our  community so this would be an  opportunity to not only prevent graffiti  on these boxes but also to showcase  artwork for our for local people within  the Butte County and we believe that  with the hard work that the Arts  Commission did they reached out to our  to different business owners, and we believe that we won't have to come to the city for funding,  that it'll be a program that is self-funded through people who want to participate in the  program and have a piece of artwork. The process for the selection of the artist and the artwork  would all come before the Arts Commission, and that's explained in the report. They would consider  key factors when selecting art for the utility box program to include locations frequently targeted  by graffiti and with the proximity to other artwork, with preferences to be given to city-owned  utility boxes that have minimal public art in that area. A request for proposals will be,  that'll be a process that we utilize to select the artist, and then that process would help  obviously evaluate the submissions. And there would need to be, the Arts Commission thought  of everything.  And this ad hoc that was comprised of three Arts Commissioners really did a lot of heavy lifting on  this. But the evaluations of the proposals would include the need for artistic excellence,  appropriateness of scale, form, content, and design. Artists selected must reside within  Butte County and demonstrate community partnership. So for the first time in a very long time,  we're asking you to perhaps endorse a program that we believe will be funded,  through the hard work of our businesses and partnerships, and not come to the city.  We would love to propose the 14 boxes in the downtown area that's already been identified  and our city owned. And then if we are successful and you really, really love it,  then I'm sure you're going to give the charge to the Arts Commission to keep going and perhaps  identify other utility boxes throughout the city. I know we do have three of our Arts Commissioners  here.  You may want to speak. And I believe they've selected it and put it in a card. So if you  have specific questions, the proposals in the packet, that came from the ad hoc. Honestly,  they didn't ask anything of me except to do the staff report and to take it to the council.  They voted unanimously to move this forward. And so I'm open for any questions.  So all this for free for us? It's not free for everybody, but the city's not being asked to  contribute anything?  We're not.  being asked to, well, there will be some staff time to help with the RFP process and having our  meetings so that the Arts Commission can make the selection. So it would probably warrant a few  special meetings. But it's already, when you look at the proposal, they've looked at every aspect of  it. And I think that it would be limited staff resources. That would be where the cost would be.  But in terms of funding the actual artwork, the city is not being asked for a dime. They believe  that there's an excitement about bringing some new art pieces in the downtown area,  and this is an opportunity to take those cabinets and make them beautiful.  I'm excited about it. I always like to include art in anything around the city. I think that's  good. A little bit of art funding, I think, goes a long way. And if we're able to see success with  this, then I think that's a good thing. I think that's a good thing. I think that's a good thing.  I think we should consider taking in a little bit to make sure we get the best quality stuff and  that artists are properly remunerated. We have really good Arts Commissioners, which we'll hear  from them, but that does help with this. And then was there discussion at the Arts Commission in  terms of a topic or a subject? I've seen these in other towns. Sometimes they work really well,  sometimes they don't. It's all political satire. Sometimes. Yuba City might be an example of what  you don't want to do.  There wasn't a specific discussion about that, but I do believe that if you were to consider  approving it, you could ask the Arts Commission to have it have a specific to represent something  and then to allow them to do the RFP and to bring in the proposals. We would have pictures of the  artwork and once they select the 14, they could even make a presentation to the council if you  would wish to see them before they go up.  The cabinets are typically, I think they're five feet high and three feet deep. And these are wraps  that go around and based on the research that our Arts Commissioners did, they have about a 10-year  life on them. And they do, and all the cities that they reached out to, they did say it detoured,  you know, deterred the placement, and yes, I can't even think of the word,  placement of graffiti on those boxes.  And they do clean up. So if they did get targeted, they could be cleaned.  Okay. So I'm just asking something you already said, but I want to make sure I'm clear. These are wraps. It's not painted on lives.  Oh, no. No, we wouldn't want artists standing there just painting. And so these are actual pieces of art that would then be placed and printed on wraps that would just, are like skins.  Yeah. So the other, I mean, I think it's important that the...  Yeah.  ...topics be non-political.  Yeah.  And that, if possible, that there's some theme that supports, you know, the historic nature of downtown. And, but there's a whole bunch of, I think it needs to have some theme.  And that's what I, if you, you know, approve the program, we can incorporate something like that. And, of course, I'd want you to hear from the Arts Commissioners, but definitely,  I can guarantee...  It wouldn't be political.  I, I, our Arts Commissioners understand that, and they wouldn't allow for that. But I, I believe having a, a theme or something would help people also respond, thinking about their artwork and how they could participate.  Okay.  Speakers?  Okay. Monica McDaniel.  How many do we have?  We have three.  All right. Three for three.  Good evening, Council.  I just wanted to give you a little bit of backstory about this program. It was Commissioner Nava who saw box scraps in another city and brought it to the Commission. And that was about three years ago. So there's been a lot of work and a lot of research done. When he first brought it up, members of the Commission and members of the community got really excited about it. And then everybody started doing research about where, what other cities they saw that it had. And some of the cities include Chino, not Chico, Chino.  Duarte.  Torrance, Costa Mica, Eureka, and as you mentioned, Yuba City. And they, there are good examples of them and there are bad examples. The ones that I saw were in Sacramento. And in Sacramento, they had, they had contact information, a QR code that told you about the artists, and a place to give donations to, to give, to get more of them.  So, they, and the other thing that, that City Clerk mentioned, they are made with kind of a wallpaper process. You've seen this in some of the murals around town.  So, the John Hugh murals.  That's in front of Chico State when they had to rebuild the Arts and Humanities building.  They had to take away that, those pillars that were there that were originally painted.  The artist came back and did this process. It's kind of like a large piece of wallpaper.  And the beauty of that is that it makes it easily cleanable in case there is graffiti.  But like the clerk mentioned, also for murals and things like this, we see a lot of graffiti, graffiti mitigation for them.  And so it's a great process.  Do you have any further questions?  I was not on the committee. I just have seen the process going on.  So, in terms of the topic, did you?  I think it's, I think trees or hooker oak or something like, like you said, historical about Chico.  If you do like, good, well mentioned, you're going to get funky architectural stuff.  You know, trees seem to be what the city seems to like. So, and that's...  You're telling me trees aren't political?  Well, I mean...  Trees are not political.  I've been her teacher.  And I've seen kids draw trees of every age.  And so that might just be fun thing to see with them come back.  So that would be my recommendation.  I think it's a good topic.  Thank you.  All right.  Thank you.  Stephen Hazel is our next speaker.  And Council, just to let you know, as the speaker is coming up and we get him the microphone,  we have our next Arts Commission meeting in October.  And we could talk about the topic and have the Arts Commission.  And we'll get back to you on what that topic might be or the theme.  Okay.  So, Stephen Hazel is our next speaker.  So go ahead.  And this is on the art graffiti on the boxes.  Just a moment.  Go ahead.  Yep.  Go ahead.  Is it working?  It is now.  It's a bad idea.  I don't know if you can hear it.  It's a bad idea.  Look what you're doing.  You're designing like graffiti.  You're saying, well, it could be cleaned up.  No.  You're going to put it on the wall.  You're going to paint your box and I can destroy it.  Well, no.  You're not going to clean it up.  No.  See, just keep it great.  What are you doing?  It's great.  You guys are?  No.  I could have backed up a draft.  You know that?  I worked at IBM.  I made seven bucks an hour to draft it.  And I can get you creative.  You know that?  You know, the creative, creative and author to take about it.  You know that?  That's like the mock art right now.  See, it's not like that again.  Oh, my God.  What art?  What is that?  It's great.  You talked about nonpolitical.  You already talked about nonpolitical.  You're going to start to create a whole mess just to paint cracks under the graffiti.  That's it.  We want to create.  I don't want to just go, okay?  Pick a wall to do a mural.  Oh, you're going to start there.  Where is the end?  You guys are idiots.  You're going to start.  Oh, yeah.  We do your box.  It's all nice.  You guys are idiots.  Okay?  And standard green, whatever it is.  That's it.  If you can't get the people their graffiti, you're not going to stop.  That's it.  You can't solve that.  See?  You're going to start to create a whole mess.  It's not going to stop.  You can do the same thing here. You can go box. Oh everything coming out.  It's not going to stop. Because see things. Jumping all the way around and in with something local. It's gotta be old. It is old. My local. He doesn't know. See the rain here.  It's not going to stop.  It's not going to stop.  It's not going to stop.  It's not going to stop.  I was saying the Brown and Newsome breached the federal,  the dam to treat the federal money  in their encompass and lack of aid on the dam.  It was over a billion dollars  and they only paid $350 million.  Imagine paying, they're gonna pay that  during their lack of aid.  That's why he's in my last call.  When he cut me off, I gotta go to the box.  I'm in the box, see Mayor of Things.  Oh, he's a blinder, he's afraid to cut me off.  He's talking about school, I'm gonna say,  this guy, I wonder what he's been called, and he's a morgue.  First time I hear him, I'm so intimidated.  I am God, I'm the God, yeah.  And what you expected, I'm true blonde, yeah.  I'm white, I'm bright, I'm the number one in Star.  In Silicon Valley, you know that?  I won a contest on the fashion store, the bar job.  I did it in five days.  You know, he's got a shower in his freaking office  in the park, yeah.  I'm in the wrong store, I'm sitting right here in Newark.  I still got money, I'm in the fashion store in the West.  I won a contest.  Fact check.  Pivot returns, it was AO2.  The white kid, who's the fastest?  I won.  I still got some time, I haven't lost it.  I still got one more year.  I probably need a chair, but I can still do it.  I got the fastest job in the park.  I did it in five days.  14-day job.  Okay.  That's time, sir.  That's who I am.  That's time, thank you.  John Scar, sir, thank you.  Sir, that's time.  And our last speaker is Bonnie Pipkin,  who is another arts commission.  So as soon as.  .  .  . !  Hi.  Hi, I'm Bonnie Pipkin, I'm on the arts commission.  I found out about you.  I was not on the ad hoc either, but I'm very excited about this project.  I wanted to talk a little bit about the timeline.  Debbie did a great job presenting all the work that the ad hoc has done.  But October will be when we make the call for artists.  So like we were saying, we do have another arts commission, but we're not going to be  doing a full-on arts commission meeting to talk about what a topic might be.  But I would probably suggest and push for being open to seeing what artists have to say.  You know, we're going to put out a call and we're going to have criteria, and the criteria  is going to be for evaluation of artistic excellence, appropriateness of scale, relationship  to the social, cultural, or historical identity.  But I feel like. . .  An opportunity for the community and for artists to have something to say could potentially  be interesting.  And it will still be juried, you know, we'll still be looking at it in the end.  And we'll be looking for anything that might be offensive, but I would say it would be  great to be open to what people might have to say too, instead of putting restrictions  out the gate.  But, so we're going to put out the call in October.  Launch it after the Mayor's Awards at that same city council meeting.  And by January we'll select the winners at the arts commission meeting.  And then we hope to have the artwork on the boxes in April and May, and then kind of launch  that with the opening season of the Night Market and the downtown concerts.  And yeah, it should be great.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you Bonnie.  That's it.  That's it.  Yes.  Um. . .  I just have one quick comment.  Sure.  Um. . .  And this was already addressed and I didn't want to interrupt Ms. McDaniel during her  time.  Um. . .  But I think just to be sure.  We have a little bit of an insurgent right now in downtown and surrounding areas of  really large, very large areas.  bright artistic things happening. And so I think possibly adding 14 more five by three  conflicting large artistic things happening could be an issue. But I can see how some  unify some sort of theme. I'm not saying they all have to be trees, but something to do  with trees and, you know, maybe nature or animals, I don't know, something, whatever  it is. I just want to impress that I think it's important that we don't go too far on  much large, very bright when we've got a lot of that going on right now. And I know  we're working on getting some windows covered in downtown and some empty buildings that  are starting to look beautiful. But I can also see how this all starts looking very  hodgepodgey and different at some point. And I know the goal is better lighting and better  streets and, you know, fixing our sidewalks and we all have a great vision for downtown.  So that was, I just wanted to put it on the record that I think it's important that we  just pay attention to it. Artistic talent, artistic freedom, definitely.  But that's just a concern personally, but I'm super excited about it. I appreciate you guys doing all the work on it and it's going to look great.  So what I heard, I don't know whether it was Miss Pipkin or McDaniel, but one of you said  that the art was going to be supportive of the historical and cultural nature of the community.  And so I think what we should do is just, without being too constrained, is to ask you  to come back and articulate some concept that's consistent with those comments.  Or do we want to just let the Art Commission decide, I think?  My only concern with that is I feel like this has been talked about for a really long time  and that we would add another delay when we're just doing some box wraps.  So let's have the Art Commission decide and go and just do it.  Yeah.  I think just giving them some of your opinions at this point would probably help.  I think it's a good idea.  Can I add to the conversation?  Sure.  In the Fine Arts Master Plan for the city, there is guidelines for public art.  And we see it in a lot of the art pieces that are already around town.  So like in the Art Hands sculpture and in the bus depot and even the piece that's in  front of the Diamond Hotel.  And it has to do with Chico's watershed and natural surroundings.  So to look for that information to possibly not be a problem.  delay. You can even look to the Fine Arts Master  Plan and look at their  specifics there that might give you more direction.  Is that  our network has been done?  I was not saying  that to delay. I would definitely want to keep it moving forward,  keep it on track, bring it back in October. I just  wanted to express my concern and  let you know.  I think adhering to those standards makes sense.  I think we  all have some  hesitation about, you know, we do have  some private buildings that have done really  bright murals and we love them  and some of them are a little outlandish  at times too, so I  concur with that as well. But I  know with the Arts Master Plan that's a little  more, you know,  natural appealing.  You know, so  that's what I would say. Any other comments?  Yeah, I'm  enthusiastic to see what the community  comes up with and see if it's a way for  independent local artists to  be showcased and be able to  develop their art forms and  you know, I really like  the situation in Eureka,  down in Old Town Eureka. That's what I recommend looking at.  It's the boxes, it's also the murals, and there's  so much diversity in the artwork, but it also has a  kind of, like, Eureka vibe  and I think that's something that we can get here to  develop in our own unique way.  Entertain a motion.  Second.  Second.  Council Member  Ann Oberman.  Okay.  Motion by  Council Member  Oberman.  Council Member Bennett. Yes. Council Member Tandon.  Yes. Council Member Van Overbeek.  Yes. Council Member Winslow.  Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds.  Aye. Mayor Coolidge. Aye.  Carries 6-0 with one absence  and thank you, Council, very much. Thank you.  Thanks to our Arts Commission for all  their hard work. Absolutely.  Alright. Item  5.4. Council request  second main street building  danger assessment. We have  a report from Community Development Director  Brendan. Good evening.  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem Following the site visit, the building official determined there is currently no imminent danger  podem  danger posed by the building  there'  s a single  secured access to the second  floor limiting unwanted access  and the activities taking place  are consistent with remodeled  projects associated with  downtown buildings. Staff has  observed however occasional work  conducted on the sidewalk right  away without an encroachment  permit. Staff emphasized to the  property owner that any future  work in the right away would  require an encroachment permit  from public works which would  address any safety concerns.  Further staff and the building  owner do recognize the remodel  has been going on for quite some  time and the building'  s current open  status does have a blighting  effect on the downtown. According  to the property owner the  building'  s age as well as decades of  previous neglect specifically on  the second floor as well as other  uses that continue both  commercial and residential in the  building have presented unique  challenges to their project  schedule. The property owner has  also experienced delays in  procuring supplies as well as  labor and the building has  completion. The building owner  the exterior work which had been  confirmed by code enforcement.  According to the property owner  completion of the exterior of the  building is a very high priority  for him. Staff did request an  achievable schedule for  completion of the exterior work  which has been shared with  council in the staff report which  is January 30 of 2025. Upon  completion of the exterior work  the property owner does plan to  incorporate 11 residential units  year and will take several more  years. Staff recommends the  council consider the status  report also hear from the  property owner as well as  architect regarding the project.  thank you.  questions?  Mr. Veague when was the  initial building permit issued?  my understanding was issued in  february or january or february  of 2023.  that thing has been under  construction for at least 10  years?  I think a lot of the previous  work was investigated as part of  a demolition permit and so the  building permit has been since  the time.  we were given this little  design sheet just late in the  council meeting and I did notice  it had some businesses in there  that haven'  t been here in 10 years. I  look at the date and it is from  2015. Did I see that somewhere?  2015. January 2015.  thank you.  thank you.  thank you.  further questions?  Mr. Veague just to go back over  this we all know this building  and some of the other ones in  that corridor have obviously not  been the best looking buildings  in chico and as you mentioned are  more or less blight to the  downtown.  I know that I addressed this  issue when we agendized it. I  addressed this issue with the  previous city manager twice over  the course of four years. I'  ve brought this up now three  times. How can we so without  going back through and going you  know what okay what happened  where did we fall down? Instead  I want to look at what can we do  to stop this in the future?  we have these buildings we did  discuss code enforcement on this  kind of stuff but really what'  s the key? There'  s other cities when they  have buildings that sit  dilapidated like this uncared  for that they crack down on the  folks who own them and make them  fix them up faster. How can we  achieve that?  good question. There'  e some specific challenges with  the downtown buildings. I think  if you hear from the area  architect and the property owner  they started kind of unwinding  something and found that they  kind of were unwinding a lot  finding the old window and  casings and things like that. I  don'  t know that this is the best  bellwether of other projects.  Projects are unique started and  has transcended the pandemic.  There have been challenges for  this property owner. I think  the future. Again we often try  to extend a building permit if  there'  s continuing to be  progress because we don'  t want to start a fight if it'  s going to not get the project  come to the end. There'  e a thin line in there.  Building permits do have lives  but we tend to want to extend  them in order to see the project  come to fruition. If there was  no progress at all then I think  we have the tools we need to go  after and do notice of violations  and levy fines.  you could answer this question  or the city manager could too.  Obviously this has been like this  for what?  At least ten years.  At least ten years. Granted that  was done under a demolition  permit but obviously at some  point we realized there was no  more demolition or it was just  the world'  s slowest  demolition. It'  s really critical that we  building. We created a blight  for the downtown. What can we do  to expedite this process? What  do we need to do? What can we  do from a policy standpoint to  prevent this? Do we need to have  more regular inspections?  if I may we have changed  the code to provide real  sanctions fines for buildings  that'  s true but as director  veig mentioned typically in a  code enforcement situation what  you'  re looking for is  progress. Not bringing a halt  to progress. In this instance we  have seen progress and then no  progress. A lot of promises of  progress and then very slowly  delivered. It has been extremely  difficult to know as Mr. Veig  just said exactly where the line  is. They'  re just to try to answer your  question there isn'  t a perfect  answer. You hope that a property  owner would begin a project like  this and bring it to a conclusion  in a reasonable period of time.  Do strange things happen,  unexpected things happen in old  buildings? Yes they do. But  granted this has gone on an  inordinate amount of time and  again getting back to the  original question could we be  much stricter and when we levy  fines yes we could. Would that  achieve a faster result or would  it just begin a protracted  battle is always the question.  To which there is no answer.  Maybe the city attorney could  answer that question.  could add to our ability to  enforce as I'  ve just described.  if I may Mr. Mayor.  I'  m sorry are you asking john  to make a comment?  let'  s hear from the city  attorney.  good evening mayor and city  council. Just to add on top of  the city manager'  s comments we do have some  provisions in our nuisance  provisions. One is that  there is a provision that  declares a nuisance building  left in a state of partial  construction for six months  absent compelling extenuated  circumstances. Another  provision unsecured buildings  constituting hazardous  conditions or inviting or  permitting trespassers and  malicious mischief. A lot of  this language is very vague  right? It'  s sometimes difficult to  objectively interpret this  we can objectively apply  precisely. Just because it'  s meant to address a broad  range of issues. Another one  relates to exterior wall and or  roof coverings that have become  substantially deteriorated and  do not provide adequate weather  protection. Unpainted,  unmaintained or otherwise  unprotected buildings. With  these open windows or window  openings that could be an issue.  Building exteriors, walls, signs  or other structures on property  that are visible from any public  street which are unsafe leaning  fallen, decayed or in an  otherwise dilapidated unsafe or  unsightly condition. We have  some existing provisions that  may apply and we can always  tweak those. Some cities have  gone even further which they'  ve adapted vacant building  ordinances that require  registration. That'  s something that council  would need to decide on whether  that makes sense or not. The  s additional  procedure and whether it'  s business  friendly or not that'  s something for council to  consider but some cities do  require vacant building owners  to register their site and  there'  re specific provisions  they have to comply with and  make sure they continue with  while the site is vacant.  can you do that within  the specific area of your city?  I don'  t see why you could'  n.  You know maybe it makes  sense to do it in a broader  range.  interesting.  So I have some experience in  renovating old buildings and a  project and there are always  things that happen but these  are there should be an 18 month  process or a year process it'  s not a 10 year process.  questions further?  we will take public speakers.  we have two.  first speaker is david griffith  followed by david.  david griffith,  architect for the project.  i came prepared to give you  some background about the  architecture and the site.  i was hoping to provide some  images but i understand that's  not possible.  although i understand you also  have the images i was going to  show you.  there's the booklet.  the booklet is our internal  document.  it's not a city approved  document but our internal  document for development.  there should be a sheet of other  pages but basically the first  picture, that's the way we think  of that building when i first  came to chicago it looked like  that.  it's basically a big corner  building with lots of arms.  if you look at the next picture  you'll see what it looked like  in 1935 or so.  there's a lot of  keys and so forth and it was  the jc penny building.  and what happened between 1935  and probably 1960 or so from my  understanding is upstairs spaces  became unused.  so the building basically was  abandoned upstairs and you can  see it was plastered over the  top.  you'll even see one picture  there.  there used to be rooms for that  upstairs 50 cents like the old  small.  the halevi trust when they picked  on this they see this as a  valuable resource for the  community.  we would like to bring it back  to what it has where the  upstairs is a valuable space for  the community and not just for  the building.  what happened, brendan mentioned  about the lack of maintenance or  whatever over the years, it  wasn't really like neglect it  was like an opportunity for  the handyman and so forth to fill  up that unused upstairs with  whatever utilities.  there were air conditioning and  electrical wires laying all over  the place just abandoned.  the entire usable space turned  into a utility attic.  so the value to the city and to  the developer is to turn this  into living space where we'll  finally have some brand new  apartments downtown.  i think i've been involved in  almost every single office  building in the city.  i've had the opportunity to try  to bring apartments downtown.  they just don't seem to happen.  this one i think is happening.  you'll see in the last few images  that i have are the sketch that  we did in the booklet which is  our vision of pre-design for a  living living in its downtown.  and then the final image is the  more refined one which is been  approved by the city as part of  our current building permit  which is for the facade  renovation and then the  exterior which is all the  exterior stuff that we're  speaking about tonight.  it was my decision and as we  discussed this that we would do  it in pieces so that we could  get it done that way as opposed  to trying to get it all done  with one giant project.  so anyway that's the vision and  that's what we're trying to do.  thank you.  can i ask a question?  sure.  david?  david?  david?  yeah.  so this is a beautiful project  and i know you're a very good  architect and i'm very excited  about more apartments downtown  so all that's great.  when did you start working on  this?  well i think the council  member mentioned that it was in  2015 but again that's an  internal document we didn't start  building anything that was our  internal you know what could we  do with it?  well i think you showed me a  set of plans or david and  halima and i had a lot of  ideas that we did around then  for lofts upstairs so what's  what's taken nine years?  well i have i had to work out  the design that you see in the  booklet and then we had to decide  what they're going to do whether  they can what they can afford it  and we break it down into pieces  that can be built the uh we also  have the issue of the number of  tenants that have changed over  the years.  so as tenants would change for  instance there was a museum kind  of a tent there for a while they  moved out.  you're talking about downstairs  though?  i am but it all it all fixed it  attaches together because we can't  just shut down the downstairs to  do the upstairs.  so i actually have an article  from 2018 april that was written  by.  that's all true it's it's a  progressive project.  okay but but it was written in  fire i remember it was written  and i remember our friends at  chico asha wrote it.  friends of the enterprise record  and it says at the beginning of  it is that you know you guys are  well mr.  lema is talking about it and  that you know these 11 units  would be built and that was  2018 it was april 2018.  i know we might want to throw  covid in there as a stopping  point but that's two years before  covid.  obviously there'  s been plans for a long time  plans that you showed us from  2015 a story in the enterprise  record where mr.  lema was out talking about it in  the community.  2018.  i realize that you know we made  zero progress over that time but  it'  s you know the reason why we'  re here talking about this is  because this is blight on our  downtown and has been for an  extended period of time.  i tried to move on this back in  the last couple of years but i  think it's been a long time since  it's ridiculous.  the way my work goes is we come  up with a concept and then we get  permission to proceed with what we  can do what we can afford what can  be done.  so i'm given these pieces and i  try to do them i have a certain  string of permits on this project  and that's what that's what it has  to be from my point of view i can't  just say i need to do the whole  thing.  it probably took less than a  couple of years to build a new  world trade center.  say that again.  it probably took less time to  build a new world trade center.  okay well i appreciate your  opinion and i'll write that.  it's not an opinion that's fact.  all right.  okay any other questions?  mr griffith.  all right thanks speaker.  david haleemi.  good afternoon.  i want to say thank you to  the city staff for visiting the  project taking the time to look it  over.  i thought the staff report was  very fair and balanced and i'm  pleased that they found there was  no imminent danger by the building  to the city which as you all may  recall was the alarming bell that  started this whole process.  i further agree and respect the  issues of obtaining a cultural  permit for the city and i  further work that has already been  in motion and i also do agree that  i wish that a lot of the progress  was more speedy.  no one has more incentive than me  to get the project done.  certainly a project that's taken  thousands of dollars and produces  no income is not something that i  wish.  i think it's a bit misleading to  bring in 2015-2018 where it was  basically the experience of a  I was doing the rotary research in whether we should do the project or not.  And if it was based on economic reasons, I would not have done it.  Much like the folks at Collier's Hallway decided not to do the residence upstairs.  Much like Alan Tauchman decided not to do the residence above the Walter King and Wine.  It really doesn't pencil out. It's more of a passion that has drove me to do that.  It took some planning. The relevant parameter is February of 2023, when the building permit was issued.  Prior to that was exploratory. We had nothing moving forward with the project.  In terms of the time, I'm first to admit that I am a perfectionist.  David Griffith is not far behind me.  And I'm reminded of the Winston Churchill quote that,  perfection is the enemy of progress.  My projects do move slower, but when they're done, it is something that the city can be proud of.  You can look at our last project, 325 Broadway.  Wonderful media, whom my tenant wanted offices that rivals Apple and Google.  And he does, with his own generator and all.  My own passion goes back 30 years ago when I rehabbed the old Montgomery Ward paint stall  and put diamonds in it.  I did some M&W Western ware.  I did the old Woodstock building where Lulu's Outlet is.  My restaurant, Mezzamoon, who's as beautiful inside as is good the food, based on the reviews.  My current project at Chico Cheers.  So I am passionate about downtown.  I'm emotionally and financially invested.  And no one has more incentive than me to bring this to the beautiful picture that you see.  And the schedule I gave you is realistic.  We're right on schedule.  All the balconies have been manufactured and shipped to .  All right.  That's time.  I'm sure we'll have some questions.  Anyone?  David, I think it's a great looking project.  I just hope you get it done while I'm still alive.  Me too.  Me too.  Council Member Wenzel.  Do you have an estimated completion date?  Yes.  For the exterior, I think it's in your packet.  January 2025.  For occupancy of the units?  No.  That's for the exterior of the building.  I may not even do the occupancy of the units.  I'm not required to do it.  But the outside will look beautiful and nobody will know what's inside.  I mean, I will make the decision whether it makes sense to move forward with the inside.  There's no plans have been drawn yet.  No permits have been issued.  Our current permit deals with the exterior of the building, which is what everybody else sees.  All right.  Anyone else?  I have a few, more than a few.  I'll just throw out there.  David, thank you so much for your commitment to downtown and what you do.  And we're all looking forward to the building, you know, looking more beautiful.  And I understand through COVID and through everything going on, it's not easy for a lot of business owners right now.  So I know it's probably not been easy listening to this either.  But all in all, I think everybody just wants to see it get to an end point.  But thank you for your commitment to downtown.  Thank you.  And I think we're going to continue to do what you're doing.  And whether we end up with apartments or not, I hope we do, because I think it would be great for the community.  And certainly some professors or students or somebody would love to be able to just walk across the street and go to school.  So, anyways.  I promise you'll end up with a beautiful exterior building.  We just produced a big cling of the finished product that's right in the window for others to see so they see what's coming so they can be more patient.  Thank you.  Well, I understand the exterior of the building is our concern.  But the exterior is our concern.  I think it's a little troublesome that you say that there's a possibility of these never being dealt with or filled.  It's a reflection of the support I've gotten from some of the city bodies.  I understand.  You know, when this issue first came up and I brought it up, and I have a real concern.  You know, we didn't obviously do testing of the roof.  We didn't do structural testing per se.  But I think it's a little troublesome to say they went in and inspected the project to make sure that it was on track and there was no load testing of support beams or anything along those lines.  I think there's some concerns overall.  The people that have heard from the most during this process has been your current tenants.  I won't mention names, but probably 90% of them have come to me and spoken about problems that they have in their buildings and issues that they have in their buildings.  Not my current tenants.  You're talking tenants?  No, your tenants.  All your tenants.  All my tenants?  Almost every single one, yes.  So what I would like to get to is you came on July 17th.  I spoke with Action News and so did you.  And you told them that you'd have the windows in a couple of weeks.  That was July 17th.  The window frames are in.  No, the window frames were already there.  You said you'd have the windows.  Yes.  That was August.  That was July 17th.  It's August 20th.  And no windows.  There's a difference between the windows.  The concern I have, Mr. Halimi, is how do we believe you?  Is you look at the entrance to the various buildings, you look at where you have the old  Plutos, you know, Panama's.  Panama's is not mine.  That's a project that's been under construction for 15 years.  I'm the one that said no to them.  There's quite a few properties there's concerns about.  So we'll have to discuss if there's other ordinances.  I'll end my questions there unless anyone else has them.  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  So we will receive the report.  Mr. City Attorney, if we were to explore one of those other options, would we have to do that through an additional report?  Is that something we could explore through this?  If it wasn't agendized, I would say that we would bring it back for further discussion.  You can do it as an item to be, you know, a council member item that we can schedule for discussion in the next meeting.  Okay.  So a council member request would be better.  Yeah.  Okay.  Sounds good.  All right.  With that, we will move on to item six, reports and communications.  Following reports, we will move on to item six, reports and communications.  The reports and communications items are provided for council's information.  No action can be taken under this section of the agenda unless council agrees to include  it on a subsequent agenda.  City Manager's Report.  No report.  All right.  We have item 6.2, final pending map development director's approval.  And then item 6.3, councilmembers' requests.  I believe we have some.  I have one.  All right.  We'll start with councilmember Winslow and work our way the opposite way.  The people will recall.  The people will recall.  the city is in a settlement agreement that constrains our policy on homelessness with  anti-camping laws on the one side and shelter on the other.  And that has justified these discussions happening in private while understandably a lot of the  public have an interest in this and have wished that more of this took place in public.  We also recently announced that the city is seeking the liberty as a government to determine  a different approach to pull out of the Warren v. Chico settlement agreement which brings  up the question to a lot of members of the public and myself are there elements of the  settlement agreement that we want to keep like the pallet shelter.  This motion to get out of the settlement agreement is not guaranteed but the Warren settlement  will expire one day and I think that the best case that we can make that we deserve to the  judge that we deserve the liberty to determine our own approach is to be transparent about  what sort of approach we're looking to take.  We don't need to wait to have a plan and if there's planning going on the public should  be involved and aware of that process.  So I want to make a motion to have a discussion on Chico's policy on homelessness post Warren  settlement in particular pallet shelter, anti-camping laws, outreach and engagement and a place  of last resort in the event that no adequate shelter options exist.  I'll second that motion.  But I would.  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem ! my only caution is we are still bound by the settlement agreement and I think it' s premature to talk about what we plan on doing after it' s set aside because we don'  podem s set aside because we don' t know that. I don' t want you to get ahead of yourself and spend the resources     take a few steps and just the sweat to come up with these  come up with these ideas and  priorities before we even know  that the city has the ability to  come up with a plan. Right now  the plan is set forth under the  settlement agreement. To come  up with another plan before we  know what that means might be  premature.  to be sure I'  m talking about things  that are already city practice  and have been now for years but  whether we continue doing them  independent of a court mandate  mandate to the settlement  agreement. Not necessarily  anything new. I would say it  should be circumscribed that way  if people have new ideas but  it'  s about preserving  existing practices and about  expressing the city'  s intention to do that or not  to do that.  I stand by my  comments council. I think it  might be premature to do that  before we know the results of  whether a judge would set  aside the settlement agreement.  settlement agreement. The prior  the historical approach as we  have taken the anti camping  ordinances and things like that  that'  s true. Again we'  re still bound by the  settlement agreement and our  ordinances need to be consistent  with the settlement agreement  until that point I think it'  s premature. If council wishes  to do that I have no problem with  that but that'  s my concern.  I can tell you I will not take  have to wait until that federal  judge tells me straight to my  face that he would throw me in  jail if we discuss it in the  public. I will pass on that.  I don'  t know that  that stands here when we'  already applying to be out of  the settlement agreement.  I don'  t think we'  re out of it  yet. I wish but we'  re not.  based upon the city  attorney'  s advice and talking about  what we'  re going to do in  2027 right now when it'  s probably  going to be a different council  and we can'  t tie in  other council'  s hands I would probably pull  back my second and say although I  would love to have a public  conversation and talk about as  much as we can as soon as we  can and maybe that'  s after the rule  60 but based upon your advice  then I would not recommend that  we go that direction right now.  do we have a second?  I'  m sorry.  I'  All right council member  Tandon I believe you have one  too.  I would like to request that  internal affairs committee  explore additional rules or  ordinances to regulate our local  massage businesses. The committee  should also consider adopting  local zoning business licensing  requirements and reasonable health  and safety requirements for  massage establishments in  compliance with California  massage therapy council.  that motion I would definitely  second that'  s something I'  ve been talking to code of  enforcement for a couple of years  about so thank you.  All right Madam Clerk when you'  re ready.  .  I'  m sorry.  I'  m sorry.  m sorry.  Council member Bennett?  Yes.  Council member Tandon?  Yes.  Council member Van  Overbeek?  Yes.  Council member Winslow?  Yes.  Vice mayor Reynolds?  Aye.  Mayor Coolidge?  Aye.  carries six zero with one absence.  All right.  Anyone else?  Well the city attorney suggested  that we get an item on the agenda  to further discuss the blighted  buildings downtown in particular  Gowan and Second.  And we are looking at  I would like to put that on the agenda.  I'd gladly second that.  Can you make a friendly amendment that we make a blighted buildings for all uptown that we don't target one area?  Yep. Thank you.  All right. Madam Clerk, when you're ready.  Okay.  Okay.  Just a second.  Sorry.  All right.  Council Member Bennett?  Yes.  Council Member Tandon?  Yes.  Council Member Van Overbeek?  Yes.  Council Member Winslow?  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds?  Aye.  Mayor Coolidge?  Aye.  Carries 6-0 with one absence.  All right.  I've got a quick one.  Since we were so enthused talking about art, City of Chico has an artist that grew up here when he was young.  The town where he was born lived all of two years.  Which was Cody, Wyoming.  Actually, they named an entire mountain after him.  All we have is a bench.  That's Jackson Pollock, who is by far one of the most talented and brilliant abstract artists of the 1900s.  I think it would be a great project for our art commission to discuss it.  Bring it back to us so we can kick it off to the art commission and perhaps do some kind of celebration honoring this very excellent artist.  This esteemed artist who does not get enough recognition in Chico.  Second.  All right.  Council Member Bennett?  Yes.  Council Member Tandon?  Yes.  Council Member Van Overbeek?  Yes.  Council Member Winslow?  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds?  Aye.  Mayor Coolidge?  Aye.  Carries 6-0 with one absence.  All right.  Any further?  All right.  With that, we'll adjourn.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Thank you.
