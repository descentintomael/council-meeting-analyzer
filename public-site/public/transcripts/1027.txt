 Ready?  Ready?  All right.  Okay, we'll call the regular city council meeting to order,  and we will start with an invocation by Pastor Brian Myers.  All right, and he didn't send someone in his place,  so we will just observe a moment of silence then.  All right, thank you, and if you can please stand and join me in the Pledge of Allegiance.  All right.  I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America  and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God,  indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.  All right, welcome, everybody.  We will start with roll call.  Madam Clerk. Councilmember Bennett. Councilmember Brown. Here. Councilmember Morgan. Here. Councilmember O'Brien. Here. Councilmember Tandon.  Vice Mayor Reynolds.  And Mayor Coolidge.  All right, Speaker Card announcement.  Anyone wishing to address the council on any of the items listed on the agenda?  There's anğiniance released on the agenda released released released  released  released  released  released  released  released  released  released  released  released  released  released  released  released  released  released  or if less than two-thirds of members are present,  a unanimous vote of the members present  that there needs to take immediate action  and that the need for action came to the attention  of the local agency subsequent to the agenda being posted  as specified in subdivision A.  So if the council wishes to address this item,  it needs to first make two determinations,  which is that there's immediate need to take action,  and then that need arose after the posting of the agenda.  If approved by two-thirds, this item will be heard as item 5.5.  And just for clarification,  the council each has in front of them a posted,  basically like a posted addendum that lists that item,  and what it is, it's a supplemental appropriation  that would be item 5.5 if the council votes right now to hear it  and that the need arose after the posting  of the agenda.  Okay.  So we should have a...  I just need a motion.  Yeah, a motion.  And I believe they can be done together.  It's one motion.  Move to hear the item?  I would move to hear the item.  Second.  Okay, we have a motion on second.  Take the roll.  Council Member Bennett?  Yes.  Council Member Brown?  Aye.  Council Member Morgan?  Yes.  Council Member O'Brien?  Yes.  Council Member Tandon?  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds?  Aye.  Mayor Coolidge?  Aye.  Carry 7-0.  All right, so that'll be placed on the agenda as item 5.5,  and that is approval of a supplemental appropriation  budget modification number 2022 CM002,  and we can think on that one,  we'd probably take speaker cards.  If you can make a note,  take speaker cards through the announcement of the item  in the staff report,  just so in case anyone after hearing the staff report  wants to speak.  So I'd appreciate that.  All right.  So we'll move on to the consent agenda.  Prior to doing so,  I would ask folks to limit their comments to positive comments.  We don't make comments on,  you can make comments certainly on how we vote  and why we should vote,  but not on us personally.  We'd ask you to be respectful,  so no clapping, cheering,  booing or anything of that nature.  Otherwise, we will adjourn the meeting or recess the meeting.  So, all right, consent agenda,  all matters listed on the consent agenda are considered routine  and nature and can be acted in one motion.  Any council member disqualifications or no votes?  I'd like to pull item 2.2.  Okay.  We have a request to pull item 2.2.  Do we have any other?  All right.  Do we have any no votes?  With the exception of item 2.2.  All right.  We need a motion.  Oh, speakers.  Any speakers on the consent?  We do.  We have two speakers.  All right.  And they are Nicole Nava followed by Jeff Creed.  Okay.  All right.  So, three minutes.  Okay.  If your name is called second,  if you could stand at the ready  so we can save some time in between speakers,  we'd appreciate that.  Welcome.  Here I am ready to go.  Okay.  So, I am here on 2.3  because I definitely want to support downtown businesses  who need to basically have free egress  for customers in and out of their areas.  So, we're very grateful to theğini released  released released released  released released released  released released released  released released  released  released  released  released  released  released  released  released  released  released  released  people urinate and defecate in the alcove that is literally outside of their door. There's trash  there constantly. People sleep in there. People fornicate in there. All kinds of things happen  in the alcove. So rather than have that be like a de facto party area, this is a place of business.  And I feel like they have the right with the amount of, you know, rent they pay for that space  to feel like their employees can be safe, like the people that go to shop can be safe.  I myself went there and while I was there, this one particular time, a person had the lovely little  distinctive pipe out and the missus was down on the ground and injecting with a needle.  It is distressing. No one likes to see that. That shouldn't be happening. The folks should  be getting their help. And the way also that the businesses can be helped is  being able to protect those areas if that means having like a little gated area so that these  areas that aren't intended to really be a place to sit and everything. It literally is kind of a  pass through, but unfortunately it's kind of spacious in there because it's got a weird curve  to it. And I just feel like I've seen what these people have tried to do to keep it clean. It's  gross. And they have to spend a lot of personal time out there every day getting prepared.  And I feel like we should be more supportive as a city for that.  I think that it might even be a good thing for you to get city staff to go walk the town, walk up and down and identify the problem areas such as those where people do tend to congregate because it is recessed and give it time and attention so that it's not just a certain business owner.  This one is a very unique space though. I think there might be one other area that's even somewhat similar to that. So please do support and approve this request. Thank you for your time.  Thank you.  Excuse me. Let me get back up there. Jeff Creed.  Evening, Council. So I was more than happy to sit at home and let this meeting go by without saying a word. But somebody had the audacity to email me two weeks before Christmas asking for $5,000.  And that reminded me how out of touch you are as a council and how  out of touch as people are.  I think that's probably the politest thing since the mayor wants us to try and be polite, even though he has no right to ask that.  You should check with the city attorney before you try and pass, push that agenda forward.  So this, when I talk about out of touch, back in June or July, you guys had a meeting and you allocated a bunch of money to fluff up buildings downtown that are in disrepair.  But you're going to charge these people, as I understand it, a pretty hefty permit fee.  So you don't enforce the law.  You don't protect their property from, well, we just heard it, right?  If you walk by there in the morning, you can smell it and see it.  So as a city, you don't do the job you're chartered to do as a city.  And then you're going to turn around and penalize the people who are trying to fill your coffers with sales tax by charging them a,  huge fee for a permit to protect their property.  And it really gets under my nerves because I've been downtown in the morning, early in the morning,  and this property owner is out there pressure washing or having somebody pressure wash their building to get all the mildew and spider webs off it,  make it look clean and presentable.  When you walk around downtown, all these other building owners that you want to give this money to aren't taking care of their business.  They're not stepping forward.  And you're...  It just drives me nuts how backwards this idea is.  You're going to spend money to go fluff up businesses who don't take care of their business, their property.  And then when property owners do want to try and do something, you're going to charge them money to do that?  I don't understand it.  Somebody explain the reasoning of that to me.  It just makes no sense.  You have one person trying to help downtown, and you're going to penalize them with a permit?  Why don't you take some of that money from June that you didn't want public input on and turn around and pay some of these fees for businesses that want to clean up their properties and protect Chico and make Chico nice, make Chico pleasant to walk around?  I'll bet none of you invited your friends from out of town, like I said a few months ago, and walked them around downtown.  I'll bet none of you invited your family downtown to walk up and down the streets at night and reported back what you saw.  I'll bet none of you invited your family downtown to walk up and down the streets at night and reported back what you saw in real time.  I'll be back.  Thank you.  He's our last speaker on the consent agenda.  All right.  So we'll take item 2.2 separately.  So everything besides 2.2, do we have a motion?  I'll make a motion to approve.  All right.  We have a motion and a second.  Take the roll.  Okay.  Just a second.  Okay.  And that is a motion by...  Council Member O'Brien, seconded by Council Member Morgan to approve the consent agenda as read with item 2.2 removed for further discussion,  which included ordinance of the City of Chico amending Title 16R of the City of Chico Municipal Code  to adopt and amend by reference the California Building Code Appendix O and California Residential Code Appendix 10  relating to emergency housing standards.  That was final reading and adoption.  Council Member Bennett?  Yes.  Council Member Brown?  Aye.  Council Member Morgan?  Yes.  Council Member...  O'Brien?  Yes.  Council Member Tandon?  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds?  Aye.  Mayor Coolidge?  Aye.  Carry 7-0.  All right.  Item 2.2.  Council Member Brown?  Great.  I just have a few questions for staff.  In the staff report, it was mentioned that these budget modifications will have no impact  on the 2021-2022 fiscal year budget.  What will be the impacts to the budget for future years?  And I'm speaking specifically to substituting the police sergeant position for a police officer  position within the Chico Police Department.  Good evening.  I can try to tackle this one.  I believe Barbara Martin quoted our Deputy Director of Finance that that impacted cost  would be anywhere from $15,000 to $30,000 depending upon the specialty pays assigned  to the officer.  Okay.  Great.  Every year following this one, correct?  Correct.  Thank you.  And this, I believe this question is for Chief Madden.  In the future, is it your expectation or hope that the police officer position that's currently  being replaced with the police sergeant position?  Is that a good idea?  That's vacant, would be reopened as a police officer position?  Well, this police sergeant is actually a patrol sergeant.  So as we had to get creative when our really low staffing levels, we had to get creative  with our shifts.  And so we got rid of some shifts to put more officers on the street for the higher volume  of calls.  Mm-hmm.  As we continue to build back.  The...  One of the shifts, noon to 10 team, which is our busiest time, we're going to be staffing  that again to be able to provide that level of service.  So with the sergeant, it still boots on the ground.  It's still a patrol sergeant.  They're still out in the field, but they're in a supervisory role.  So realistically, no, because that is a patrol position.  We just needed to be a supervisor as we lost all those positions in the past.  Okay.  Great.  Thank you.  And I just have one more question for you, Chief Madden.  In your report, you referenced that in police services, the sergeant should supervise five  to seven officers per shift and noted that we currently have up to nine officers being  supervised by nearly every patrol sergeant to make that case.  I did a quick search online and forgive my ignorance, but I was just curious kind of  what you're referencing.  I couldn't find any industry standards specifically related to that, to staffing levels.  Well, for me, it's my experience in training through all the positions that I've worked  for.  When you're out on the street handling calls and then also having to monitor the calls  and show up and supervise these types of calls and critical incidents, you really can't do  that with nine.  It's not manageable.  It's not safe.  And for me, in almost 30 years of this job, my experience is five to seven is about the  max of what you want to do.  So again, although we're talking about these positions, it also is because we've had to  modify our positions.  We've had to modify our schedules to meet the demands of public service.  So this is another avenue of trying to get back to more manageable shifts and putting  out the officers at the most optimum times.  Thank you.  Appreciate that.  That's all I had.  All right.  Do we have a motion on item 2.2?  I'll make a motion to approve, and I agree with everything that Chief Madden said.  Spanning control is extremely important in this profession, and I support this wholeheartedly.  Second.  All right.  We have a motion and a second.  Madam Clerk, take the roll.  Council Member Bennett.  Yes.  Council Member Brown.  Aye.  Council Member Morgan.  Yes.  Council Member O'Brien.  Yes.  Council Member Tandon.  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds.  Aye.  Mayor Coolidge.  Aye.  Carries 7-0.  All right.  Item 3, business from the floor.  Members of the public may address the council at any time on a matter not already listed  on the agenda with comments being limited to three minutes or as determined on the number  of speakers.  The council cannot take any action at this meeting on a request made under this section  of the agenda.  We have seven.  Okay.  Three minutes.  Okay.  And I'm going to call two names, and if you can go ahead and line up.  First speaker is Stephen Hutton, followed by James West.  Good evening, City Council.  My name is James West.  I've been with the City of Chico for 14 years in the right-of-way department.  I'm here with my fellow workers.  I would like to ask for your support.  As you know, we are in bargaining with the City.  We do not get to meet with you in closed session like City Manager and HR Director have the  opportunity to do.  This is the impact freezing wages for the last 12 years.  Our members love this city and are proud of the work we do to keep this city running.  Unfortunately, most of us cannot afford to live and work here.  This means we live in different cities and we have different conditions.  and results in us not being able to be a part of the community we serve.  Our kids don't go to school here.  Our families don't get to participate in the community  when we live 30 minutes or an hour away.  Our kids don't get to enjoy the tree lighting ceremony that we set up.  We want to be a part of this community,  but without the city investing in us, that's not going to happen.  Thank you for your time.  James West, followed by James Irvin.  Hello.  Thank you guys for giving us the time to come speak with you.  I'm Stephen Hutton, kind of a new guy.  I've been with the Chico Public Works Department for the past two years now.  My experience here has been bittersweet.  Sweet is in perfect timing to join the city.  A lot of changes, a lot of moving parts.  It's been a lot of fun things to be a part of,  but bitter because of the lack of incentives to stay and work with you.  At current time, an individual with certain experience such as ours  is being offered twice the wage in Paradise, Orland, and Oroville.  I myself cannot afford a house here in the city limits  at the current wage that I'm working with.  I'm forced to live outside of the city,  and in addition to added fuel costs,  and travel time,  this challenge is constantly conflicting me.  Because I need to provide a good lifestyle for my family,  but I love Chico and the coworkers that I've gotten to know.  Please support us in our efforts to gain the needed support  for all of us to continue to offer the people of Chico outstanding services.  Thank you.  James Irvin, followed by Nicole Nava.  Good evening, council members.  My name is James Irvin.  I've been an employee of the city of Chico for 15 years now.  I started off in the parks department.  I spent five years there.  I moved over to the road crew.  Spent four years there.  Spent a few years as a parking meter technician.  And currently I'm assigned to the traffic safety division.  I maintain and repair the street lights and traffic signals.  There are two of us that do this in town.  There are over 100 of us.  There are over 100 traffic signals.  There's over 7,000 street lights.  There's plenty of work for us.  We do important and critical work on a daily basis.  We are the ones that fix intersections when it's in flash  or when someone drives through a pole and it's not working at all.  Three times in the last month,  a drunk driver has hit a street light pole and knocked it down in the middle of the street.  And we've had to come out and secure it at night.  One time last month, a complete intersection was taken out.  An intersection controller was taken out.  We worked through the night to get that up and running to keep the public safe.  Other things we do to keep the citizens of Chico safe include picking up needles,  filling potholes, repairing street signs, inspecting and maintaining playground equipment,  and cleaning the streets.  Repairing cracked sidewalks and lifted sidewalks,  keeping the roads clean and free of debris,  picking up leaves, and cleaning up after accidents and storms.  One of the other things we do is we clean up in and around homeless camps.  The work we do should be considered essential services.  For example, in October, the major storm we had in October,  it practically shut down our city.  On that Sunday, we had 12,  12,  12 employees that worked no less than eight hours.  Many of them worked up to 16 hours into the night.  We kept the streets cleared of trees and flooded roads.  The cleanup continued for an entire week,  using 16 members from our crew,  working every day for the week.  I'm speaking to you tonight not only for myself,  but for all my coworkers who go above and beyond  to keep this town safe.  I think it is important that everyone is aware that we are a group,  and we all feel the same way,  and we are motivated and unified,  and we are prepared to do what it takes to get ourselves made whole.  Thank you for your time.  If there's no questions,  we have to work early in the morning,  so we're all going to exit.  We don't mean disrespect.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Nicole Nava, followed by Jeff.  Jeff Creed.  Good evening again.  So that's some...  Nicole, why don't you hold on a minute?  Sorry.  No, no, it's all good.  Don't forget to turn in that homework.  All right.  All right. [inaudible]  Thanks.  Thanks.  Right. Well, seeing all that makes me think about, you know, this ecosystem that's our city.  And so I was going to touch on some things, but what we have there, people feeling like they're  not getting what they're worth and keeping up with the cost of living is indicative of our inability  to stimulate the economy to the point that it needs to in Chico to sustain these good,  honorable people working really hard. And I firsthand saw what they did in that storm and  many others. And they're unbelievable and they do great work. And I hope that they  are recognized for that in a way that's meaningful. So one thing I just want to remind you guys,  you got that, you tasked the city with looking at a letter to the state to see about maybe getting  us some help. I'm hoping at one of these upcoming agendas to see a progress report on how that's  coming along.  And,  you know, we need mental health treatment. We need drug treatment. And I keep saying that I'm a  proponent. I'm a supporter of Everhart village. I am contrary to popular belief, not a far right  extremist as some are trying to paint that picture to be. And that's why I want to highlight that I  have tried these efforts. And I do think it's important that the homeless and the house people  in this community that need treatment are able to receive that treatment. So what I want to talk  about is, you know, the,  we need to be,  we need to be proactive. We're coming up on we're going to have some storm. We're winners coming right?  Are we looking at that? What is going to happen? Are we looking at the county to figure  out something? Because the city cannot keep entertaining this or those poor men and women who are  marching out of here? Just now? Won't ever see the fruits for their labor and be able to help their  families? And so the onus has to be? Maybe you guys? Pushing at the county? To go? Are you making some  plans for winter here. We got a lot of people floundering outside. You know, you're under an  injunction. I get it, but there are measurable steps that can be done. And all the people that  like to have people continue to be able to remain outside, maybe those people need to stand up and  start thinking about what they're going to do about it. I will say that I came down here last  week. I was super excited, got back from my vacay, thought I want to check out the ice rink. So I  pull up my car right over here across from you guys. I go with the intent of going across to  film at the ice rink and encourage people and literally turn my head to go do the parking  meter thing. And I look out and a man is peeing right there, right in front of our chambers.  And then I get out and I think, you know what, I'm going to film all this trash right around  our house, the people's house. And then I get aggressively, I'm not even kidding you,  this man charged me. I did nothing, said nothing to him, charged at me, literally started throwing  food at me. I'm like, I'm going to go to the ice rink and encourage people. And then I get  in trash at me and verbally assaulting me with the most disgusting words. And I was terrified. I  was, but I did, I completed my loop, but I just want you to know that's unacceptable. We need  help here. Jeff Creed followed by Jessica Giannola.  So April 2017, I showed up to a council meeting  with a problem.  A solution. In fact, a solution that's so widespread, it's could be standard practice,  could be called standard practice across the state. And the property that drove me to come  to council is still almost as bad as it was then, if not worse in some areas.  I don't understand it. When I look at the way you run the city, and I know people say I have no idea  what's going on, but it's pretty obvious.  When you're sitting in the bleachers, what's going on a lot more apparent than to the guy  hiking the ball and getting his head shoved into the ground by the defensive nose guard, right?  Monday morning quarterbacks are right for a reason, because they  have the distance to sit back and see what's going on.  Commander O'Brien said he knew how to manage or how to best to police Chico.  How many murders have we had in Chico this year? Is it a record?  I'll bet it's an all-time high record, even from the 90s when, you know,  murder was really high in the 90s, right? But I'll bet we hit an all-time high record this year.  I couldn't find accurate numbers, but I remember at least a half dozen, right?  So what can you do? You guys can do a lot, but you're stuck on doing things the way they've  always been done.  And you're stuck on doing things the way they've always been done.  You're stuck in the mud, and you don't see that if you're trying to swim in the mud, you're not going to get anywhere.  You need somebody to throw you a rope. You need to float out of it.  You can't stand up and walk out of mud. You need to find a different way.  And that may be a bad analogy, but it sticks true.  What you're doing will never bring Chico to a clean, safe, prosperous city.  Never. It isn't going to happen.  And it's obvious as all day when you stand back and look at it.  There's tons of bits.  There's tons of business knowledge out there on the internet.  Tons of YouTubers who run million-dollar businesses, and they explain it very clearly.  And you guys are failing to pay attention.  Just like Mr. Morgan's over there playing on his phone because he doesn't like me.  Because I don't know anything.  Well, I know this.  If you don't get behind a sales tax, and you don't promote it, even though it is a horrible thing,  you're not doing what every other successful city in California has done.  And if you're not going to do what successful people are doing, guess what?  You're going to continue to fail.  Just like you have for the last five years I've been coming here,  trying all different kinds of ways to get attention, to get you to see,  get the people sitting up there to see what's going on.  Because you're objectively failing as a city.  What did the vice mayor say when she came back?  I should think about what she had to say.  Jessica Giannola, followed by Julie Threat.  Council, gosh, there seems to be a common theme,  and it's really our council really not hearing or seeing the reality of us out here.  So many voices that I agree with.  We don't always agree on things, but this one we agree on.  One thing I'd like to point out for the city,  the way the view,  the way the view of county meetings run,  they don't exclude people from commenting.  They actually invite people at the end of the whole thing, an item.  If anyone hasn't signed up, then Conley goes,  does anyone else from the public would like to say anything?  And he invites them to.  So I think that we should adopt that instead of excluding people from having comment.  Zooms are helpful too.  The ice rink across the street.  So we all have our different experiences, right?  There's people that are unhoused that were probably living over there  because they have no idea what's going on.  They have nowhere else to live.  They are around this building and I bring them food.  I bring them food.  And so the conversations with them are a lot more pleasant.  I don't know.  Everyone has different experiences, but they've always been pleasant.  And we discuss this chain link fence around the plaza that nobody can go into unless they pay money.  That's absurd.  So direction is really important.  Our housing crisis.  I don't know if you know, but like almost 80 percent of Californians,  we have a lot of housing in our city.  And we need multi-family housing.  And recently, Governor Newsom passes SB 9, SB 10.  That's to help have two units per property.  And some cities are already fighting back.  It's not even January 1st yet when that takes place.  But the city of Chico, really the city of Paradise, all of our cities around us, the entire state, in fact,  needs to focus on including providing more housing.  And that's what we're doing.  That's why we have a housing crisis.  We don't have enough.  We don't have enough that's affordable.  We don't have enough, period.  So we have to make it.  We have to build it.  We have to allow it.  We have to support it.  And that's where the city comes in.  That's not a county thing.  That's not a state thing.  That's a city.  City zoning.  City decides that.  And so I looked at our map, our zoning map, and most of our map is yellow.  Yellow is our one.  That's single family units.  We need to have a whole lot more of that brown and beige in there.  We need to have more family units available.  That's the only way we're going to build up.  We have to build up, get more people in housing.  We don't have them around here.  They're not going to the bathroom in the street because, you know, we don't have bathrooms for people to go in.  They've got to go somewhere.  They don't have it.  They're going on our sidewalks.  We can't blame them for something we're not providing.  It's a city issue.  We can do it.  We have to do it.  If we don't do it, this is what we keep doing week after week, month after month, year after year.  And the city, the employees are working so hard.  I cannot believe they haven't had a raise in how long.  They were so respectful.  Can you imagine the fear they'd have of losing their jobs just coming before you and saying, please, give us enough to live?  Thank you.  Julie Threed is our last speaker.  I'm going to try to slow down.  First of all, I didn't know that the city was going to have a lot of people in housing.  I was going to bring my family down to the ice rink and my 80-year-old mother, she loved it.  She was watching everybody fall.  So we went downtown.  And I was against it, Sean, at first.  But I'm like, he did the right thing.  He made the right vote.  So congratulations on that.  Okay.  There was a headline in the paper last Thursday.  And it said hotel shelter program ends early.  And I first thought, oh, my gosh, what did the city do now?  And this is how I interpreted the article.  Five people were evicted from the motel.  They were put into quarantine from the virus.  Because the service provider who was paid to put them up there under a program a local service provider was paid to develop in a partnership with a regional service provider who was paid by the county to administer received funding under a program that was mandated by the state received funding from the federal government because of the virus.  Couldn't manage their funds and refused to apply for more.  So five people get sent back out on the street with a tent, a good luck and a business card with a number to call if the tent is defective.  I know there's a lot more to the story.  But what I do know is my family is in quarantine.  So they released the released the released the released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released  think people into housing would not lose sight of these five people before the cycle starts over.  So I look forward to getting the updates from the city manager and you all about the  about the pallet homes and I really ask that the service providers and the media start sharing  those positive stories because they're out there. I had to look really far to find the positive  stories about those 26 people that got into homes. Thank you. She was our last speaker.  All right thank you very much. We don't have any public hearings so we'll move on to the regular  agenda item five. 5.1 is the climate action commission final appointments and I'll turn  that over to you. Madam Clerk. Thank you. Thank you Mayor Coolidge and Council. What is before  you tonight is the final appointment process for the 2020 recruitment that occurred in November  and because of the the procedure that's established by our formal policy  each council member who was elected or was appointed to fill an elected position  in the 2020 election got to nominate one individual. They nominate the individual. It  requires the vote of the full council in order to confirm those appointments those individual  appointments. In addition we asked for nominations for one additional position that really has less  than two years. I mean it really only has about 14 months left on that term  and we're still in the process of doing that. So I'm going to turn it over to you.  Madam Clerk. Madam Clerk. Madam Clerk. Madam Clerk. Madam Clerk. Madam Clerk. Madam Clerk. Madam Clerk. Madam Clerk. Madam Clerk. Madam Clerk. Madam Clerk. Madam Clerk. Madam Clerk. Madam Clerk. Madam Clerk. Madam Clerk. Madam Clerk. Madam Clerk. Madam Clerk. Madam Clerk. Madam Clerk. Madam Clerk. Madam Clerk. Madam Clerk. Madam Clerk. Madam Clerk. Madam Clerk. Madam Clerk. Madam Clerk. Madam Clerk. Madam Clerk. Madam Clerk. Madam Clerk. Madam Clerk. Madam Clerk. Madam Clerk. Madam Clerk. Madam Clerk. Madam Clerk. Madam Clerk. Madam Clerk. Madam Clerk. Madam Clerk. Madam Clerk. Madam Clerk. Madam Clerk. Madam Clerk. Madam Clerk. Madam Clerk. Madam Clerk. Madam Clerk. Madam Clerk. Madam Clerk. Madam Clerk. Madam Clerk. Madam Clerk. Madam Clerk. Madam Clerk. Madam Clerk. Madam Clerk. Madam Clerk. Madam Clerk. Madam Clerk. Madam Clerk. Madam Clerk. Madam Clerk. Madam Clerk. Madam Clerk. Madam Clerk. Madam Clerk. Madam Clerk. Madam Clerk. Madam Clerk  appointments and then we'll handle the vacancy separately.  All right. You said we had no speakers on the side. Okay. So, um,  yeah,  I'll move to confirm the individual appointments as, um,  as made by other council members. I'll second that.  All right. Motion on second. Okay. When you're ready.  And so just for anyone listening, um,  on television or through the streaming video, which is working tonight,  by the way, um, those appointments would be Ashley Kohler,  Joshua Pierce and by Kirk Kaufman and Brian Kress,  and they will serve the remaining of the four year term. And I,  that'll be like three little over three years and those positions.  So for the fifth position, this was a vacancy that was unscheduled.  Uh,  we are feeling it.  You have a ballot in front of you or at the last,  one of the last appointments, um, you have,  you can see the list of people who move forward.  Each council member got to nominate one person to move forward who hadn't  already been selected for an individual appointment.  Do we need to take a vote on that last motion?  You know what? And it's on my screen. I should have looked at it. I should have looked at it. Council member Bennett. Thank you. Yes. Council member Brown. Council member Morgan. Council member O'Brien. Council member Tandon.  Vice mayor Reynolds. Yes.  Mayor Coolidge that carries seven zeros.  Now we're onto the fifth position. I apologize.  Um,  so what would council like to do?  You do have Lauren Kohler who came forward,  uh,  with one nomination,  Kirk Mumford received three,  Mary Murphy will Waldorf received two.  And so there,  there is a ballot in front of you.  If council wants to use,  the balloting procedure,  feel free to do that.  And then if it's still three,  three or a tied vote,  um,  appointments require a vote of four council members in order to be  appointed.  So I'll leave it up to the council to decide how you want to  handle that.  All right.  Are you going to,  so if we have two,  are we going to have to move forward if,  and in fact it comes down to two or how do you want to  do it?  Do you need several rounds?  I have prepared extra,  ballots in case.  Okay.  Gotcha.  Hoping that it would jinx it and it'll be done on the first  one.  All right.  So if you want to just pass those down and we'll gather those  ballots up and we'll tabulate if you,  if we can take just a couple of minutes to do that.  Okay.  So we're going to wrap up the hearing.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Thank you, Council, for your patience.  So, Kirk Mumford received four votes,  and Mary Murphy Waldorf received three.  So Kirk Mumford will be appointed to fill that vacancy.  Again, we're going to be doing another round of recruitments  next November and starting this process all over again.  But in the meantime, the Climate Action Commission  has now been finalized.  And because it's a balloting process,  we don't need a confirming motion on that.  So I will notify all of the applicants  who are grateful for all of them.  They really did stay involved for a long time  trying to get through this process.  So we'll get through it again in 2022.  Yeah, and just jumping on that bandwagon,  I think it is great that we had...  Sometimes we don't always have the recruitments that we need,  and it is good that we do have folks involved,  and we really appreciate you doing that and being a part of it.  And we ask you to...  ...not give up and to come back,  because that obviously is something that's considered too.  The more we see it, the more likely we are maybe to appoint you  to something in the future based upon that.  So it does take a lot of folks to make our city run,  and those committees are important work that we need to do.  And we do keep their applications on file,  and we reach out to them when we do a new recruitment.  And if, you know, in case there happens to be a vacancy,  then we will reach out to them to ask them to come back.  And be considered.  Great.  Okay.  Thank you.  Thanks again.  And then we'll move on to item 5.2,  presentation regarding 2021 redistricting and chiefly city council districts.  Mr. Orme.  Sure, Honorable Mayor, members of the council.  It's a pleasure to be here this evening and introduce you to ARTA Demographics.  I know that Steena is getting the PowerPoint prepared for our presenter tonight.  But just as a wrap around on this, earlier this year,  the city council...  Thank you.  ...asked city staff to go out for an RFP for redistricting services,  just after doing it the year prior.  And it's kind of one of those situations that most cities don't want to find themselves in,  but we did it.  City Attorney's Office did a great job of getting the RFP out there.  We did receive three responses to that.  After going through the process, ARTA Demographics came out on top.  They were the most responsive entity to this.  They are out of Southern California.  And I will tell you that both Jason Mills and Claudio Gallegos,  were wonderful to dialogue with.  And Claudio is here tonight.  And thank you for allowing the city clerk, the city attorney, and myself to participate in that process.  We hope this will be a smooth process.  Seemingly, we see activities elsewhere with redistricting.  And I know it can be controversial, but we hope to make it as smooth as engaging  as the city council desires for the public to have in it.  So with that, I'd like to introduce Claudio to come up and introduce you to ARTA.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you very much for hiring us.  My name is Claudio Gallegos.  I'm the principal demographer for ARTA Demographics.  So we went ahead and prepared an introductory PowerPoint for you all this evening.  So go ahead and I'll get the slideshow going.  So a little bit about us.  So we are an introduction to ARTA Demographics.  We are a California-based full-service mapping and analytics firm.  We have managed both redistricting and transition to district process for multiple jurisdictions,  including cities and school districts.  Got our start more on the advocacy side.  Now we're transitioned over to the official side.  Myself, I'm the senior demographer, Claudio Gallegos.  I have drawn maps.  I'm currently in use in several cities.  I've worked in many cities and school districts in California, primarily Orange County,  which is where we are based out of, Santa Ana, California.  And we'll assist the city and the public in creating new districts based on the 2020 census  in compliance with all federal, state, and local laws.  We will also create a tool for the public to draw maps and submit to the city and collect public testimony,  throughout the redistricting process.  So we assist in the public input portion.  So quick overview of some of the federal rules.  Districts must be equal population  with an allowable deviation up to 10%  from the lowest populated to the highest populated district.  Federal Voting Rights Act of 1965 standards  must be considered and used for minority protected class  populations, those are Latino, African American,  Asian American, Pacific Islander, and Native American.  No racial gerrymandering, although race can be used  in conjunction with other factors.  So now there are some state rules as well.  In 2018 or 2019,  the ABHR, the ABHR, the ABHR, the ABHR, the ABHR,  released an released an released an released an released an  released an released an released an  released an released an released an  released an released an released an  released an released an released an  released an released an released an  released an released an released an So I mentioned that. They set a minimum of four public hearings that every city must have before even considering  released an released an released an  released an released an released an  released an released an released an  released an released an released an  And in fact, one of those hearings must be held either on a weekend or after 6 p.m. to allow people who may be work during the day to have an opportunity to attend.  Draft maps must be publicly available for review at least six days before a public hearing that they're going to be introduced.  Criteria to consider when drawing new districts are geographic continuity, undivided neighborhoods and communities of interest, easily identifiable district boundaries, meaning keeping them on, you know, main streets, freeway, river, main boundaries.  They try to avoid going through small neighborhoods.  And district compactness discourages bypassing one group or community of interest.  To get to a more distant one.  And no targeting of an incumbent or political opponent to try and, quote unquote, draw them out or into a specific district.  So it sets specific rules to avoid gerrymandering.  So communities of interest.  What is a community of interest?  Community of interest is a neighborhood or geographically defined group with shared interests or characteristics that could be affected by district boundaries.  Example.  School attendance area.  So these are the current boundaries of the Chico City Council that were drawn recently.  So per the 2020 census, the population of Chico was 103,165.  So you have joined the club of cities in California that are over 100,000.  And this includes the Chapman and Mulberry annexations, which have 1,000.  And the first part of the census is that the total population is 14,342 people.  Median population for the seven districts is 14,738.  Districts do need to be adjusted to be within a 10% deviation with potential future growth factor in.  This will be the first part of our job is to determine which districts are, if there is over a 10% deviation.  And determine the adjustment.  And then we'll move on.  Going forward.  Federal guidelines allow for up to 10% deviation with a plus or minus 5% of the median of the deviation strongly encouraged.  So you don't have to go exactly five below five above the median, but it's strongly encouraged.  You can go say 3% as the lowest populated district while the highest populated is 7% above the median.  So it is legal.  But they encourage you to do that.  And then you can go ahead and try and stick to this 5% number.  So ideally, district population should be no less than 14,001 and no more than 15,475.  So with that, I will take any questions.  Next question.  Council Member Martin.  Have you been a district director for a member of Congress?  Yes.  I was the former district director for Congressman Lucrea.  And do you think you can draw unbiased maps?  Of course.  You understand what I'm asking?  Yes.  I know he is.  He also is known as one of the most moderate Democrats in Congress.  Yeah.  Thank you for the presentation.  Can you kind of just outline for the public what your typical process for engagement and getting public input is?  I know that we'll have some say in that.  But love to hear from you.  Right.  So obviously, we take direction from you, the city council, on how you want to go about it.  We have two different methods.  One, we create an online tool that people can use.  It's a PDF map where they can download, draw on there, you know, how they see the city map.  And we provide an Excel sheet with all the census block groups with the population, ethnic data, citizen voting age population.  Because that's also determinant when it comes to Voting Rights Act districts.  And work with them to submit maps.  And if the council wishes, we also have a GIS tool that can be used for them to submit maps.  We encourage them to put their name to it.  Because while we will allow anonymous maps, if there's an issue where they're out of compliance, we would have to, you know,  it wouldn't be allowed to be considered.  This would allow us to contact them and maybe work with them to get it into compliance.  We definitely want as many people to have a say as possible.  Great.  I love both of those tools.  I'm actually a little bit more curious on the side of getting the public involved in conversations about communities of interest and things like that.  Yes.  Previously, we went through this process.  We had several community workshops, for example.  I'm just curious if that's part of the work that you do.  Yes.  So we will have, you know, like one month.  We do community workshops that are outside of the four public hearings.  So it allows, you know, we go through, have a separate PowerPoint teaching them how to use the tool.  We'll be there or, you know, if maybe it can be, you know, virtual but can help them, talk them through the tool.  If they have any questions, be there to answer it.  All right.  Further questions?  So I've got one.  So how important are existing lines to the process?  So what we do, the first portion will be going through each one and seeing are they within the 10%?  We'll let you know whether it is or isn't or if certain districts have to grow, some have to shrink.  Did an area have more growth in the last ten years?  And then you go from there.  You do have to put a focus on the process.  So what we do is we have to make sure that the fair maps act has to hold your four hearings.  But should it be within the 10%, you would be allowed to introduce that map back into consideration.  Should it be outside of that 10%, the first version that we would introduce when we submit or when we present our own draft maps is what we call right sizing map.  That basically does the smallest amount of adjustments to get you within that 10% as possible.  Okay.  I'll weigh my opinions for later on the past maps.  But there was certainly a lot of community opinion on the past maps in terms of how they were drawn, specifically targeting and gerrymandering as well.  And you say that you guys obviously don't want racial gerrymandering.  We don't want any gerrymandering.  So ideally.  Okay.  Thank you.  Thank you.  So, okay.  Do we have any further questions from you all?  I do.  Okay.  So just to piggyback on that question, is it a possibility then that our new map could look completely different than this one?  While you say the first map you bring back would be small adjustments to this, will we be given different options as well?  Correct.  So there's, you know, we'll take input from, you know, at the community hearings from speakers.  But also the council is welcome to give input.  We'll give any input of how certain ideas that they may think is a community of interest.  And we will draw a map from there.  So it could either change drastically or just do what I've mentioned, the right sizing.  So it's completely up to the city council which direction you want to ultimately go in.  Great.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  All right.  Do we have any?  Thank you very much.  You're welcome.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  No public comment?  No.  Wow.  It's almost shocking.  All right.  So from there, and that's just no action required obviously, so we don't have to move forward with that, just informational.  So item 5.3, confirmation of public works, Director of Engineering, Mr. Orme.  Yes, honorable mayor, vice mayor, members of the council, thank you very much.  As you know, you have the pleasure of confirming department directors.  As we bring them on board.  And I have the pleasure of introducing you to our new public works director over engineering.  And unfortunately, you're not going to be able to meet her tonight.  And I'll tell you why in a moment.  It was her first good decision that she made, not being here, because she's under the weather.  And so I appreciated her not bringing her under the weather into this room.  And so I thank Leanne Sutton for doing that.  But pursuant to state law, I'm going to read into the record the recommendations.  And I'm going to read through the recommendations.  So the first recommendation is that the city manager is proposing to enter into an employment agreement with Leanne Sutton as the public works director of engineering.  And the city manager is proposing to appoint Leanne Sutton with an annual salary of $168,000.  I am recommending the city council confirm this appointment of Leanne Sutton as public works director over engineering.  I'll tell you, the city went through recruitment.  We used a recruiting firm.  It was a nationwide recruitment.  And through that process, Leanne shined as the number one candidate all the way through.  And we are very, very grateful that she desires to be in Chico.  I'll tell you, she's got a tremendous amount of work having been conducted over a number of different agencies, starting down in San Diego, where she had a lot of work down in San Diego, going up to the city of Carlsbad, going to Monterey County, and the last stop was in Manteca.  So I look forward to welcoming her.  And I know you probably do as well.  I know the department director is looking forward to it, especially Bob.  And so thank you, Bob, for your time.  And thank you, Leanne, for your dedicated service.  You are definitely greatly valued.  And Bob will have an opportunity to overlap for at least a week with Leanne.  And then she'll kick it off running at the beginning of the new year.  But she'll be here at least before the end of the year for a week to work with Bob.  And then she'll be back in to kick off the new year.  With that, I request confirmation.  And thank you very much.  All right.  And so Bob's last day is?  He knows.  .  End of next week.  Wow.  All you will be missed.  Thank you so much for filling the interim.  Certainly been an excellent job.  I've heard nothing but positive, fantastic praise upon everything that you've done.  Thank you.  And I just want to thank the city manager for giving me the opportunity and let you know that I think Chico is really nice.  I mean, it's really a nice place.  I've worked in a lot of places and I've worked in a lot of different places.  I love the downtown.  You guys have just a great city.  Thank you so much.  Can I make one other note?  Yes, please.  Bob said that.  I will tell you, I would not want to be on the other side of the table with Bob interviewing you.  It was fantastic to watch the final round of interviews.  Just so you know, do you need somebody to be on the interview panel?  I know he's going to go try to retire.  But, yeah, he's fantastic.  So there you go.  All right.  Do we have any public comment on this side?  No.  All right.  Entertain a motion.  I'll move to it.  Do we have a motion?  Do we have a motion?  So we're going to move to it.  Do we have a motion?  So we're going to move to it.  Do we have a motion?  So we're going to move to it.  Do we have a motion?  So we're going to move to it.  Do we have a motion?  So we're going to move to it.  Do we have a motion?  So we're going to move to it.  Do we have a motion?  So we're going to move to it.  Do we have a motion?  So we're going to move to it.  Do we have a motion?  So we're going to move to it.  Do we have a motion?  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you. synopsis of where we're at. You know I get a question all the time which is we originally had 29. We did. We had three fall out because they got denied. We did. Well four but we put one back in.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you. We did. We had three fall out because they got denied. We did. Well four but we put one back in. Right. So have any others dropped out or are we at 25? We're at 24 moving forward. Okay so one  we at? 25? We're at 24 moving forward. Okay. So one other dropped out. Well, we had 29 and then  we had the six, but not everybody appealed. So we have currently got 24 applications moving  forward. So in January, we'll have the interviews for those applicants. So 24 interviews. And that's  a process that doesn't, that takes place internally, correct? Can you talk about that process a little  The interview process? Yeah. Yes. So city staff and our consultants, which is HDL,  will be handling the interviews with the applicants from the cannabis. So they'll come in,  it'll be about a 45 minute interview for the applicants. And then afterwards, scoring will  be completed by city staff and then reports will come back after the interviews from HDL  regarding how all of the,  applicants scored. Okay. Yeah. I've just had a lot of constituents concerned about various  locations. So they've been asking me how the process works and goes through. Yes. And then  all those locations are posted on the city website for the applicants that are going through the  interview process. Okay. Perfect. Is there a chance for the public to weigh in during that process?  There's a chance for the public to weigh in when we get to latter hearings. There's two  hearings before the city manager. And one of them is a public hearing. So the public can be heard.  Okay. Perfect. Thank you. Any other questions?  Thanks. So at this point, you know, the idea was just to discuss the issue. I think,  you know, Mr. Ewing, I kind of aim this question towards you. If we were to  move forward on anything, what would you suggest being the best possible route of some reconsideration?  If the, I would ask that the council provide direction to staff to analyze the issue,  we can bring back some of the information that we have. So I would ask that the council provide direction to staff to analyze the issue. We can bring back some of the information that we have.  We can bring back some of the information that we have. So I would ask that the council provide direction to staff to analyze the issue. We can bring back some  options, the analysis for the next regular meeting. And at that time, the council could take action or not based on those recommendations.  All right. Thank you. Any council member questions from this review?  All right. Do we have any public comment on this?  Yes, we have four speakers. All right. Let's do three minutes.  Okay. And if they can line up, David Peterson, followed by Curtis Bartle.  And David Peterson is the first one.  Good evening, council and staff. Again, I'm David Peterson. I appreciate you.  And just want to say thank you for keeping your promise to the community and bringing this topic back on the agenda for discussion.  I mentioned before in other council meetings how  important it is to establish the distribution and manufacturing  for cannabis, for commercial cannabis when  considering generating revenue for the city. Dispensaries  and I'm going to reiterate some of what your staff member Angie just said.  Dispensaries will capture the revenue of funds that are being spent by local people  that are buying these retail products in and around the city.  But the manufacturing and distribution will capture some revenue from sales  that are made to other licensed businesses throughout the whole entire state of California,  not just the ones here in the city.  So it's important to remember the commodity flow of the retail product.  The Bureau of Cannabis Control requires that any retailer, whether it's delivery or storefront,  sell or purchase their products that are on their shelves from a licensed distributor,  and then that licensed distributor has to also purchase those products from a licensed either cultivator or manufacturer.  So they're basically like a mandated middleman.  So allowing...  Allowing the distribution and manufacturing within the city is only going to generate revenue  from businesses and transactions that would otherwise be captured in other municipalities  that are allowing those licenses and activities currently already.  So if you are going to allow these licenses applications to move forward,  what I'd also like to request or recommend is establish some sort of incentive for the businesses to work together,  right?  So you have currently a community benefit fee of 5% of gross sales receipts to each individual commercial cannabis licensed business.  So if that manufacturer that's established here in Chico sells their product to the distributor,  they're going to tack on that 5%.  And then the distributor is going to sell it to the retailer.  They're going to tack on that 5%.  And the retailer is going to sell it to the consumer.  They're going to tack on that 5% just to cover the cost and the community benefit fee.  So at the end state, it's a 15% markup.  And that's very unlikely that that's going to happen.  So those retailers are going to be purchasing their products from outside of the city where it's cheaper.  So my recommendation would be to create some sort of incentive program for the businesses to work together,  like reducing or eliminating the community benefit fee at the sale.  So if the retailer purchased it from the distribution company within Chico,  maybe they don't pay their community benefit fee or it's a reduced community benefit fee.  And likewise from the distributor.  So that's all I have.  I appreciate your time.  Curtis Bortle, followed by Crystal Kesey.  Hey, good evening, City Council.  My name is Curtis Bortle.  And it's actually kind of good.  I'm kind of following up Mr. Peterson's comments.  I own a retail dispensary in Lassen County.  I own the only retail dispensary in Lassen County.  And so consideration of some of these other,  licensed types I think is valuable and at the very least prudent to think about.  Because one of the areas that cannabis as an expanding industry is struggling is in distribution and logistics specifically.  So, for example, at my shop, the closest distribution center is in Sacramento.  And many of the rest of them are either in Los Angeles or in San Francisco.  And in my small shop, about, you know, for every month,  that goes by, we purchase about $150,000 worth of inventory that we then mark up.  So, you know, Lassen County also similarly is missing out on revenue or tax revenue  that potentially could have been generated by a local distribution company  to the tune of $150,000 a month.  And that's just in Lassen County, which is, you know, probably a fourth of the size of the city of Chico.  So, doing some simple math, it's really easy to draw.  I have a conclusion that if the intent of the city council is to capture additional revenue,  it would be wise to include as many parts of the distribution chain as possible inside the city limits.  If for nothing else, then to supply the businesses that are going to be stationed locally in Chico  and to be able to capture that tax revenue for those businesses.  And then, you know, like was mentioned earlier, additionally,  if you have a distribution company or a manufacturing company that is particularly successful,  you know, you're going to be able to get that tax revenue.  So, if you have a distribution company or a manufacturing company that is particularly successful,  and their brand travels throughout the rest of the state of California,  that's, you know, that's demand that's being driven from outside of the city limits.  So, eventually, essentially, you get to take advantage of being an exporter instead of an importer of product.  And if you're very familiar with economics,  communities benefit more from exporting than they do from importing just by pure, you know,  just by pure economics and supply.  And then, you know, if you're very familiar with economics,  you know, just by pure economics and supply chain runs, you know,  you're spending more, you're making money instead of spending it.  So, you know, from my perspective, it would be wise if Chico pursued these other license types,  especially distribution because, you know, the whole north of the state  as it stands right now doesn't really have a distribution hub that's north of Sacramento.  Chico is positioned along the I-5 corridor, which gives it access to many other parts of the state.  And, you know, in the immediate area, there's probably 15 to 20 dispensaries,  and then, you know, you just have to keep going.  And we're looking at, you know, we're looking at, you know,  we're looking at different ways that a distribution manufacturer could be servicing.  So those are my comments.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Crystal Kesey followed by Charles Burton.  Good evening, Council.  I'm the principal owner of one of your cannabis dispensary finalists, Village Green.  And I'm also a Chico resident.  And I'm a woman-owned business owner.  And interestingly, this morning, when the Council last fall put a hold  on the  the rest of the supply chain,  and accepting the applications for the retailed storefront,  our team switched gears and applied in Redwood City,  and we are finalists there, too,  and we had our interview this morning,  so it's sort of our practice for our interview here in Chico.  And very interestingly, we had, like, a Captain America,  like, our security officer, 30-year military veteran,  veteran current police officer in Mendocino County,  and we were really prepared to talk about  how safe we were going to keep the dispensary in the community,  and the city manager, the chief of police,  the senior planner, the economic development director,  and the diversity and equity and inclusion officer  for our hour-and-20-minute interview  wanted to talk about diversity, equity, and inclusion.  And so I...  I looked back at our process here  and realized that there is nothing in our ordinance  for women-owned businesses or minority-owned businesses,  and so I'm grateful for the mayor  to reintroduce the concept of the supply chain  back into the Chico possibility in Chico.  And so my suggestion is,  you have 25 finalists for the dispensary,  only three are going to win the prize, right?  And so...  But the other people are very qualified,  and there might be some diversity, equity, and inclusion applicants  in that pool of non-selected dispensary applicants  who would love to be able to run a delivery service,  and you've already vetted them through the process.  So my suggestion is,  don't throw the baby out with the bathwater.  If you have all these qualified candidates,  allow them to use their...  storefront dispensary application  with modifications to address delivery services, say,  and consider diversity, equity, and inclusion  in your thought process  as you consider reopening the supply chain.  And I wanted to tell Curtis  that the closest distributorship is actually in Shasta Lake  because I'm the one that owns it up there.  So thank you.  Charles Burton is our last speaker.  Thank you, sir.  Good evening, City Council.  I'd just like to start by thanking you guys all  for bringing cannabis back on the agenda.  As somebody who is an application finalist, too,  we were very concerned when you guys took off  the other non-competitive applications  as we planned on that being our backup plan,  as there are only three out of 29,  and we believe that, you know, there are some...  There's a lot of money behind some of those people  where the small local person who might not be  as competitive as the other people.  So our backup plan was always to have that delivery service,  which was non-competitive.  So I'd just like to thank you all for that.  Thank you guys for looking at that, opening it back up  and, you know, giving us a chance.  Thank you very much and look forward to seeing  what you guys come up with in the future.  He was our last speaker.  All right.  Discussion from the Council.  I'd love to hear from you.  You brought this up back.  You know I'm supportive,  so I would love to hear from you first,  and we'll go from there.  Well, so I'll make a motion  to send it to the City Attorney for review  so we can have some options that are next meeting.  I think that makes sense.  You can just direct me.  There we go.  You can just direct me.  Okay.  So let's direct the City Attorney  without a motion and a...  Yeah.  All right.  Respectfully, Mayor Coolidge,  I'm not sure what the direction is.  Oh, sure.  So, I mean, if it were up to me,  I would say,  to have the City Attorney and staff  kind of look at manufacturing, testing, distribution,  and non-storefront retail delivery  as it's written in our ordinance  and come back with thoughts about continuing that process  or if there's other options  that this Council would like to explore,  including not in the direction.  Sure.  Yeah, I think I'm polite.  Yeah.  Understood.  I don't agree with that direction.  Okay.  So if I were going to give direction,  I would agree with what you just said.  Ms. Dilk made a good point,  and then it got kind of taken sideways.  We agreed on three retail establishments.  I mean, I agreed on none,  but with delivery from those.  And I think that's fine for a city our size.  I agree with the supply chain issues.  I do understand economics.  I am not excited about Chico  becoming the cannabis central anything  for Northern California.  However, there is money  to be generated there.  And if we don't make it,  someone else is going to.  I'm not interested, though,  in opening X amount of manufacturers  or X amount of distributorships.  I would be open to something.  But as we're giving direction,  it needs to be limited  the same way that retail shops were.  I am not interested in talking  about any more kind of delivery.  We've already made that possible.  So if we just give it to the city attorney  and say, hey, go do this,  that's not really any direction.  Okay.  So I think we do, in fact, then need a motion.  I don't know that we need a motion.  Maybe we just need to specify a little bit better  what exactly what we're directing Mr. Ewing to do.  And I would love to see a complete analysis  of all of those things.  You can take delivery off if you want to,  but manufacturing, distribution, and testing,  and knowing what you've done in other communities,  knowing the breadth that you have  and the ordinance that we have,  I would love to have you come back  and advise us,  as a body,  how you think the best way to move forward would be,  and then we can make our motions  and decide what we want to do from there  after you educate us a little bit more.  That's my opinion anyways.  I agree with your opinion.  I just don't,  and Mr. Ewing, tell me if I've got this wrong.  I don't want this body to be looking at you saying,  go create policy for us  and come back and have us vote on it.  No.  Because most of the things we're talking about,  we are,  we already kind of know.  Right.  No, I'd be looking at the policy that you created  and making a recommendation about what you can do  based on the analysis that I've done  with the policy you've created.  Thank you.  Yeah.  So I will support analysis.  Beyond that, that's yet to be seen.  I got to tell you,  I really think we need to figure out  this dispensary thing first.  This is a new enterprise.  We need to walk before you run, in my opinion.  Let's get dispensaries right first,  and then we can look at other things.  That's just my opinion,  but I will certainly support  at least having an analysis of this issue  from the city attorney's office.  I would support an analysis of our existing policy,  including manufacturing, distribution, testing, and delivery,  and bring you back to the point where we're at.  So we're very released on the released released released action that we can take all right I have general consensus on that all right there you go thank you  released  released  released  released  released !  released  you all right items added after the posting of the agenda which in fact we do have  yes that's my first time ever having that too so we'll turn this over to the city manager if you  do want to speak on this item you may be able to speak all the way through council discussion  so please accept late cards uh clerk thank you yes honorable mayor vice mayor members of the  council these are the types of items that i typically would never bring to you uh except  for an emergency situation and since it arose subsequent to the preparation of the agenda  i felt it necessary to bring back as you very well are aware we are having an intergovernmental  project be operationalized as we speak and that intergovernmental project is currently underway  through settlement negotiations with uh with the courts  so i  can't speak to the specifics of uh varying aspects of it but i will say that to alleviate the stress  and concern that otherwise a type of request such as this would make i.e coming from the general fund  i've worked with my department heads to come up with uh some of the federal funding that came  through uh to be able to modify budget appropriations or authorizations that were  previously granted by council to accommodate the nine hundred thousand dollars that are necessary  to support the storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm storm  compared to the amount that was previously authorized.  So with that, I request this budget authorization, please.  All right, questions from the council?  So I just have a reiteration question.  Yeah.  Because I want you to say it again.  Thanks.  So not from general funds?  Correct.  These are non-general funds, correct.  And where did they stem from?  They stem from federal funding that came through.  And the item that we are working through  has aspects of COVID-19 to it.  So the funds came through to help offset  some of the impacts of that on our community.  And this is one large area where the impacts were felt.  Okay.  It's going towards helping the city.  So you can say the acronym where it came from too.  American Rescue Plan Funds, ARP funds.  Thank you.  You just wanted that on the record?  Yeah, absolutely.  All right, do we have any speaker cards?  No.  Is anyone wishing to speak on this item?  All right.  All right.  Motion to approve.  Do we have a second?  I'll second that.  Motion and second.  Madam Clerk, when you're in.  Thank you.  Council Member Bennett?  Yes.  Council Member Brown?  Aye.  Council Member Morgan?  Yes.  Council Member O'Brien?  Yes.  Council Member Tandon?  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds?  Aye.  Mayor Coolidge?  Aye.  Carries 7-0.  All right, item 5.5, approval of the  fiscal year 2021 supplemental appropriation budget  modification number 2022CN-002.  That's actually the item we just took.  I added that into your.  You did.  Yes.  You already added it in.  Do it again.  Do it again.  Sorry.  Well, look at that.  Sorry.  No, no, because that would have to come out  of the general fund.  All right, threw me off my own agenda.  Okay.  Yes.  Reports and communications.  The following reports and communication items  are provided for the council's information.  No action can be taken on items under this section  unless the council agrees to include it  on a subsequent agenda.  Verbal report from the city manager.  Yes, honorable members of the council.  I just wanted to highlight a couple things actually,  based upon some of the comments given tonight.  I think it's important that the public do know  some of these items are coming back.  There was a question under public comment  as it relates to the letter to the state.  And as council very well is aware, you heard a presentation  from Director  Kennelly.  I've already worked with the information  as provided by Director Kennelly.  That letter will return back to the city council  for approval at your next meeting of the 21st.  I will tell you that the sales tax item  that was mentioned by a member of the public,  there will be a recommendation to move forward  with the winner of the RFP associated with consultancy  for the sales tax.  That will be coming back to the city council  at your next meeting of December 21st.  And then I will also make mention of,  there was also some commentary,  given to housing or in all the efforts  going on towards housing.  At your next meeting of December 21st,  a presentation on housing will be presented  based upon a recommendation and request  from the city council on that.  Mr. V will be presenting that.  With that, those are my updates and have a great evening.  Can you specify what the housing presentation is?  Absolutely, I believe it was a request  of Council Member Tandon, if I remember correctly.  And she in essence wanted to better understand  the projects that are on your site.  And she's been very helpful in getting that going.  And in particular, wanted to understand  some of the more difficult to build projects,  like the low income projects.  And so I know that Director V is ready to give  that presentation by the 21st and has,  going to have a comprehensive report to give.  Great, thank you.  I know there was another request,  I believe by Council Member Morgan,  about housing related to the Green Line.  So I wasn't sure when that was coming back to us.  Yeah, I'd have to consult with their city clerk  to find where that's at on the agenda planning calendar.  Thank you.  I don't have that right off the top of my head though.  We haven't forgotten though.  All right, item 6.2, Council Member requests  for Senate date PMB 1010.  Council Member Mays verbally request an item  to be agenda at a future meeting.  After stating what the item would be,  a majority vote of the Council is needed  in order to the first step to agenda.  Council Members may also submit requests in writing.  Do we have any said requests?  Okay, I actually have another request.  So sorry, fellow Council Members.  But next year is a really important year  for the City of Chico because it's our birthday.  Well, every year is our birthday,  but this is a special birthday because it's 150 years.  And I think that's pretty substantial  and I think we need to have some planning on it.  What I would say is in wanting to agendize this,  that we do it much like the ice rink  in terms of having it break even  and not spend a lot of taxpayer dollars  and be geared towards the city.  And that's the focus of the public  rather than maybe perhaps the city.  So that's my thoughts behind it.  I'd like to agendize it,  maybe have a city staff bring back something  and move forward at that point if it seems appropriate.  I'll second that.  All right.  We have a motion and a second.  Motion by me, second by Vice Mayor Reynolds.  Mayor Coolidge, the request is to have a discussion  about our 150th anniversary and celebration  that may be available.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Pretty broadly open to see what...  Sure.  I support it.  I like birthday celebrations.  All right.  Council Member Bennett.  Yes.  Council Member Brown.  Aye.  Council Member Morgan.  Yes.  Council Member O'Brien.  Yes.  Council Member Tandon.  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds.  Sure.  Mayor Coolidge.  Aye.  All right.  Item 6.3, Sunshine and Negotiation Proposals,  informational only.  6.4 is also informational.  And we will recess into closed session.  Do we have any council disqualifications  from closed session?  Do we have any closed session public comments?  All right.  Thank you.  With that, we'll adjourn into closed session.  Thanks very much. [inaudible]  Thanks very much.  Thanks very much.  Thanks very much.  Thanks very much.  Thanks very much.
