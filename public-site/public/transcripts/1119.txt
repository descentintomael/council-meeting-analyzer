Anyone wishing to address the council on any item listed on the agenda must first complete a speaker card, which can be found at the back of the chamber. Once completed, please turn to the city clerk on my left, on your right. Speakers are taken in the order the cards are received. And once the first speaker begins their comments, no additional comments. No cards may be accepted on that item. I'll start tonight with a closed session announcement from city attorney Vincent Ewing. Take it away. Thank you, Mayor Coolidge. The city attorney, city manager, city clerk, and staff met with the city council in closed session on the listed agenda items. On those items, only one action was taken on item 2.2. The city council voted unanimously 7-0 to approve a settlement regarding case. Case XXS versus city of Chico. Workers' Comp claim number CWCO550115. With respect to the other items set forth on the agenda, no reportable action was taken. Direction was given. That concludes my closed session report. All right. Thank you very much. We'll move on to the consent agenda. All matters listed on the consent agenda are considered routine in nature and can be enacted in one motion. And do we have any speakers? No. No speakers on consent. Any council disqualifications or no votes? Just my abstain from 2.1. All right. Please note, Vice Mayor Reynolds' abstention from 2.1. We can entertain a motion. Move to approve. Second. A motion from Vice Mayor Reynolds and a second from those guys down there. Okay. Thank you. Council Member Bennett. Yes. Council Member Morgan. Yes. Council Member Tandon. Yes. Council Member Van Overbeck. Yes. Council Member Winslow. Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds. Yes. Mayor Coolidge. Aye. Carries 7-0. All right. I only said that because they said it at the same time. All right. We'll start with business from the floor. Members of the public may address the council at this time on any matter not already listed on the agenda. The council cannot take any action at this meeting. On request. Any request made under this section of the agenda. So again, if you want to speak on a matter listed on the agenda, please wait until that matter arises before us to do so. How many speakers? Two. Three minutes. Okay. Nicole Nalava followed by Monica McDaniel. Hi there. A couple of quick things tonight. First off, thank you for the opportunity to participate in a Chico Fire, basically an assessment thing. But what I wanted to point out. But I wanted to point out that it also fell within the same time as a Chico Police Department kind of community event as well. So if you wanted to try to go to the police one, which would have been great, you were unable to do so. So maybe in the future if we could try to like look at calendars of things that are of import to the community and for us, that would be super-duper. So switching gears, I wanted to speak about the alternative camping site. And also some of the other spaces around Chico. And just again reiterate a few things. One of which, and I'll ask for an appointment with the police chief if I need to, but I feel like it's very important that the optics, if you will, of everything is that we always are going for all citizens are being treated the same when it comes to our laws, our ordinances, etc. And that is not the case. Blitter is still a huge issue. And I'm concerned that that will continue. I understand that. I understand that there is a very strict regimen you have to follow for the settlement agreement and noticing and where you're going to go and all of that. But again, you do have the latitude to take action on actual violations. And that is not a protected class who is exempt from that type of citation. The other thing is there are people struggling around. So Depot Park, Tiker Ponds and all that. And I understand, again, you're going to get at it at a certain. Order. But there are people around the community who keep asking for help. I actually had a call today from a concerned male parent who has two children who have to pass by a bus stop where it was being occupied right in front of a school here locally. Thankfully that person moved, but they moved literally into a neighborhood where these two children have to go to go by themselves to go to school. And it is problematic behaviors happening. That's not always the case with all that population. But in cases it is. So it would be good if we could have some attention at trying to convince people to, again, be assessed, to be locating at the alternative camping sites. There also seems to be confusion among the population about can someone just go to an alternative site if they've called and they have someone intervene that is from the city? Are they supposed to wait until an area is noticed? That kind of a thing. The general public does not seem to understand. They don't seem to understand this flow. The flow chart is great, but maybe we need to revisit that in light of the additional resting sites and some things. So that's what I wanted to bring to your attention. And I thank you for your time. Thank you. Monica McDaniel. Good evening, Council. Mayor Kulich, Vice Mayor Reynolds. I'm just here to speak on behalf of the Chic Arts and Culture Foundation tonight. We've been giving city art tours for the last several years. We will begin our tours again in May. We're going to be doing tours on the first Saturday of the month, May through October. And we just wanted to invite all members of Council, city staff, to come and get a little preview of the tours. We're going to give a little abridged version so you can get a taste of what we're doing and hopefully tell people about it and support your standalone art projects. So I just want to give those to the city clerk. And I just want to invite you. It's March 30th in the evening at 5 p.m. So we hope to see you there. Thank you. All right. Thank you. Mr. Mayor, may I make a comment? Sure. Yeah. So I have been on Ms. McDaniel's art tour, and it is really worthwhile. I would recommend it. I would second that. People do that. I have as well. So, all right. Okay. Moving on to item 4.1, Hearing Ordering Formation of Maintenance Assessment, District A51, Magnolia Gardens. And we have a report from Public Works Director of Engineering. Thank you. Good evening, Mayor, Vice Mayor, and Council members. A condition of approval of a final map requires the developer to provide a means for funding infrastructure that provides a special benefit to the future parcel owners. Richard and Sherry Payne, owners of Magnolia Gardens subdivision, which is south of East Avenue, west of Mariposa, and east of Cianothis, have submitted a petition to form a CMD. And so the hearing that you're about ready to open is regarding the CMD, any public comments that would be wanting to be submitted. The infrastructure that provides a special benefit to the CMD is stormwater improvements, irrigated landscaping, and street trees. And there are 13 lots in this subdivision, or there will be as soon as the final map is approved. And the cost for the CMD is $1,038 per year. Per lot. Any questions? Questions? Okay. Thank you very much. All right. And we will open the public hearing. Any comment? Close the public hearing. Entertain a motion. Second. We have a motion from Council Member Tannen, a second from Vice Mayor Reynolds. And that's a resolution of the City Council of the City of Chico ordering the formation of a maintenance assessment. District improving the declaration of conditions, covenants, and restrictions relating thereto City of Chico maintenance assessment number A51 Magnolia Garden. When you're ready. Council Member Bennett. Yes. Council Member Morgan. Yes. Council Member Tanden. Yes. Council Member Van Overbeck. Yes. Council Member Winslow. Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds. Aye. Mayor Coolidge. Aye. Carries 7-0. All right. Moving on to the regular agenda item 5.1 amendments of the Chapter 1470 of the Chico Municipal Code, use of public right of way for operation of outdoor cafes. We have a report from the Deputy City Manager Jennifer McCarthy. And there she is. Welcome. Thank you. Good evening, Mayor Coolidge, Vice Mayor Reynolds, members of the Council. I'm Jennifer McCarthy, Deputy City Manager for the City of Chico. Before you tonight is consideration of amendments to the City of Chico's Municipal Code as it relates to the operation of outdoor cafes in the public right of way. So today I'll go through quickly kind of the background of how we got here, the proposed amendments to the Municipal Code, talk a little bit about process efficiencies that we've been discussing, and finally answer any questions that you might have about these modifications. So as background, as you know, the City of Chico is a public right of way. And we're going to talk about that in a little bit. So the City of Chico is a public right of way. The City declared a local emergency based on COVID-19 back in March of 2020. It seems like forever ago now. With that came several executive orders that were issued through the City Manager. One of them was in relation to temporary parklets. And that is allowing the temporary location of outdoor dining within the public right of way. So examples of those would be what you saw in terms of Banshee or Duffy's or Ramona or others in downtown Chico. As you're hearing, we're going to talk about the As you're hearing, we're going to talk about the! As you're hearing, we're going to talk about the! As you're hearing, we're going to talk about the!! As you're hearing, we're going to talk about the! As you're hearing, we're going to talk about the! As you're hearing, we're going to talk about the! As you're hearing, we're going to talk about the! As you're hearing, we're going to talk about the As you're hearing, we're going to talk about the! As you're hearing, we're going to talk about the! As you're hearing, we're going to talk about the! staff take a look at our process and how we're issuing our permits to see if there's any opportunities for efficiencies. So before you tonight is a draft ordinance that if ultimately adopted would modify the Chica Municipal Code to allow for expanded eligibility of outdoor cafes with greater efficiencies and as well as compliance. So I won't go through all of the changes, but I will hit some of the major ones for you. The code modifications do allow for for alcohol establishments that do not provide food to be eligible to apply for outdoor cafes. It also allows for businesses that are adjacent to diagonal parking to have outdoor cafes with the caveat that only up to three diagonal spaces could be removed as a result of putting in the outdoor cafe. In addition, as we started to look at the existing code, we realized there were some other real cleanups that needed to happen. So we decided to do a little bit of a review of the changes that we're seeing that are happening and opportunities to make sure that the city is protected as well as we're putting in some efficiencies. So one of those is making sure that the licensee, the person that is receiving the license for the outdoor cafe, when there's permanent infrastructure improvements, meaning taking away the parking spaces, is actually the property owner versus the business. Because as you see in our downtown area right now, some of the businesses that have the permanent improvements have since left. And so this way, if we have it associated with the property owner, that can stay with that property. It can transfer as a new business comes in and utilizes that space. It would actually be a benefit for the property owner. The other thing that it does for the city is it allows us to continue to collect the parking fee that is associated with removing those parking spaces from use in the downtown area. Other items that are included in this, you can see, are related to enforcement of violations. Right now, as we're looking at the city's parking space, we're looking at the city's parking space as it sits with our code. We really don't have a lot of teeth for what happens if it's not properly maintained or what happens if it's not kept up or utilized in a way that's associated with the license. So there's been a small modification that basically says that violation will be treated as a public nuisance and abated in such a way. So the other thing that council asked us to do was to look at process improvements. Because whereas the code kind of sets out the regulations and how we're treat outdoor cafes, the outdoor permit process is the actual piece of paper that you get to implement the code. So we took a look inside and kind of thought through what are our opportunities for changes and improvements. And so at this point, I'll kind of walk you through what the process is. There's no way I'm asking any of you to be able to read all of this. So I'm just going to provide you a really brief overview. When you're applying for an outdoor cafe, if you are a business that serves alcohol, there's really two areas that you're going to have to go through and receive a license for. One is a license through the Alcohol Beverage Control Agency or the ABC, and the second is through the City of Chico with our outdoor cafe permit. In looking at the ABC process itself, if you have a clean application, if you've turned in everything complete, if there's no issues with the neighbors or if there's no issues with the site visit, that entire process will... will take about 60 days. The reason for that is they bring in the application, they check for completion of the application. They also have to do public noticing because they have to notice the neighbors that are around the property. And then finally, they do a site visit. So the ABC process takes about 60 days, give or take, and again, that's with a clean... with a clean application. The second layer that you see there is the city's process. And again, this is best case scenario. We're throwing out a 30-day process right here. And really the steps that are involved in this process include meeting with engineering to make sure that there's a general concept that they understand, submitting an application for the operation of the outdoor cafe, and then having that application reviewed for completeness. They have to be able to provide the city certain insurance requirements associated with that permit. It goes through an architectural review process. Then the complete package is ultimately sent to... Public works, fire, the police, as well as planning for final review and approval. And that process can take 30 days. I say that process can take 30 days, but please note at the bottom it says, timeline with a complete application submittal and no issues. So we talked through what could be some of the issues that are out there. And typically, it is perhaps the application itself was not complete when it was submitted. Perhaps the applicant is having difficulties getting proper insurance. Perhaps the design that's being submitted is not up to par for what we're seeing in our downtown area. Or maybe there's engineering concerns related to utilities, easements, and parking. So these are all areas that could potentially delay the type of the timeline that I talked about. Some of these delays are within our control and some of these delays are outside of our control. So we kind of thought through what are some potential changes that we could make to hopefully speed up the process for folks and give them as a much of an opportunity to get to that 30 day timeline as possible. And in regards to completeness, engineering is working through the concept of a checklist. They have a very detailed list already of documentation that needs to be submitted with the application. But they're looking at putting a real just checklist on the very top that is submitted with the package that the person literally has to check all the boxes so that we make sure it's complete. So we're helping them become complete. And then in terms of architectural review, as I mentioned, we have the bars set pretty high right now in downtown Chico. We have some nice looking outdoor cafes that are already in place. So staff is feeling very confident that as long as an application is submitted that's at that same level, we could have staff level approval of architectural review, which will cut some time for us. And then also we've currently made the change already in terms of insurance review and that's done in-house now and that can take one to two days now. So those are some examples of some process improvements. So to let you know basically staff has taken a look at our process. We've gone through and evaluated where we could make improvements. And then we've taken your direction in terms of code modifications and then other cleanups to the code. And it is before you tonight. So tonight we're really just asking for you to introduce the ordinance by title only. And I'm happy to answer any questions you might have. All right. Questions? Council Member. That was excellent. You almost answered all of the questions I had. Good. So I commend you. Very good. And... It's just a simple one. Is the city going to wait if someone does not have a liquor license and they need to apply for a liquor license, is the city going to wait until they receive their license, alcohol license? Or are they two separate time frames where somebody could apply for the city assuming that their application is complete? I know that's tricky. Right. I've been there many times. So... Can they be working both time frames at the same time or do you want to wait? Or do you want them to wait? Thank you for raising that issue. Certainly they can be started concurrently if that's what the applicant chooses to do. But the city cannot issue our final permit until we have all of the approvals from the ABC. Okay. So that is the linchpin to completion. Yeah. If they needed to, they could drop their application with ABC and continue forward with just food without alcohol. Certainly. I'm just thinking. Yeah. Certainly. Thank you very much. You're welcome. I have a question. How large an area, an outdoor cafe do you get with three diagonal parking spaces? So Director Sutton may be able to answer that a little bit better than I, but in conversations that we had, in thinking currently outdoor cafes can take away two parking spaces if it's parallel parking. So in looking at three diagonal spaces, it's very similar to that same amount of space. And I would just add that when we would look at these, we would try to convert the diagonal to parallel parking spaces in front of it. So the outdoor cafe wouldn't go all the way out to the end of the diagonal parking spaces, which are pretty long. It would just go out eight feet or something to that effect. And then the rest of the space would be used for parallel parking. So when you say it's going to occupy no more than three spaces, is that net spaces? So if you take up five diagonal spaces and you add two parallel spaces, is that three? Do you get my point? Say it again. Yeah. Say it again. Okay. So is the three the net loss of spaces? So for example, if you have a situation where you have an outdoor cafe and there's parallel parking on the outside, and let's say you have three spaces. And you've taken three diagonal spaces to create that, or four, then that would be a net of two. I don't believe the municipal code, the way we drafted it, is based on net spaces. It's based on three diagonal parking spaces, which is three whole, even if they're taking a portion of a third space, because the lines from the building come out straight and the diagonal. So we would be looking at minimizing it to three diagonal spaces total, not portions of four spaces or portions of five spaces. Do you see what I'm saying there? So I believe that's the way the code's written now, and that's the way we would enforce it. All right. Council Member Winslow, you had a question. This whole presentation was great. Thanks. Also, the only thing that crossed my mind reading it was saying this, Council Member Van Overbeek, that the three diagonal parking spaces, I just wondered if there's any steadfast reason why that has to be a limit. And following that, if two adjoining businesses both applied, does only one of them get the permit because you can't have six spaces taken up in a row under any circumstances? It would be per business. And if there needs to be clarifying language included in the ordinance, we could certainly do so. For instance, if you wanted to limit it to no more than the length of the facade of the building, we could include that if that makes more sense than the three spaces. Or no more than three spaces as a maximum, we could do that if that makes more sense. The idea I considered floating was if these were really successful and we really wanted to see some expansion or some adjoining businesses had some complementary, like,! use of space, then they might have an interest in expanding and having some kind of provision for special approval for a larger parklet so we don't have to amend an ordinance again in order to get there. Like, say, if the city manager had to approve anything larger than that. Okay. Any other questions? All right. Thank you. We'll hear from the public. Do we have any speakers? None. Okay. Well, it counts. Would, I mean, I ask you, would you entertain just a small change that would allow for a provision under special circumstances for a larger parklet than three diagonal parking spaces? Does that feel overly complicated? Mr. Sorensen, do you have any comment? It just leads me to wonder, under what circumstances, would Council want us to approve a larger loss of parking spots? Just the business being successful enough that it warrants greater use of space. They're paying for the spaces in any case, right? Mr. True. But for decades, I've heard that one of the biggest problems for businesses downtown is inadequate number of parking spaces. So it just makes you wonder. Even with the code as it is, one of my biggest concerns is what if you do have too much success and you lose too many parking spots in some particular area of town? You know, that could be a real problem. Is it today? No. Do we see it on the immediate horizon? No. So that's the only hesitation I have with some sort of a too easy of a mechanism to take out more parking spots. Is there anything that precludes two adjoining businesses to do a parklet next door to each other? No. It would be three spots for this business and three spots for that business? No. So each business can still do their three spots and so... They can share the space. And they can share the space and split it up however they want if they agree to do that. But I think the three spots and then when it's parallel, it's two, I think, right? If they were different properties because the way the code's written now is it's per property. Yes. So there are some properties and I have one in mind that has one restaurant, one some other retail, and then something else. But conceivably, that could be one property with, you know, maybe they want three different parklets. But the way the code's written, they could only have one. And it's not parklet. That's not the right term. Cafe, dining. Outdoor cafe. That's why I see some room for improvisation without amending ordinance in the future would make sense to me. But it's not a hill I'm going to die on. I have one quick question. Are we limiting like per block how many parklets would be allowed because of the parking concern? Like let's say on one street between 3rd and 4th, if every business would like to have a parklet, could they do that and we can just not have any parking on that block? Theoretically, yes. It does not limit. Okay. So do you... Is that a concern though? Yes. Right. It is a concern. But we don't have a... If we have a whole two blocks without parking, is there a way... But if we limit it, then that kind of is not right. Who will apply first will get it and the others won't. So... But right now, there's no provision anybody can apply and we can potentially lose a lot of parking. Potentially. And we did talk through some potential mechanisms for trying to limit it per whatever unit of measure per block. And it's just one of those things. There is no perfect answer. That would be grounds to deny a permit application is that there's not enough parking in the area. Is that right? It could be. That could very well be a logic. Hopefully, if we think we're getting close to that problem developing, we have another discussion. I mean, today I don't see a gold rush on cafe dining. So as usual, sir, you'll take care of it when it comes out as a problem? We'll take care of it. Okay. Thank you. All right. We have a motion. We have a second. Okay. And it was a motion and a second to introduce ordinance of the City Council of the City of Chico amending Chapter 14.70 of the Chico Municipal Code to regulate the use of public right-of-way for operation of outdoor cafes. Council Member Bennett? Yes. Council Member Morgan? Yes. Council Member Tandon? Yes. Council Member Van Overbeek? Yes. Council Member Winslow? Yes. Council Member Kulich? Aye. Carries 7-0. All right. Item 5.2, Replication of Memorandum of Understanding Stationary Engineers Local 39L39. And we have a report from Ms. Chelsea Feebus, Director of Human Resources and Risk Management. Welcome. Good evening, Mayor, Vice Mayor, and members of the Council. Before you for approval this evening is the Stationary Engineers Local 39 MOU. This contract actually concludes the bargaining that we entered into in 2020 for all of the groups, so it's good news that this is wrapped up. Key highlights of the contract include the following. A 5% general salary increase retroactively effective to January 1, 2023. A 3% general salary increase effective January 1, 2024. A lump sum non-percival payment of 2% of base salary effective January 1, 2025. One additional eight-hour floating holiday and an additional 40 hours of personal time-off. Once implemented, the contract will cost the City approximately $41,000 through June 30, 2024, and will have a total cost approximately of $233,000 over the lifetime of the contract. These costs are fully borne by the sewer fund. Staff recommends approving the Stationary Engineers Local 39 MOU effective January 1, 2023 through June 30, 2025. I'm happy to answer any questions you might have. All right. Questions? Okay. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Any speakers on this side? None. All right. Entertain a motion. Move to approve. Second. I move a motion from Council Member Venna, a second from Vice Mayor Rounds. And that's a resolution of the Council of the City of Chico approving memorandum of understanding between the City of Chico and Stationary Engineers Local 39 L39 regarding pay hours and other terms and conditions of employment for the period of January 1, 2023 through June 30, 2025, 2023 Local 39 MOU. Council Member Bennett? Yes. Council Member Morgan? Yes. Council Member Tandon? Yes. Council Member Van Overbeck? Yes. Council Member Winslow? Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds? Aye. Mayor Coolidge? Aye. Carries 7-0. All right. Thank you very much. Next, Item 5.3, Consideration and Approval of Supplemental Appropriation and Budget Modifications under 2023 AST 003, report by Council Member Tandon. I'll now take a report from Administrative Services Director Barton Martin. Welcome. Thank you. Thank you, Mayor Coolidge, Vice Mayor Reynolds, members of Council. Thank you for your time this evening. Last meeting, March 7th, the Council accepted the financial statements for the period ending June 30, 2022. Kind of the final step is to allocate any surplus funds that we recognized for the general fund for that same period. For that period, we have a surplus of $4,592,000. That's $196,000 and $139. And per budget policy D1C, we have certain allocations that we have established to put those surplus funds to. Just to note that that $4.5 million is after the $831,000 that was allocated back in September for the fire apparatus that was part of surplus funds originally. Council made a motion to move those funds to the Fleet Replacement Funds. That's where we will be talking later on in the presentation. Any additional questions on that? Any additional questions on that? Any additional questions on that? Any additional questions on that? Any additional questions on that? Any additional questions on that? Any additional questions on that? Any additional questions on that? Any additional questions on that? that fund for just pension costs. And then after that, we have the next 25% going to our public infrastructure replacement fund. That's $1.1 million just over. This fund is just used for road reconstruction projects. So that will be additional funds in that fund as well. And then the final 25% is allocated between our various replacement funds, including our technology replacement fund, fleet replacement fund, facility replacement fund, and then we have a police equipment and fire equipment fund. And all of those funds will equally get $229,807. And with that, I ask you to approve the supplemental, and I will take any questions. CHAIRMAN BRYANT. All right. Questions? All right. Any speakers on this item? MS. None. CHAIRMAN BRYANT. All right. I entertain a motion. Move to approve. MS. Second. CHAIRMAN BRYANT. I have a motion from Councilmember Winslow, a second from Councilmember Tandon. When you're ready. MS. Councilmember Bennett. CHAIRMAN BRYANT. Yes. MS. Councilmember Morgan. CHAIRMAN BRYANT. Yes. MS. Councilmember Tandon. CHAIRMAN BRYANT. Yes. MS. Councilmember Van Overbeck. CHAIRMAN BRYANT. Yes. MS. Councilmember Winslow. CHAIRMAN BRYANT. Yes. MS. Vice Mayor Reynolds. CHAIRMAN BRYANT. Aye. MS. Mayor Coolidge. CHAIRMAN BRYANT. Aye. MS. Carry 7-0. CHAIRMAN BRYANT. All right. Item 5.4, Internal Affairs Committee Report Quality of Life Ad hoc Committee, and we'll turn this over to the Chair, Tom Van Overbeck, Councilmember. So on August 2nd, at the City Council meeting last year, the Council directed the Internal Affairs Committee to consider the formation of a creation of an Ad hoc Quality of Life Committee. The Internal Affairs Committee met on March 6th to discuss that matter. We had one speaker from the floor. We had... some discussion related to it. Vice Mayor Reynolds made a motion, and the item died for lack of a second. And so we're back here. Okay. So, do we have any speakers on this item? We have three. All right. Do you want to take the speakers? Yeah. Do we have any questions prior to that? Any questions for council? Oh, okay. Yeah, let's go over to the speakers, three minutes each. Okay, Michelle Cooper, followed by Nicole Nava. Good evening. In California, anything which is injurious to health, or is indecent or offensive to the census, or an obstruction to the free use of property so as to interfere with the comfortable enjoyment of life, or property by an entire community or neighborhood, or by any considerable number of persons, or unlawfully obstructs the free passage or use in the customary manner of any navigable lake or river, bay, stream, canal, or basin, or any public park, square, street, or highway is a public nuisance. And that's according to Section 360 of the Penal Code. Chico voted for the quality of life measure because there are many issues facing us which cause public nuisance. The fact that two members of the Internal Affairs Committee are now stifling public input because they find it redundant says that what voters want doesn't matter. That improving quality of life for locals isn't important. According to these two committee members, my precious three minutes at this podium should suffice in ability to convey what I believe to be any public nuisance needing the city's immediate attention. I also should be perfectly okay with the fact that while at the podium, I will have no interaction with the council members that I'm addressing. No conversation which could result in positive outcomes, for all involved. I fail to see the redundancy here. Chico has so many problems right now, like broken sidewalks near schools, which caused my child to break both arms, camping violations caused by public to be unable to use paths, parks, and waterways, crumbling streets causing commuters unnecessary vehicle repairs, and now that our beautiful Bidwell Park is once again usable, I find that walking and jogging in it comes with challenges as the roads are in desperate need of repair there as well. The list goes on. An ad hoc committee would be the best option for public input, communications, and solutions that are both beneficial for citizens and the city alike. I'm extremely disappointed in the two council members that have failed the voices of the voters. Thank you. Thank You Nicole Nava followed by Rob Berry. Hello, I agree with many of the points that were made. I agree with the previous speaker. I just, at its base, I just don't see the harm in hearing from your community. We are here and as other speakers have said on prior nights and tonight, like we're talking at you, not with you. My understanding is that what was proposed was even one person per district. Doesn't seem really overwhelming. Could meet for, of course, a short time period, set up a number of meetings and clearly articulate goals of, okay, we're going to identify what people perceive as the biggest issues. Next we're going to talk about some potential solutions and we're going to talk about maybe tactical and then the recommendation, of course, sits with the chair and everyone else to report over to City Council. These are people that put you guys up there and we believe that we have the right for our voices to be heard and our issues to be heard as well. I understand that there is a perception that coming up, here is enough or that the form is enough. I will tell you also the part of what I want to talk to you about is the communication by the city. Like at times I'll see really good things and a lot of times it might be more self promotion things like, hey, we did this building permit thing and we got this award or whatever and that's fantastic. That should be happening, but which should also be happening is to make sure when there are opportunities that we hear about them in a very proactive manner. There's a lead. There's a lead up. You consider are there other language needs and things like that. And on this particular one, I had to click into it like six times to get to where the form lives and I've heard it said, okay, well, there's a form. There's a mechanism for you to report a public nuisance, but it shouldn't be too difficult, right? There's a hamburger menu you can click and maybe we under that make it easier to hover and see that it's public versus private. Lead us to the spot. Also, and maybe it's me, but it's not a dialogue. It's a dynamic form right now from what I'm seeing and clicking. Like I can't just do it and have it be done and shoot it off. A lot of people are going to probably give up a little bit if, yeah, like we're going to get it to me now society and they don't want to have to physically snail mail something or drop it off. So I just really, truly want to encourage you to like go the extra mile to hear from your people. Not be intimidated by that. You guys ultimately have the authority to decide whether you're going to take up. Those recommendations or not. And I feel like there's people that are pretty savvy in this community that will be able to articulate what's going on and have the pulse. And not that you don't alone, but many of us live in areas that have been impacted and might have different insights than you if you live in certain areas of town or your businesses are only in certain areas of town. So just maybe kind of think outside the box a little bit as it relates to that and have an openness and a willingness to hear from your folks. Thank you. Rob Berry. Thank you. Any other questions? Any other questions? Any other questions? Any other questions? Any other questions? Any other questions? Any other questions? Any other questions? Any other questions? Any other questions? Any other questions? Any other questions? Any other questions? Any other questions? Any other questions? Any other questions? Any other questions? Any other questions? Any other questions? this council really for anything including your participation if you feel like this is something that you don't believe in or you don't see the value in nobody's requiring you to participate in any way all I'm really asking is if you're that person and I think it's obvious that there's there's people that don't see the appreciation all I'm really asking is well don't stand in the way of other people that are interested in pursuing this idea it's got a lot of popular support it was passed by 60% of the voters just don't stand in the way and everything else will follow thank you very much thank you all right council discussion yes I have a couple comments which I may or may not make but first I would like Vice Mayor Reynolds to explain how you see this Ad Hoc Committee operating frequency just doesn't I don't want to get into the weeds but it's just a general comment about how it's you envision this working in reality please absolutely thank you for asking the Ad Hoc so there was two parts of the what was passed by the voters so one was the public nuisance part and the other part is a paragraph D which is the quality of life and that is where quality of of life commission was what was originally talked about, was created, and then they decided we didn't want to do commission, we'll do ad hoc committee and have internal affairs set that up and bring it back to council. So there is actually two different things we're talking about, but the committee itself, the way it was envisioned and talked about and originally brought up is that it's a place where we can have a place where there can be a two-way conversation. We don't have to be limited to three minutes. It can be five minutes. It can be 10 minutes. It can be one minute or two minute. We can choose that. And it's a committee that would come together once a month and there would be an agenda published, probably a specific agenda item on that that would be tackled for that week and probably meeting about once a month and then coming back to council with a recommendation periodically. So it's just a time where we can dig into more things and have more of a two-way conversation, which being at a council meeting, you just don't get that opportunity to do. Yes, we hear you from the floor. I make no. I do things. I try to follow up with people afterwards when they come up with good ideas and stuff like that. But it's really not an open dialogue conversation where we can have continuing and bring forward different things that we want to talk about that could enhance the quality of life in Chico. So it would be fairly informal then. It would be a give and take. Yep, give and take and a place for community members to come in and have an open conversation. And I'm going to shift to the city clerk, Ms. Preston. So as long as an ad hoc is created as an ad hoc, then that does not require the Brown Act to be engaged, which means there's a big difference in the time which staff would have to devote to something like this. I'm reading from your notes. Right. That is correct. It depends on how a committee is set up. If it's a true ad hoc, it would not have to fall under the Brown Act. If you'll recall. Years ago, we had a housing committee ad hoc that just got created. Three council members served on that. When they were done with their meetings and brought back recommendations, the council did take action on some of those items. But that was because it was three council members and it didn't constitute a quorum, didn't require any staff support, nor were there any agendas or minutes or anything that comes with a Brown Act. Right. Right. So if the council was leaning more towards setting or appointing one person per district to represent that district, then that would fall under the Brown Act and that would require agendas, minutes, staff participation, and that would be a completely different animal versus a true ad hoc, which is there for a purpose. And if this is for the forum to be able to provide more input or take in more input from citizens, then if two or three council members wanted to create that or have that be blessed by the council, then you can move forward with that and meet as often as you want. We can even facilitate having a room where it could be held. But you aren't held to just one meeting a month. You could meet as often as you needed if you had an issue that you really wanted to delve into. Okay. Okay. Okay. I think the component of one representative from each of the districts triggers the Brown Act versus not doing that and keeping it similar. That is, you know, and of course I would always go with what our city, our esteemed city attorney would say, but I believe that once you include the citizens that weren't elected and they're setting their hearing items and making recommendations, you really need them to have, be well-defined, their roles, responsibilities, and that would be, that would fall under the Brown Act. And you concur, Mr. Ewing? I do, and Ms. Press and I have discussed this issue. Okay. Yes. Thank you. So, Ms. Rano, let me just pause for a second. I don't know if staff can smell, but there's a significant smoke smell. Yeah. Okay. Is that, like, everywhere? Yeah. What are you saying? The police chief wants to investigate. Did he? Okay. Where's the fire chief? He's just sitting here. Is the police chief checking out the... No, no, no comments. No comments. The rivalry between PD and fire. All right. All right. So, yeah. Okay. Yeah, it's just because it's pretty strong up here. So, yeah. Anyway. So, are we okay, Billy? I guess. The building isn't on fire. All right. Okay. Sorry. Council Member Manover, go ahead. Yeah. No secret, but I'm not crazy about this idea. Yeah. My main concern... When I got elected to council was to make the function of the commission, it's not my main concern, one of my main concerns, to make the function of the commissions and boards more efficient. And the city clerk has done a great job in this last meeting of streamlining that whole process. And so my main objection to this was that it was going to trigger the Brown Act if we appointed citizens. But if it's an ad hoc committee made up of members of the council, then that's not an issue. That's something I do. And what I do want to point out is that nowhere in the ordinance or the resolution from the city council is the word commission board as of anywhere, including in paragraph D. So this idea that we're... that what the public voted on was an ordnance abatement ordinance for public or city-owned property, and there's nothing in there about creating a committee, which doesn't mean we shouldn't do it. Or that's a bad idea. But they are completely separate issues. All right. Council Member Morgan. So I agree with what Mr. Van Overbach said. I don't have a problem with the ad hoc committee. It somehow got turned into a commission. We're trying to get rid of commissions and people that sit up here. And you get seven people up here that are all appointed by us, you're not going to have a free discussion at all. It's going to be a mess. And we've seen how hard it is, both our own group and planning commission, it is to the point where we're not going to have a discussion. But I think it's important to keep people limited to times and do all of those things. So if there are members of the council that want to start an ad hoc committee so there can be a free flow of ideas, as we've discussed, I think that's fantastic. And they report back to internal affairs. And I think that's what the people expect. You turn it into another commission. And then commissioners tend to get big lofty ideas like they have control of the council, which they don't. Which is why I'm not a fan of most of them. So that's why I don't support a commission. But an ad hoc committee. All day. All right. So I know this idea of being tossed around of an ad hoc committee, what was the thought process and how long that would last? I'm open on that. But yeah, my motion, if we were going to make one, would be to do an ad hoc committee with up to three council members to meet monthly and report back to council periodically with updates. And I would say start with a year. And then we can visit it at the end of the year and see where we're at. I'm assuming it'll go longer. Yeah, I'd be willing to do the year and then have a look at it. Yeah. Just, you know, I don't want to be back here with my grandkids going, oh, look, that ad hoc committee is still there. Totally. I totally understand. Oops. We didn't sunset it. Yeah. Hopefully all the issues at that point will be solved. Solved by then. Yeah. All in motion? Yes. Yes. I'll second that. All right. Thank you. Any other questions? I'm going to pick the – Anybody like to serve on the committee? I think D had mentioned – Yeah, council members who – well, I would suggest that we appoint three to an ad hoc committee. Do – would it be best to appoint that tonight, Ms. Preston? You can – since you're forming it, you can – in this motion, you can indicate – sometimes people volunteer. Sometimes the mayor will appoint. In terms of the housing committee, it was more of a volunteer. The three council members, the two council members and the mayor who wanted to do that at that time, chose to do that. Yeah, when we had the one on homeless solutions, we had more than enough volunteers, and so I chose. That worked out pretty well. Actually did. I'm curious about this, so I'd be happy. You made the decision that I'd be happy to volunteer. Awesome. And I, of course, would love to have a volunteer too, because it's kind of important to listen more than three minutes, and having a two-way communication is something I'm looking forward to. Alright, so do we have three volunteers? Do we have a fourth? We can't have four. I know. No, I'm saying, but you could have more people volunteer, and then we could go down from there. Just don't want to push anybody off because they didn't raise their hand fast enough. I have some additional questions as far as the direction of what this is now that we're talking about, because there's this concept of quality of life, and I suppose it's designed somewhere in the measure, but what exactly are we seeing? What's the first agenda item on here? Because we have people come up and talk about public infrastructure issues. Is that what we're looking at? Other people have mentioned issues around homelessness. Not only do we not have a back and forth on these issues, but what's the first agenda item on here? We only discuss it in closed session. So what are we looking at for the agenda for this, or is that something to be determined in the future? I would imagine that being determined in the future. I don't foresee it being all homelessness, all roads. I foresee it being a little bit of everything. Could be on something that somebody thinks is going to be great for a dog park in Chico. Could be something that be, I got a great idea for the Kmart building that we could turn into families and kids stuff. I don't know. That has no purview over city council, and I don't foresee that. But I'm just saying I don't foresee it being all one item by any means. Because lots of people have lots of ideas on what they think could improve the quality of life in Chico. So would we open with just an open public forum? The public is invited to come and express any kind of quality of life? So if I'm going to chair the committee, I would choose a subject for each meeting that would be noticed. Not taking staff time or anything like that, but I would at least notice when the meeting is going to be, where it's going to be, and what's going to be discussed. And then we can have an open item at the end where people can say, hey, I'd like to talk about X, Y, or Z in the future. And then we can look at that for a future agenda. To take everybody's input into consideration. Do you have any proposed schedule to start off with as far as what these I just proposed once a month to begin with, and then if we need to do more. Sorry, I mean schedule for topics. The first topic will be the second. No, it was creation of the committee first, and then the committee would meet to create those topics. Okay. Okay. Okay. I had a question. Kind of two questions. One, when you, so in thinking about this, you mentioned like Kmart, this is public nuisance, so that's not public property, so apply. Correct, and that was probably a bad example. I was just trying to say there could be other examples, whether this isn't all just talking about bike paths and roads and everything else. I just don't think it should be, you know. That would not be a subject that I would put on there, but I don't think it should be a dog park. I agree. It should be a public nuisance. Yeah, I got you. I'm just, and then would you be willing to amend to a six-month review? I just don't want this committee necessarily getting out of control. Once a month for 12 months doesn't seem out of control. No, I know, but I mean. This was voted on by 60% of the voters, so I'm good with staying with a year. I agree that it was, but I don't, okay. Okay. I'm not going to go over semantics, but all right. So we have a motion and a second. Any further discussion? Madam Clerk. So the motion was made by Vice Mayor Reynolds, seconded by Councilmember Tandon, to have Councilmember Bennett, Councilmember Tandon, and Vice Mayor Reynolds sit on an ad hoc that would have monthly meetings and, for the first year, and they would bring their updates directly to the council. And at the end of that year, they would have a full review with the council. But in between, what I understood would be updates should something need to come back right away to the council. Is that? Sure. All right. Councilmember Bennett? Yes. Councilmember Morgan? Yes. Councilmember Tandon? Yes. Councilmember Van Overbeck? Yes. Councilmember Winslow? Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds? Aye. Mayor Grisham? Mayor Coolidge? Aye. Carries 7-0. Thank you. All right. Moving on to item 6.4, councilmember requests pursuant to AP and P-10-10. Councilmembers may verbally request that item be agendized at a future meeting after stating what the item would be. A majority of council is needed in order for staff to agendize. Councilmembers may also submit requests in writing. Mr. Mayor, I think you missed 5.4 and... What? You're reading 6.4. Oh, I am writing 6.4. Okay. Sorry. Reports and communications following reports and communications provided no actions under this item. Can be unless the council agrees to include it on subsequent agenda and then we have all the information only. So then councilmember requests. Thank you. All right. Do we have any councilmember requests? One once, going twice. All right. I do have one. Sorry. I knew I'd get Sean to grimace even though he knew this was coming. So I'll just say that I'm not going to be doing this. I would like to the council to agendize a discussion in regards to measure H funds to allocate 70% to our roads and 30% to public safety and parks. That's permanently? I mean... For this budget cycle. Right. And hopefully all future budget cycles but for this budget cycle. I wouldn't be able to determine... Yeah. I wouldn't be able to determine what future councils did and we wouldn't be able to memorialize that and set it in the sun. So we're overreaching. Yeah. So I'd make that motion. On what? Yeah. Sorry. I'm sorry. I didn't get it. All right. The motion was is that of the measure H funds, 70% of... So I'd like to agendize a discussion about having 70% of the measure H funds go toward roads and 30% go to public safety and parks. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Any other questions? Any other questions? Any other questions? Any other questions? Any other questions? Any other questions? Any other questions? Any other questions? Any other questions? Any other questions? Any other questions? Any other questions? friendly amendment would be to have a discussion about the allocation. That's fine. Then I will second that with my own friendly amendment. I've given away what I want. So do you want that to come back before the budget when the budget is coming back and we're having those discussions? Yeah. Okay. Alright. And it would be the allocations. There was a... So I made the motion. Council Member Morgan made the second. He seconded. Yeah. Okay. The friendly amendment to change it just to the discussion about measure age funds in general. Council Member Bennett. Yes. Council Member Morgan. Yes. Council Member Tandon. Yes. Council Member Van Overbeck. Yes. Council Member Winslow. Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds. Aye. Mayor Coolidge. Aye. Carries 7-0. I have another request. Council Member Reynolds. I would like to request to come back at the next meeting. A reconsideration of my vote for planning commission. Second. Okay. Just a minute. Okay. And that's a two-step process. And this will be the first step, which is to agendize the reconsideration. Council Member Bennett. Okay. Yes. Council Member Morgan. Yes. Council Member Tandon. Yes. Council Member Van Overbeck. Yes. Council Member Winslow. No. Vice Mayor Reynolds. Aye. Mayor Coolidge. I have the discussion. I'm crazy about it. Aye. Okay. Carries 6-1. Alright. Any further items from Council Members? Alright. With that, we will adjourn. Have a good night. Thank you.
