The only difference is from the previous lease is that you approved closing the gate so it has to be opened to the public but they are willing to open it up to the public when requested and other requestings as well. That' s the only difference we don' t have that public hour requirement because it' s a locked gate but the group has agreed to let members of the public in and it' s still available by bicyclists and hikers. It' s just cars are not allowed in their private cars. The term is five years. It' s a standard lease we' ve done with both the observatory and the rod and gun club with two five-year extensions as a possibility. I do believe Denny Whiting is here with the cea if you have any questions. would you like to come up and? I' m the president of the Chico equestrian association. I wanted to say we love our spot in the park. It' s very unique and in that uniqueness I think we do provide a nice presence to the community. These days I run into so many people when I' m riding in the park and their kids are flabbergasted they' ve never seen a real horse before. It' s super important and I' m so glad our kids are I think our community provides these experiences for our kids and adults. Some adults have moved from the bay and they' ve never been next to a real horse. I' m proud of our community that we have this in our bidwell park. Also we have tried to do a couple different things. We' ve had awareness days in the park where we' ve had our horses spread out all over from horseshoe lake down to horse and we have had a lot of horse and we really do try and interact with the community and not just have our own private little riding area. If you have any questions that' s great we love our spot and love our park. Any questions at all? go ahead commissioner. how many members are in your association and do you have stalls I' m sorry I don' s a very simple area. We have a parking lot and a fenced arena where people like to ride horses and warm them up. But mostly people like to park there and be able to ride the trails. We don' t stall our horses there. That' s never been allowed under this lease or at any time I know of in bidwell park. Actually the only time that was allowed is when the police used to have a horse program. the program. We would have a would come in for a weekend to do their training and you guys would allow them to have stables there and spend the night but we are not allowed to. thank you. what does it take to be a member of the association? thank you and how many members what it takes is a piece of paper filled out one that you have medical insurance that' s about the only requirement that we do have and it' s $50 a year and what that does for the person is they are allowed to have the now in this new system the combo to the gate and we put on a couple of different clinics for the members I forgot to answer your question we have about almost 200 members and we have a number of people that are in the park the past year and that goes up or down every year. We have a lot of people that don' t really participate necessarily in our activities but they understand the importance of keeping that area for horses in the park because once it goes like everything else it goes. I have a question for staff as well since this is a new the first time we renewed the lease with the gate in place what has the public feedback been on the! I have had a couple of people call me and right away I said no problem I always explained the benefits of being a member but we are happy to let anybody in there no problem except the drug dealers. Great thanks. Have you seen a decrease in vandalism since the gate? Absolutely. In the last couple of years we have had a vandalism and a lot of our members are I will say older and once in a while they would call me and say Danny there is somebody down here. We had identified a couple of specific cars that parked in there and then some really nice BMWs came down because it is such a hidden area. Absolutely we have had almost none and before that I said I used to be president of a club now I am president of disasters and things happening. It has really been very nice and safe. I had a couple of questions. Since there is a requirement that the facilities are available to the general public how often does the general public use the facilities? That depends if somebody wants to come in there is a number right there and of course we are all over Facebook and everything and I have had people call me. I have never had a call from a I have never had any negative comment about somebody who wanted to use it and could not use it because I am not always available but it seems like it. To let somebody in or give them the combo if needed because I always tell them we are not trying to keep horse people out or community people out we are just trying to keep the vandalism out and safety for our members if they are the only one in that area because it is general public are allowed to use it or those requirements under the lease it doesn' t say you have to advertise it but I don' t think people would necessarily know that the general public can use it unless? that was advertised for many many years. We just all wanted to see what happened like how did everybody respond to this change and I really have had not one negative comment on the whole procedure that we are doing. I think that is the most important thing that we are doing you can get into that area so many different ways if you want to you can walk from I don' t know probably 20 different areas so it' s not like people are being kept out it is not completely fenced it is just the vehicles. If they want to people walk their dogs in there all the time they treat it as a dog park a lot and that' s fine we don' t mind that at all. I think that is the most important I am just trying to see or trying to ascertain how the general public knows that they could have access to this property and the facilities if it' s not advertised anywhere if it' s not on your facebook page if it' s not you know what I' m saying but the requirement and the lease how do people know about it? a lot of times they will call our office and then we will give her the number for denny' s number out and the number that they call and it' s on the website. that was my question. any other questions? denny' s excuse me. thank you for being here. thank you. I' m going to make a motion to approve the lease. second. we' re still trying to learn the granicus trying to get some depth in the staff there. unfortunately the computers are not working so they' re not showing up there. thank you. thank you. thank you. thank you. commissioner alexander? aye. commissioner blashly? yes. commissioner where am I? glatz. yes. and chair thomas petty. yes. thank you. item 6.2 on our agenda is review we have reported that have occurred by dogs off leash during times outside of the approved dogs off leash areas and designated hours. report by linda hermann. yes. thank you. this is I imagine is going to be talked about more than just this meeting. I think it' s a topic that' s coming to a lot of people' s understanding that there' s some issues with the dogs. I just wanted to start that conversation so it doesn' t get lost. what we' re finding now is a lot of it before was the problem with the homeless dogs but now we' re seeing it' s not just the dogs from the unhoused it' s other dogs that are being let on leash even after the hours. as you know we have off leash until 830 in the morning. so a lot of people purposely come after 830 because they don' t want to deal with dogs off leash. that' s not happening now. they' re doing it all throughout the day. the last one I have, one of her friends was knocked down and broke her rib. every time I talk to someone another lady called me and said her dog had been attacked four times. when I got to the door I was like I don' t want to deal with it' s really becoming a problem with dogs off leash. I think part of the problem is the owners aren' t being very considerate also. they get angry when they say can' t you please put your dog on leash or this is off leash hours. it' s getting to be a problem. I think enforcement is needed of I want to get some ideas from the commission on how we can address this issue and make it still a place for dog owners to be also and dogs. I think we can do some more signage. we can start with that. I already talked to our field supervisor about doing the signage and we are going to make sure the easiest thing is to put it on the doggy pot stations because it' s already got a pole in place. I think if we did some sort of I talked to both rangers about and they have had some ideas too. I think Joel was wanting to do some sort of TV videos or something. it' s just a matter of getting together and saying we need a public education campaign. that' s what I' m coming to. we need to start working on that and getting the word back out to people that these are the rules. these are where you can and cannot have your dog off leash. that' s kind of just the start of the conversation for me. do we want to talk first? I know we probably have. it' s up to you. do you guys want to hear from the public first on this? yeah. how many speaker cards do we have? we have one speaker card. will it to jesus? hi. what' s your name? it' s willow to jesus. I' m actually a park pal. it hurt my leg. I haven' t been doing it. but anyway my husband and I are park pals. but I would never assume that I could go up to somebody and say put your dog on a leash. it' s true. people are really, really not open to hearing about what' s legal and what' s not legal. and it started just with near hit accidents on my bike. my husband and I are avid bikers. we are in the lower bidwell park. we are in the lower bidwell park. and the amount of incidences of being on a bike with dogs almost causing collision at least for us. I' m sure there have been real collisions. and the thing is you' re not going to maybe hear about this because as someone said to my friend it was my friend who was just recently knocked down by a really big dog. he wasn' t being aggressive. who knows why he came from behind her. not only did she fracture her rib but she had a seriously deep wound. and the owner offered no apology. no comment. just started talking to her about her own issues. I mean it was really crazy. my girlfriend was in trauma. so when people say we' ll get their number so you can contact them it doesn' t happen. when people are traumatized my girlfriend actually could not breathe because it was such a big knock down. and then I started telling that story to other people. and as Linda knows I put it out on next door. and just you know this happened to my friend. has anybody had some experiences with dogs off leash in the park? and it was a storm of information. and no matter who I talked to just before I came tonight my girlfriend who I didn' t even a different girlfriend who I didn' t even know said oh yeah I' m so afraid to go to lower bidwell park. and there are people who are elderly who are afraid of being knocked down by dogs. there are people whose dogs are on a leash who have been seriously mauled and attacked by off leash dogs. and I don' t really see that many signs and I don' t know even what the fine is because I wasn' t a dog owner. I' m not a dog owner. so I' m sure the general public is in that same situation. and I really appreciate the work and suggestions that you' ve made because I think it is a great way to get people to know that there' s going to have to be something where people actually feel there' s going to be a consequence for illegal behavior in the park regarding dogs. because otherwise I' m not a dog owner but I know enough dog owners that I' ve had to take to court over barking dogs etc. dog owners a lot of them not all of them but they don' t want to admit wrong doing or that their dog is the dog that' s going to attack you as my girlfriend found out she' s like oh my dog didn' t attack you it just ran into you meanwhile she' s like so yes I appreciate all the suggestions and I know it probably will be a lot about public education because the way it is now nobody seems to know anything about law and order in terms of their dog leashes so I appreciate you listening and that' s all I' ll say for now. thank you. thank you willow. we have one more. I just wanted to comment again I' m in the park quite a bit also on a horse which can be really dangerous also if you' ve got an attacking dog but I do have to say probably 80% of the people that I run into in the park they put their dogs on the leash and they always ask what do we need to do do we need to step off and so the problem with all of this is the people who have their dogs like animals and they' re supposedly under voice control and supposedly they don' t care about the signs you know what I mean they' re going to do what they' re going to do in the park and I don' t know how you combat it I don' t know if you' ve checked into other parks and seen what' s been successful I' m sure you would with them but the problem is how many rangers are in the park anyway so to be I don' t know I just wanted to say that I have run into many many nice people who do have their dogs under control but the ones that aren' t it seems like like you say what do you do about them is there a if I' m in the park and my dog' s off is there a fine yes there is I can answer that the first offense is $75 and then $150 for the second and $300 for the third oh okay so that' s significant I' ve never heard of anybody getting that before but you know the more people that maybe got that then they would be listened to but anyway that' s all I just wanted to say good luck thank you Denny let' s go ahead and open up the discussion then do I have go ahead Jessie go ahead you go first same here first question do we know how many off the leash violations we' ve issued last year last couple years I do not and that' s one of the things that Shane' s idea we used to get that information and put it in the division report the number of citations that were written by the rangers and he' s trying to institute that back and get that information from the police department second is I love the idea about media campaign and signage by far and away outside of homelessness this is the number one thing that I hear from people in regards to the park is people are not walking in upper park especially on guardian in those areas because of the dog issue it' s overwhelming so adding things in the media campaign people always oh my dog' s friendly well I also don' t want poison oak from your dog rubbing up against I also don' t want the ticks that your dog just now put on my kids so even if the dog' s friendly I follow the rules so maybe adding some components in there other than people thinking it' s a mall but you hit it perfectly Linda when you asked somebody can you please grab your dog they get confrontational with you they get fights but ultimately at the end of the day this comes back to the same thing I' ve been preaching for the last four years we have for the most part zero enforcement in Bidwell Park and it' s a huge park and nobody cares because nobody gets held accountable to it and I don' t know what we have to do to get rangers in the park I' m just passionate about it because I live in Chico primarily because of the park I love that park but if it' s a free for all and people are constantly telling me this constantly in my former employment I had to develop a program like this and this was in an area near a large city in southern California and it was also bighorn sheep habitat but the cost of the park and the complaints that we were getting were very similar to what I heard tonight so what we did is we did a large media campaign and I hate to say this before Facebook so we did a large media campaign and in that campaign we said that we are going to begin to issue citations and so what we did when we started we did ten days of pretty much verbal warnings hey we' re here this is a you know verbal or written warnings in fact we decided to go with written warnings and then after that we started citing people and one of the things that made it easier when you talk is that instead of misdemeanors which those have to go to the district attorney and that takes time if you can change them to infractions then they can go to a commissioner and it' s a lot simpler and easier on the on those so anyway we did that and yes it stopped I mean it reduced but you then every six months or something you had to come back and do it again but I think signage I think media campaign and then like you said if there' s no consequences they' re not going to listen and that' s where we' re at so that would be my suggestion and I think that' s it thanks yeah right now they are infractions and they are done through administrative fines that' s the money I was talking about so they go before the commissioner in the court or is it no it' s just a citation and they get a thing in the mail oh okay they get a bail the bail gets sent to them in the mail and if they want to fight it then they can go to the court commissioner correct okay good that takes the DA out of the commission commissioner schrier yeah thank you thank you for raising this linda and staff appreciate it and community members as well yeah so I think we all agree that it' s a problem I personally did not know that sycamore field for instance was only available to dogs off leash after 830 I think there is a good chunk of law abiding citizens who just aren' t familiar with the rules and every time you see a dog there you think oh a dog can be there and you know the hours are not clear to me as a frequent caper acres user kind of sycamore field area so I think signage can be improved I would also say maybe some temporary signage you go into the park frequently enough that you just start to blur out any signage so even if you' re passing it daily you don' t know that it' s there so you know some kind of like temporary signs that are in the walkways or things like that I like the idea of an awareness campaign but also as john said an enforcement campaign where we really say this is the time where we' re hitting this and we' re making people aware of it in advance and then frequent citations I think would make a big difference I' m curious to ask how you think the unhoused would respond in terms of do you think it would be an effective deterrent I imagine the unhoused getting a lot of citations and never addressing the citations I don' t know if that' s a reality or not so I' m curious to see what staff thinks about that but mostly I want to address this issue of what do we do about the really difficult people but I also think there are a lot of people who are law abiding who would follow the rules if they were more aware of them so signage awareness social media but also an enforcement campaign that makes it clear that dogs are really not allowed because your neighbor just got a citation and now you' re like oh it' s really hitting home but the question for staff is how do you think the unhoused will respond will it be an effective deterrent I think that' s a tough one because it is just a citation and they' re probably not likely going to pay that but it is going to be tough we just did an enforcement in the Bible Park just last week so we' re hoping that that will become less and less frequent that those dogs are off leash it' s just a problem all around so it' s going to be difficult to enforce when they don' t have a way it' s going to be difficult to enforce when they don' t have a way they get to a point where I don' t know if this is in the 1218' s is it the dogs off leash I mean the 918' s so there is a section in the code I apologize the 12R' s are infractions in there but there' s a mirrored code in the actual 9 chapter 9 and those are misdemeanors so it' s the same rules just in there and so sometimes it gives the police and the rangers discretion on whether you think it' s an infraction or is it a misdemeanor situation so the misdemeanor would go to court then at that case and then in terms of the communication and awareness around it I think communicating the hours where there are specific hours and the locations even looking at this map I can' t really tell exactly where dogs are allowed or where they aren' t and the fines would be helpful and then also who to contact if you are interacting with an aggressive dog or aggressive dog owner irresponsible dog owner who do they call just to make it easier for folks to remember yeah I reached out to Ranger Dillon and asked him about animal control and whether especially if someone gets injured or bitten they definitely will need to respond if they' re bitten by a dog so it' s good to let them call dispatch the police department and get them involved if that' s the case for sure but I don' t know about I thought maybe they could go through the park and do some patrols but they also have been short staffed and they just now I think got two animal control officers so maybe we can get cooperation with them and they can help with the outreach and education as well thank you Commissioner Glatz a couple things this is an issue I' m a dog owner for all you people so just putting that out there first my dogs are off leash in the park before 8.30 in the morning to me it' s not a dog issue I think we all agree it' s a people issue so how do you deal with the blank holes out there of the world versus because there' s also homeless people my dogs have been attacked both of my dogs have been attacked in the park by houseless people's dogs so one of the things I found dealing with our rangers both Dillon and Joel I think they' re pretty good at interacting with people that first chance these are the hours and if you do it again we' ll give you a ticket so that needs to continue but I believe I don' t speak for them second hand but I believe they' re as frustrated as the public is in what they can do with a lot of the dogs that are in the park having said that anybody whose dog knocks down someone doesn' t take immediate culpability for such find never show up in the park again whatever but one of the people contacted me because they knew this was on the agenda and I guess there' s a program in Colorado just something to think about where you can actually take your dog to the city or some place and get I want to say a permit but your dog can go through a testing kind of situation to make sure it' s a little bit more safe than others so that if you do get a ranger to approach you to give you a ticket you can show them basically some kind of permit I' m not saying that' s good 24 hours a day but at least it' s taking the public awareness maybe some place else but again the enforcement' s the biggest thing signage but one of the things that I think has to be included in signage but for all signage that doesn' t exist in the park is there' s no phone number anywhere in the park to call anybody whether it' s police non-emergency park service it doesn' t exist and it should be for any issue in the park dogs should not be it should be fires trash whatever it doesn' t really exist any place and that should be every quarter mile something just so anybody can pick up their phone and call if something happens the public education campaign of course because even having my dogs off leash even at 8 o'clock in the morning I' ll get yelled at for my dogs off leash when they' re perfectly allowed to be there and it does become confrontational sometimes because people just don' t know and everybody gets very defensive about it including myself by the way both sides get very it' s weird the dogs thing it is weird people get really upset on both sides of it and I understand the bike problem too because I' ve watched dogs you know rush out in front of bikes and things like that it is but it' s just it' s got to be education and the people who don' t adhere to the education deserve to be fined I' ve paid a couple of fines in my life back when Shane was giving them out and I learned my lesson I think and I don' t know if my wife ever did but I think that' s part of it is just the enforcement but it' s also not just rangers in the park we have bike patrols that I watch PD bike patrols go through the park but I never see them off trail because most of the time you' ll find a lot of dogs off leash is off trail and there' s almost like this unwritten rule if you' re going to have your dog off leash keep them on a trail because you' re never going to get caught so that doesn' t work well for people who are jogging on the trails things like that so it' s anyway as I said I don' t think it' s a dog person issue and how do we how do we balance as I used to tell Shane how can you give me a ticket for my dog off leash when that houseless person right there has their dog off leash and they won' t pay their fine but I' m paying my fine so it' s kind of it' s almost unfair but anyways so it' s a challenge I do think being a dog person it should be addressed because it shouldn' t be just free for all all day long in the park for dogs off leash I agree thanks commissioner Glatz I' m going to go ahead and give my two cents worth I' m going to give you my background on this issue first I' m a dog owner my dog has been attacked in upper park by an off leash dog and a very belligerent one belligerent human who almost got into a fight with my husband I' ve been run off lower park road on my roller blades and into a blackberry bush by an off leash dog I also as an attorney fought one of these citations in court for a client it' s been 20 years ago because of the lack of community awareness of what the rules were no signage in the park and one her citation was dismissed thrown out she didn' t have to pay her fine and I just looked and I thought this was the case dogs are not allowed off leash on any state park in the state of New York and I think and I' m a dog owner and my dog is very smart and completely under voice and whistle command that we' re almost to the point where I don' t know why we' re allowing dogs off leash anywhere in the park in the first place we have an off leash dog park at least one of them in town this is a huge deterrent for people to use the park it is a huge area of liability for the city I don' t see where the positives are in this regard I know people want their dogs to run free I know there are people who don' t have yards that' s what we have a dog park for we' re all fooling ourselves if we think there' s going to be more enforcement we don' t have the rangers for it we do not we do not have the presence in lower park or upper park to write more tickets I would guarantee you there are a handful in the past two years that the rangers have I would almost bet money on it I would I don' t see that as any kind of a deterrent our rangers have too much to do we know we need at least double the rangers we have now I' m just scratching my head I' m doing kind of a what is the benefit at this point if people are being injured if people are scared to use the park is it benefiting a small community or a small community I' m always trying to advocate for what is the best for the largest percentage of our population and I' m a dog owner I feel really sad for people there' s nothing scarier than having a dog attack you or attack your dog there' s nothing scarier than that it scars people for life they don' t want to be around dogs are we creating this experience are we creating this experience are we giving people PTSD I think it would be easier to enforce if we didn' t allow them at all I' m sorry that I have to say that because I am a dog owner and I know that most dog owners are responsible most of them are but this is a case of a few bad apples ruining the whole you know bushel or whatever so that' s my two cents I' m sad that I have to be extreme in that opinion but I am I want our park I want people to feel safe in our park and this is just one of the reasons why they don' t yeah I' m also a dog owner who loves to go on the unleashed area up towards monkey face and all that and I think it' s pretty delineated by the road if I' m not mistaken if you' re on the north side of the road dogs off leash and I was wondering when you look at the citations it' s interesting to see where they were written because I would imagine the majority of violations are going to be on the Yahi trail where the dogs can go play in the water I have a feeling that' s where you' re going to find most of the violations and then one other thing from the experience that we had in the place I used to work is as people continue to carry concealed weapons legal or illegal you' re going to have an incidence where a dog' s going to get shot and if this keeps up because a person if a dog truly they can articulate that their life is threatened by this dog coming at them and that gets to be a very bad time so just that has happened in the past not here but where I was Commissioner Glatz yeah sorry I' m going to disagree with you on a couple of things the whole state park versus city park I' m not personally a fan of that having spoke to state park police and a lot of the reasons they do it is because of the wild animals you can' t take your dog off leash in Yosemite because of a bear or something like that yes we have deer we have bears we have mountain lions we have coyotes we have everything they have in Yosemite we have in our park sorry to interrupt you so I' m not sure for me personally that analogy kind of works because other cities many cities including CARD was talking about allowing dogs all the time off leash in their parks right here in Chico before any drastic measures were ever taken I would sure hope we would try to figure out some sort of a public education process and enforcement issues before just saying no more dogs allowed off leash because right now it' s very restricted before 8.30 in the morning you' re allowing people an hour's worth of sunlight to do that and it doesn' t seem unreasonable in my point of view that' s it Linda DeLong do you know the history of why the north side was identified as a dog leash exercise area you know I was starting to look do you know Shane I was starting to look back to see what we I know dogs have been talked off leash has been the topic of the commission before in the past and I tried to find that and I didn' t see it but I can keep looking and see if there' s something there it goes back as far as I can remember I just didn' t know there' s some unique reason why that road was identified as a dog leash and I don' t know I don' t know I don' t know either but you' re right there are more dogs off leash areas with card parks now but they do have hours I believe for those I had a couple of other things well I' m sorry I interrupted commissioner Glatz that was very rude of me um I think I think I think that maybe I know we had a public survey done when we um when I had my interim appointment when we were floating the idea of the kiosks in um in upper park to pay to park thing um I don' t know if there' d be somebody Chico State that would be willing to it seems like this topic would maybe benefit from a public survey um I mean people are very passionate about their dogs people are very passionate about the park and based on the um response that willow got on next door it might be worthwhile doing some sort of public survey I mean granted if we wanted to change anything it' s going to have to be a change to the municipal code um so that' s you know that' s never anything that' s done um on a whim uh you know just because cards allowing more off leash doesn' t mean that' s right either I know someone whose dog was attacked at wildwood park and almost didn' t survive had to undergo multiple surgeries you and I both Jeff and I both have a lot of experience with this um so I think that' s a good way to um to get some that' s a good way to get some information to go with it in chico um yeah right down by in east glen um it' s dogs are supposed to be on leash it' s in the municipal code anywhere in chico that would be some continuity you know I' m sorry that maybe we' re I feel like we' re at this point at least with the unhoused situation that we still have now um there are dogs out there I noticed that most of them were tied up so that' s good um but there are just some shocking incidences and I you know it makes me very sad so I you know maybe we could check in and have some sort of a public survey um it seems like this would be a good topic for one more thing sure but in the meantime um but I would suggest possibly we can agree that perhaps the rangers could be talking to about interacting more when they see dogs off leash and explaining the rules and if someone' s belligerent their discretion can be used um I do think you could try some more signage but the signage should incorporate other things too I said the phone number even if it' s not just for that but we really really get into the signage issue and then start this public awareness because regardless of whether they' re on leash or off leash um whether this is you' re no longer allowed to have your dog off leash in the park people are still going to do that so you still have to have the education process whether that changes to never or before after 830 um I still think that it' s not going to happen overnight so that program can be to begin to begin to be developed now so that 60 days from now or whatever you guys are on to Facebook start and we have it start and things like that but I think the rangers could be asked because I asked them not to you know to reengage with the people when they see them you know just around just to educate people you don' t have to put the hammer down yet but soon so that' s just my well your comment also assumes that the rangers aren' t doing that I mean we have great rangers I assume they are doing that you know they are letting people know what the rules are in the park not just the leash off leash rule another problem I have is that before 830 we heard from Willow again that some of her early bird friends do not want to go to the park before 830 because of the dog issue when you know they should be rewarded for being up and being active in the morning but they don' t want to be in the park because of this um we talk about signage all the time but you know it' s not that that takes money um that' s a process that' s not going to happen right away either I just don' t know what if there is an immediate uh what we can do immediately to help this problem because it seems like it needs to be immediately another thing about the off leash rules you need a map to figure out okay where can my dog be off leash and where they can' t it' s not just a matter of some words you need a map for reference so that makes things a little more complicated um I just want this to be one of those things we' re actually doing something about people are getting hurt people are scared and people are deterred from using the park no it' s not an action item does anybody else have a comment or a question but thanks for bringing this to our attention and thank you members of the public for coming here and speaking and for you know starting your own conversation about it because you know that' s what we need so okay are we ready to move on then for now okay so we' ll table this for further discussion I would like I don' t know I think the survey idea you know is just something we could get it out there who' s in favor of the off leash rules as they are who' s in favor of no off leash I mean it could be pretty simple three or four questions but okay we' re on item seven reports and communications oh what' s next steps so we threw out a ton of ideas a ton and I just want to note this just doesn' t disappear because I know surveys cost money and I know where that' s going to go in regards to surveys oh we don' t have money what' s the next steps well the next steps would be starting with the signage you know I already talked to the field supervisor because where the dog' s off leash is on those big rule signs and gets lost right it' s not just one that has a dog and no leash and it' s probably one that we would also say you know please pick up after your dog as well so I' ve seen I think Commissioner Nava actually sent some samples that she' s seen also in that so I think that' s a good start especially at the doggy station you don't necessarily know where because they're running around all over the place, then you don't have the opportunity to pick it up and clean up after your dog. So that is a problem too. And we know people don't trail after their dogs and pick up after them. So anyway, but okay. So I guess we'll trust that. Yes, I guess we'll just wait to hear back after more signage is eventually put up. I guess I just, I'm sorry. I'm like a project base. Like, hey, what's the next step? Next meeting we'll discuss like, or we'll touch base and find out how many citations. And we'll maybe this month we'll ask the rangers to be in the park and try to emphasize dogfights. Dogs off leash. I'm just asking the group. Could we request just as a background for people who are here and don't know how we do business, we are not allowed to put any of our own items on the agenda. So we could not vote to put this on the agenda again in three months. We are not allowed to do that. We used to be allowed to do that, but we can't anymore. So that's why. You can because I brought it up as a staff driven. Linda, but we can't say, we can't vote to put it back on the agenda in three months. Yes, you can because it's related to this item and I brought it to you. Not you. You didn't request it. So, okay. Well, I would like to move that we agendize this item again in three months time. Can I add if it be possible, we have one of the rangers here to talk about their contacts and what they have found and, you know, in their enforcement efforts. Yes. Two. Thank you. Thank you. I'm in the process of reaching out to the target team sergeant to talk about the ranger program and where it is and where we would like to see it go. And at that time, I'll ask him about having a ranger here. There's been a lot of challenges, as you know, with the ranger program over the last several years. Just the change in the program itself and then the lack of staff on the ranger team. But then also thrown in that mix, we had a couple. The things that have led to this perfect storm, I believe, in this leash scenario. We had COVID and then we had the huge influx of unhoused people into the park during that time. And as an enforcement person, they were put in a very difficult situation to, and as Commissioner Glatz just mentioned, oh, you're going to write me a dog off leash ticket, but you have so-and-so over here doing X, Y, and Z. It was very difficult. But we' re getting back to some normalcy and the timing is perfect to do some outreach to the target team and bring our rangers back into the park. And report on citations and warnings like we used to do so we do have an idea of how many warnings are being given for dogs off leash and other things and how many citations are being written. This is all in process now. I do think it' s possible to have a ranger come in and speak to this. Because it wasn' s a very Because it wasn' Because it wasn' s a very Because it wasn' s a very Because it wasn' s a very Because it wasn' s a very Because it wasn' s a very Because it wasn' s a very Because it wasn' s a very Because it wasn' s a very Because it wasn' s a very s a very Because it wasn' s a very Because it wasn' Because it wasn' s a very Because it wasn' s a very Because it wasn' s a very Because it wasn' Because it wasn' Because it wasn' what the public information campaign is going to look like and then we can give you thoughts on that. That's what I would like to add to the motion. Yeah. We need a second. I'll second that. Commissioner Alexander. Aye. Commissioner Blashley. Yes. Commissioner Glatz. Yes. Thank you. Okay. Okay. Thank you, everybody. Thank you, guys, by the way. thank you. thank you. thank you. we are at 7.1 and this is our parks division report and linda hermann. yes as usual this is just an informational item only and if you have any questions about the report or would like to ask me I am here to do that for you. thank you. does anybody have a question for linda? commissioner scherer? no I don' t there was just not to call anybody out. there' e someone in the audience who hasn' t spoken and I thought you were adding to the erosion control on the park. thank you for all of the updates about the erosion control in the park. I think that' s important. glad to see city staff collaborating with a number of others on that. thank you. it' s been a great collaboration and tremendous amount of work that' s been done. unfortunately we' re going to get five or six days of rain and heavy rain but we' re keeping our fingers crossed. there' s a little bit of mud in the creek and the mud that' s coming down is actually higher up past the ecological reserve and the people that' re doing the work on their property. that' s what you' re seeing possibly. but yeah they did and the resource conservation districts have been great. yeah. and do you have an idea of what percent has been treated so far? I believe I think they had you know I don' t know. I know that we have they' ve done over 700 or so. I know that we' ve got 50 we have about we had 50 the last I heard in the park just that first week and they' ve been working there this week because the roads are too wet to get into their ecological reserve. so or to beat up because they had fema in there and starting the clean up review. so they' ve been working in the park the last two weeks. we had the ccc's were gone for a week so it was right now that' s just a small crew from the been treated in their properties up above. I think I have to go back and look but I want to say they had thousands that they had to do but I don' t know if it was 2000 or 1000 but I can double check that. I think in the park ours was a couple hundred I think or 100 something I believe. thank you. hey linda so it' s not specific to this report but I recall that email about the south park drive and some kind of a group what' s going on with that? I need a little clarity on that one I wasn' t quite sure. so it' s in the design process and they' re just putting together a stakeholder group as what you saw in that email that' s why I sent it to you if you wanted to appoint someone on this commission to be that regular person to go that would be an opportunity you could do that. but yeah so right now it' s just in the early stages so they' re just trying to reach out and get a stakeholder list and that stakeholder group will meet more frequently in that process of design but it' s scheduled to be done. south park drive is supposed to be so the south park drive is I think slated for 2026 so they' re starting that design for the south park drive. so maybe because there' e be new commissioners up here I guess come january february whenever that is maybe we at least bring this back then to have those people. probably what I should do is have someone from engineering come and speak to this group they' re the ones who' re leading this project and have the more information about what the steps are. so she' ll have more input on it and stuff like that. it would probably be good if they came to speak to the new group. yeah. just didn' t want to get lost. thank you. any other questions or comments for linda? thank you for a thorough report as always. and then we have item 7.2 street tree division report. richie bamlett urban forest manager. thank you. thank you chair thomas petty. again this is for information only. but I' d be happy to answer any questions the commission may have. I did read where you have a new crew. is that the additional crew that we talked about? yes. very exciting. that' s crew number three. congratulations. now all of those new stuff won' t make they won' t all exclusively be in a brand new team full of brand new people. so we will mix them up. so currently we have the experience level of the crew ranges from 15 plus years to a couple of weeks. so we' re currently looking to mix them up and change them around according to the objectives that they have. because they have different types of equipment now. so we' we have a lot of equipment that can do different things and prune and remove various trees of different sizes. so it' s exciting that we can put a program that can pretty much cover every type of tree maintenance issue throughout the city. so yeah. very pleased. congratulations. . hey. sorry richie. I just want to say thank you for everything you' e been doing. because I' m not sure how long I' ll be up here. but just thank you for all the years and continue the good work and stuff like that. is there anything we can be doing to help you? I don' t know. is there any issues that the commission can actually try to support publicly? yeah. great question. well, you know, coming up we are looking to do another community tree planting which is always well attended by, you know, the public. so you will certainly get an invite for that. so if you' d like to come along, do some tree planting. and, you know, mix with the folks with the shovels and get your hands dirty. we' ll always take your volunteer work. I have a question. how is upper park looking? how are the trees looking? you know, I haven' t been up there for over a month. but when I was last there, it' s green enough. it' it is coming back. as I mentioned in the report, we did remove the 55 worst trees along upper park drive. they just really had no chance of coming back. they were just literally toast. but the other trees, we plan to, you know, do a routine reassessment monthly. and just use time that' s on our side. and now the moisture that we' re going to get, we're going to use that. and just see how the trees come back and how they respond. I anticipate we probably will still have to remove a handful of trees regularly. but I think eventually we' ll get to the stage where all the trees that are presenting a hazard to park users have been removed. and the remaining trees are coming back. I hopefully anticipate that the number of trees that are coming back will be higher than the number of trees that are still in use. I think the number of trees we do have to remove will actually be, I would say, probably maybe a quarter of the trees that we've assessed so far. over 700 trees have been assessed. but so far when you look at the percentages, you know, 55 out of 700 plus is pretty good. so I'm hoping that those numbers remain low. you know, the ones that we have to remove. but as you'll know, we're still trying to get the trees that are coming back. I think from the profile of the fire, there were some super hot spots where everything was incinerated. and there really was no chance of anything coming back. but it is starting to green up. some of the trees that we thought would be dead are actually starting to sprout back at the base of the trees. and a lot of our native trees are fire adapted. this is what live oak does. this is what blue oak does. and they come back from fire. so in the future, it may well turn out that we're actually just looking to prune back some of the sprouts. and new trees will come from the sprouts that we do manage to grow into the next generation of native trees. so you're kind of in wait and see mode until spring for much of Upper Park. yeah. and then by springtime, we'll have a better idea of really what's not there. but the reason is, the trees are not going to make it. one other question I had. I have a pretty good view of North Rim, and the part where the fire started. it's very bald. would there be any chance of reseeding some of the area that has just completely been deforested? is there any chance? is there any need to do that? is there any chance that that would happen? I know you can't speculate now, because we don't know what's... yeah. It's going to happen over the winter and in the spring. Right. It's a great question. Possibly with acorns, I think, if that's what you're alluding to. Well, I know that there are no root systems that's, you know, erosion. I think that, you know, there's nothing to prevent that hardcore erosion. Right, right. So that's maybe something that, well. Yeah. So I will add, though, too, there are, we haven't assessed, they've had eyes on them, but we haven't marked the trees on Ten Mile House. There's quite a bit that will need to come down off of Ten Mile there. So that is going to be done by a registered forest professional. Our resource conservation district is going to get somebody out there to mark them. They assessed them and looked at them, but they stopped marking because they were finding they were marking everything and we were monitoring them and we didn't want to confuse them. We wanted to confuse people if it's a blue dot or, you know, blue X or white X. So now we stopped doing the blue and we're just going to mark the ones that absolutely have to come down. So where's the money coming from for? Actually, the council is going to, supplemental is on the council agenda tomorrow for, they're putting $200,000, I think, in there to cover those costs. And then also I'm going to attend a workshop on Thursday to talk, because there is some money available for local agencies to get reimbursed for the costs that they've done. So I'll know a little better after that on Thursday. Anybody else have questions or comments for Richie? Richie, are you doing an analysis because the density of trees, especially native trees, when you're taking them out, are we going to end up with a lot of brush? And is Scotch Broom going to be an issue as these areas are open? And how? Are you going to do any type of brush removal or just let the brush take over? Are you referring to the Park Fire burn scar? Yeah, I'm sorry. Yes. Because there was, you know, so many areas were burned, so many trees are coming out. And if you don't manage it, the brush is going to take over. And I heard at the Ecological Reserve they did have Scotch Broom in there. Right. And do you? Do you anticipate any of that? For sure. Yeah. And if the Ecological Reserve has it, we may well get it. Yeah, it certainly is an invasive weed. And I'm familiar with it from Scotland. It's bad. Yeah. We used to burn it in Scotland. So, yeah. I mean, a prescribed fire with Scotch Broom, it burns pretty hot. So it's scary. But, yeah, I guess we'll see what comes. And obviously with Linda and Shane, you know, it may well be that we end up having to develop some programs to try and control it. Because, yeah, we certainly want to make sure that it doesn't get a foothold. Because, yeah, a continuous cover of Scotch Broom would be terrible. I think it's Spanish Broom. It's what? It's Spanish Broom. Oh, Spanish Broom. Yeah. But we do have a herbicide contractor. Okay. Yeah. And so he's... He's been taking it. And last year they used a crew from the Ecological Reserve to, like, hand remove it. And then he sprayed it immediately. So that is one of the targeted species that we're using under the herbicide contract, too. And then Shane's also done some work with volunteers on Linda Channel. It's pretty bad Linda Channel, too. How about you don't get tan oak in there, do you? Have you had tan oak? I hope you don't. I haven't seen a lot of it, just single specimens. Yeah. Not a great issue. It's not an... It's a non-native and I'll take over. All right. Thank you. Okay. Linda, since you mentioned Linda Channel, do you know if there's any work that's occurring on mitigating it in the Sycamore drainage area at all? The mitigating the Spanish Broom? Yes. Yeah. I don't know if... He's not spraying in there, is he? I think... Is Dempsey spraying in there? So the strategy on that watershed is... You know, starting at the ecological reserve and going downstream and he's progressively working down. I know there's spots in Linda Channel where there's some huge swaths of Spanish Broom and we've worked with Fire Safe Council. We did some volunteer days and did some broom removal. So as volunteers are available, but we're just... We're gradually making our way downstream. So... He's doing it on the edge where the diversion starts. He's treated that area in there with Linda Channel. But the Sycamore Channel is also, I think, the county's responsibility. Yeah. I didn't know if you just knew anything about it or if it was kind of outside your preview, but it's pretty thick there. I just had the opportunity to ask that question. It is. Yeah. It is. Anybody else have questions for Richie about his report? Thank you, Richie, as always. Oh, I do have a question. I always have to get our update on the tree that was... Came back on appeal that was causing a medical issue. And they had to come forward with a plan for mitigation. What's the status of that? The willow tree has now been removed. And three replacement blue oaks have been planted. And we're monitoring for the survival of those trees. Okay. Well, I'm glad that's off your plate, but... Well, sort of off your plate, but not happy about that outcome. So... Okay. If we don't have anything else, we are adjourned until our next regular meeting, which will be, I believe, December 16th. Sorry, I lost my... Yeah, just a reminder, that is earlier in the month because of the Christmas holiday. So it is the 16th. December 16th, 2024 at 6 p.m. right here. Thank you, everybody. Thank you, members of the public. Thanks, commissioners, for being here. Thank you. Thank you.
