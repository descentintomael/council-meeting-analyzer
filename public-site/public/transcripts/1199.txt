We have two. All right. Okay, and I'll call both the names, and if you could go ahead and stand in the middle aisle. Stephen Hazel, followed by Dexter O'Connell. Dexter O'Connell. And you may want to get your mouth closer to the microphone if possible. Stephen Hazel, 2001 Notre Dame Boulevard. I live at Jarvis Gardens. Long time no see. I like the speech you gave about being removed because the first time I addressed you, you cut me off when I said Jarvis Gardens was real there, but in the Bible it was false. I thought that was quick. But since then, I've got 180 minutes in. Since then. But since then, I've been cut off about half time. Apparently, you don't understand that when I address the council, it might appear to the person not know what I'm talking about. I'm not on the subject, but I really am. I'm establishing some foundation kind of synergy, like when we talk about affordable housing. I'm talking about jobs, but I bring it back again in three minutes. I satisfy that element, that housing overall, you've got to develop just right for your land. And it's got to stop. Rather than that, when it goes to—it's been already witnessed by Winslow that at two times, the door's been locked. So you've kept me out. So I'll be just speaking. And by doing that, it's issues like autumn leave and even the other issues that you kept me from speaking on. Okay. I'll talk about the election. I'll talk about the election. Now, the election, I can say right now, you know where I am. I've told you before. I've got—okay, I was born that way. My birthday is in two days, December 6th. The other guy is George W. Bush. Okay. H-W-E. Okay, no, I'm going to go. I'm just telling you. I'm going to go. I'm just telling you. I know, I know. I'm not a kid. Last warning. I know. I'm not a kid established like a gender or pronoun. No. I'm saying I'm that. And people say, well, prove it. I'm just saying, hey, just give me a chance. I'll get off of it. I'll get on the subject. Okay. I have a giant jersey that gave me God wanted God to. God to has it. I'm able to give it to you. I do. I have an absolute shirt. I said, I don't want to sit behind a home plate. They give me a seat off. I swear to me. It's a true story. I have an autograph from the Goldbergs girl that says, to God, our number one fan. I do. An autograph. Okay, I'll get on the subject. Okay, I just want to establish who I am. Okay. Other than that, so it's not an issue. It's not really about me. You want to know if you're certified? Well, of course. I like the 2000 election. I can say it's accurate. But even though it's accurate, what happened to you? You were recalled. Even after. It doesn't matter. Because the minority people, they dislike you for whatever reason. But you survived a recall. This could happen here. It's certified, whatever. But you can look to the future. These people can still be recalled. They're fine. They're probably perfectly for the job. But there's always an element that can do that. You know, use a system, whatever. Even though they're wrong, right? Because you were recalled, right? A bunch of voters, right? You can say, wait. A minority person. You went with the majority, right? So, you understand. You cut me off. And you realize, I'm for you. You understand. Even with the homeless. You understand. These guys are squatters. You cut me off before I get to the end. And I've lost about five minutes of time. That's right, Mr. Hazel. Could you give me at least one minute? Mr. Hazel. No. That's time. Thank you. Next speaker, please. The next speaker is Dexter O'Connell. Excuse me. Mr. Hazel, please do not make me escort you out of this meeting. Your time has expired. Thank you. I'm hanging up. You've got to go to reality. Next speaker, please. I want to offer a point of order. You're not going to try to let me over the question. I'm very confused. You're a Chico. Who's that? Who's the party? Thank you. Hello, members of council. Dexter O'Connell, formerly of Chico. It's a pleasure to be back. I first met my friend, Bryce Goldstein, when I was working as a city planner for the city of Chico. And she said something. She said something very insightful about tree removal at a planning commission meeting. And we've been friends since then. And I wanted to come to council because two years ago I came to congratulate my friend Addison on his election. And I felt like it wouldn't be fair to shortchange another friend of mine. So it's a genuine pleasure to be back in Chico. I will again thank my former boss, Brendan Veague, and his whole team for their generosity to me when I dealt with some family issues that forced me, unfortunately, to leave the city. And effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively! effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively Do we have any council disqualifications on any of the items present? All right, no items removed from the consent agenda. So with that Member Bennett Council member Morgan council member Tandon. Yes council member van overbeck. Yes council member Winslow Yes, vice mayor Reynolds. Hi mayor Coolidge motion carries 7-0 We'll now move on to our special agenda It is indeed special item 3.1 our official ceremony recognition of outgoing council members and we will start with This is Topeka Tandon if you want to join me down in front I Cannot say how pleased I am that this is my last final action It is really great to do this and do it in your honor So I think anybody who knows to be got understands that she's somebody Who loves her community more than any other trait? And I really believe that that deeply she cares about the folks that she represented during her time So the funny thing is is that Topeka actually Went to everything no matter how scary it is no matter how lined up the other side is Whatever it might be she walked into the face of it every single time she was there. She took the hard questions a lot of hard questions During her time on council and she did this job both with honor and dignity But I've never seen them before so she's truly someone Who I think we can all be very proud of but I think our community can be very proud So, you know We have districts for a little while She was the first first load to win district seven and and the interesting thing about that is she really embodied her vision in So many ways she cared about them but she also made sure to make efforts to get to know them to walk and talk to them and to actually represent them I can't tell you how many times in conversations and I can disclose this because it's not really partial any background discussions that she started a sentence with the people of my district or the people of district 7 or we're not going to saddle district 7 with X Y or Z or district 7 deserves a representation so she was always looking out for the people that she represented and that's a trait that's just amazing and I think very honorable so you also did a little bit of besides agendizing some great items over the years she served on the Internal Affairs Committee she was the alternate to the Vina GSA committee she served on the Government Affairs Committee three core and then for a while also for the continuum of care and more than that she also took center stage when we were dealing with the homeless issues so to be good myself Scott you were all formed were part of the committee that we sat right here in this very chamber and not only did we discuss with various organizations so we brought in a group of conservatives abroad and liberals brought in group of homeless advocates who brought in a group of perennials and we brought in a group of conservatives and we brought in a group of providers on the homeless issue a lot of people have got this because long time ago that we actually had these discussions about three and a half years ago but we brought in all those folks and then we did something we brought in police and fire to have discussions with them law enforcement as well but then we did something even crazier I believe it was the Peekahs idea is let's fight the entire public in we'll sit here for an entire afternoon and we did and listen to every single opinion so we put that out in the community came and the three of us listened to that and it was a great idea and I'm glad we did it and I think it really gave people a voice on the homeless issue that they were hurt we didn't sit up at the dice we sat down here we invited each person in it was COVID so we had them come forward and we actually talked with them we asked them questions we gave them their three minutes but sometimes we gave a little bit longer a little more strict on three minutes it's up tonight sorry to be a guest I'll give it to you it's been fabulous having you here. I know your community service will not end. I've known you for a long time before we sat up here. I know I'm going to know you a long time after. I know your community service is in your heart and in your soul. And it's not just necessarily tied to sitting on that die. So for that, I am incredibly grateful. We have this wonderful plaque for you, which again, I have to get on my muscles to read. Now when I started City Council, I didn't have a class. All right. Topeka Tandon, City Councilmember. In recognition of Councilmember Tandon's four years of outstanding leadership, significant contributions, and exemplary... We've got to not put that word on anymore. Exemplary commitment, great commitment to our community. Topeka's gracious manner and ability to collaborate with her peers and subsistence helped ensure the community and citizens were at the forefront of every decision. And that is that has worked perfectly with the exception of exemplary. So, congratulations. Thank you so much for your service to the state. And you have flowers. So, at this point, we will turn the microphone over to you, and then we're going to have to hear from Congresswoman of Office. Thank you, everyone, for being here today. And, you know, when I came to this country in 2007, I never thought that I would be honored. And I'm very grateful that I had this opportunity to serve this wonderful community. I do want to thank everyone who voted and respect their decision. This, these proud, you know, that is the reason we have elections. And I want, I'm very humbled that I received support from a lot of community members, although I'm not going to be on the council, who agree with my vision for this, for Chico. And I really, really, really respect everybody's decision. And I'm not one who won't any hard feelings, which I faced in my last four years. When, so just want to say that we need to still work, you know, together, no matter how much we do not agree with each other, there is no reason to hold any sad or bitter feelings for anyone. Because for a small community like Chico, that is a big thing, and that work makes us special. I just want to let all of you know that how blessed we are to have the wonderful team of people that make City of Chico run. And being in the council for four years, I, we, I realized how committed and dedicated they are for everything they do for City of Chico. Will I have a lot of applause for them, please? I would also like to thank my family, my husband and son. I will be home on Tuesdays, most likely, most of them. And I just really want to congratulate all of the new members of the council. I want to thank all of the newly elected council members. Thank you for running in the race and being here. And my current members who are going to be there, joining them. And I hope you all work together as a team for City of Chico. Thank you. Hold on just a minute. Terry DuBose. This is Terry DuBose from Congressman Doug O'Connor's office. Thank you. Good evening, everyone. My name is Terry DuBose. I'm a district representative for Congressman Doug O'Malpha. It's an honor to be here tonight. One of my jobs throughout the county is to work with elected officials. And it's been an honor working with Topeka. She is not necessarily the loudest voice up there on the dais, but she is doing the work. And she does it from her heart. So it's been just a pleasure to work with you. I know everything that you've been doing. And I hope that your future is bright and happy with your family. And we'll see you at the market. But thank you for your four years of service on the council and your dedication and commitment to the City of Chico. Thank you. And I'm a certificate of congressional recognition. Thank you so much. Take a seat if you want until we're done. Okay. Okay. I still have stuff up there. All right. It's my turn. Mr. Morgan, do you want to come on down? Yes. Be nice. Be gentleman. Pick podem. Nice. Where is his hat? He's got two. I have two. He's lucky. He's such a show off. You have two, too. Okay. Andy, what do I say about you? Good stuff. We've actually been opponents. Have we not effectively effectively effectively effectively We have. And we've been colleagues and we've been friends and other things. You've taught me a lot about politics from all the different campaigns you've run all over Northern California. And that's where you got your start. You've given advice to me. You've given wisdom. Sometimes they've been the same. And that's been helpful. And I appreciate it, whether it was during a campaign or whether it was from the dais or whatever it was. And the reason that you've got two plaques is because you've been so involved for so long. Far more than your eight years of service call for. So here's what I wrote for you. In recognition of Mayor Coolidge's four years of outstanding leadership and significant contributions to the Chico community, and your support of small business, which makes the whole city work, has been unwavering as he champions city programs such as Shop Local, as well as dedicating a portion of American Rescue Plan Act funds for a small business grant program. Mayor Coolidge has worked tirelessly to strengthen the community, and to strengthen the town and gown relationship, ultimately partnering with the university to ensure that businesses took an active role in Chico State's Wildcat Weekend, creating simultaneous success for the city, the university, and local businesses. Whether demanding a fence be built along Union Pacific Railroad tracks to protect university students, or identifying ways to ensure the vitality of Chico Regional Airport, Mayor Coolidge's tireless dedication to the city of Chico, effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively Four years on the Finance Committee, three years with three corps, two years with Butte County Associates of Governments, and three years on the Air Quality Board. But probably most impressive, Andrew is one of the few council members ever, crazy enough, not only to serve two terms as mayor, but do them back to back. Becoming the city's lead cat wrangler, peacemaker, mediator, and dartboard for anyone not willing to follow the rules of decorum. Mayor Coolidge. On behalf of a grateful city, thank you for your dedication and tireless service. We wish you well and good luck in your future political and personal endeavors. Thank you. There's no way I'm not wearing the glasses. Although I was at a photo shoot yesterday and somebody taught me if you pull glasses out, you add that. It's like 10 points. It's what your IQ seems to be. So if I wear yours, I'll be at like 15. In recognition of Mayor Coolidge's four years of outstanding leadership, significant contributions, the same thing I just wrote. Okay. You don't get to read it, except I did say Chico Regional Airport. And if I was going to say one last thing before I turn the mic over to you, I have someone to give it to. Whether we agree on it or not, your tireless effort supporting air service to the city of Chico is unmatched. And when it comes. Not if. When it comes. I hope we call you and get you there. Because you led that effort. And I'm sorry it was in the way. So I want to call up again Congressman LaMassa's district rep, Terry Bowles. Hey, Andrew. Hello. Hi, Andrew. I just want to say thank you for your eight years of service. The time it takes to be away from family and your friends and your life to sacrifice, to be here for the city, your commitment and dedication to the city has been unwavering. I know prior to me working for the congressman, we had some conversations as I was working on downtown things. And sometimes we would. Not see eye to eye. But at least we had those conversations. And they were very important. And I will always remember that. So just congratulations. And I hope your future is bright. And on behalf of Congressman LaMassa, we want to give you a certificate of congressional recognition. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. been valuable. Casey, we've known each other for a long time, so I really appreciate everything you do for the city and your leadership as well, and for covering all those crazy things that I couldn't go to. Topeka, I think I've said my fill on how wonderful I think you are. Addison, I can say this. It is wonderful to have somebody on the council who you don't agree with, but yet can have a friendship with. And I can't tell you how important that is. To the oncoming council members, the bitterness rival needs to end. It's politics, but that doesn't mean it can't be changed. Talk to people, get to know them, respect them, and move forward, against them or for them. Sean, a lot of ways to manage. I'm a mentor, a lot of ways a buddy. The person I called probably when I was most frustrated, because he calmed me down the quickest. I really appreciate it, man. I can't tell you. Sean and I's family actually goes back some years, and we didn't quite realize it until 2012 that our fathers were buddies as well. So it's important for me to carry that on. Everything I really do appreciate. So I'm going to buzz through staff here real quick, guys. So, Debbie. Thank you. The words aren't even there. And your staff, Angie, Amy, Christina, have all been great. Thank you for everything you do. You're the young son heroes of the city. Jen, I couldn't have done a lot of this stuff, including that state of the city, without you. So I really appreciate it. Mark, I'm glad to have you in this leadership position. It's great to serve with you up there, but honestly, I like getting this chair, because you really can lead. And we don't have to deal with the politics of it. You direct the leadership. You direct the leadership. You really are a great product in terms of so many items and issues with intelligence and a memory that is unparalleled. John, thanks for stepping in. We really appreciate it. You're a wonderful person. Very grateful to have you here. Brendan? What? Brendan A? It's Brendan V. We did those crazy Chico Country Day school meetings in here where we had mock councils for little kids. I put those on the board. You know, those were really really, on myself alone and it was tough without you but talk about a guy who cares about his community it's been great mr. Aldegoni I will not call you and ask you details on our project right before I go meet with the media anymore but he's been great and the knowledge he passes is super so and Eric you know I've driven you crazy sometimes and I appreciate everything you do for this day your department and everything you guys do behind the scenes is very monumental and very important. So Chelsea, those negotiations and Barbara, you too. And, you know, we both miss, I don't know, we miss Scott, but your leadership after he's gone and Chelsea, yours with our negotiations. It's just wonderful. Of course, our chiefs back there, I'll lump you both together. Without you guys, we wouldn't have the amazing departments that we have, both police and fire. So thank you so much for everything you do and for the men and women who serve under you and everything they do for the city of Chico. I have to say thanks to Carter and Alyssa and Brody for being here. Linda, I wouldn't have been able to do this without you. Thank you so much. Claire's here with my son, Adrian. And Adrian, so my daughter, Lisa, and my son, Adrian, have been the ones who have been with us for the last couple of years. And I think they've been the ones who, wow, have been the ones who have really been supportive. They've allowed me to do this. And as crazy as it is, but, you know, they got towards the back runs because of it. I would have never won an election without your help. So I appreciate it. And Steve, same goes to that. Thank you so much for everything you guys do. So to the citizens of Chico, for those who weigh in on all the issues here, thank you so much for doing that. It's very important to this community. But I am the one who's grateful to you for allowing me to do this. I've always tried to do it the best way I could. I know I didn't please all the people all the time, and I don't think you can. But thank you so much for allowing me to serve the city of Chico. Thank you. With that, Mr. Morgan, come on down. I'll turn it over to you. And I broke it. So I'm Debbie Preston, your city clerk and elections official. I've been here for 24 years. I've worked with a lot of different councils. I've sworn all of them in in the past 24 years. It's been an honor to do that. So I get to swear you out? I don't know. I don't know. But whenever I do it... Let's hear it. She waited 12 years to say that. He was always in charge of my Evaluation. And now he can't fire me. So I don't need to do it right now. It is an honor to recognize Sean Morgan for 12 years of service, working tirelessly for our community, for our organization. And serving his two years effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively as the mayor and many other positions I'll talk about in a minute. Starting on day one and continuing over the 12 years in office, Sean's keen operational understanding played a pivotal role in quickly assessing and addressing significant structural issues facing the city on day one. He was sworn in on December 4, 2012 and was immediately faced with a $15 million structural deficit with about $3 million in cash on hand and tonight he walks out leaving this organization with clearly defined budget policies and systems in place to ensure the fiscal success of this organization. Oh, and he's also leaving the organization with $200 million in cash on hand. So I'm looking right at Barb and being like, oh my gosh, you're out. I wanted to see if he remembered. Also worth noting, Sean never shied away from his commitment to public safety and when he leaves he will be leaving the city with 106 police officers. Versus the 68 when arriving in 2012. Lastly, in 2012 he also found approximately $5 million was allocated to street repairs and improvements while today that allocation is now over $70 million. Sean worked tirelessly to support and champion staff efforts and implemented policies to ensure that resources and infrastructure were in place for the city to be successful. All the while, never ever once forgetting his fiscal responsibilities for our city. His financial acumen and promise for more budgetary transparency along with council guidance over the city's complex financial system has ensured that the city of Chico stands ready to serve future generations. And no one can say that Sean was ever afraid to make tough decisions. He never wavered from what he believed his responsibilities were as a council member, as well as when serving as mayor for the two years. He ran efficient council meetings, applying the rules equally in order to ensure that council actions could be taken in an orderly manner. Sean's leadership during those two years as mayor paved the way for efficient meetings as well as safely dealing with rioters who were night after night packing the chamber and threatening staff and council. Very tough time for all of us. Also in 2018, he never hesitated in looking for ways for our city to help Paradise residents during the aftermath of the Camp Fire. I've always said that being elected as a council member is not from the faint of heart. You need courage, resilience, and a strong will to do what you do. You need to be willing to collaborate in order to develop solutions, even if the vote doesn't go your way. And you need to be willing to attend lots and lots of meetings. Lots of them, right? And Sean knew all that and so much more. I actually added up all the council meetings that he attended over the 12 years and it came out to 298 meetings, totaling 1,125 hours during those 12 years, which included a few Saturdays, lots of late nights, one 15-hour budget meeting, one five-minute meeting, and please note that number of hours does not include time that was spent in closed session, nor any of the meetings that he was on for standing committees and local agencies. Those additional responsibilities included two years on the Internal Affairs Committee, two years on the Economic Development Committee, two years on 3COR, ten years on the Local Government Committee with four of those years serving as the chair, ten years on the Finance Committee with five of those years as the chair of that committee. Sean not only spearheaded a new process for the evaluations of the city managers, city clerk, and city attorney positions, but also served as the chair of that committee for over six years. He additionally served four years as the chair of the Town and Down Committee, three years as the DCPA liaison, two years on the Chico Urban Area DPA, and one year on the Butte County Emergency Services Council and Butte County Selection Committee. He spent a lot of time helping our community. So on behalf of the City of Chico organization, I want to thank you, Sean, for your commitment to our organization, to our community, and for all of our citizens. For your tireless efforts to ensure that the city was on a solid financial footing, and for your belief in staff. That was important.

Congratulations, Sean. Thank you. Don't worry, folks. You guys are going to take office. We're almost done. Real quick, I'd like to invite up your District 3 State Assembly Representative, Mr. James Ellender. Well, it's a pleasure to be with you guys here tonight on a great occasion. I did want to be able to be here to say a few words about my colleague and my friend, Sean Morgan. Twelve years of service, of leadership, exemplary. I think that's the word. Leadership. That I look back on the campaign trail and working on many challenging issues facing Chico, facing North State. You have been thoughtful, caring, sometimes very blunt, sometimes using choice words that maybe I wouldn't have used. Like exemplary. But always with a heart for the city, which you grew up in. And every instance, I always saw that. The care that you had for the city. You came in at a time where there was fiscal distress in the city, and you helped bring it out. You navigated a lot of trials and travails in the aftermath of the campfire. And navigating homelessness that many cities in the state have had to face. And the leadership of this council that you were instrumental in, I think, was very exemplary. And so tonight, I just wanted to be able to say that. And also, you know, the city of Chico, you know, you guys have an amazing legacy. This is a, this is the jewel, you know, of the North State. And it's because of a long line of leadership over many years that, Sean, you've been a critical part of. And I also want to recognize the other two council members who are who are outgoing to be contended. And and Mayor Andrew Coolidge. There you are, Andrew. Also, I mean, three great leaders, you know, who have served this city very well. And it's been an honor to be able to serve with you as an Assemblyman and work with each of you. In every instance, I have found you to be very caring, capable, thoughtful people who are trying to find solutions. And that's something that we desperately need, you know, in these times. And did let things, politics, get in the way of finding good solutions for the city. So to all of you, I just want to say thank you. And I do also have resolutions for all three of you. Sometimes the state's a little slower in processing things but they will coming and we will podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem! podem podem podem podem podem Sean, it's great to be here with you today. I'm going to read my IQ by 50 points. So I got a prepared statement and then I'm going to give Sean a mic so I have to be very careful. You know I have a gun, right? I'm prepared to say that the word doesn't work. Yep. And I see you can shoot. Sean Morgan, Chico City Councilmember 2012-2024, 12 years. Served as Vice Mayor 2014-2016 and Mayor 2016-2018. Sean, your original campaign message was clear. Return Chico to its stated mission. A safe place to raise a family, an ideal location for business, and a premier place to live. In this, you have never faltered. During your tenure, you have influenced the community. You have influenced and counseled many local, state, and federal officials. You've played a major role in local elections that have been and continue to be pivotal to the direction of this city. Including paving the way for every single councilmember currently sitting on this dais. Well, except you guys. It hasn't always been a smooth road. You've stood up to media protests, attacked from enemies, and even more disheartening, attacked from friends. You've been silenced by judges, threatened with sanctions, and even jail-tight. Yet, you've won three elections, gaining popularity in each one, and obliterating one ill-fated and poorly executed recall. You've endured three United States Presidents, three California State University Chico University Presidents, 17 different city councilmembers. Six mayors, five city managers, four city attorneys, and yet only one city clerk. Over the past 12 years, you've led through the Oroville Dam crisis, the Paradise Fire, a corrupt financial staff, and personally raised millions of Aaron Rodgers dollars for campfire survivors. Amen. You've helped your sons graduate from junior high, high school, college, grad school, possible for parents, performed 12 weddings, and even had the honor to pin a badge on a lieutenant for the Chico Police Department. But yet, you always stayed true to your mission. You've gone on countless police and fire by-laws, showing your support for all public safety. Through all the years, you've stayed true to yourself and your mission. Being the voice of reason, while realigning the city's strategy to its stated values. For 12 years, no one has ever wondered what you were thinking regarding any city-related issue, because you couldn't tell them. I often get asked a question, how we met and how this friendship began. No, it was not in high school, as once stated by the News and Review. That would be possible, because Councilmember Morgan is very much older than I am. . It was actually 12 years and one month ago, election night, the night Sean won his first election. I was a patrol officer that night. I was dispatched to report an argument at the Diamond Hotel. Apparently, Wayne Cook, the owner of the hotel, and the drummer of B.B. King's band, had a difference of opinion regarding the outcome of the presidential election. I got there just in time to save the drummer from Mr. Cook, as Mr. Cook was quite a boxer back in his day. . When I arrived at the Diamond, I saw Councilmember Morgan, and said over the police radio for the first time, Chico, I'm out with Councilmember Morgan. I was the first person ever to refer to Sean as a councilmember. Tonight, I finish the same way I, correction, we, started. And last to say, Councilmember Morgan, you leave this city in good hands, and for that, your community is grateful. . I don't really need the microphone. Do I? You do. I do. I'm told I do. You do. That's the last time you get to tell him what to do. I know. Thank you. So, friends, supporters, my colleagues and staff, thank you. We leave the city better than we found it. In better hands. And it took all of us. Together. The thing I am most proud of is to be succeeded by Michael Bryan, a good man who has been and will be a great councilmember. Congratulations to you. To my detractors, naysayers, opponents, . . .

Is this on? Okay. So, as we watch Sean leave, and all the other council members, this is an extreme honor. This is the part where we swear in new council members who have agreed and been out there pounding the pavement in order to get elected and meeting people. And we're grateful for your willingness to do this for our city. I'm going to swear at them individually, and I'll be doing it alphabetically, starting with Dale Bennett. So, Dale, I hope you could come down here. Come down here, please. And then when you are finished being sworn in, you can go ahead and take one of the empty seats. Even if it's the mayor's position, don't worry. We'll figure that all out later. So, just take a vacant seat. So, congratulations, Dale. Thank you.

Congratulations, Mike. Hey, Mike, you're supposed to be up here. We'll wait for Mike to get up. Let's see. I kept the seat warm for you. Thank you. Yeah, there's his hand sanitizer. Perfect. Okay. All right. So welcome, council. Now we're going to go into the nomination process for the position of mayor, so then I don't have to run the meeting. Well, at least for the next meeting, I won't have to. So it's a nomination process. It doesn't require a motion to open nominations or does it nor does it require a motion to close the nominations? the way the process works it's I Went once I open the nominations I will accept the names if there's more than one will vote on more than one person Unless the first person who receives a majority vote and that's four votes or more becomes the new mayor And they serve for two years they're appointed every two years for by the incoming new council as Well as the the current seated ones, so that's how the do you have any questions about the process? It's it's Sometimes it ends up being where we talk over one another but Just know that as soon as I open up the nominations you may nominate who you would like to serve for two years as in the position of Mayor so I will open nominations now For that position I wish to recommend and acknowledge that Vice mayor My vice mayor Reynolds, excuse me be considered for mayor Okay All right Are there any other nominations I'm a council member ran over back, okay I nominate council member O'Brien Okay council member Winslow All right, so once we receive four more votes Then we won't continue voting on each of you so but thank you for that. So now I'm going to do a Roll call vote and it'll be an alphabetical order because we don't know exactly How that's all gonna play out so on council On vice mayor Reynolds who is currently serving as our vice mayor. I will begin voting so for Casey Reynolds to serve for two years as the mayor Councilmember Bennett. Yes Councilmember Goldstein. No Councilmember Holly. Yes Councilmember O'Brien Yes Councilmember Reynolds Aye Councilmember Van Overbeck. No Councilmember Winslow. No Okay, she received four affirmative votes and that's a majority vote. So Casey will be Okay And Then I Am Going To Move Right Into The Position Of Vice Mayor Who Has Has also serves for two years, and I will open up nominations for that position right now.
