Okay.  Okay.  We'll go to the next one.  Yes, Steven Hazel.  By the looks of me, I'll reflect to you, out there across the street, the only city council  who puts a mask on, got a home assault, but who wants you to do the job you're doing?  Now, if you got a subject matter that's off the table, it's not on here, off the table,  just tell me, please.  I'll run it by my legal department.  Last time, he said what?  Assassination was off the table.  And also, this is any matter under jurisdiction, so it's a wide broad range.  It's not what you think you vote on.  Now, it's a wide range.  You got to check it out.  You didn't know what public comment was.  It's the only city in the whole world that didn't know the name of this thing, public  comment.  I'll get back with...  Now, my name is Steven.  Now, I've got to get on the right step.  So, my name is Steven Hazel.  My name is Steven Hazel.  Right step, are you a pet or a pest?  And I'm about life.  My name is Brian, Brian.  My last name is Hazel.  I have AIDS.  See, it's more or less, I'm 1 to 26.  That's my birthday, 12-6.  Okay.  I am God.  I'm actually God.  I'm a God.  Okay.  My son is Jesus.  Okay.  And it's funny because I usually address certain people and say, you would know God if he was  standing right in front of you.  And I'm actually standing right in front of you.  And you didn't even know me.  And, you know, I'm a Christian.  And I don't mind being very courteous.  And I don't mind being very courteous.  And I don't mind being very courteous.  and money. And yeah, we want  who puts, no,  no, I'm going to give it to you on a silver platter.  A Chico Red.  We want these bones of  big kids. In fact, they're 450  acres for the site.  I should just take it because, hey,  it was a sweet, but hey, you lost, dude.  You lost.  So all this  shit is a Chico. Hey, we  won this time. Usually they lose.  We got screwed. But we won.  So yeah, we won.  So  I'm getting to the matter.  I don't preach it unless I'm a token.  I said the governor  and, well, ex-governor and current  governor preached the horrible  debt to trigger the federal emergency money.  And I gave the progressions and went from  40 to 65 to 100 CFS.  And when Bill Crowe came out,  he said, he slipped and said 100 CFS,  I mean dollars. He goes,  I mean dollars. And  the two never came out. That's when  Jerry Brown was governor. Now the  whole world wants to get new sabbaticals. That's it.  He committed treason. And I came  and he cut me off. And I actually was  thrown in an assault. That's how I  lost my three teeth because I spoke  at city council.  I should be afforded more time.  The governor would get more time.  And I'm actually that guy. God, you should.  Because actually, I own you.  You're under me. Not just as a citizen.  Of course. All right. That's fine. Thank you.  I should get more time. Okay. Fine. I just asked for more time.  Thank you.  Ma'am.  I heard, but I can't.  Ma'am, if you continue to disrupt  the meeting, we will ask you to leave.  And you will leave. Please stop  interrupting the meeting now.  Thank you.  All right. Next speaker. Steve Perez  followed by Janica Kramer.  Hey, everybody.  My name is Steve Perez. I have the privilege of serving  as a president at Chico State. I just wanted  to take a couple minutes to come and thank you all  for all that you're doing for the city.  And in particular, what you're doing for downtown.  A vibrant and safe downtown is vital for our success.  I've been here a couple of times and talked about  how important the relationship between Chico State, Chico is,  and in particular, Chico State and downtown.  When I talk with students, when I talk with families,  when they talk about what brings them to Chico,  it is this partnership, it's this environment,  it is the downtown. It's where they get to live,  where they get to learn, where they get to work, all of that.  And so I want to thank you all. I want to thank the Chico State.  And in particular, I want to thank the Downtown Chico  Business Association. We've partnered with them  on any number of things over the last year, couple of years.  We're partnering with them and you all for Wildcat Weekend,  which is October 5th. It's a showcase for the university.  You're all cordially invited to come on down and see  what we've got going on. But in particular,  I want to thank the DCBA for all that they're doing.  So thank you for the time. Appreciate it.  Thank you.  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem Thunder Diner and Cafe, and then Capre Acres, and finally Bird in Hand, before heading back  in hand before heading back home. On our way to Morning Thunder, I noticed a syringe on  the paved path in the park, and I'm taken aback, but we continue, and as we do, we notice  the tents and the trash. I have noted them before, but there seem to be more, lots more.  And after breakfast, we head to Caper Acres, and as we cross the bridge over the creek,  a family with teenage kids on bikes pass us and stop us to wait for me and Rory. At first,  I didn't understand why, but suddenly I noticed that we have passed into an area with 10 to  15 tents, and several of its tenants are visibly on drugs. The dad looks at me and says,  stay safe. Bikes with us pass the 10th encampment. This is near Chico Women's Club.  Once in downtown, I start to relax, and as we hit Broadway, we step off our bikes and walk  them on the sidewalk. Right after we cross Second, just in front of the old B of A, I hear cursing,  and I see a man biking towards me and Rory. Rory's walking in front of me, and as I lock eyes on the  person cursing, I see him waving a knife at Rory with his left hand while steering his bike with  the right hand.  Bitch, I'm going to slice you. The blade of the five-inch knife is two feet away from Rory's face.  In shock and holding our bikes, we freeze, and he continues past us, and about five steps behind us,  he waves the knife at a woman in her 70s walking her small dog. He continues his cussing and then  waves the knife at a mom with a baby in a car seat stroller just crossing Second. Three women  and two children. It is Sunday at 11 a.m. in downtown Chico. We were walking to a toy store.  I come out of my freeze, immediately call 911, and within minutes, the police are circulating.  Thank you.  The officers take all our statements and let us know that they have apprehended a man that fits the description.  Only one of us is by law allowed to do an identification, and I offer to go and see the mom and baby,  and now I go to see the person.  Rory and I go with the police to where they are holding the suspect, and as we pull up, I have doubts, and so I cannot say yes,  and after I have already said no, my son says, Mom, that's the man I know because he had the colored pants and that  beard picture on the hoodie that Daddy has. He's meaning to see our Nevada logo. I tell the officer about what Rory said, and I say, Mom, that's the man I know because he had the colored pants and that beer picture on the hoodie that Daddy has. He's meaning to see our Nevada logo.  But at this point, it's too late.  He was close enough to the man and to his knife and at the right height to see that there was a logo on his chest and the color of the pants.  At this moment, I feel like I failed to keep others safe.  I was just more confident.  If I was just more confident, I could have stopped this man from hurting others.  I'm here today because after the fact, and after lots of anxiety following this Sunday, I don't feel like I failed, but that I have been failed.  The responsibility is with the representatives of this town to keep our public spaces safe for everyone.  I don't think a person that slashes at people feels safe either.  They're safe.  something fundamentally wrong it's either mental illness or there's something that gets a person  to do that and we're not in a safe space either one of us if we want something to change we must  facilitate change and no not wait for the problem to go away we cannot wait for people to be safe  in public spaces we cannot wait for people to be mentally fit let's get out of homelessness to get  rid of the drug addiction and move the tents from our public spaces my ask is my ask is that our  city representatives will see the urgency and act that's time thank you thank you you can have some  one more outburst and we will dismiss you from this meeting for interrupting a public meeting  that's your last warning charles with whom followed by karma  yes we don't speak now no counselors staff thank you very much for your time tonight  north state shelter teams revised managed campground proposal 2024 is just a request  for a discussion  you  we just want to talk about it with city staff to see if we can team up to make some new progress  on our shelter crisis i hold in my hand letters of support for our managed campground proposal  from true north housing alliance faith lutheran church the housing authority of the county of butte  chico housing action team first christian church among others these are all groups that want to  effectively effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively With a challenging multifaceted situation, I suggest to you it might require a variety of responses. Our proposal has input from successful programs from up and down the West Coast. You'll get a flyer after the meeting that shows four. As I speak now, there are more tents in Chico parks than there have been in a long, long  time. Prior to North State shelter team making an application we suggest that  the council direct staff to meet with representatives of our team of  nonprofits and see if we can't bring our unique local experience and regional  best practices to the table to see if we can either refine a current program or  offer a new one. Let's talk. How about let's align our objectives make some  new progress based on successful award-winning programs. Thank you.  All right so we'll move on with public hearings. First one  Oh,  Oh,  we have one more speaker. Yes, karma.  Thought we had four.  Tara karma.  She added it in before they started speaking.  All right, three minutes.

I just, you know, if anybody else wants anything to say, send me a file.  Ma'am.  Ma'am.  Point of order.  So I wanted to talk about the homeless problem.  Out of the night that covers me, black is a pit from pole to pole.  I think whatever gods may be for my unconquerable soul.  In the fell clutch of circumstance, I have not winced nor cried aloud.  Under the bludgeonings of the winds, I am bloody, but I am not.  In this place of wrath and tears, I am a man.  podem  podem Lieutenant Tupper and Mr. Cox, canine, Chico Beatty, I just want to take a knee because  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem !

It happened to me.  I tried to kill my dad.  He had to grab me.  He had to choke me out.  So then I went down to Ducky P.  I was like, Greg Patterson, go arrest my dad.  He had fingerprints.  And then Ducky P. is like, Ken, do you want to arrest her or do you want to arrest you?  Ken's like, I never got an E.O.  I never got an E.O.  So then I got a 16th birthday.

Upon close of the public hearing  tonight it is requested that council  approve submission of the report to HUD.  This concludes my report. If you have any questions I will be happy to answer them.  All right.  Questions?  Mr. Wenzel.  A lot of the funding that went into these projects came from the  disaster relief funds came through  the federal government originally.  So the actual amount that we are  looking at here is pretty small in comparison to all the  money that is going out into projects.  Do we anticipate that steep of a  drop off in affordable housing  production once all these projects funded  through the disaster relief subsidies are gone  or done, well, built?  Um.  Yes.  Because of the special allocation that  we received from the disasters.  So in, it was the disaster recovery  funding plus also special tax  credits that were allocated to our  area.  And so we saw a huge drop to help  replace the units that were lost.  And so we will see a decline  just because it is special funding  that federal government  allocated directly to  it is allocated to the state and  then the state is going to have to  And then the plan goes to butte  county and then the city got a  portion of that.  any other questions?  thank you very much.  With that we will open the public  hearing.  how many speakers?  none.  we will close the public hearing  and entertain a motion.  so.  it is 4-1.

Do we have a timeline in the report on when will those  steps that Attorney Mr. Lamb has provided, when would they be  completed?  Those steps need to be completed.  Those steps need to be initiated by the DCBA.  So it is up to them.  And I do know that they have created a committee to look at  that process.  In total, I would have to go back.  I'm sorry, Council Member Tandon, and give you an exact  timeline of the steps from beginning to end.  But the first step and something that they're working on right  now is doing an inventory of all of the businesses.  So really getting an understanding of what are all of  the businesses that are part of that DCBA district.  And that is information that they're going to be able to  And that is information that they have to have because they  must be able to reach every single one of those businesses  so that they're aware of any change to assessment and have  the opportunity to protest that.  You're welcome.  All right.  Another question?  Oh.  As the...  Go ahead.  I'm not going to ask you a question.  As the liaison to the DCBA, I know that they are making  progress relative to the revision of the assessments.  They have taken an inventory.  They have taken an inventory of the downtown businesses.  I think that has been completed.  And I can't give you any more information other than they are  diligently pursuing the assessment process.  Thank you.  All right.  Thank you.  Council Member Bennett, appreciate that.  All right.  I think we're good.  We're good.  You have one?  Are we going to have a discussion?  Yeah.  Well.  So.  Do you have a question?  Well, you have to do public comment, but then we can have a  discussion.  But if you have a question.  I'll ask.  No.  Okay.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you.  How many speakers?  We have three.  All right.  Three minutes.  Okay.  And if you can come to the microphone and speak clearly so  that everyone can hear you.  It's Audrey Taylor followed by Linda Zorn.  Good evening, Mayburn Council.  I'm Audrey Taylor, President of Chapin Concepts and volunteer  for DCBA.  I'm here.  I'm here instead of Greg Scott, our president, who is not able to be here.  But tonight we do have Vice President Sherry Anderson with us.  We do have advisors and board members here with us and also staff.  We first want to thank you very much for your support for the last 18 months.  We've made significant progress on the three-year plan.  I think you will see that in our report.  But we've been working very hard on the focus areas, which have been,  the organization, engaging businesses, the events, and marketing.  At our last board meeting, and thank you, Mr. Bennett, for being a liaison,  has been very active on there and also volunteered for our next committee,  which is a revitalization of downtown on the vacant buildings.  That committee has been formed at the last meeting.  We will be taking that to the property-based improvement district,  the PBID board, to get their participation in that.  Because it's under their peer review regarding the property buildings downtown.  So we've been moving forward and I'm happy to answer any questions about the report  or what is happening at the DCPA, can't even say it.  And I want to again thank you, the council, for supporting us  and also want to thank the Target team.  They're awesome.  Thank you.  Just one quick question for you, Audrey.  You've been working really hard as a volunteer.  I see it.  It's been a long time that I've seen you in a really important role.  I heard talk about hiring a general manager or executive director for the DCPA  and I'm curious if that's something that you anticipate happening in the next six months or so.  So we have a general manager and that's Debbie LaPlante.  Oh, okay.  Over here.  Great.  And Lucia, we have one full-time staff.  We have three part-time staff.  So we're going to continue that way.  The president, Greg Scott, is actively involved in spending probably at least 20 hours a week  on DCPA and PBED, too.  Great.  Thank you.  Thanks.  Linda Zorn, followed by Louis Moreno.  Good evening, mayor and council members.  My name is Linda Zorn and I'm the executive director of economic and workforce development at Butte College  and I'm also a DCPA advisor.  Butte College is very pleased to have entered into a partnership with DCPA  on a downtown Chico art placemaking initiative supporting the arts and culture in downtown Chico.  This will involve several Butte College programs and result in multiple public art projects.  So stay tuned for an announcement later this fall regarding the details.  We are also collaborating with DCPA on several of the Oktoberfest events.  Two examples are October 12th, the emerging artist exhibition, and October 26th, the Oktoberfest fall art show,  which will highlight Butte College ensembles.  So we look forward to these and future collaborative ventures in support of DCPA.  Thank you.  Louis Moreno.  Good evening, mayor and council members.  My name is Louis Moreno.  I am the assistant director at 3COR.  3COR is the economic development district that serves Butte, Glen, and Tehama counties.  Our programs provide support to small and micro businesses  and the downtown businesses encompass a large portion of Chico,  along with a large proportion of the DCPA.  The DCPA is a large-scale nonprofit organization that's a part of the DCPA's small business community.  So we're very pleased with our partnership with the DCPA in promoting and supporting these businesses.  Over the past couple of years, we've collaborated on several initiatives,  including last year's Small Business Saturday activities and this year's Young Entrepreneurship program,  where youth were allowed to participate as vendors at the Thursday night market.  We intend not only to continue this program, but to strengthen it and possibly even replicate this model in some form.  of our other areas within our three county region and we're very excited to continue this partnership  with the dcba and continue working together and continue supporting downtown chico thank you very  much all right last speaker last speaker all right okay thank you uh the further discussion  mr ran over back i believe you have a point yeah i i was downtown during the taste of chico  event which was uh two weeks ago last week whenever it was anyway uh it was fantastic  uh everybody that participated every restaurant that participated was packed  uh so great job audrey and the rest of the team really really great job  i was just going to add my two cents on that as well i was down at the event and um  did just meandered through several businesses and it was  very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very  really exciting to see everybody out. Went and listened to the band for a little while afterwards.  The feedback that I've gotten from most all of the vendors were they were just packed. They were  running out of items, didn't have enough, you know, almost to feed everybody. But we're going  out and getting other things because they wanted people to be able to test their wares and all that  good stuff. So I thought it was a great event. Hopefully next year we'll see even some of the  stores that aren't typically open on Sunday stay open. Or was it Saturday or Sunday? Sunday.  I noticed a couple and I was like, oh, you're missing out on so many people. But it was a great  event. November and October have so many fun things coming up. And so I'm just excited to see.  Thank you, Debbie. You just, Ms. Mosley, you have an amazing skill for doing events and pulling  things together and being organized and really appreciate everything you did to bring that  together. So thank you. All right. Further comments? All right. Mr. Bennett. I just want to  add  that your new office on Broadway is absolutely beautiful. That's a fantastic addition to the  DCBA's efforts to revitalize downtown Chico, to support downtown Chico. So I just want to say  congratulations. It's very nice. All right. Anyone else? Okay. I'm going to add in my two cents, too.  I'm very pleased to see you guys obviously opening what Mr. Bennett refers to as your office, but  effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively Additionally, obviously, we're doing some some work on the making Wildcat Weekend a big deal. We'd love some merchant participation in that. And I think that's coming together great. So we're we're getting thumbs up out there.  effectively  the city and the city is  end up supporting the city as we  get more students here is  vitally important to chico I  think we'  re all talking on the same  page it'  s nice to see. Any others  with that we will accept the  report. Item 5.2 is the  response to the 2023 grand jury  report and we have a report from  city manager mark sorensen.  thank you mayor the item  before you is the 2023-2024  grand jury report. The report  contains findings and  recommendations related to the  city of chico and the city  council is required to provide  written responses. At the  september 3 meeting council did  discuss the item and referred to  committee to draft a response  and before you is that draft  response for your consideration?  that is all.  thank you.  just a quick one. There is  a couple of things I wonder if  the recommendation was  misinterpreted and I'  m curious was there any  interaction between the grand  jury foreman and city staff in  order to get any clarification  on any of these things?  no. I didn'  t see anywhere there was  clarity lacking.  I will have comments after  public comment on it.  thank you.  all right.  how many speakers?  we have three speakers.  all right.  three minutes.  mike johnson followed by  grace marvin.  ladies and gentlemen good  evening. I'  m a local business owner here  in chico.  my family and I have worked and  lived since 2010.  I once served on the red bluff  union elementary school board  and I'  m currently an officer in the  u.s.  council.  I am deeply disappointed with  the majority of the current  council.  not only for your ineffective  approach on homelessness in  general but also a base of  specific remarks made here by  councilman morgan and mayor  coolidge on september 3.  the council's years along  extremely expensive tack of  enforcement has resulted in  institutionalized whack-a-mole  upon many hundreds of chronically  homeless people.  whenever it can the council  majority approaches the matter  behind closed doors.  lacking public transparency.  and now the majority is using  the recent grants passed to  decision to give itself an out to the agreement that legal services made in good faith.  The disdain with which the current majority received the grand jury's report could not  be more evident. Yeah, just keep it to the grand jury report would be ideal.  That is your right. Unfortunately, that disdain also resulted in a lack of basic courtesy or  respect to the grand jury itself. In the remarks two weeks ago, Councilman Morgans and Mayor  Coolidge's public remarks came across very poorly, frankly lacking understanding of the grand jury's  role entirely. Grand jurors are average citizens. They could be any one of us. Chosen anonymously,  they are briefed in by expert witnesses in relevant agencies, and they make their decisions  and recommendations with no political agenda or financial incentive to any one of them.  Indeed, once deliberations end, grand jurors simply return to their private, anonymous lives.  Their decisions are, by definition, intended to be informed and impartial, favoring nothing and  no one other than truth itself. On September 3rd, Councilman Morgans' dismissive  report was released. It was a report that was not intended to be informed and impartial.  The grand jury's recommendations were irrelevant because, in his view, the city had already tried  everything and failed. Mayor Coolidge then worsened it with his dehumanizing comments about  homeless population deaths.  All right, so here's how we're going to do this. We're not going to insult or interpret what people  said. You can certainly say what they said. You can make comments about them, but you cannot make  or interpret exactly what they said with words like dehumanizing. So we keep it,  relative to the comments, relative to the action, but not to the person. All right?  As long as I have my time, sir, thank you.  Yes.  In her words, compromise of people that are often going to die anyway.  Even tonight was described a clearly disturbed person as tonight's entertainment.  Okay, so again.  Sir, this attitude of flippance and futility reveals a very deep misunderstanding of homelessness  in general.  And particularly so your responsibility to us all.  Are we really to believe that we've just given up on a thousand of our fellow citizens and neighbors?  Dismissive attitudes towards constructive criticism is exemplified by the report.  Only emphasize the lack of inaction to actually reduce homelessness and reduces the public's  confidence in our elected leadership.  As Justice Gorsuch noted in his majority opinion on grants passed, homelessness is complex.  Its causes are many. So maybe the public policy response is required to address it.  I want to believe that the council can find a better way forward on homelessness.  But at the very least, the citizens of Chico, all of us, housed and unhoused alike, have a right to demand leadership from the council.  You don't have the option to just throw your hands up and defeat.  No one may take your oaths of office, but we have every right to expect that you will and demand that you uphold them.  We really are all in this together, folks.  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your time.  Grace Marvin, followed by Julian Zenner.  Yes, please.  First, I'd like to make a comment about hearing.  Many of us have had difficulty over the years and this evening, too, about hearing from different speakers.  And I saw that Ms. Presson had a speaker that she offered to one person.  And I'm wondering if that might be something that you generally announce at the beginning, that people could use such a speaker.  If they wanted to.  Because often we can't hear much of what is being said.  The other thing I wanted to mention, relevant to this topic, is that many of us citizens don't feel like we are being heard in terms of what we would like for the City Council to do vis-à-vis homelessness.  And therefore, it was very upsetting to hear, to watch on TV, because we didn't come here.  Um.  Um.  And effectively, we don't understand how effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively  that it is presented, there is just silence on the part of city council.  And so many of us members of the public feel like we are not being heard.  And that's all I wanted to say.  Thank you.  Julian Zenner.  Good evening.  The air conditioning gets to me.  City council members, my name is Julian Zenner.  If you don't mind, I would like to comment on your handling of the Chico unhoused  and your response to the grand jury report.  To accuse the grand jury of ignorance and lack of diligence  is not a good thing.  It is so ironic.  Let me remind you and the public  that the Chico City Council approved a settlement agreement  arising from the Warren v. Chico lawsuit  unbelievably without any of the council members actually reading the text.  You relied on the summary of the current,  the current city attorney,  whom you subsequently fired.  Have any of you spent the time to repeatedly visit  the Cohassa-Eaton city-sanctioned campground site,  as did the grand jury members,  to talk to the campers,  to take pictures of the unempty dumpster,  to inspect the contaminated water source  or visit the atrociously maintained two toilets?  How many of you have visited another Northern California city  that has more successfully managed its campsite?  Or have you studied research papers,  as did city council members,  on homelessness and ways to mitigate the universal problem of California,  particularly exacerbated by the campfire?  For us,  rather than dismiss the grand jury report  with a token three-member group response  with a none-of-your-business attitude,  now is the time for a fresh start,  particularly with the winding down  of the settlement agreement.  Acknowledge that some of the folks  in our community will not accept the fact that we are not going to be able to do this.  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem !  I urge you to work with local advocates such as the North State shelter team  Who have repeatedly submitted proposals to provide the location and management of a sanctioned campground?  If only you would give permission, that's thank you. Thank you  All right  Discussion  Yeah, I have a comment, you know, I know it's a full moon  But we have really gotten a share of crazies the first speaker on this topic  Impugned my friend, mr. Morgan and the language that he used to condemn the  The grand jury report and I just want to comment that if he knew mr. Morgan he'd know how restrained his comments were  But I read the  The report and I read the response from the city  I want to thank the city manager and the mayor and the vice mayor  It's the committee that drafted the response on I wouldn't change a single word  excellent  It's possible that the public commenters who you don't know are also restrained in their words I prepared some  It's important. I think that we present for the public record the whole breadth of opinion on the council and according to another councilman  member from the last meeting that is everyone and me  I don't want to assume that the will the council isn't to discuss each of these responses individually  Although I just heard that council member van over but does not so I want to ask should we go through them together?  Or should I just go through my comments?  Could you repeat that do you want to go through each of the recommendations or responses that are on there together or I'll just run through this  That's okay. Yeah, so report one. I not all the findings recommendations with some of them report one Chico needs a plan  Finding one says that the city of Chico precipitated the Warren lawsuit when the unhoused were relocated without adequate shelter  The City Committee came up with the response disagree citing the Supreme Court ruling that came three and a half years after the Warren lawsuit  So that's absurd  Former President Donald Trump appointed three Supreme Court justices that reversed previous rulings  Yes  That's right  But the lawsuit came about with the settlement so restrictive because the direction coming from the City Council was so obviously contrary to  those laws  Not just cruel and unusual punishment, but also for unreasonable government certain seizure of private property  Before the illegal relocations the City Council did fire the city attorney who obviously gave too sound of legal advice. I  Was there in the camps that winter I asked the police where people could go  They said somewhere but we can't tell you where like it was some kind of sick riddle  We were expected to solve and that officer target team sergeant Cesar Sandoval told me he would not lead the target team if people were  Evicted in the reins with no other options and he was off the team the next day  The court stepped in because the city gave them no other choice if we wanted to be tactful or even even if it's inauthentic  Our response would be yes, we precipitated the lawsuit, but we're doing better now in any way the law has changed on  Recommendation one the drafted response is that the city does not need an internal committee to interface with the unhoused population  Current service providers and future county state and federal homelessness commissions because internal coordination meetings occur regularly  But neither this council nor the public tell you who attends these internal coordination meetings nor what exactly they discuss and  Does internal mean internal to the city if so?  How then does that address keeping service providers or anyone else in the loop to these internal coordination meetings involve anything besides planning the black  Amul circuit have they ever involved any service providers except for the jesus center?  The public should know that for the first time since the formation of the butte county continuum of care this council has no elected  designation  We have staff on it  We have never received a report from a meeting  Not that we would permit a council member to give a report if we had a representative on it  But that's how pathetically disengaged this council is on questions of homelessness and it speaks to the general  Opacity of the city on our handling of homelessness just ask the social service providers  recommendation number two the Chico City Council developed a written policy that will deal with how the city will address the unhoused  The drafted response is perplexing it says the settlement agreement is the city council's written policy  The agreement that the city is putting legal resources into getting out of and complains is quote completely unworkable and ineffective is the city council's written policy  So there's no need for discussion  The warren settlement agreement does not preclude planning  We don't have to play dumb if you're up here and you're not thinking about what the city does after the warren settlement agreement  My take is you should not be up here  So let me quote from the city's recent court filing a rule 60 motion to escape the settlement agreement  The city has fulfilled and will continue to fulfill  Its obligations toward the city's homeless population  But no one knows what that means because we've never discussed what our obligations toward the homeless population are  So yes  It makes sense that we would discuss this and to know the settlement agreement does not count as the city council's policy any more than a  Prisoners preferred vacation destination is the county jail  Anyone whoever hears me discuss local politics know that knows that I have a great deal of respect for council member Morgan for having more  Courage to speak openly and thoroughly on this topic than the rest of the council combined  But council member Morgan contradicts himself  And this at the last meeting saying I would love to have these discussions in public  We can discuss a future strategy on homelessness publicly  I asked that we have that discussion a month ago and no one seconded my motion and it is not too late for someone else  to bring that back up  but moving on  recommendation 5 the Chico City Council should expand shelter opportunities for unhoused people who currently live outside sanctioned shelter facilities  the drafted response says the  Recommendation requires further analysis and will be defined in the future by City Council budget priorities and budget deliberations  This is nice. It's like we'll consider it  It does weirdly in my opinion suggest that the grand jury should have budgeted out projects on behalf of the city  It also totally negates the fact that the state has grant funds for shelter projects if we support any  but here I just want to pause and  Madam clerk a motion that the City Council agendize a discussion of expanding shelter opportunities for unhoused people  Who currently live outside of stanchions shelter facilities  Okay, there's a motion for discussion, okay  just wait to see  It dies without a second  Did you repeat your motion motion that the City Council agendized a discussion of expanding shelter  Opportunities for unhoused people who currently live outside of sanctioned shelter facilities as it says will be defined by future City Council budget priorities  Aren't we making a motion taking up something that's not on the agenda  well  Well, you can agenda something for a future meeting.  But you have to request to set aside the rule.  I mean, maybe you can ask the city attorney, but I don't think we're following our rules.  This is about the response to the grand jury report.  I can sum this up.  Okay.  So while I may be hypocritical, I do know the rules, and you're not following them very well.  We can agenda this discussion.  All right.  We asked for an attorney opinion.  Let's get it.  Yeah, Mayor.  I think this is more appropriate for council member requests towards the end of the council meeting on the agenda.  That's typically where items that are brought forward by council members for future discussion would be appropriate for tonight.  With respect to the grand jury report and the response, that's typically what would be discussed currently on this item.  So the point is that this answer is entirely disingenuous, and we should probably just put something like no thank you instead.  There is no interest in expanding shelter facilities for unhoused people outside of them.  Recommendation number six.  The city of Chico should continue funding transition.  And emergency housing programs.  So I was legitimately surprised by this answer you came up with.  Because it's not a big maybe.  It says it's up to the city council as if we are not the city council responding to this.  So my question, probably a lot of people's question would be, when the city has provided funding for transitional and emergency housing programs in the past, was it all just because we needed that to justify making homelessness a crime?  And did the Supreme Court ruling remove the whole incentive for the city to take any responsibility for sheltering the poor and mentally ill at all?  And it's weird that these are questions that a council member has to ask.  The next report.  Alternative accommodations for the unhoused.  Funding number one says that the city of Chico is responsible for allowing the appalling conditions at Eaton and Cohasset.  The draft of response is to disagree and point fingers at the non-profit tenant attorneys.  And there's two things that I think are really interesting about this.  One, the city both denies it was our responsibility that the appalling conditions existed.  And takes credit for unilaterally addressing the appalling conditions after this report was received by us.  Number two.  The only people who know at all what has gone on.  on behind closed doors how these conversations have went on managing Eaton and Cohasset over  the past two years are the city council majority, select members of city staff, myself and I'm  continually threatened with legal action by the council for speaking too much publicly on this  and this grand jury. 19 people who had privileged access to all the information that exists  and came to a consensus with this conclusion. Anyone who has spoken to people in the Eaton  and Cohasset camp know that the people assessed to be there and the lawyers representing them  wanted management. They wanted clean water, lighting, controlled site access and safe places  to prepare food and the city resisted providing all of these. In a not far off analogy legal  services in Northern California were the tenant attorneys and the city of Chico was the slumlord.  Recommendation number two, Chico City Council should direct the target and outreach team  to issue fresh assessments on current alternate site residents. Our response begins saying  quote, a target and outreach team does not exist.  And this is obviously very snarky because we know exactly what they mean. It's like saying actually  it's called the outreach and engagement team, it's one guy and the target team is just standing right over there.  Is this really how we treat a grand jury, normal people serving as volunteers for a year to watch dog  government operations? It's not a Facebook argument. It's a flagrant disrespect of the democratic institution  designed to support government accountability. And I don't know if this was intentional or if this was missed  but when this report came out about  17 people who had privileged access to all the information that exists and the city of Chico was the slumlord.  We did a public works operation clearing out those individuals without any assessment for shelter and now a bunch of them are outside of the city council chambers or in the city plaza.  So great job.  Recommendation number four, Chico City Council should provide clearly marked spaces in all alternate sites using the dimension and pod layout directions in the settlement agreement.  The response says the settlement agreement does not contain dimensions and pod layout directions for the alternate site.  But the least bit of sincere engagement here would tell you that they're referring to the pod layout of the pallet shelter which is described in the settlement agreement.  Mr. Winslow, if I may.  So Mr. Morgan certainly tested my patience yesterday.  This is the last page. Mayor, please just let me finish.  I know.  You can't act like, like, critically.  Listen, you're right. But if each of us take 20 minutes to go over this.  Then the meeting's going to take an hour and this is the work of the government. This is what we're elected to do.  No, 20 times 7 is not an hour. It's a lot more than that. It's two and a half.  And I'm certainly willing to sit here for that. But at the same time, a lot of your comments could be wrapped into singular comments and not outlined particularly.  Not exactly. I mean.  I know. But we don't need to dry it. Yeah. Okay.  I will continue.  I'll let you continue. But please for the order of time.  So pod layout of the pallet shelter is described in the settlement agreement.  So again, it's disrespectful to be snarky and play dumb to a grand jury.  But here at least, it's a good example of how we can do this.  And I think the city staff have done something useful with the Eden-Galazic campground.  We did agree, reach an agreement on the actual outcome.  Lastly, recommendation number 5.  Chico City Council should ensure that care and maintenance supervision of current alternate site conforms to health and safety regulations.  This response is interesting. It's definitely the most emotive language that came out of the committee.  It says, such a site does not, by its very nature, there should be a comma there,  conform with the most basic regulations for human habitation needs.  The site is a product of flawed legal reasoning.  The most basic regulations for human habitation facilities.  Homelessness has been a battleground in Chico for years.  We fought over a shelter downtown and a tiny house village on the end of town.  We fight over bathrooms and dumpsters.  This council spent an inordinate amount of energy resisting putting barbecues out for people to cook safely.  Or providing any lighting at night.  A fence that can be locked.  There are so many constituent parts of Chico City Council.  The most important part is the fact that we are a civilized society.  Having dignity and being healthy and safe.  But you choose to focus on the fact that people would be living in tents.  Tents to you are anti-public safety so you treat tents the same regardless of their environment.  You make it impossible to live if all you have is a tent to live in, even on your own property.  Can you believe that?  We have catastrophic wildfires, a homelessness epidemic, and a shelter crisis.  And it is illegal to let someone camp in your backyard.  So you can go and bulldoze all the tents, but the people who sleep in the tents are still here scattered all over town.  Even immediately outside of these chambers.  And what do you do for public health and safety and drug use when all the homeless people in Chico are hiding wherever they can on bike paths or in the waterways?  As far as legal reasoning goes, health and sanitation regulations can be found in Title 8 of the municipal code.  Building regulations are in Title 16.  We can actually improve health, safety, and sanitation without hyperfixating on building code.  That's called being pragmatic or harm reduction.  There's a general understanding that there is a need for facilities that are built in the area.  And there are facilities for people who are outside of the existing approved shelter facilities.  We expect, because this has been the council direction, that all those options that currently exist are going to go away when the settlement agreement is gone.  And I think that is a huge misstep for the city of Chico.  We are just going to be pushing people around town again and again.  It is, at best, an accelerated game of whack-a-mole.  I just have a clarifying question.  Did you say I was snarky and plain dumb?  No, actually, no, no.  I complimented your response for being very upfront.  I heard that.  I just want to know who you were referring to.  It was the committee of the mayor, vice mayor, and city manager.  I'm not sure whose verbiage all of it was.  But, yeah, I think what came out of here was snarky.  Maybe you were snarky, too, in your response.  But at least it was clearly from you.  I don't know.  I mean, it was upfront.  You can make it better by saying that.  It's as good as it can get.  All right.  Comment from other council members.  Mr. Van Overen.  I know Mr. Winslow.  It's an election year, and Mr. Winslow is playing to his audience.  But that was uncalled for.  And, I mean, I would remind you that when they did the last assessment, the last clearing, the fourth one, at Tigard Ponds, 12 of 13 people had been offered shelter and refueling.  And that's the number of people who refused to go.  And that's 79% of the people who were surveyed in San Francisco, I'm sure it's true here, have been convicted felons, have served time in prison.  It doesn't mean they're not human beings.  But the governor, Gavin Newsom, a well-known conservative, has said that he wants these camps cleared.  Because what's clear is the path that you propose to enable her to go.  And I think that the path of homelessness has compounded it in California, which is why we have half of the unhoused homeless in the country.  And that's a policy decision.  And states that have taken a path that have said to people, you need to get your life together or you can't stay here, have reduced homelessness.  So I think your comments were not well served, not appropriately.  I think you're being overly polite as it relates to the city manager and the mayor and the vice mayor.  And I think you should apologize to him.  Mr. Winslow, that's not a response.  I have one clarification when I get the chance.  Yes, but you're not the only one who may want to speak.  So we're going to go through this in an orderly fashion.  You're more than welcome to respond, but that's after everybody else has spoken, too.  So anyone else care to jump in?  All right.  I have a few questions for our city manager.  So I'm going to test your memory.  How much money do we spend on the palace shelter?  About a year.  About $5 million a year.  Other programs?  I know you brought this up when we were on the council long ago.  I mean, we heard about CDGB.  We've heard about other stuff.  Ballpark?  What does the city spend on low-income and homeless individuals in a year?  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem ! So thank you.  I'm going to respond to a couple of things in this just to bring some, with respect, truth to it.  So, yes, the airport mention site was mentioned in the opinion that airport resting site was found by the Supreme Court to be fine in terms of it.  And a point within it to where the Supreme Court noted, look, you can't take a particular site like this and denote whether or not, because it had shade, because it had water, because it had toilets, because it had all these other things, and compare it to any other area and create a baseline for the entire country to adhere to.  So, that very much, the resting site, was the very last paragraph of the Supreme Court opinion.  I read the whole thing.  It shows how difficult it is to deal with this problem on a national level and say, you know what, every city in the United States has to spend $5 to $10 million, depending on their size, of course, us, our size, spending that much, to deal with this issue.  So, another thing, our city attorney was not fired by us.  Our city attorney was fired by his law firm.  We never went into closed session and talked about firing, or fired our,  attorney in closed session.  We may have had discussions about its performance, which I will leave in closed session, as I have to, but we never fired him.  To tell the public we fired him is completely false.  That did not happen.  So, this council has been, I think, crystal clear, because they've told me on two occasions to speak about it, exactly what we should do, that we should keep our palace shelter, and, as the governor not only suggests, but the governor, in fact, orders us to do so.  effectively effectively effectively This council has clearly said that's what they want to do. All eight candidates at the forum this morning said they want to keep the pallet shelter.  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively All eight candidates at the forum this morning said they want to keep the pallet shelter. I know Mr. Winslow has concerns about the pallet shelter and the future of it. It doesn't sound like there's that much concern to me. I think Chico's compassionate, but at the same time I think Chico is sick and tired, and I am too, of our parks and waterways and public spaces being taken over by people who think for some reason  for some reason that they have a right to it and the rest of the public does not.  It's despicable, it's sickening, and it's the response and result of policies that have led us  here from the state of California. You know, great thing, you know, you talk about various policies  and how they lead us here. I will tell you, make drugs less legal, you make crime less legal,  you let a bunch of people out of prison and then you wonder why you have a bunch of people living  on your street, close all the mental health institutions and do all these things, and it's  been a variety of politicians over the last 20, 30 years, you create a problem exactly like we're  living in today. You make housing harder to build, you make housing less affordable, you include more  environmental restrictions to make housing more expensive in the state of California and wonder  why housing is so darn expensive. Well, here we are. So this is actually what we have been led to  by not only our state, but by a lot of flawed logic. So in terms of you saying,  that they said about us, we had flawed legal reasoning. So where was their attorney?  They're just a group of folks all without a law degree, and they want to say that we have  flawed legal reasoning. I guarantee you. That was from your response. That was not from the  grand jury report, flawed legal reasoning. Well, okay. So I can tell you this, is that  our city attorney did read this. So we have pretty not flawed legal  reasoning. I can absolutely say that we should avoid the circumstance that we are in, where you  have 99% of the people paying hugely out of pocket for 1% who decides that responsibility,  living a drug-free life, or at least a relatively life where you can function on drugs,  and saying that they deserve housing at every step of the way and be taken care of every step of the  Have we effectively effectively  effectively We need to make public responsibility and responsibility a priority in the state of California again. And I believe our governor is starting to fall in line with that.  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively We want a city that's parks, waterways and public spaces are clean and clear from encampments.  the city of northern california  of sacramento is doing.  Mr. Mayor?  yes.  I would like to move the  council approve the proposed  draft response.  second the motion.  Mr. Winslow.  for some discussion.  I appreciate your commitment to  keeping the park clean.  We share that really.  I think that I also appreciate  that you have been vocally  supportive of keeping the  pallet shelter.  I would like to call the  question because we are talking  about an issue that is not  before the council right now.  We are supposed to be talking  about a response to the grand  jury.  there is no discussion on  the motion.  I am speaking and you will be  quiet for a minute.  that is the rule.  there is no discussion on that  motion.  I will break your  microphone if you interrupt me  again.  the city clerk will have an  issue with that.  you are out of line when  you interrupt me.  we are supposed to have a  response to the grand jury not  go back and forth about how we  feel about anything else.  about anything else going on.  I call the question.  Mr. Mayor.  all right.  take a vote.  you need a second.  I got a second.  pay attention.  who is seconded it?  casey.  all right.  council member bennett.  yes.  council member morgan.  yes.  council member tandon.  yes.  council member van overbeck.  just to be clear yes means  we accept the report.  no.  it calls for questions.  we accept.  I am sorry.  we accept the statement.  effectively effectively  effectively Then you can vote to accept the report.  What? Wait.  effectively  effectively  effectively We're voting on accepting the report. Yeah, we're voting on accepting the report. You voted to call it. Call the question. That's a separate motion. I mean, Debbie, Madam Clerk. !  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  discussion until the council is done discussing  if you want to call the question you want to shut me up  you don't want me to respond to it that requires a  two-thirds majority five out of seven  and then you vote after that  that's what the rules say  without  it's  okay  we never do it because it's rare that somebody  wants to call the question and shut up  council members  I will say this without  can we just leave the  snarky comments  to the wayside  sorry I didn't bring it here  I know but you've mentioned it  as much as everybody else  so that's  true what he said we do  actually have to do that in order to  stop discussion that is part of  parliamentary procedure however that is  not past practice it is never  voted on since I've been  here within our rules  we have a motion a second  consideration  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  We're still stuck on the last one.  Okay, so Mr. Winslow.  No, respond.  Oh, just a few things.  I'm not trying to hold this up here.  I know maybe, I mean, I would argue we don't talk about this enough  because so much of this has been a closed session,  which you all complain about,  but here's our opportunity to talk about it, right?  So the governor's order, I think you're mistaking what it says.  It recommends that local governments adopt policies  consistent with what they say.  Point of order, this is not related to the motion.  Mr. Mayor, can we move this along?  We've spent enough time on this.  Mr. Winslow has certainly spent enough time on this.  We have a vote underway.  Can we finish that?  We do.  We'd have to.  Let's explain this because I don't really want to.  So if, in fact, you call the question,  that is, in fact, according to our rules and the heart of it,  not actually.  It's not actually a real thing.  We went over this a couple of years ago.  It was not fun.  So if, in fact, you call the question,  it's just simply a statement that you're making.  It doesn't carry any weight.  It's not a real motion.  You actually have to have a motion to call the question.  The motion has to be seconded and voted on by five sevens.  And we had that.  We did not.  So because of that, Sean made a motion to file the report.  To approve the letter that's been written as amended.  Yes.  And that is the motion to be sent to the grand jury.  Yes.  So Mr. Winslow is responding to the motion in progress.  So carry on.  The governor's words say that the city should create a distinction between encampments  where exigent circumstances exist that are threatening to life, healthy, and safety.  And they say those should be cleared out.  Others, they say we should work with service providers to offer services there.  The only reason why the city has this as a practice is because it is in our written policy,  the settlement agreement, which you were seeking to approve.  And I'm not saying that you should be asking me to throw out.  And whenever I have attempted to have a discussion to maintain some of those provisions within  the settlement agreement, you have refused to discuss it publicly.  So don't bring up the governor's report like that.  And just the conclusion of all this is that there is a difference between encampments  which present a threat to health and safety.  And all encampments don't have to be that way.  What we have done to Edenco has dramatically improved conditions there.  It is the best thing this council has ever done with regard to homelessness.  I am so glad that it was implemented.  But there is more we can do.  There are more people who are not in sanctioned shelter facilities.  It does not require millions of dollars in order to serve them.  In fact, we have this binder with a proposal in here which has like under $50,000 startup  costs for a managed campground.  They are offering it.  They have been here.  We have service providers who have been trying to help out the city of Chico, and we refuse  to engage with them.  And that is a failing on our part.  Thank you.  All right.  So I'm going to actually take a second to respond to that before we vote.  So, yep.  Sorry, guys.  This decision removes the legal ambiguities that have tied the hands of local officials  for years and limited their ability to deliver on common sense measures to protect the safety  and well-being of our community and to implement and enforce policies to clear unsafe encampments  from our street.  And that's on Governor Newsom's website.  His page, his words.  So I can tell you from talking to his office, and I'm getting the last word this time, is  they are very clear on the fact, well, you did on the last three, I think.  So very clear on the fact that they want encampments cleared and that they are very in favor of  what the city of Chico is doing in terms of the pallet shelter that we are providing.  So to say that we don't want to tell the public exactly what we're doing and why we're doing  it is a farce.  It's worse than that.  It's a tragedy.  And the reason why it's a tragedy is because every single person up here, because I know  them, wants to tell this community exactly what happened.  And exactly why we've done things.  But, and I know some people like to pretend it's fake, I've talked to the judge and I've  gone through this before here on council.  I've told people before.  They've threatened to put Mr. Morgan in jail.  He'll attest to that.  We cannot have that discussion.  The judge told me he didn't care if I got recalled.  He didn't care if I got kicked out.  He didn't care about any of that.  And I will tell you, that's the way it has been.  I'm more than happy once we're out of this case.  And once we get caught, I'm going to be out of this case.  I'm going to be out of this case.  And I will show this community exactly what we have discussed and why we made the decisions  that we had to make.  But I think everybody up here has the best interest.  I think the best interest for the city of Chico is to file this.  So let's take a vote.  Madam Clerk.  So we have an aye from council members Bennett, Morgan, Tandon and Vanoverbeck.  Council member Winslow?  No.  Vice Mayor Reynolds?  Aye.  podem  podem !  Mayor Co podem All right. With that we're going to take a short break.  podem  podem  Mayor Co podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem !  point three consideration of a  resolution declaring city owned  property as surplus land and we  have a report from deputy city  manager jennifer mccarthy.  good evening again mayor  coolidge vice mayor reynolds  council members I'  m jennifer mccarthy  before you tonight is a  resolution to consider declaring  city owned property as surplus  the city owned property is part  of what'  s referred to as the lost park  economic development project.  the entire lost park project is  seen on this map outlined in the  dark black. The entire project  area is just about two and a  half acres and it includes city  owned property as well as  property at 25 and 35 main  street. The entire property is  that belongs to the California  state. California state I'  m going to say it wrong  enterprise foundation is their  foundation arm of chico state.  The item before you tonight is  only in regards to the city of  chico property not the chico  state property as you see on  this map at 25 and 35 main  street. The goal of the lost  park project is really to open  up the area along the greenway  provide a space for the public.  There'  s an excellent opportunity  here where our community can  potentially enjoy a mixed use  development that could have  housing it could have commercial  and office space and in addition  to that it could enjoy our  public greenways and there'  s some examples here of what  you can see in ashland Oregon as  well as in san luis obispo where  they have done an excellent job  of really opening up their  greenways to public activity. In  addition to that they have  lot of the street from chico state  so it could be an excellent  connector point to the university  as well as to lower bidwell park.  There'  s been a lot of progress to date  on this project to give you the  low down on that we sent out a  request for qualifications back  in 2022 since then we'  ve also executed a  memorandum of understanding with  chico state and chico state  enterprises on how we'  ll work together on this  project. We completed a market  plan to provide a ! !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  ! !  podem !  the city'  s property  you can see is outlined in blue  it is approximately 1.61 acres  and currently it is municipal  parking lot number five it'  s a  very odd shaped parcel of land  and it is contiguous to two  businesses as well as the chico  state enterprises properties at  25 and 35 main street. The  surplus lands act process has  many steps I'  m going to try to go  through them quickly with you  today the first step is what'  before you today and that is to  declare the property as surplus  when government is no longer  utilizing that property for  government uses we have to first  declare it as surplus and that'  s what'  s before you this evening.  The second step is to go through  what'  s called a notice of  availability process that is  where we send a notice to the  california state housing and  community development department  to let them know our property is  california state housing and  community development department  for affordable housing. There'  s a 60 day response period and  then one of two things happen  either there'  s no responses that are  received which is possible it is  an odd shaped parcel of land that  is in kind of an interesting  situation if you look at it just  by itself. If there'  s no responses  received then we have the ability  to reengage with chico state  enterprises and chico state and  reissue the rfq on the open  market. Or during that 60 day  response period if we do get a  response from one or two potential  developers that are interested in  affordable housing and I might  also note when I say interested  in affordable housing the  requirement is that at least 25%  of all the residential units that  are developed on the city'  s property would be  affordable. I want to put that  out there. During that 60 day  period if we get one or more  responses then we have to enter  into a good faith negotiation  period for 90 days. That  negotiation can take up to a  agreement can happen based on  price and terms. The price has  to be that we will be accepting  is fair market value or lower if  we choose to but not above. At  the end of that one or two  options happen. Either we reach  agreement and then the property  we go through a purchase  agreement and that property is  now in the hands of a private  affordable developer and they  can go forward and either  develop the city'  choose to work with chico state  and chico state enterprises on  some of the things we talked  about but we can'  t require  that. Or there'  s no agreement that takes  place and for whatever reason  through that good faith  negotiation period we can'  t come to agreement on price  or terms. If that is the case  then again we can go back out  and re-issue the rfq and  re-engage with chico state and  chico state enterprises and move  this project forward. Really in  summary tonight before you again  is consideration of declaring the  city owns property that'  s part of  the project as surplus government  land. If we do that then we go  through the process with htc and  the end result is we may have a  nice redevelopment project. If  the council does not decide to  declare the property as surplus  land then there'  s no further actions that the  we will move on to the next  the last part of the project or  the declaration of surplus land  and our city attorney john lamb  is as well.  I'  m very excited we'  re moving forward to do  something with this piece of  property. It'  s the most interesting  piece of property that is  being built.  re-design. That was a dry  cleaners at some point and  there'  s significant environmental  problems with that property.  Do we understand the scope of it  and the cost to remediate it  and all that stuff?  currently the cana ranch  property is not part of lost  park. It'  s held privately.  the environmental problem is on  this.  when we did the phase one  they currently have a deed  restriction on that property.  we have a basic understanding  and it'  s also part of a  state monitoring system.  there'  s a state monitoring  well that'  s part of that.  the DTSC process where they'  re monitoring that property.  there are potential environmental  concerns in and around but there'  s a lot of  things that we can do to  it probably requires  remediation.  I have a quick question.  if somebody wants to buy it and  they only want to build housing  there and it isn'  t the vision of what chico state  and people have a vision and  how live work stay whatever  which is beautiful and super  exciting do we have to sell or  how does that if it'  s not what the vision is?  we have to sell it and  council if I can add to that  as we go out to the notice of  availability process we envision  also providing some conditions  on how we envision some of the  site to be used and again that'  s one of those things that hcd  will look at and see if they'  re reasonable or not but again  the idea of providing housing plus more is something we can  that from what we'  re desiring and  that can be part of the price and terms negotiation.  thank you.  any further questions?  Mr. Bennett.  I remember when  tom giovanni was looking at this and  that had to be 30 years ago I think.  24.  thank you.  it was a fantastic concept I  federal developers in chico were  also involved or looking at it 24  years ago.  I'  m excited this is moving to the  next phase and this will take some  time but I think it'  s great looking at the possibilities  would be fantastic.  thank you for all your work.  thank you.  any other questions?  all right how many speakers?  none.  thank you.  thank you.  further discussion?  just a comment we have our  growth and community development committee  meeting and we'  ve been talking about mixed use and this  would be a fabulous place to do a  mixed use residential commercial development.  I will say that a  lot of the things we'  past and I walked this spot with  gail hutchinson former president  of chico say we had a discussion  about that and we both alluded to  the fact that having something  ashland like there would be  amazing and anyone familiar with  that but I can tell you any time  these things happen they'  re always successful where the  creek is played on for dining and  eating and things along those lines.  I think this will be a huge benefit to  the city.  I think it'  s fantastic.  any other comments?  it'  s a really awesome project I  totally agree I think it has a chance  to transform this into downtown and  the project we'  re talking about it was  punted off but for changing the  streetscape on main street there also  has a lot of potential to work  synergistically with this development  and extend that pedestrian oriented  s accessible to people so lost  park ceases to be lost.  I'  d love to come up with a new  name.  can we drop the lost?  just park.  entertain a motion.  move to approve?  I'  m happy to second.  I don'  t get to do that much.  all right madam clerk when you'  re  move to the next item.  I should say deputy madam  clerk.  council member bennett?  yes.  council member morgan?  yes.  council member wenzel?  yes.  vice mayor reynolds?  aye.  mayor coolidge?  aye. And so that's a resolution of the City Council, the City of Chico, California, declaring certain real property APN 00319003200 surplus land pursuant to the California Surplus Land Act. I didn't have to read that, did I? I did anyway. I wasn't going to say a word. Well, you know, it's there in bold. Well, you know, it's there in bold. I'm going to read it.  effectively  effectively Item 5.4, Council Member Tandon requests massage establishments. Council Member Tandon? As I requested last time for the Internal Affairs Committee to explore additional rules, the reason for that request was to make sure that we are in alliance with the state recommendations  that request was to make sure  we'  re in alliance with the  state recommendations and to  make the establishments safe as  well. There'  s not a whole lot to add  onto it. I think we'  ll need more information  from the stakeholders and hope  to get some internal affairs  committee to bring it back to  us.  thank you.  I presume you'  re talking about  legal massage parlors as opposed  to illegal massage parlors.  trying to make them all legal.  I'  m trying to understand what  prompted you to put this on the  agenda. I'  m trying to understand  what was the motivation? Why do  we have a problem?  because there are regulations  that say that the massage  parlors should be a member of  california massage therapy  council and some of the parlors  in our city are not. Like you  said, legal. To make sure they'  re all legal because there'  re some complaints about it.  I'  ve heard it in the community  that there could be incidences  of human trafficking and things  like that. It'  s better to make sure we update  our ordinances to make them  safe.  thank you.  thank you.  I wondered too. Thank you  for that question and elaboration.  I'  ve heard things about the  connection between a lot of  massage business and human  trafficking. I wonder if the  police chief had any comment on  that. I know this is kind of a  I'  m curious what the police  department has as a reading on  that within chico.  I have received complaints  about it. In the past I haven'  t had any recently as the chief  just when I was a captain I did  take a couple complaints about  places in town. This is a  complicated one. It involves a  lot of cooperation from the  district attorney'  s office on these cases. I  know they'  re very complicated.  s complicated in terms of the  illegal ones. From the police  department'  s perspective we have received  complaints about them. We'  ll wait for the direction from  council as to what the request  is.  thanks.  I would just add that I think  right now we have about 45 to 50  massage parlors and the one around  the corner from my house is open  for the public.  nothing good has happened at  that time.  I would move to move the  conversation to internal affairs.  we have to take public comment.  after we hear from the public.  we have one speaker, austin  barron.  come on now.  good afternoon everyone.  my name is austin barron.  I would like to start out by  saying I'm glad this conversation  appears to be going in the right  direction and that everybody seems  to be on par with what's going on  in town. I've been a commercial  real estate broker for about six  years. Massage businesses have  always been a concern. There's a  lot of bad players out there.  I'd like to commend council member  Tandon for bringing this  discussion to the table. My two  cents would be if there's  any concerns or a way we can  include additional like a business  license or something like that  would be to add a background  check. Because that's something  that I always do in my practices.  We have ways of background  checking our clients to make  sure that we're dealing with  law abiding people. And I'd also  like to add I've personally  encountered over half a dozen  businesses attempting to lease a  building or have me represent  them. And I think that's a  landlords that had felonies  including prostitution and sex  trafficking on their record even  out of state convictions. They're  attempting to lease and start a  massage business here in chico.  I hope the city comes to a  solution that will help both  legitimate massage businesses and  the landlords hoping to lease  their buildings to law abiding  just so you know under the  state law currently the city is  allowed to regulate massage uses.  However, they do preempt cities  from regulating the permitting of  individuals who are certified from  the state massage therapy council.  So if they're issued permits  through that state process the  city cannot impose additional  background checks. However the  city can land zone create  permitting requirements health and  safety standards for the facility  things like that is permissible.  But if they have a permit from  the state that is sufficient and  we cannot require additional  background checks or other  requirements from those  individuals.  we don't require that.  those who are not so permitted.  correct. And that would be  something that we would be  that the council can consider.  we could restrict those who are  not so permitted.  could we limit hours?  yes. you can prohibit folks  without that state permit and  require everyone to have that  state permit.  the certification you'  re talking about is the  california massage therapy council  that'  s a state body?  correct.  I would concur with the  I will now take my motion to  move it to internal affairs.  I will second it.  you can second it.  I just want to say it sounds  like we should get a little  report from the d.a. office in  order to know more what'  s going on or what'  s been investigated already.  we can ask for that.  as part of the process I  think they can do that in  internal affairs.  I don'  t think they can do that.  the d.a. is never there.  not since I'  ve been there.  I'  m not going to comment on  the d.a.  we have a motion.  council member bennett?  yes.  council member morgan?  yes.  council member tanden?  yes.  council member van overbeck?  yes.  council member winslow?  yes.  vice mayor reynolds?  yes.  mayor coolidge?  yes.  motion carries 7-0.  council member van overbeck  request blighted buildings.  in the august 20'  th meeting we had a report on  the building you were concerned  about mr.  Mayor and the northeast corner  of second and main.  that begs the question of  whether or not our code is  strong enough to be a  s strong enough as it relates  to blighted buildings.  I would like to have internal  affairs review the current city  code and make sure it'  s specific  enough so the next time code  enforcement encounters a  situation like this they have  the tools to get it done.  transparent enough to enforce  the common sense rules.  it'  s pretty  straightforward.  any questions for  mr.  van overbeck?  two easy ones.  one you'  re talking about the  nuisance code updated last  year?  yes.  you say there'  s a report can I ask  who the report came from?  from the dcba or a different  random public member?  I didn'  t say a report.  speakers?  we have two.  austin barron followed by adam  fidelli.  three minutes.  or less.  you have to speak for all  three.  no.  going back to the old days  when we were here until one in  the morning.  8 o'clock is just fine.  take as long as you need.  thank god sean put a stop to  go back to that right?  all right.  as I mentioned before I'  m a local commercial real  estate broker.  so in addition to what I  property sales and all that I  help small businesses find space  to lease and I help landlords  lease out space.  downtown has always been a  question or concern for tenants  both safety wise and quality of  the building and everything like  that.  there'  s a lot of buildings  downtown that are really  blighted.  I know you spoke of one in  particular last time.  it'  s more than that.  there'  s ones that have been boarded  up for years.  and it'  s not only an issue for the  tenants that may have leased  that space or looked to lease  that space or have ideas for  that space.  but for those leasing from  neighboring buildings.  I can'  t imagine running a business  next to a boarded up building  and expecting people to come in  and want to buy stuff from me.  I'  d just like to say that the  city'  s efforts to improve the  buildings or fix this issue is  very honorable.  our downtown is a gem.  I look forward to seeing us  continue to improve it.  I hope to see the city give  these building owners some sort  of incentive to repair and lease  the buildings.  I don'  t know what that might be.  it might be in form of a  penalty or fine.  but I'  d just like to commend you in  bringing this issue to the  table.  and hopefully we can get those  boards out of storefronts and  get some tenants in there and  have a thriving downtown.  thank you.  Adam fedeli?  evening council.  Mr. Mayor, I would echo my  colleague'  s comments.  austin, I have a sales  persons license.  not a broker's license.  but hey, I am a downtown  business person.  I sell real estate out of an  office downtown.  and you know, to have buildings  downtown that frankly, just  never been a problem.  look bad doesn't do us any good.  And it's not just the ones that were discussed the other evening.  There's one right across from the A&PM gas station.  It used to be an old appliance sales building, if I remember correctly.  That's been boarded up vacant for the whole time I've lived here.  I came here in 1986.  So I think this is, since we are now a big city,  whether we like to admit it or not,  we need this kind of teeth in our code.  You can't just nudge somebody anymore and say,  hey, you really should finish that.  We need to flex our muscle a little bit with restraint,  but still need to flex our muscle a little bit.  So thank you all very much.  Thank you.  All right.  Couldn't agree more.  So further comments.  Just one quick comment that I will bring up  that I brought up.  I think it's important to note that this isn't just focused on downtown.  It should be a universal of how property is kept.  I would agree to the conversation as long as we'  re talking about all businesses not targeting any business.  And of course I always like to throw out lots of carrots,  but when carrots aren'  t working there has to be code that unfortunately you can follow with a stick when we need to.  So I would welcome the conversation.  I would agree with that.  There'  s some at the airport that I can think about.  s some throughout the city.  All over the place.  Some of our back roads have buildings on them that are impeding those areas from developing  and moving forward.  I would agree too.  So entertain a motion.  I move to accept the recommendation and refer to the question to internal affairs.  I would like to say that we should widen it beyond just the nuisance code just like this  DCBA report that we received.  Didn' t identify particular solutions from us, but that we can talk about other methods  of dealing with the issue.  E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E  council member tandon?  yes.  council member van overbeck?  yes.  vice mayor reynolds?  yes.  mayor coolidge?  yes.  action news in the back of the  room they said we'  re going to build a memorial  to jackson pollock. That'  s not true. It'  s not what I want to see  happen here. This is my request  obviously item 5.6. Just a  little background. Paul jackson  pollock known as jackson pollock  was born on january 28, 1912 in  cody wyoming where they named a  mountain range after him. He  spent his childhood in chico and  later in arizona. He'  s a major artist in the  abstract expressionist movement  for his use of the drip  technique. He died on august 11,  57. He died in the  the! ! !  He died in the !  He died in the ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !  the arts commission.  I think it'  commission to discuss this item  and come up with different ways  to honor jackson pollock his  history in chico and his  influence in the world and in  the abstract art movement it  does not have to spend money it  does not necessarily have to do  anything it would come back for  some kind of approval but I  think it'  s worthwhile.  I would say next to aaron rogers  is probably our most famous  resident.  questions?  I don'  t like abstract art but that'  s neither here nor there I think  it'  s important to honor  people who have been notable  citizens so I wholeheartedly  support it even though I don'  t like this art very much.  do we have any speakers?  we have one katie posey.  all right.  three minutes.  hi everybody.  as an arts commissioner I think  this is a great idea.  I also look forward to finding  out what the rest of the  commission might think about it  about how we could honor the  artistic legacy of jackson  pollock I think many people in  chico might not know that about  how effectively effectively and maybe to grow an appreciation or not of another type of art, because that's fine too to know what you don't like. This also ties in to goal one and two of the City of Chico Arts Master Plan.  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively and two, to facilitate the education of all citizens and the development of an appreciation for the arts. So I was I did want to mention like that idea, you know, it was said that this is cost neutral.  I was I didn't want to mention like that idea, you know, it was said that this is cost neutral and if you recall  The utility box project that the Commission has worked on there's creative ways that different funding streams to do that  So I had briefly looked at the comments on the action news now article and people are you know saying things like well  You know, we need to fill the potholes  Well, the thing is we're not going to take money from the pothole  Funding stream for the Jackson Pollock funding stream. And so I think that people you know can be reminded of that  And along with that, you know, some people were also mentioning this is just an extra thing  Some people were mentioning well, he wasn't born here  But the fact is he went to school in Chico and was here from the age of five  And so I think that there's also a tie into the schools  And as an educator, I think that's exciting as well  So anyways, thanks for bringing it up and I look forward to the possibility that we on the Commission might be able to discuss it  All right. Thank you  council discussion  entertain motion  I got a good thing to say. Well what one is nerdy for city commissioners. That's great. Thank you  Another I know some people or I'll just say I've seen on New York City or there were some potholes filled in with like a ceramic  Mosaic it's kind of like abstract art. So there's some neat ideas there  Also, I want to note  I think this is the first time since I've been on the council that we referred something to a commission  I will make a motion to approve  definitely the first time since  we set the process where they  can' t agenda so we' re  agenda a discussion of a  discussion of a commission and  thank you for bringing this up I  will make a motion to approve the  recommendation.  second.  I have a motion and a second.  council member bennett?  yes.  council member morgan?  yes.  council member van overbeck?  yes.  council member winslow?  yes.  vice mayor reynolds?  aye.  mayor coolidge?  aye.  motion carries 7-0.  reports and communications  from the city manager.  city manager mark?  just a quick update on  security screening we mentioned  at the last meeting it appears  the equipment will be here and  installed later this month.  either the first or second  meeting in october that process  will likely begin and we will  have a press release with all  those details once we get closer  to a launch date.  all right.  council member requests item 6.2  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively effectively I have a personal request is that we all wear Chico State colors for the next meeting because it's right before Wildcat Weekend.  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively Chico State colors next meeting.  thank you Mr. Chair and  members of the committee and  especially employees of chico  senate. With that we will  now podem
