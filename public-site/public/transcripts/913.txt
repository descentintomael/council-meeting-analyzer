 Calling to order the special Chico City Council meeting of July 28.  Please join me in the Pledge of Allegiance to the flag.  I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.  And Ms. Crescent, could we have the roll call?  Yes.  Council Member Huber?  Here.  Council Member Morgan?  Here.  Council Member Horry?  Here.  Council Member Reynolds?  Here.  Council Member Stone?  Here.  Vice Mayor Brown?  Here.  And Mayor Schwab?  Here.  This meeting is being conducted in accordance with Executive Order N-2920.  The public may view the meeting on Comcast Channel 11 or via our Granica streaming video link that can be found on the City's website.  Public.  Public participation during the meeting.  The Engage Chico Civic Engagement Program will be available for citizen input on individual agenda items both prior to and during the meeting and that program can be accessed through the City's website.  Public comment will also be accepted by email and can be sent to publiccomments at chicoca.gov during the meeting prior to the close of the public comment on an item.  The public is encouraged not to send more than one email post.  We encourage the public to submit one per item and not to comment on numerous items on one email.  This is a special agenda and due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the public shall have an opportunity to address the Council by email and or Engage Chico on any item described in the agenda before or during consideration of that item.  Government Code 54954.3A.  The City Council is prohibited by law from considering any other item in the agenda before or during consideration of that item.  It's an unbiased 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 !  지나  지나  지나 !  지나  지나 ! ! !  지나  지나  지나  지나  지나 ! ! !  and adopted Resolution 7-20,  which is a resolution the City Council of the City of Chico  declaring a local emergency due to the outbreak of COVID-19.  And this resolution had several sections in it  to direct us as a body and the city as an organization  on how we could operate, nationalize our activities,  particularly at the council level  and our role as the governing and policymakers for the city.  So we have that in place.  And then Duke County submitted an attestation  and reopened plan to the state  and were granted a local variance.  On May 19th, we adopted Resolution 20-20,  which contained amendments to our original resolution  in light of the new information.  On Saturday, this past Saturday,  Duke County was put on the state's coronavirus watch list,  which spurs another opportunity,  another...  time that we should revisit that resolution  to update us on how we go through our...  how we react to this emergency  and if there are any...  to reaffirm this  and to make any changes to the resolution.  So I want to assure the public  that we are not holding any secretive meetings.  This is a special meeting so that we can review this resolution.  As everyone knows, we had made a plan that on August 4th,  we would invite the public back to our meetings.  We had arranged with a church in the area to rent their facility.  It would have allowed for 80 members of the public to be in attendance.  And that...  And that...  At that point, we could move on from only hearing essential items  to hearing items that have actually, frankly, been on our back burner,  boiling up in this community since pre-pandemic.  And the public wants us to act on those items.  But we made a commitment to the public that we wouldn't hear those items  until we could get the public into the room.  They sent an email...  The church sent us an email on Friday,  and said due to the governor's...  Due to us being on the watch list,  they were not going to...  We would not be able to continue with those plans for August 4th.  So we have a list of items that were to be on the August 4th agenda.  And that obviously now needs to be changed.  What I called the special meeting for,  was that we could get feedback from the council  to provide direction on how we move forward.  I personally would like to see if we could find a way that we can engage the public  so that we can start acting on non-essential items.  But this is a decision for the council.  So why now?  We have to get the agenda out for August 4th.  Tomorrow is our goal to have the agenda out the week after.  Wednesday before the meeting.  So that's why I called this meeting for today.  Outside of our regular schedule.  So with that,  I will open it up for questions,  for discussion from members of the council.  On how do we move forward now.  I have a quick question.  Okay.  You, Sean, and then Alex.  Okay, sorry.  I'm just wondering why this meeting is being held at 3 rather than 6.  I just wanted to respect staff's time.  Our regular meetings are 6 p.m.  When I submitted the request for the meeting,  I said my preference would be at 3 o'clock  and said if people were not available,  then we could have it at our regular time.  The indication that we received from the people who responded  said 3 o'clock would be their preference.  I'm just wondering whether you were able to pull the public  which expects our meetings to be at 6 o'clock.  It's not the council members that I'm questioning that.  I question it again for members of the public  that expect our meetings to be at 6 o'clock.  I wonder why we continue to deviate from that.  Unless there's a specific cause of action,  rather than just the mayor feels more comfortable with 3 p.m.  because it's better for your schedule.  The public expects our meetings at 6.  And so that's why I keep asking.  We're meeting at 3.  Okay.  Sean?  Thank you.  I don't want to pile on on that one.  3 o'clock on a Tuesday.  I mean, it's a little bit no wonder the public's like,  why is this meeting happening?  I appreciate, Ann, your explanation.  I would have appreciated it more in some other way  before we got a very vague agenda about,  call it a special meeting, call it an emergency meeting.  I don't care what the semantics are.  We're meeting Tuesday at 3 o'clock for what is not an emergency  and what is not special.  My fear a little bit,  and you talked about these boiling up items  that we want to deal with.  I think this is what's going to happen today.  We're going to debate, hopefully not for hours,  ways we can get the public engaged,  knowing full well,  given the governor's order,  that that is not going to happen.  We'll probably talk about technology again,  and we know that's not really going to work.  So there's not really a way to engage the public  in these boiling up items.  So whether we get there having looked at everything  and just found no way to do it and decide,  well, we just have to move ahead with these nonessential items,  which you certainly have the votes to do that,  or we say we're going to wait and only deal with essential items  like we agreed that we would do on March 25th,  it doesn't really make that much difference to me.  Because on any of these items,  most of you have the votes to get what you want anyway.  Today's meeting, to me, honestly,  seems like smoke and mirrors to move on to something else.  And maybe that's not the case,  and if I'm surprised, I'll apologize later.  I would like to point out that at the March 25th meeting  that you mentioned, Ann,  we agreed that we would only have the people  who have meetings dealing with essential items  and they would be the meetings that were required  by the city's charter the first Tuesday of the month.  Had we followed through on that,  we would have had four meetings  to deal with essential city business only,  had we followed through on our commitment  to ourselves and the public.  If we had not done that and we had said,  you know what, we're going to keep our regular meeting schedule,  keep the public out, that's not anything,  I'm not saying any of us wanted to do that, by the way,  keep the public out due to the pandemic,  if we continued on our regular meeting schedule,  we would have had seven regular meetings  dealing only with essential city business.  We've had 12 meetings.  We've had more meetings than we ever would have had  had we not been faced with the pandemic,  trying to keep everybody safe,  and only dealing with essential things.  Maybe it comes down to what is essential and what is not,  and I think that is the cause of some of my consternation,  some of the public's consternation,  and the reason that I'm irritated that I'm here  Tuesday afternoon at 3 o'clock,  which is a hard time for me to make,  and an impossible time for those,  well, maybe they're all working from home now,  so they can all watch the council meeting,  but if there is an appearance that things are  not upfront and transparent,  and I'm not saying that they are not upfront and transparent,  but I'm saying that's where I believe it's coming from.  Having said that, I'm here,  and I'm happy to engage in any discussions  that we want to talk about.  I appreciate, and I got it right away,  that the intention behind this meeting  was to try to find a way,  knowing that the church was unavailable to us,  and we had lost that opportunity,  trying to find an alternative  that allowed the community to be engaged,  and I know that that was the spirit  of your reasoning behind calling this.  I'm not sure if you can hear me,  but I understood that from the beginning,  and I appreciate it,  and I think it is essential in a way  that we look for ways to allow the community to be involved,  so I thank you for calling this meeting.  I do think it was a reasonable need,  and I hope that we can find some sort of solution.  Michelle?  Yeah, just want to kind of throw my comments in here initially.  I think that's a great point,  and I think that's something that I would like to say.  I was, you and I had talked about this meeting  prior to it being called,  and kind of the importance that we made a promise to the public,  and that promise was that they would be able to access  their city leaders the first meeting in August.  I think it's responsible.  I think it's reasonable for us to understand  that we've got some barriers to that happening,  and press to see how we can make that possible.  So I also appreciate you calling the meeting.  I'm ready to have this conversation,  and it's absolutely 100% related  to the global pandemic that we're in.  So it's essential,  and it's the work that we should be doing right now.  So thank you.  Thank you.  When we started down this journey,  I think each and every one of us thought  that this would be over June, July,  and we'd be able to start going back  into our regular,  regular meetings.  But that's not the case,  and I think especially now that we are on the watch list,  it's going to be very difficult to get off of the watch list  until such time that we adhere to all of the health  and safety guidelines that are being published  by our public health leaders, by the CDC, by the governor.  And so I think that's going to be a very,  very important step.  So it's clear that we cannot go back to business as usual.  But it's also clear that we,  I feel that we need to be able to engage our community.  We have heard of stories of other cities saying,  oh, well, we just use Zoom or we use WebEx,  and there's no problem.  We get, we get members of the public are able to engage,  and we can continue on with our work.  And so we've had a lot of challenges with that.  We've had challenges with our regular agendas.  We've had challenges with that.  Or even some cities are able to have members of the public  come into their council chamber,  but they don't have the number of people that we have  in our community that want to be engaged.  And I think that that is a wonderful problem to have,  that we have people that really want to share their opinions  with us,  and be part of the process.  However, when we're trying to navigate that electronically,  we have had our challenges with that.  We had our policing ad hoc committee,  a policing review ad hoc committee last Thursday.  And I think overall it went fairly well.  We had nine members of the,  the,  the,  the ad hoc committee that were able to engage.  A couple little hiccups getting started.  We were 15 minutes late.  Just getting everyone so that they could be part of the meeting.  We had, I believe, 38 participants.  Of those, six people spoke.  And two of them had problems with the communication.  Either feedback or not being able to be heard clearly.  So if we,  you know,  I'm hopeful that we can continue on that road  with those smaller meetings so that we can have engagement.  But when we have 200, 300 people online that want to speak,  that is going to be very, very difficult to navigate.  So we did have direction to staff to,  to see how we could do that.  Another suggestion that actually Scott brought up,  way back in probably April,  when we were deciding how to move forward,  how to hold these meetings,  Scott said,  well, maybe we need to get a microphone in the parking lot  and just have people speak to us from there  and have lines that queue up.  you know,  back then I thought,  oh, how are we ever going to manage with that?  But right now I'm thinking,  how can we manage without doing that?  Something like that.  Where we would allow minimum,  minimum numbers of people coming into the room,  lining up,  taking cards.  It would take additional staff time  to,  to manage that process.  X's on the sidewalk so everyone could be six feet apart from one another.  Having people line up.  So that is one idea that  we can put out there.  I'd like to hear other ideas.  If people like that idea,  shall we try it for August 4th?  How do we move forward?  I wanted this to be an idea session.  Yeah, I'm specifically interested.  I know that some cities,  I think including Redding,  allow folks to line up outside.  There's some organization to it.  I don't know if Redding requires this,  but I would want to,  that everybody's wearing masks.  There's an align that's aligned with the state guidance.  And come in one by one and speak to us here.  Or directly outside chambers,  whatever audio capabilities we might have.  It seems appropriate.  We would not be the first community to do it.  And I think it would take extra resources,  but these are the kind of resources we should be focused on right now.  So in my opinion,  I'm ready to do that.  And I'm curious if staff's done that,  done the research to kind of confirm what other communities are doing in that regard.  But that seems reasonable, plausible,  and an easy solution to the public engagement concern.  Those alarm bells were not related to your comments at all.  There's a silver alert.  Right.  Well, we,  you know,  I mentioned on March 25th,  when I made this emergency declaration,  that we were going to be dealing with this for the next 18 months or more.  So this isn't too much of a surprise.  We would expect us to be probably in worse condition from the virus,  at this point.  We've done,  the community has done very well to stave off the infection to this point.  But that's a delay of our immediate process.  And I would push that 18 months back out,  but I think we're going to continue to be dealing with this for the next 18 months.  So I'm surprised to see us here four months later from that declaration,  still toying with technology problems when we can have an outdoor queue.  There are lots of communities,  large and small,  that don't have this problem,  that seem to be moving forward.  I have a question that doesn't need to be answered right now,  but how often do we have 200 speakers on a single item?  It doesn't happen all that often.  I imagine with the capability to be right in someone's home,  sitting on your couch and engaging and speaking to the council would increase that number electronically,  which I think is a good thing.  Again,  I'm sharing with the,  with the mayor's comments.  But,  you know,  the public wanting to share their opinions is superb,  and I think that's fantastic.  But we also shouldn't be trying to do things the exact same way,  and nobody's expecting us to from this point.  We have to be able to provide the opportunities,  whether that's an outdoor mic,  which seems to be pretty easy to do,  save for it's 105 degrees outside.  We do have a queue that are available to be in these rooms,  because we know what the restrictions are and the numbers in here,  and how we can space them.  What's,  and if we held our meetings at 6 o'clock,  by the time people might be in the queue outside,  it might be 8 o'clock when it's much, much cooler.  3 o'clock in the afternoon, not too much.  You know,  this,  this restriction to continue to operate in the same way over the last four months,  or at least restrict,  and not look for alternatives,  shouldn't be stopping the business of government.  Now, I said four months ago,  that again, we would be dealing with this for at least the next 18 months or more.  Councilmember Morgan, I think his exact words are,  Mayor Stone seems to be saying some crazy things these days.  That was one of them.  One of the crazy things that we would still be dealing with this.  But the other one was,  that we were looking at the greatest economic devastation that this community has seen.  And again,  that was a little alarmist.  I apologize.  But those are the realities.  So we're sitting here,  four months later,  having a special meeting,  talking about ways that we can allow the public to engage,  whether it's electronic or in person,  when other communities are handling this just fine.  And we're literally on the precipice  of the largest economic devastation  that we have seen in generations.  I'm sorry, but we've lost the ball.  We've lost the target.  This should be something that should just be addressed,  move forward,  get the public engaged.  However possible,  that can be made electronically,  physically, however,  all of the above.  But we've got business to do,  and for four months,  we haven't been doing it.  And we did know that this was going to be with us for much,  much longer.  So the argument that we thought this was going to be over and done in June  was something I think the President was saying,  but certainly not what I said in my emergency declaration,  and not the information we had on March 25th.  Certainly not the information we've had all the way up to July 28th.  So let's just get it done.  Okay.  What would you,  well, let's hear from others.  I'd like to hear what your specific idea would be.  Any other comments?  Yeah, I think, you know,  better to try and fail  than to not have tried at all to solve this.  So, you know,  if the first idea is sort of a physical process  where people line up outside,  the east side of the building is generally shady in the afternoon,  6 o'clock,  could set up a line out there and a microphone,  or set up a line out there and then usher people in one at a time  to speak to us.  We apply limitations on a regular basis  to how many speakers depending on an amount of time that we've allotted.  So if we have,  if we're shooting for I think 45 minutes is what we've allowed in the past,  then we know exactly how many speakers are going to be allowed to speak  within that time.  So that's no different than what we've ever done,  or at least what we've done in recent history.  Yeah, let's get on with it.  Let's try that,  or I'm happy to hear other ideas,  but sort of a physical solution rather than a technological solution  seems like maybe the least fraught with problems.  Thanks, Council Member Huber.  I agree with you,  and I would just add,  I'm all for doing that and allowing the public comment emails  to come in for folks who don't feel comfortable  or can't stand outside for the state.  And if that was a motion,  I'd make a second on that,  but we have some public that needs to engage.  Yes.  Do other Council Members have any comments?  So I have a quick question.  Our legislature has figured out a way for people to call in  and to do by phone.  Debbie, I know you did hours and hours and hours of research,  so forgive me if this is a repeat,  but did we reach out to AT&T or Verizon,  and do they have the ability to offer us anything like that  that you're aware of?  I did not reach out to them.  We do know that there are some capabilities with call centers  and being able to have staff help have those come in.  The one program that I think city staff  was looking at today may cost three cents a minute,  and they charge you for every minute even if they're on hold.  So, you know, and then managing that,  obviously we can look into that if that's the Council's directive.  So like three cents a minute per person per...  Per minute.  Correct.  And if they're on hold, we're still being charged.  Exactly.  Okay.  Thank you.  That's almost like calling collect back in the days when you used to...  Extremely high price.  Okay.  So we have public comment on this item.  I imagine we may discuss other items as well,  but if we could vote on this particular item  and then go to additional comments.  Makes sense to me.  Okay.  So how many comments did we receive through Engage Chico?  I have 36 comments.  Currently.  And I will check back into that system.  And how many emails did we receive?  We have one email that came over.  Okay.  So if we have 36 comments,  let's take five minutes to review those  while you read the names of the individuals.  Okay.  In the Engage platform,  we actually received comments from Taylor Skinner,  Rob Berry, Kellyann Seitz, Peggy Gerolin, Buster Sherry,  Kimberly Hagstrom, Sean Bentley, Christine Williams, Paula Brackett,  Ed Hullahan, Lisa Moore, Roger Brady, Christopher Fowler, Steve Simpson,  Linda Kalbraith.  Jody Taylor, Tina Peters, Terris Lee, Jules Brown, Jessica Montgomery, Betty Neipath,  Deborah Jones, Kirsten Norris, Joshua Smith, Steven Muser, Nicole Nava, John Kask, Mike Harper,  Karen Wilhoyt, Gary Fertel, Julie Threat, Kimberly Burke, Rebecca Smith, Jacqueline Glover,  and Susan Smead.  And the email?  It's from Susan Smead.  Thank you.  It's an email to Kirsten Krab estamos estamos  It's an email to Kirsten Krab estamos  It's an email to Kirsten Krab estamos  It's an email to Kirsten Krab estamos  Please.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you. But in terms of the sheer numbers, we're much higher in terms of the number of people coming in. But we will do whatever you ask us to do and we'll try to find a solution to do that. So I appreciate your comments and all the work you've put in on it, Debbie, and your concern for the public safety.  appreciate your comments and all the work you've put in on it, Debbie, and your concern for the  public safety. I think we've seen examples all over in the last couple months of places that  have large volume of customers that have come up with systems for staggering people, you know,  Xs on the floor or mats or lines or whatever, you know, sometimes that are quite extensive that,  you know, extend back 20 or 30 customers. So given that, I would like to see us attempt this, and I'd  be happy to be part of the conversations on how we might make it work. But I would make the motion  that for our August 4th meeting, we make an attempt at a system of allowing  a system of allowing  people to line up for agenda items and come in one at a time to speak to the council, and that we  essentially sort of comply with all the standard time limits and number of speakers that we have in  the past. And I'll second the motion, and I appreciate your comments, Council Member Huber,  and especially to Ms. Presson.  This was not a comment or a criticism of staff at all. I see Mr. Marquis running around here every  single meeting sweating from the amount of work that he's doing in the IT department. So, yeah,  no question, this has been a problem that council has not driven forward. It's not a question of  staff. There are options available, and I think, you know, this isn't rocket science. We're going to  have to work around some things because we've never seen anything like this before, like coronavirus.  But the business of government must continue.  We've got tenant protections that are vanishing. We have second stimulus that's being discussed.  This community is right on the precipice of some pretty significant economic catastrophes, and we  should be operating. I would hate to think that we're holding off on these types of issues because  we can't figure out a way to get our very engaged community to communicate with us. So I'm glad to  second Council Member Huber's motion.  And I have a question.  I was going to say before we go down that road, I wanted to ask the city attorney something in regards to our  resolution 2020, specifically section 3, which is the regulation of public gatherings. It says that the city  council shall resume its regular meeting schedule of meeting on the first and third Tuesdays of the month,  effective August 1st.  It's an 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나  지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나  지나 지나 지나 지나 지나  지나 지나 지나 지나  지나 !  It's an 지나  지나  지나  지나  지나 !  지나  지나  motion, which I support, is saying that we would have an in-person participation, which  varies from the language in Section 3. So I wanted to get your advice on that.  That's correct. And the three sentences that you quoted there were Sentences 2, 3, and  4 in Section 3. And it's Sentences 3 and 4 that would need to be modified in the resolution  in order for the motion to actually be put into force. So the motion is valid as to stating  Council's desire on how to go forward. There would need to be additional, in order to be  perfectly proper here, we would need to be adding more. So the motion is valid as to  being able to go forward with that. And we also need to amend Resolution 2020 in order  to address that issue where you previously said you would only allow essential items  until there were guidelines promulgated by the state and you would only allow electronic  participation until there were guidelines in an order. So that part would just need  to be tweaked in a supplemental resolution to this.  this. We do not have that resolution for you today. And so we could go about it two ways.  You could say that that resolution, today's action, would be in order to  amend. I guess three ways. One, you could order that resolution be done based on your motion.  Two, you could direct the city manager as emergency services director to make that action.  Or you could bring back that resolution stating in more clear terms on the 4th.  And then the actual attendance at public meetings would occur on the 18th.  So council could take action today to make that amendment?  Was option one from what I heard?  That was option one.  But it may not be as clear.  Correct. And we often hear things in this room and we think we've got them down perfectly.  And we put them in verbiage and then there are differing opinions as to what the motion even was.  So I throw it out there in order to be accommodating.  But my preference is always to have it in hand in writing to show you and everyone.  And if you want to edit it, we edit it here.  And then we take action on it.  You had a comment.  Yeah. I know the motion says that it would be in accordance with state guidelines.  But I would hate to put anybody at risk by not kind of reassuring the public that we will be requiring masks  if folks are to be outside lining up in any capacity.  So I'm just wondering.  I'm curious if as a friendly amendment, we can just make sure to reassure that people will not be allowed in without masks  and people will not be allowed to wait in these lines without them.  Yeah. If that's a request for a friendly amendment, yeah, certainly.  I would accept it as well.  Yeah.  I would expect that we're doing this now anyway.  But I appreciate you highlighting and underscoring that that's a necessary element.  So preference from council on if we amend right here.  And we heard the city attorney's advice on that.  Ask the city manager in his role as the director of emergency services to make that  or bring it back on our meeting on August 4th.  It's sort of fitting if the city manager doesn't because we've been waiting.  And the reason why we haven't had it done is because council hasn't made that decision.  So now the city manager would be taking the emergency action.  That's good.  Okay.  Doc Humer.  Which is...  It seems to be to have it in front of us and have it back on the 4th.  So you can see what we're voting on.  I would be more comfortable with that.  So then it would potentially take effect on the 18th?  Yes.  Yeah.  Okay.  Well, if that's the way we have to go, then I'm okay with that.  I'm not hearing that's the way we have to go.  But I'm ready to do it right here right now or to direct staff.  I'm okay with do it right here right now or direct staff.  We have the power and authority.  It's within reason.  It's not unexpected.  It's appropriate.  We knew that the date was going to be coming at some point.  The public's been reasonably notified.  I don't care which route.  I feel like whatever's the most expeditious.  I think, you know, all of these people that commented to us online,  essentially, I think what they really want is to get in front of us.  I mean, that's their objective.  So let's get them in front of us ASAP.  So whatever it takes to do that, I'm okay with that.  Get them in front of us.  More importantly, getting the business of city government going.  Well, I think they go hand in hand.  Yeah, I agree.  It's not like we haven't been doing city business.  Yes.  There are two aspects that we also want to take into account.  If one of the items to bring back is the cannabis item on the 4th,  okay.  Okay.  So the cannabis item on the 4th,  I think it was put before the council on,  I believe that was March 17th or 18th.  It was publicly noticed.  And so I don't believe there is sufficient amount of time today  to publicly notice that for August 4th.  And I believe it's required to be public notice because of,  it's been a while since I've looked at that staff report,  but due to the amendments to the zoning code,  and in order to keep everything on track,  if we've noticed it back then,  we should probably re-notice it,  just so there's no potential for legal challenge.  The second point would be,  if there's going to be an amendment to resolution 2020,  either by the council taking action on that,  or directing the city manager to direct that,  I'd recommend that the language read something to the effect of any items  that may be heard by the city council at any meeting of the council or commission,  provided the public is afforded the opportunity to view  and provide comment by electronic means during the meeting,  or provide a testimony at the meeting in person,  utilizing social distancing as established by the emergency director,  consistent with state law.  And the middle part of that we could probably finesse  to how you want the public to participate,  and it sounds like that with the friendly amendment was in there.  It's the last part, the social distancing established,  and I think that's the first part.  It's the first part, the social distancing established,  by the emergency director,  consistent with state law.  That will allow the accommodation of ideas,  such as Councilmember Huber had about staging over there,  and bringing people in and so forth,  and consistent with what staffing levels are,  to come up with some creative solutions that work for this building,  versus what's working in Reading,  versus what's working in other places.  City Manager Arn?  Sure.  If you'd like to hear from the police chief  on how best we could manage that type of situation,  he is here and available if you want to ask about that.  I just want to offer that to the council,  since we have him here.  Council would like to hear from the police chief?  Absolutely.  Okay.  Good afternoon, council.  So I agree on the public engagement.  I do have a few concerns from the policing standpoint.  As far as being outside and some of the concepts that are being sent.  One of the issues of being in a lot of council meetings in the last few years is decorum.  And in your APMPs, the presiding officer in these public meetings run these meetings.  And that's the mayor.  And the police chief is designated as your sergeant at arms that enforces rules coming down from council.  So I just have some concerns.  I think the mayor is a little bit concerned about what's going on outside.  People are participating in a public meeting.  And how does the mayor keep that decorum?  So let's say we have like the concept of a microphone outside.  And somebody's talking.  And someone interrupts them.  Well, it's not a violation of law.  But it could be a violation of the APMPs on the public meeting.  And then how do you, mayor, know what's going on and direct staff to address some of those issues?  We've seen some of these issues inside the chambers itself.  So I just have some concerns of seeing this thing going out.  And how does staff, particularly the police department, what role are they going to play in that?  And, you know, right now I'm not interested in having any negative encounters out there when it comes to just public meetings.  And so those are a couple of my concerns there.  Just because I've been in these meetings where I've worked with the mayor at a sergeant's arms position to address decorum issues inside the council.  I don't know if you've heard of that.  I don't know how we would do that.  And then finally just a little bit of my take on the ad hoc committee with the technology that used WebEx.  I know it started off a little rough.  For me that was the first time being on WebEx.  I've been on a lot of different platforms over the last few weeks.  But once that got up and running I thought it was going pretty well.  And from my experience with technology it only just gets better the more you use it.  And so I see.  At least from our vision of the ad hoc committee.  That just getting better and better each time we host that WebEx meeting.  So that's just my take looking at the policing issue of coming and going.  And the last thing I want to remind council is I'm incredibly worried about this virus getting inside your police department.  And what it could do to the organization.  You know, the exposures.  And so right now.  As things change we're constantly trying to provide direction to our staff to best protect them out on the street while still doing our jobs.  Because if this thing really gets inside the organization.  I'm worried about that.  And so again from a policing standpoint we're trying to limit exposures.  Focus on the true issues going on.  Criminal issues going on in the city.  And so you know having hundreds of people out in the parking lot that our officers are engaged in.  Just poses a concern for me.  So with that I take any questions if you have any.  Thank you.  Yeah Chief Madden.  I certainly don't want to put your officers at any unnecessary increased risk.  Or go against your recommendations.  Do you think if you have a week to work with city staff to come up with a system.  That can both maintain some level of decorum.  As well as protect your officers.  Does that, do you think that gives you enough time to come up with a solution that may be workable?  You know I'll take direction from the city manager.  You know we can have these conversations certainly.  I mean I'm never not afraid to have those conversations.  See how your police department fits in these roles.  So we can have those.  Just wanted to put that out there.  Just from experience of the organization.  Being in these meetings from a policing standpoint.  Thank you very much.  I appreciate it.  And I hope your officers stay safe through this.  Yes.  Sir.  I would just to be clear with the council.  I have no intention.  I understand that you had mentioned this as a possibility.  But my preference would be people one by one come in here and speak.  And that almost completely eliminates the idea of anybody interrupting somebody while they're speaking.  That was just referenced.  So I don't.  I don't.  I don't have any interest in just hearing people's voices.  I think as long as they're masked and coming in one by one we can see their faces and hear them.  And they have the floor.  I agree.  There's a model for this already.  When you have to close the chambers because decorum is not being maintained you can let people in one at a time.  Plus we do have a little bit of seating that's possible here.  So there's at least a pool, a reservoir if you will, to keep people in the queue in a very limited number of folks.  But yeah I would expect them to come down here to the podium.  But this isn't rocket science.  And I wonder why council is attempting to find some specific policies.  I think if we empower staff to achieve this objective however they find best in this situation,  we direct staff to do that rather than council making decisions as to what we think we can tolerate or not  and what we want to do or what we don't want to do.  Let's empower staff to get this done and find the most efficient, effective way to achieve that objective.  I don't think we as council members, again we're policy makers, we are not administration in this city.  These are not our decisions to be made.  We want to have public meetings.  We want to have some way to keep a pool of people available.  We need to have a queue whether that's people separated six feet apart rather than congregating around a big screen like it's a live sporting event.  Which I think is what was kind of invoked from the earlier story.  No.  We just empower staff to do this.  And we're not doing it for the public.  And they do it.  It's that simple.  I mean not to say that there aren't regulations that we have to adhere to and that that's a very difficult task.  But council should not be the ones that's making the decision as to how we operationalize this.  Additional comments?  I would just add that as we go into this new phase,  we might have to consider how we,  align our agenda,  what we put on our agenda.  And you know,  I don't know if we do timed items.  I don't know what it is.  But we cannot,  yes,  you're correct when somebody's speaking in here,  absolutely there's not going to be any crosstalk or anything else.  But you can't tell me somebody standing out that line waiting for three hours standing in front of or behind their arch enemy.  There's not a chance of having altercations out there.  So there is inherent risk in having people standing.  So be it,  this item is not going to be heard until this item is heard.  We're only going to take this amount of time on each item.  We're not going to put 17 items on our agenda knowing that we have people standing outside for three hours waiting to talk.  So those would just be my concerns as we move forward that we don't set ourselves up for failure.  Let's have a nice light agenda maybe for the fourth and try it for the first time so we're ready to go for,  you know,  a manageable amount of business.  And that would be my comment.  The mayor has that discretion.  And has exercised it routinely.  We've said what we wanted on that agenda.  And I think it's done.  A couple of items.  And council has never been afraid to share with the mayor,  whoever the mayor is,  their opinions on what is on the agenda or not.  If it's the right thing or too many things.  So I'll take that.  Feedback.  Okay.  So,  I'm sorry.  No, you.  I think you were probably going to say what I was just going to say.  It seems like we're at this place where we need to refine our direction.  Yes.  And so the motion is to change the language in section three to allow for the public to address the council on items by coming into the room.  I think I'm saying it too much.  Do you want to restate it, Scott?  Yeah.  To allow the public to, in a way.  Or actually, the city attorney had written it down.  So if you wouldn't mind, we'll have him read it.  Go right ahead, Mr. Chairman.  That would be amending resolution 2020, section three at sentences three and four.  To then re-write it.  It's an amendment that's 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나  It's an amendment that's 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나  지나  It's an amendment that's 지나  지나  지나  지나  지나  지나  지나 !  지나  지나  지나  지나  지나 !  지나 ! !  However, we need guidance on whether or not we will make that amendment now or bring it back to us on the August 4th agenda on how that is made.  So I will leave that to Mr. Huber.  Or he can take friendly amendments or suggestions.  Yeah, so my preference would be that we deal with it tonight so that we can make those changes for the August 4th meeting.  That could be as part of the motion.  My preference as well, unless we're going to allow the city manager to take the authority to handle it that way.  I actually prefer, I mean it's my second, but I prefer it going to the city manager in the first place.  But I'll leave it alone.  Not to throw in any more hassles.  Okay.  I'd like to deal with it tonight.  Okay.  I'm good with that.  Any further discussion before we take a vote?  Anything else we need to consider on this particular item?  I want to be clear about my, or any opinion that would be described to me about the propriety of taking that action right now.  I do think it's appropriate to do so because your prior resolution 2020 says until further order of the city council.  And so what you're doing right now, I believe, would be an order.  I believe it's appropriate to do so because your prior resolution 2020 says until further order of the city council to amend that section three of RESA 2020.  I just think that it's often clearer to have a writing in front of you when you're taking action.  But as long as there's clarity as to what's being amended in section three to allow this, I think it'd be appropriate.  Do you feel like you've got the direction that's needed with that language?  If you're going with the language that I quoted, if that's what the motion is, then yes.  I think that it's crystal clear.  But we had a motion on the table and then started to be restated.  That was a little different.  We didn't have the discussion about the language I proposed.  So I believe the motion would need to be perfectly appropriate.  You need to amend the motion to adopt that sentence that I stated.  Okay.  I'll amend my motion to include the verbiage that Mr. Jarrett has referred to.  Second.  Is that adequate?  Okay.  Any other discussion?  I have one more quick question.  Mr. Jarrett, the last very last statement that you said is consistent with state law, that what we're doing must be consistent with state law.  Does state law allow...  Okay.  Are we allowed to have public meetings and large gatherings?  I believe so.  I don't believe that you could have...  And I've proposed it in that way for two reasons.  One...  We have new lines of sight here, so I'll move over a little bit.  For two reasons.  One, to ensure that we're being consistent with the Brown Act, first and foremost.  And two, to be consistent with any guidelines.  There might be a guideline that comes down from this.  If there's a state that says no public anywhere, we would have to abide by that.  What I wanted to avoid was, to be perfectly honest, was to avoid the word guideline in there, because we put that in the prior order in anticipation that by now there would be a state guideline to allow for public assembly uses.  And that's a little vague.  I believe that there's enough room to talk...  To have...  One or a few...  A few members of the public in this room with appropriate social distancing under current state guidelines and law.  So, Mr. Jared, with the wording that you've given us to work with with this, does that allow us the flexibility of...  Canceling or modifying this if something comes down from the state that says,  no, you can't have somebody walk in.  And I'm going to ask you to speak on the microphone.  Indeed.  And any...  Of course, anything that the city council does in regard to this can be overruled or preempted by county, state, or federal orders, and would be.  So, if the state were to come down and say, we're back at stage one, and it's stay at home order, and everything is, you know, pure shutdown, then we would have to go back to the state.  We would probably not be allowed to have these types of meetings.  Yes.  Okay.  Thank you.  But this order does, as worded, it does allow the flexibility...  I should say, we wouldn't have the ability to have people present, but it does have the flexibility to then still allow electronic only and go to a pure WebEx based.  Okay.  We'll call the question.  Council Member Huber?  Yes.  Council Member Morgan?  Yes.  Council Member Horry?  No.  Council Member Reynolds?  Aye.  Council Member Stone?  Aye.  Vice Mayor Brown?  Aye.  Mayor Schwab?  Aye.  Carries 7-0.  I'd like to take a quick break, five minutes.  It's an emotional 지나  to sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep  So we have amended resolution 2020 to allow us to engage the public  and to, in our meetings, and not have that distinction between the essential and non-essential items.  Are there other items that the council would like to consider?  I'd like to bring something forward for council consideration as we are looking to amend the emergency resolution.  It should be no surprise to any of you what this item is going to be,  as I sent a memo out to the entire council through the city clerk.  Understanding that we were making these potential amendments today, I wanted to bring an item forward.  Also understanding that the public will be able to access our next meeting,  I would like to propose the item today, and I'm happy to look at approving it at that meeting  where the public can engage and participate in the conversation.  I am going to read from some of the memo that I sent you.  You're going to read the same noise now?  For the benefit of the public.  For the benefit of the public.  Yeah.  So today, just to be direct, I am requesting council consideration of including enforcement  of the statewide order on face coverings and other statewide mandates for COVID-19  in the city's COVID-19 emergency resolution.  This pandemic has taken a massive toll on our community's health and our economy,  and the impacts only continue to worsen.  As the mayor mentioned, we've been added to the state's watch list as a county.  Due to the increasing number of people in the city, we've been added to the state's watch list as a county.  We've had a number of cases affecting our residents, and we are at the center of that equation.  Obviously, I've been incredibly heartened and felt uplifted by the city and the city council's responses  to the economic devastation that has followed this virus.  We've expanded outdoor dining opportunities.  We're supplying aid to local businesses through loan programs.  We're assisting in providing personal protective equipment to businesses.  We're canceling parking meter fees to increase activity in the downtown area.  And we are actively engaging.  We're helping both the university and local businesses to keep our economy alive.  That's a lot of incredible work by city staff, and I'm proud of it.  However, we're doing this work and also being added to the Butte County watch list for COVID-19,  which poses additional threats to public health and, by extension, our economy.  I think this risk only increases as college students begin to return to our community,  and we see that in the community.  We start to move forward in those ways.  No one wants to see that risk increase, but until the virus is under control in our region,  this is the reality that we have in front of us.  And I believe it's time for us to be leaders on this issue and to take greater responsibility  for our community's health as we are working on creating a healthy economy to get us through this storm.  So today, I'd like for the council to consider amending its COVID-19 emergency resolution  to operationalize city enforcement of the statewide order on face coverings,  and other state mandates related to COVID-19.  We have done great work.  Our community has done great work.  Hundreds of businesses have done great work to voluntarily comply with these orders  and to help and to do their part in slowing the spread.  But I want us to be doing right by those businesses and those individuals who have taken those steps  by honoring them and enforcing the mandate with those who are putting public health at risk  and, by extension, putting our...  our economy at risk.  So that's my request today.  And I'm happy to answer any questions and deliberations.  I have a question.  Could you describe exactly what you would foresee city enforcement looking like?  So is that somebody's walking down the sidewalk and they don't have their mask on and they're alone,  taking their dog for a walk, you're enforcing them?  Are we going to businesses and enforcing in businesses?  So if you could just describe a little bit more what exactly you're proposing.  I will read you the list that is laid out by the state in terms of when a mask is required.  In any indoor public space, when waiting in line, when getting health care,  on public transportation or when ride sharing, at work, when near others or moving through common areas,  outdoors if you can't stay six feet away from others.  There are also exemptions in the state mandate that would apply when eating and drinking,  communicating with a hearing impaired person.  Who needs to read your lips?  If it poses a risk to you at work, when you're not sharing a common area, room or enclosed space with others,  when you're getting a service to the nose or face, when outdoors and public and can stay six feet from others.  So I, as Council Member Stone stated earlier, we don't operationalize, we provide policy direction.  My request is that we provide that policy direction.  And I'm happy to answer that.  I understand that we included in our emergency order and that we give staff the, we empower staff to implement it.  I didn't quite catch the beginning.  Did you say that your request today is to agendize it on the 4th?  My request today was going to be to change it.  We have made direction that we will be opening the meetings to public at the next meeting.  I understand that this is an item the public would very likely want to engage on.  I'm just allowing some leeway that as long as it is on a very, an agenda very soon, I'm happy.  Perhaps it's like our previous issue that we talked about with the city attorney.  Our options of adopting such an amendment to the emergency resolution would be to provide guidance to the city attorney,  who would then in turn bring us language that we could see and know exactly what we would be engaging in.  For this item, that seems to make sense.  So if, I guess the action I'm requesting today is to direct staff to bring that back at our first meeting in August.  You know, when I first heard about this, and it's not the first time that I've heard from the community that they've been asking for our direction, our law.  I think it's important to have our leadership on wearing the mask because we've got many people who are rightfully concerned  that there are a few members of the public who are not wearing the masks.  And the health threat that that brings to us.  And then I thought, well how on earth are the police going to be able to enforce this to get 100% compliance?  And I actually think that's a good question.  I don't think that that's reasonable or practical or realistic.  Just like I know that wearing seat belts save lives.  And those are laws that are on the books.  And I know that the police department in all due diligence would want everyone to be wearing their seat belts.  But I know that that doesn't happen.  Just like cell phone use in cars.  That doesn't happen.  But if there is a situation where using a cell phone while driving is causing a safety hazard,  and if the police observe it, then they're going to enforce that.  And that's how I see practically how this could play out.  And then I think, you know, we've all heard the story of, was it last weekend?  Late last week there was a large gathering up in Redding.  A thousand people, none of them wearing masks.  That would be a situation that I would hope that the police department would say, this is not safe for our community.  Or when as we see college students returning to us in the fall, we know that that age group, 18 to 24, the traditional age group for college students,  may be carriers of the virus, but may not come down with symptoms.  However, when we look at the dashboard on the Butte County Public Health, you see that that is the largest demographic of those that are affected.  And if gatherings, as we know, college students have gatherings, that they're not practicing the six foot distance, that would be another instance.  It's an 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나  지나  지나  지나 !  지나 !  지나 ! !  지나  지나  restaurants, we're putting them in an impossible situation, or they're in an impossible situation,  a very challenging situation perhaps. Many younger people, many people that are working  for minimum wage are at the retail establishments, at fast food restaurants, and while their  owners, their corporate office may say we're not allowing people in here without masks,  we're asking the young person to enforce that. But we're not giving them any legal authority  here at the city level, and I think that that reinforces what companies are trying to do  to encourage compliance. Our cases have climbed.  We're now at 866 individuals who have tested positive in Butte County. 445 of them are  in Chico. We've had seven deaths. We could really get our virus under control if we practiced  the guidelines from CDC and the state of California to social distance at six feet, where I'm  really hopeful that that's really an opportunity to really stop that, to really stop that, to  really stop that, to really stop that, to really stop that, to really stop that, to really  stop that, to really stop that, to really stop that, to really stop that, to really  stop that, to really stop that, to really stop that, to really stop that, to really  stop that, to really stop that, to really stop that, to really stop that, to really  stop that, to really stop that, to really stop that, to really stop that, to really  stop that, to really stop that, to really stop that, to really stop that, to really  stop that, to really stop that, to really stop that, to really stop that, to really  the flu. It's something that's very serious. And I, for one, would love to put this in our past,  but we need to have everyone's participation in those guidelines. And to your point, Mayor Schwab,  you know, I hear every day or see every day folks saying, I'm not going to go to X place. I'm not  going to shop at local businesses because I don't know what I'm walking into. Or if I walk into a  situation that I know isn't safe, I'm not going to shop there. And the impacts to our economy are  directly related to compliance with these orders. The other piece I want to add is that I don't  believe we should just begin enforcement without also having a robust educational campaign for  the community, whether that be additional signage, taking out Facebook ads, radio ads. Like, I think  we need to communicate to the public our commitment to public health and to moving us  forward.  And so I would want us to also direct staff to invest more in that public information piece so  that we really can reinforce the culture of protecting each other and protecting our community  and moving forward.  It doesn't have to be now, but now is also appropriate. Can we hear from the police chief  on his thoughts on how his officers could enforce it or other possible means of enforcement or  other?  I don't like the word enforcement. Compliance. I'm on board with everything that's being said. I just wanted to see what that could look like, what kind of burden we're putting on them, or if there's perhaps a different or better way.  Okay. Chief Madden.  Sorry, Chief.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  It's all good now.  It's all good now.  It's all good now.  It's all good now.  It's all good now. And you see as its public awareness, data July 2nd that supports face coverings. That leads you to the Department of Health, California Department of Public Health, that leads you to the guidelines of face coverings that the vice mayor was discussing.  the California Department of Public Health  that leads you to the guidelines of face coverings  that Vice Mayor was discussing.  So I'm networking with a lot of police chiefs right now  on these issues.  And the consensus from the police chief community  is it's not in regards to face masks.  We don't know what the enforcement mechanism is  because it goes back to a guideline  and it's not in the executive order.  So that causes me some concern.  So if I don't see that,  I don't know that you can criminally enforce solely on that order.  Even if the police department was directed to enforce  solely on the state orders and not on the local ordinance,  the Butte County District Attorney,  who would be the prosecutional authority for these violations  because it would be a misdemeanor,  has made it clear that due to the issues with the court system right now  that these cases would not be filed  because the defendant in that case would have the ability to have a jury trial.  And they're not having any jury trials right now.  So that's an issue there.  Obviously, the other option could be handling this  on a city municipal code  and addressing this issue in administrative function  rather than criminal.  And you have, you know,  obviously, the law is in place.  There's obviously codes that allow you to do that.  So to specifically address the issue of face coverings  from a police department standpoint,  there's a multitude of issues  to go with those exceptions in those guidelines.  So I'll give you an example.  In that guideline, it talks about persons with medical  or mental health conditions are exempt.  There would be no way law enforcement could prove or disprove  that there was a violation based on exemptions in these guidelines.  Our own officers fit within the exemptions  due to the officer's safety concerns.  I think it would be, I would be concerned  of public perception of officers attempting to enforce an order  where they may or may not be wearing one as well.  So again, putting the police in that position,  again, I believe it could be potential  for negative encounters between our law enforcement  and our community.  The next concern for me from the policing aspect is capacity.  If the police were directed to enforce COVID-19 related orders,  these calls for service would be very low on our priority levels  given what's going on right now  and how we prioritize calls for service.  These calls would inundate police and fire dispatch center,  which is understaffed with some open positions  that we're trying to fill.  And we're already seeing an increase in crimes,  specifically in violent crime,  over the last couple of months.  As a police department, we're currently looking  at different staffing models to combat those problems.  So the ability for the police department  to have capacity to actually enforce these types of orders  would be pretty low.  And then finally, in a time where our police department  is laser focused on building and improving relationships  within this community,  this would only disrupt our efforts to continue  to build and strengthen relationships  with positive interactions.  And I go back to the original issue of this order  not being specific to being enforced.  And so finally, what I'll say is that  I've been listening to these discussion groups  with police chiefs all up and down the state  that are trying to combat this problem.  And the only real solution I'm seeing  coming out of any of the municipalities  is looking at a more code enforcement stance with,  administrative function due to the court systems  entirely across the state.  So with that, I would welcome any questions.  Can you explain more about how that would work?  You said it would be a misdemeanor  if we made it a municipal code enforcement.  So I mean, that's probably a question  for code enforcement and the city attorney.  Yeah.  But what I'm saying is if we're acting right now,  if we're talking about going off the executive orders  without any other involvement from city council  creating its own ordinance to use  through its municipal code,  I'm not seeing any true way to enforce this order  specifically when it comes to face coverings,  because face coverings are not documented  in his executive order.  When it comes to businesses who are non-compliant  with the order, does that change?  That might be the angle there.  But again, when we talk about outside of businesses,  when we're talking about just community at large  and the guidelines that we're referring to  and really kind of going off here,  again, it's a guideline.  You go to the governor's office and it sends you  to the California Department of Public Health  for the guidelines where it says it must,  but then you want to be able to go back  and go back to the governor's orders to say,  it must because it's documented in an executive order,  which makes it codified in law.  Got it. I got that piece.  I'm just curious with, you know,  whether maybe we take a code enforcement approach  with the former of those issues  and allowed our police department to enforce the orders  that are enforceable as mandated by the state  regarding businesses and those types of things.  Would that seems to be plausible?  Yes.  Yes, that is plausible.  Okay. Thank you.  I appreciate it.  Yeah.  So it's the state who has not given the right types  of specific, they're just issuing guidelines.  They're not establishing something that we can go back  to specifically to say that you are not allowed to do this.  Well, in the executive orders, they talk about the businesses  and some of the things that the vice mayor is talking about.  So those would be enforceable.  And I would defer to the city attorney  for more description on that.  I'm really concerned about the face coverings  and how we play that role in enforcement actions,  specifically regarding mass.  So if there was a large gathering of 1,000 people  at one mile, or if there are groups of individuals  having an event that they're not social distancing,  and it's a public safety hazard,  what tools are at your disposal to disperse that group?  Well, again, we can fall back on those orders,  but with all these exemptions, where do you draw the line?  You've got exemptions with household members  that this exempts.  You've got exemptions, like I said,  with mental and physical health.  I mean, where do you establish those lines,  because if you go up to that group and you find,  or someone just says, I got a medical condition,  I can't wear a mask, we're done.  I mean, there's nothing further we can do with that.  So again, we've been playing a role  working with code enforcement,  trying to do the educational piece,  trying to get it out there.  We recognize what's going on.  You know, you spoke earlier about my concerns  with our own staff, right?  And so I get it, but at the end of the day,  I'm just trying to make sure that everybody understands  as we create these policies,  what we can and can't do from a police standpoint.  And right now, just going off, dealing with face coverings,  I think if that's the direction of council,  we probably need to look at how council direction  and council policy to enforce that.  Cause I'm just, I'm not seeing that enforceable action.  You know, and we have, you know,  and I'm not working with chiefs that, you know,  have five, 600,000 people in their city,  and they're saying the same thing.  So it's definitely a problem.  Do all this will involve as well.  So forgive my ignorance.  Somebody skateboarding on the sidewalk.  Is that a misdemeanor?  Is that a municipal code violation?  Municipal code violation.  Okay, so here's, this is a question.  If the goal is to the extent possible,  a hundred percent compliance, right?  And that's really what we want.  We don't want to go be the Gestapo.  If the goal is a hundred percent compliance,  is there a way with the social media campaign?  I mean, anybody that doesn't know this already  has got their head up their butt somewhere, but whatever.  If we can push social media marketing,  these are the things that need to be done.  And in the city of Chico,  this is considered a what municipal violation.  I mean, really at the end of the day,  you want the people to believe what they're doing is illegal.  So they do it.  And they're just, you know, they're just doing it.  It doesn't have to be any enforcement.  I mean, so I guess that's partially a question  for Mr. Jarrett is that,  can we write that into the municipal code  and help that be part of the messaging?  So we get closer to where we're trying to get,  and then we don't have to worry about necessarily,  you know, does the police officer have to do this?  Do they have to do that?  Because the public, the general public is hearing  wherever they hear it.  They're like, master, good idea for this reason,  this reason, this reason to the mayor's point.  We want to get through this in five weeks or four weeks  or six weeks or six, whatever it's going to take.  And not only is it encouraged by the state and the city of Chico,  it's part of the municipal code.  And most people don't know the difference.  Municipal code other than a felony.  Is that something we could write in the municipal code?  You could.  I don't think you need to go that far to put it  as an ordinance in the municipal code,  even if it were an urgency ordinance.  Okay. You have to be able to do that.  So, we have the authority on multiple levels.  First with the city manager  as the emergency services director to issue orders.  You as a council have the ability to do so.  Violation of those orders is a misdemeanor pursuant to 268090.  And when it's a misdemeanor, it does not mean that it needs  to be filed as a criminal matter.  It can be reduced to a citation.  So, jury trial wouldn't attach.  I do not dispute the chief's take on this, that there's a lot  of smoke here in the sense of it's murky in trying  to interpret what the governor has done at various levels.  It is difficult to wade through the COVID19.ca.gov portal that goes  to another.  And before you know it, you have to go to Dr. Angel's website  with the actual Department of Public Health,  Health Officer orders.  Bottom line with that is those orders are enforceable  under the government code by the city, by police department,  as misdemeanors.  And that's under government code 8665.  So, that means a ticket citation?  No court appearance, fine, something like that?  Correct.  It would, I mean, as a misdemeanor,  you would then file it and reduce it down to a citation  and just like a parking ticket type thing.  Or just like a citation for a speed violation that's not a  misdemeanor, right?  There are a number of cities that held off on any type  of enforcement.  There are a number of cities that went forward  with enforcement right off the bat.  Okay.  With face masks and social distancing, the first city I  heard of that actually imposing this was San Diego.  That social distancing and just being  at the beach back in April under, I believe that was  under the 8665 state law.  Recently San Francisco, the PD is issuing citations  to both businesses.  And individuals, County of Napa, Marin County, Calabasas,  West Hollywood, Malibu, Beverly Hills, Costa Mesa, Glendale,  Santa Monica, Manhattan Beach.  So, there are a number of cities statewide that are dealing  with this and issuing citations.  And all those cities I just mentioned were  for the mask issue.  So, the chief and I have not spoken on how, and we're not,  frankly, we haven't gotten direction  to pursue investigating how to enforce the mask issue.  So, there is a path out there.  Whether it's going to work here is another thing.  But some cities are finding a way to make some things work.  The two approaches that cities are taking are either the  criminal route as infractions or the administrative citation route.  With the administrative citation route, you are on the city code.  And most cities are taking the criminal route as infractions.  So, in most cases on those cities that I was mentioning,  it still is the law enforcement agency where there's the sheriff  as the contract police department, as in West Hollywood,  Calabasas, Malibu.  But in other cities, San Francisco,  it's the police department, of course.  Beverly Hills, the same.  Santa Monica.  Those have their own police departments.  It's a mixed bag whether or not it's administrative citation  or an infraction.  As an administrative citation, you need to have a review hearing  for due process purposes.  And then after that, the person can go to superior court  for file a writ before a judge.  And as the chief mentioned, the court system is quite bogged  down, but they're finding ways to get around that.  Many courts now have gone to a pure WebEx or their own version  of WebEx.  In some cases.  Can I ask for some quick clarity with what you just said?  So, somebody gets a citation whether it's  through this criminal mechanism or administratively.  They either pay the fine and move on or they contest it  and then go through the process that you're now describing?  Okay. Thank you.  And that would be the case with both a citation  or with an administrative citation.  In both cases, you essentially have to pay for the bail,  essentially.  And then at the conclusion of the hearing, you either have  that fine or bail returned or it's sustained  and then there's appeal rights, you know,  to the court of appeal, essentially.  I will also add, we've been monitoring cases all throughout  the Ninth Circuit on the issue of enforcement of orders.  We're unaware of an order  that has been successfully contested.  And even going to the Supreme Court, there have been petitions  of the Supreme Court about, I believe this is true,  to the U.S. Supreme Court and other circuits that, I mean,  by and large the courts are, or almost exclusively the courts,  are upholding these orders in the name  of criminal law enforcement.  We're aware of the fact that in the courts,  health.  As to the mask in particular, I've not heard  of any legal challenge being successful.  I know that there is one being mounted by the lobbying group  for cosmetologists, but I don't believe  that that has been adjudicated yet.  Are we still, oh, I'm sorry, were you up?  No.  Are we still just talking about whether or not  to agendize this?  Because it kind of feels  like we're having the whole conversation.  The reason that I brought it up today is  because we're talking about amending our emergency ordinance.  It fits in that conversation and that paradigm.  If the goal of this council is to hear it next time,  that's obviously an option.  If the goal of council is to give direction to staff  to bring us back something at our next meeting,  that's an option.  That's what I'd prefer, obviously.  But, yeah.  I'm open to people's opinions.  I'll just weigh in with my thoughts on it.  There's one more thing I can add regarding enforcement.  And this goes back to your order 7-20 at section 6.  It talks about enforcement there.  And the enforcement was identified regarding the  regulation of public facilities and private facilities  and public gatherings.  And that was to ensure that there was clear identification  that the sections would be punishable by a fine of not  to exceed $1,000 or not to exceed imprisonment of six months.  So bringing it as a misdemeanor and bringing it pursuant  to the government code section 268090, as I mentioned,  or government code 8665.  That was set apart from everything else in that so that,  in the sense that there was not enforcement obligation  for exemption of delivery vehicles, religious gatherings,  protection of affected tenants,  and utility service determination.  So there is precedent in your resolutions regarding enforcement.  And so that would likely need to be looked at and amended  to make sure there wasn't an argument  that you had already limited yourselves,  and that there was no need to go into any further  and further enforcement actions.  I'll call a point of order really quick.  I feel like we're getting really deep into something that was not  on the agenda as opposed to the item.  It was something that was sent to us after the agenda was posted  as something to discuss.  And I feel like we're getting really far  into the weeds and borderline.  So if Councilmember Reynolds, I sent this  out to give Council a heads up.  I could have brought this up on my own volition  without giving you a heads up.  This was a courtesy email that I sent out to make sure  that you were prepared.  Agreed.  But it was not an agenda item.  So the public hasn't been noticed.  What's on the agenda, it includes this conversation.  City Attorney, can you?  No.  So.  Yes, please provide direction.  I felt that this item falls into actions related  to the COVID-19 pandemic, reviewing the resolution  and going forward.  Please give us your opinion.  In coverage, yeah.  So, yeah, the Brown Act requires that there be notice regarding  what's going to be discussed.  As I read what you put on the agenda, Mayor Schwab,  it was to discuss issues relating to amending the orders.  If what you're talking about is amending the orders,  then it's likely within that purview.  So along those lines, I'd like to make a motion  that we agendize the discussion of the, you know,  the face mask enforcement for a future meeting.  Along with that, I'd just like to state the obvious,  which I think most of this, it sounds to me like most  of this council already acknowledges that, you know,  we've seen empirical data that cities, states, and countries  who have done a mandatory face mask have a,  not only have a decreased risk of COVID, but they actually,  have a decreased incidence of cases.  So, you know, there's a suggestion out there  that somehow this takes away people's freedom.  But somebody brought up seat belts and somebody brought up,  you know, talking on the cell phone.  We have rules about those things because they keep us safe.  And this is another thing that keeps us safe and it makes sense  for us to put something in place to assure  that we're helping keep our citizens safe.  So, Mr. Huber, instead of, or having this discussion  at a future meeting, could it be to direct staff  to bring options back to us on enforcement safety?  Yeah, that could certainly be part of it, yeah.  Mr. Stone?  Well, I was going to say, similar to what your questions were,  and it sounds like Councilmember Huber is in line again.  We're a policy arm, so I think the city manager has emergency  authority that we've granted him for these types of things.  I appreciate Vice Mayor Brown bringing this forward and agree  that this is an important topic to be discussed.  But to Mayor Schwab's questions, let's empower staff  with what we are looking at.  We can leave it to staff as to when that can be implemented.  It could be right now because the city manager has  that emergency authority, or it could be  at the August 4th meeting, or it could be some other future time  when it makes sense.  So to your question, Mayor Schwab,  let's operationalize this with staff  when they think they can most effectively implement that.  We can have that discussion on the 4th or the 18th  or whatever they feel like it's appropriate.  But we can tonight give direction to staff  to operationalize exactly these types of things rather than try  to get in the weeds and making larger decisions than we had  to tonight.  I know it is only 445 rather than 11 o'clock at night,  but this really is a task for our municipal administrators.  And if we need guidance, we can go to the state.  We can go to the Department of Public Health.  There are lots of organizations that are dealing with this,  of course.  So I just think if we are, I was going to make a substitute motion  on your motion, Scott, effectively.  I'm directing kind of along the lines of what Mayor Schwab said.  Let's give staff direction, allow them the opportunity  to change our municipal code or whatever else  that they feel is appropriate.  As a body, I'd like us to direct staff to tell them this is what  we would like to see operationalized.  And I think that's the spirit of what you're looking for,  Vice Mayor Brown.  I don't think this, I don't mean to sound curt  about not having council engaged in this type of activity,  but we routinely as a council,  we veer way out of our lane in order to dabble into operational  details that we probably shouldn't.  Yes.  I would say that the thing I'm asking is  that we operationalize enforcement.  And I don't know.  It doesn't matter what that means, right?  It makes the most sense.  So exactly your point.  I hadn't heard a second.  And it sounds like Council Member Huber is kind  of on board in the first place.  So if we can call for a second.  If there isn't a second, I'll make another motion.  Is there a second?  I have just like a little bit of hesitation on the second.  I totally appreciate your motion.  It's just a, and I think I heard this in what you were saying  to Council Member Stone is that I would love for this  to be addressed a little sooner rather than later.  And I don't see any kind of stamp on it.  I get that operationalizing it might take extra time,  but I would love to have options  in front of us sooner rather than later.  So I'll make the motion  and respectfully appreciate Council Member Huber's  motion.  I support the general activity, but again,  I'd like to see us more expeditiously address this.  There's no question the exigency of this issue.  Our community is at risk.  Public safety is our number one priority  and wearing masks saves lives.  A neighboring county's ICU is in overflow right now.  And so I also support marketing with whatever we can  to encourage people to tell them that this is a change  and we're going to begin enforcing this activity,  whether it's code enforcement or PD or otherwise.  You know, we need marketing to counteract some  of our Council members that write letters  to the editor encouraging people not to behave.  So I'm supportive of all of the marketing that we can engage in.  And remember, just this action alone, just telling people  in this community and the businesses in this community  that we will stand by them and that we're going  to enforce this rule encourages businesses to hold the line  and make sure that their customers  and their activity is adhering to the law because they know  that they have a concern as well.  When they don't have a municipality that's backing them  up to protect them and knowing that there's regulations  in place and that they will be enforced,  there's even less regulatory compliance.  So in the end, we're supporting our businesses,  we're supporting our community members,  and we're keeping our community members safe regardless  of the nonsense that may be out there and the misinformation  and disinformation that occurs about wearing masks.  So with that, my motion is to approve.  We will now move to the next item,  which is to direct staff to operationalize enforcement  of the mask order as soon as possible and leaving the  discretion to staff as to how to achieve that.  Second.  So we have a motion and a second.  Comments?  Questions?  So the motion is to direct staff to operationalize enforcement  of the mask requirement.  We'll move to the next item.  The state guidelines, yes.  And leaving the discretion to staff as to how they would  like to operationalize that.  But we would like to see that,  I'll quote the Vice Mayor, sooner rather than later.  And if that means we have to take action for August 4th,  and we probably will to refine those things, we want to do that.  And semantics, but I think face coverings is more appropriate.  I know there's a lot of different ways people can  so I think .  I've seen this, yes.  So I'm just saying I would like face coverings  to be kind of the general guidance.  I mean, I will say that my request also includes  enforcement of the other mandates, as I had mentioned  to the chief businesses who are out of compliance,  that kind of thing.  I would like for that to be included.  Is that something you would be?  I would absolutely, yes, please.  So I guess my confusion on that still lies  with are you expecting this comes back on the 4th,  or are you expecting this to come back on the 5th?  I'm not sure I'm expecting that staff start  to enforce this at their discretion.  Both.  As soon as possible.  I would like staff to, at their discretion,  begin to operationalize this as soon as reasonably feasible.  They have the authority to do that.  And whatever we need to bring back operationally from,  excuse me, not to confuse things,  from a policy standpoint that it is brought back again  at the earliest possible time,  which I would imagine would be August 4th.  But I wasn't certain that all of that had to be  be in the motion. Knowing that our agenda is supposed to be published tomorrow. Yeah, it's  going to be tough. I mean, as long as we're moving to public engagement, second meeting in August.  Which is the whole reason why I wanted to see staff operationalize this. It can be done sooner.  Correct. We're in this. This is an emergency, as we said back in March. So just a small  clarification. When you say operationalize to me, that makes it sound like they're writing it,  they're starting it, they're doing it. What we're asking for them is to bring us back  suggested direction for us to vote on here public input. And then we just, the council has to vote  to move that forward. That was not my intention. I expected staff to, given their discretion and  their ability to enforce. So we're telling them to write a law or a ordinance that they will  operationalize and it's not going to come back to us for a vote to approve? The city manager  has that option. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't  know. We're not really taking action at all because the city manager has the authority to do it  anyway. We just had a big deliberation to let Skipper know that that's what we want to do.  But the city manager is not going to do anything. The city manager is not going to do anything  without direction from us, which is prudent and makes sense. So we don't have to completely write  the law and make sure that everything's perfect in order to operationalize the safety of our  citizens.  We're in an emergency. We gave the authority to the city manager back in March and he can  operationalize this. What he needs to hear from us is we would like to see this happen. Now if  there's a law that needs to be created in order to effectuate that, where we need to pass it in  here, we can do that August 18th. But we already have the ability, the city manager already has  the ability to operationalize what the state of California, the California Department of Public  Health, almost every single health leader in the entire state and country and potentially the world  has said we should be doing in order to protect.  I'm not debating that.  I just want to know exactly what we're asking for.  So not.  And I'm not encouraging anybody to wear masks.  That was for the folks at home. I know you know what I'm saying.  And we are doing that now through quote enforcement, encouragement and education.  Seems to me what we're saying is that this is a priority for us, for enforcement, for Ms. Jorm.  Sure. So, so what I'm hearing from the city council, and I think that the conversation, the discussion is, is that we're not going to do anything without direction from the city manager.  It's really an 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나  be candid, the vast majority of businesses and individuals are abiding by these guidelines.  But what you're looking for is, and this is what staff's hearing, is you want us to turn  the pressure up. And if there are individuals that are blatantly affronting these rules,  that you would like staff to enforce those. And there are some areas here that we have  flexibility to do that soon, as soon as today or tomorrow. There are other areas that we're  going to have to work through, the city attorney, the police chief, code enforcement. We're  going to have to sit down and say, okay, on these aspects of these face coverings, what  do we need to put in place in order to operationalize, allow us to operationalize it. That's the  discussion that will come back at a future meeting. Right now, with the legal ability  that I have to enforce some of these issues, we'll move forward with that. As long as there's  at least a majority of council members that agree with this, then we're going to move  forward with what we can. So that's what staff's hearing, for whatever it's worth.  That's what I heard as well. Thank you.  Yes. And that would include more outreach to our community?  Yeah, we already have a number of campaigns on that front. We're working on PSAs and a  number of other things, and we will ramp that up another degree. And Linda's back there.  She hears this, and so happy to ramp that up even further.  More discussion?  No.  Okay. In fact, call the question. I know it's probably not necessary, but...  Okay. Just make sure, have we had any additional comments?  No.  And have we had any additional emails?  No, there's more.  Okay. So have the roll call vote, please.  Council Member Huber?  Yes.  Council Member Morgan?  Yes.  Council Member Orry?  Yes.  Council Member Reynolds?  Yes.  Council Member Stone?  Aye.  Vice Mayor Brown?  Aye.  Mayor Schwab?  Aye.  Carries 7-0.  Okay.  We've discussed two items on COVID-19. Is there any other items that members of the  council would like to discuss?  I'll defer. I had asked the City Manager for an update on economic steps that we're taking  post-COVID again because we're on the precipice. He has indicated to me that August 4th is  the date for that discussion, and I'm comfortable waiting on that, as he and I discussed.  We're in the middle of the next meeting, so if there's any other items, please let me  know.  Any other topics?  Well, thank you very much for holding this special meeting. We have direction to go forward  for August 4th. I think that our time was well spent so that we can continue moving  forward to serve our public, to be the public servants that we are, and to do what we can  do to solve those problems that we see that's really really really really really really  to ensure the safety and health of our community.  With that, we will adjourn to the regular city council meeting on Tuesday, August 4th at 6 p.m. in the council chamber.
