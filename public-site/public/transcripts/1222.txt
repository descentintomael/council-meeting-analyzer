 Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Item two, consent agenda.  Do we have any speakers on the consent agenda?  No, ma'am.  Are there any motions for the consent agenda?  Move to approve.  Motion in a second.  So the motion by Commissioner Wolfe, the second by Commissioner Wall.  All in favor, we will do the roll call vote.  Commissioner Wolfe?  Aye.  Commissioner Wall?  Aye.  Commissioner Wolfe?  Aye.  Commissioner Sharpe?  Aye.  Commissioner Laffins?  Aye.  Commissioner Byker-Kaufman?  Aye.  Vice Chair Scarpa?  Aye.  Chair Scott?  Aye.  So public comments.  Members of the public may address the commission at this time on any matter not already listed  on the agenda.  We do have comment cards in the back if anybody would like to get one in at this time.  And also if you would like to get any speaker cards in for item 4.1.  Or item 4.2.  Nicole, do we have any public comments?  No.  Does anybody wish to speak on any matter not on the agenda?  Okay.  Then we will move to item 4.1.  I will ask for any ex parte communication on item 4.1 starting to my left.  Yes.  I had ex parte communications with the project architect.  And I have a question.  I will ask for any other questions from the applicant on this project.  None?  I have had none.  Okay.  All right.  Then we will turn it over to associate planner tina wilson.  good evening, chair scott, vice chair Scarpa and members of the commission.  Item 4.1.  Is a request for architectural review and a modification to a use permit for in motion fitness.  It is for the site design and architecture for solar structures at an existing building at 1293 east first avenue.  And it is to modify a previously approved conditional use permit to authorize additional offsite parking.  The project site.  As you can see here.  In the aerial photograph.  And also the gis zoning map.  Is land use designation.  Neighborhood commercial.  And zoning of cn.  You can also see that it is surrounded by residential properties.  It has been in use since about 1992.  I believe.  As noted in the written staff report.  Here is a site plan.  You can see in the shaded gray areas.  That is the designated areas of expansion.  The white here is the existing building.  And the white here is the parking lot areas that are existing.  The first phase is the west side expansion.  The second phase is the portico share addition.  And then the corner pavilion is the third phase.  So.  And then the second phase is the portico share addition.  And then the third phase is the portico share addition.  This is the proposed landscape plan.  There will be some moving of some of the existing landscaping that is already in place.  There are quite a few trees that are proposed to be planted.  Especially palm trees.  That are already throughout the site.  But also at the access points further down the road.  And then the other side as well.  I'm going to go through the elevations first.  For the project.  So first we will start with the portico share.  For the existing building.  Now the primary reason for the architectural elevations.  Is for the solar portion of the project.  This is a solar net zero project.  That will ensure that the facility is net zero.  That it will be able to not have any electrical demand on the system.  That it will be able to be self sufficient.  A really high cost.  And it will be able to be used for a lot of other purposes.  This is a really forward thinking project.  That is in terms of our climate action goals.  For the city.  In terms of our general plan goals for climate action.  It is very forward thinking.  And definitely in line with those land use policies.  And this.  The integration of the.  You don't see the actual.  The actual.  Solar panels.  In the.  Architecture here.  But that is what the architectural elements are screening.  This is the west side expansion.  Elevations.  It is a Mediterranean motif.  This is the corner pavilion.  Again.  It is carried.  The motif is carried through.  Out.  All of the different elevations.  It is also another view of the pavilion.  I am going to transition more to the use permit portion.  Or the modification to the use permit.  Because the parking is also the modification to the use permit.  And the need for the parking that is having to be modified.  Because of the different expansion needs of the pavilion.  the project. So this particular site plan, you'll see it shows an overflow area points to the  original overflow parking area one, which on the next slide, the overflow parking area one off of  village lane. This is where the 78 parking spaces are required. And I want to also segue to thanking  both commissioner sharp and commissioners wolf for reaching out to staff with questions beforehand  about various aspects of questions regarding the report. And there's a condition that needs to be  amended that you'll see.  Commissioner Sharp.  In the summary at the end of this presentation, condition number three has been amended. It was old language for the  number of parking spaces. 78 spaces need to be allocated at this particular location. So thank you, commissioner  sharp for pointing that out. That needed to be changed.  In addition to the !  This particular lot, this particular slide also shows the safe pathway between the facility and the overflow parking lot. And it shows, in addition to that, it's primarily for ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !  So I want to note  note that the overflow parking lots are for employees.  In summary, the project is consistent with our general plan.  In summary, the project is consistent with our general plan.  As conditioned, it conforms to our municipal code.  Specifically, although it's not called out in the written report, there are specific  solar design, solar development standards in the municipal code.  I'm remiss in that that wasn't in our written report, but that this project definitely meets  all of those standards.  Especially by the municipal code.  Especially by the municipal code.  And I think that's why the architecture really integrates the solar into it specifically.  So it's integrated really well.  And again, condition number three has been revised for 78 parking spaces.  And again, staff recommends approval.  And again, staff recommends approval.  Staff recommendation to the planning commission to consider the project staff report, direct  any questions to staff, provide comments, hold a public hearing, and adopt the planning  commission resolution 2507, including the findings and subject to the recommended conditions.  That concludes my report.  If you have any questions?  Thank you, Tina.  Do we have any questions to my right?  I had one question.  thank you.  both of the overflow parking  lots for employees primarily?  that is my understanding but  available for others if needed.  okay.  any other questions to my  right? to my left?  okay thank you tina.  so we will open the public  hearing.  we will begin with the  applicant.  so the applicant will be  granted ten minutes and then  we will have public speakers  after that.  so if you wish to speak on this  item please get your card in.  and then those speakers will  have three minutes after all of  the speakers from the public  speak we will have a chance for  the applicant to come back up  and speak.  hear any comments that were made  by the public any questions that  the commission has and then we  will close the public hearing.  so how many speakers do we have  nicole?  one.  matt just wanted to speak.  we have others in case we have  other questions.  first caller is matt galloway.  welcome mr.  galloway.  how are you?  it's good to see everybody.  it's exciting to be back.  this is an amazing project.  it started with carl and i  back 1999.  we started doing a little bit of  work on this facility.  and just an amazing team to work  with.  you know it's more than just in  motion to vote.  we have a lot of people here  from in motion fitness and their  team back here.  the contractors here.  solar is another local  representative who is doing a  lot of the work for this.  golden valley bank is doing the  lending on this.  it's just an amazing community  effort to go through and be a  part of this.  really excited to be part of the  net zero project for in motion  fitness.  take everybody back down memory  lane a little bit here and remind  everybody about what this was in  1992.  you see at the upper left hand  corner that's what carl bought  back in the day.  he was on a tight shoestring  budget and the next image to the  right is the first transition  where he opened his doors.  before i even came along there  was a lot of work with that same  main entry into the building.  i was lower to him and represent  work that he did.  i don't even know i was just a kid  at the point.  i don't think i was licensed at  the time.  god bless him he gave me great  vision to get in there and start  working out.  this facility is the number one  health preventative facility  preventative health maintenance  workout facility north sacramento.  very important to our community.  when people come into town and say  hey i want to take a look at what's  going on it's amazing how many people  want to go take a look at in motion  fitness and it's become a resort.  and so we are trying to maintain that  image excitedly.  we've been working on this project  honestly for since almost two years now.  as we kind of focus in on the site  that we're looking at this is the  confines of the property and the area  at which we have to maintain all the  solar.  we're shooting dang near close to a  megawatt.  almost 2,000 panels are going to go  here and they won't all fit on the  existing roof.  the white area at present is his  existing roof.  handles about 60% maybe of the solar  that he needed to get to net zero.  here was the first pass that was  provided to us from aes.  i looked at the date on this earlier  today.  march of 2023.  so over two years ago.  and i don't know about you but my  first concern when i saw the gray  squares, eight of them, inside that  red kind of polygon on the lower left  hand side.  i know what those look like when i  drive around town.  you know we have tons of different  examples about how those different  structures can work.  and this is a brand new one actually  that just went through on esplanade  between the bank and the city of  los angeles.  they can be in comrade.  they can be dark.  they can be very stark.  here's another one.  even when painted and lightened up a  little bit they're all very  distinctive.  i asked carl is that really what you  want to see in front of your club?  and i think universally we agreed no  and you can see the dust stars in the  back of that picture which helped us out.  so when we started working through an  alternative idea and i'm going to take  and rotate this image.  all of our future images have the  project rotated slightly so we'll call  project north the top side of the  screen for everybody.  we came back with a proposal like  like tina had shared where we're  talking about three new structures that  are integrated onto the build or two of  them are integrated on the building and  then a third because even with those  structures integrated into the building  we couldn't quite get the full solar  amount that we needed.  so the portico share i'll go back here  the first one is out the front this has  been a wish of carl's for a long time to  have the ability to bring people in and  out of the facility without getting wet  parents are dropping their kids off  kids are dropping their parents off in  some cases elderly people and so we're  trying to get a nice method friendly out  of the elements to get them in the front  door.  so we're trying to get a nice method  friendly out of the building and under  this in addition so basically it's a  replacement and reuse of the existing  parking for the drive-by line underneath  it.  then on the west side we wanted to take  advantage of trying to keep things close  to the building and have the opportunity  to do a little bit of upgrade and some  of those aesthetics that we looked at  but during covid the team at in motion  found that there were a lot of people  who really enjoyed working out outside  there's some tents around the pool on the  ground that are vastly popular and  everybody loves to use them so as we  started laying this space out we said  hey we have a great opportunity here to  extend the existing running track that's  across the bottom and let it turn back  up into the structure and have  additional outdoor areas for people to  work out that came a little bit of  sacrifices and parking i think we lost  about 13 parking stalls to do that we  also had to add some use so additional  parking needs because of that additional  work out that we had to do and we  moved lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot  lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot  lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot  lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot  lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot  lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot  lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot  lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot  lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot  that I'll talk about here in a second.  The last option then for our,  for our, what we're calling the corner structure,  was we wanted to bring some of the architecture  from the facility out to the road.  This becomes a gateway to the project.  We tried to keep it open and light  so as people are coming through,  they still see the facility,  but they also see some of the architecture  associated with this facility brought out to the road.  And ultimately, it's much better to see  this Mediterranean architecture out there  than some of those other steel structures  that we see on the roadway and other places.  So working on the use permit side of this,  we're basically coming in to request  one additional parking stall  that wasn't included in the original use permit.  We see the overflow parking on this drawing  on the left-hand side.  It accommodates 75 parking spaces.  That's been in place and been used  for the last 10 years, since the last permit.  And honestly, we don't ever see it filled  much more than, like,  20 parking spaces.  We'd love to see more people go over there and use it,  but at this point, it is what it is,  and we're planning on using it a little bit more, hopefully.  Especially during construction.  I think we all recognize that some of the parking lots  are going to be closed as we're building.  And then as we get out of construction  and reopen those parking places,  we should be getting...  These are the three areas  of the additional solar  that we're putting on.  And as we work through  to get those parking spaces,  we're going to show solar structures out there.  Like I said, we massaged some places,  lost a parking stall here or there.  As a result of fire department requests,  we're providing additional access  for the fire marshal's request.  Site has been in place since the 50s,  but there were some areas that weren't current  to code compliance,  so we added some additional turning lanes  that resulted in a loss of a parking stall here or there.  And there was a fair amount of non-compliant parking stalls,  especially in that corner.  So we made them compliant,  resulted in a couple losses  of some parking places here and there.  But ultimately, when the calc's all done,  we really just need to pick up one parking stall  on the lot across the street.  Carl purchased that piece about five years ago.  Historically, that piece had served as parking  for the nurse school that was right across the way  behind the gas station there.  When they moved out,  Carl kind of jumped on it and purchased that piece,  and it is now mandated for his employees  to use that parking space.  So we have a lot of parking spaces here,  that are not the same as the ones we want to park.  So as we kind of transition into the architectural part,  so those structures that we're talking about fit here.  Three green, color's the same,  so you should kind of see them.  And we'll take the green off here a little bit  so you can see them a little bit better.  Again, trying to reiterate and reuse architectural language  that exists on site and enhance that,  have additional detail, reuse the color.  All of these are really consistent with the Title 19  point six O requirement for solar structures.  It says that we need to try and keep the solar panels  as invisible as possible.  We haven't seen that done so well on other properties,  so I feel really proud about how we handle that.  That that screening should be color coordinated  with the rest of the facility.  I think this is exemplary of that.  Same angle.  So these structures all hide the angle.  So if we were to go back and look at some of those original structures,  we see that angle,  but we'll go and sneak a little closer peek at our architecture.  It hides that angle.  All of our infrastructure is going to be hidden  because it's up inside of the building.  And ideally, the solar panels would be matte finish.  This is according to Title 19 again.  In this case, our solar panels shouldn't be visible from the road.  Here is a rendering of that front portico share.  Again, just reusing it.  We've enhanced the elements that we've used  from the Mediterranean style throughout the club.  We've enhanced this with some additional kind of flanking elements of the tower.  Just a beacon to try and bring people into the club  and have a good understanding where the primary entrance is.  We've also enhanced the main public way or pedestrian way  in this approach to get out to the road.  So we've got some enhanced breaks in the parking lot to get people out to the road.  On the corner structure,  this could be an excellent opportunity for us to have in motion  fitness presence on the road as you are eastbound on East First Avenue.  And it's been something that we've been after for a long period of time.  And here with the solar project,  we've had the opportunity to come through and do that.  We are maintaining our sightline distances,  so we don't come straight out to the corner.  There's actually carved back.  We've removed the tower from the actual corner,  moved it in just a little bit more so it still has presence,  but it isn't super overpowering on the corner in our opinion.  And also there's no walls associated with this.  We just have white columns.  So we brought that column element out and tried to maintain a window,  a gateway from the corner back to the facility.  The west portion, we kind of break into two parts.  It's got,  the northern end of that,  that's going to serve as a main entrance into the kids in motion section,  which is the daycare.  So we were playful with some of our colors there to try and attract the kids  and their parents to have a great place to come up and have some frivolity with that architecture.  The west side, the rest of that,  just taking that left element,  it was too linear.  We needed to do something to break it up.  So we have some arches for a portion,  then we have a,  really neat element that kind of serves as an egress out of that side with a series of balconies.  And then to the,  to the right of that,  there's some canopies again,  just trying to break up that monotonous elevation.  And then the last part of that section on the far right is actually just a fence.  It's a very glorified fence.  We have issues with,  with weights that have a tendency maybe to kind of walk off the site,  now that we're working outside.  So we need to be cognizant about having a solid barrier for those things.  So we propose that there is a condition in the report that says that that section of the property needs to be compliant with Title 19.  And at present,  it's a fence,  but it exceeds the requirements for fence.  And so I'd love to have some interaction and discussion about that and whether the commission feels that that's worthy of exceeding the fence amount,  or whether we need to go,  with a different option that's fully compliant.  Back to kind of an overall view,  I think here.  So again,  on the far right hand corner is that same,  that same fence area.  So we're extremely proud of what we've,  what we've got before you.  We're happy with the ability to get to net zero,  and it's been a long time coming for everybody.  I think we're just anxious to get going.  I'd be happy to answer any questions if you have.  Thank you.  Any questions for Mr. Galloway?  Commissioner wolf.  Yes, thank you.  Thanks, Matt and thanks,  Carl for bringing forward such a great project.  I mean,  this is,  it's really great to see stuff like this,  trying to advance the solar stuff.  You could have done a completely different way,  but you chose not to do it on the cheap.  You really took the high road here.  So this is,  this is good stuff.  I had just a couple of comments and one possible concern about here.  I just want to make sure we know what we're looking at and,  and what we're going to see in the future here on the corner.  We've got a structure that's about 35 feet high.  That's typical,  maybe like a three story structure.  Some,  it's up there a ways.  So this is going to be a big change for this,  this part of,  of this neighborhood.  And there are some design guidelines from our design guidelines manual to speak to this.  One of them calls for us to utilize the massing scale and form of new buildings as transitional elements between new and existing development to maintain a pedestrian level scale throughout the city.  So,  the pedestrian level scales,  like,  are,  are we maintaining that here?  I think is maybe one concern.  And then there's,  there's a,  another guideline that says we're to create a scale and character development that does not overwhelm the surrounding neighborhood.  And Matt,  you and I talked about this a little bit and I,  maybe if you could just talk,  walk through kind of how this structure,  it's going to be a big change there.  How does that really fit in with these,  these guidelines in your mind?  So,  again,  the pedestrian scale component of it,  you can see we have a,  we have a little white pedestrian walking in front of that area.  So,  pedestrian scale can be managed by demising of the,  of the structure.  We obviously have an elevation that we have to maintain for clearance in order for cars to drive under this.  And that kind of establishes that horizontal element.  And so if we were to imagine that horizontal element kind of in,  in the,  in the way it's presented here without the tower,  it's missing something.  It needs to have another element at that corner in order to become a beacon.  So it's actually then another pedestrian,  a pedestrian scale element on the top,  a traditional balcony where people would walk out.  In this case,  nobody's going to be walking out of it,  but you still have a sense of scale and pedestrian orientation to that at the second level.  So just to,  in other words,  it looks like a place where people would,  would go or be.  So it's oriented to a pedestrian level.  Got it.  Okay.  Additionally,  like I mentioned earlier,  to minimize some of that input impact to the street,  we did have passes on the street.  We had a couple of passes early on year and a half ago where this was right on the corner and it,  it just didn't make sense.  It was too overpowering.  And with the exemptions for code for the cupolas,  we looked at a little bit higher.  It wasn't working well for us.  So we pulled those back,  had these,  had these column structures that are out on the road,  maintain our sightline visibility and,  and attempted to really address this mass and concern and have it back.  Again,  there are elements here that are unavoidable with regards to the horizontal nature of it.  And I think that in hindsight,  looking at this versus the old solar components,  this was the way I'm really happy that Carl.  Definitely agree.  Yeah.  Thanks.  Any other questions?  Yeah.  Sure.  Well,  you had a community meeting some time ago.  Yeah.  About how many people attended that?  There were three or four people from the public.  And they were neighbors.  Yes.  Yeah.  And what was the one question was,  where were the panels made?  There was a concern.  Actually,  that's neighbor who sits on the sustainability committee.  And these panels are actually assembled in America.  I didn't have the answer to that at the time,  but they're assembled in America.  That was one of the questions.  One of the other questions was,  Hey,  one of the it companies has got a project going on on the backside.  Does this have anything to do with that?  We are,  we didn't have anything to do with that.  So she was,  she was happy.  And I know,  you know,  general,  the biggest concern historically with the sites been parking.  And when we first met with city management and,  and the directors,  we said,  Hey,  we're really proud.  We haven't had any complaints in the last.  I say,  we like I'm part of a team here.  So we haven't had any complaints in five years.  And the deputy director said,  you know what?  I got one today.  And it was,  this is five months ago.  Right?  So we said,  let's address that.  Let's reach out and talk to him.  It turns out it was an employee who wasn't parking where he's supposed to be.  So the way that they've addressed that in their interest to be the best neighbor,  they have an employee parking manual that they have in there aggressively enforcing that people park and parking lot or employees park and parking lot too.  It's actually closer than where this other person was parking anyway.  So we had to maybe put a little numbers there.  Hey,  you could save 50 steps if you,  if you park where we want you to.  Okay.  So essentially the neighbors are happy with it.  Far so good.  Carl likes to say,  you say you're your cheapest best neighbor.  So I think he's trying to live up to that,  to that title.  Thank you.  All right.  I was just wondering about the bicycle parking.  Do you have plenty of bicycle parking?  Yes,  plenty.  It's covered.  It's on the way in.  It's identified in one of the exhibits that you have with a little bit of a  bicycle symbol.  So as you come into the west side,  we have plenty of opportunity to provide the standard two foot by six foot bike parking location.  So there's a fair amount required.  We're not sure that they're all going to be used,  but we strongly encourage them,  encourage the use of them.  And honestly,  when I use the club,  I ride my bike from my house.  I was a little confused about the fence.  Can you talk about that?  Is that what you were going to ask too?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Situation.  And that was a interesting thing.  So I'm going to,  I'm going to come back to an image where we kind of see it.  So in this back portion back through here,  we need to maintain the ability for vehicles to access the backside from the service standpoint.  For a long period of time,  the fire department was using that as,  as emergency access,  but they've abandoned that because we fully fire suppressed the building.  So for 50 years,  it wasn't fire suppressed.  I'm sorry,  could I interrupt it?  Just could you show us on the site plan where this is?  I think I might give us a better sense of how this,  how the functionality kind of plays into this.  Yeah.  Skip back here a little bit.  Okay.  And so it's this small little green section right back at the backside here that offers closure from the long perimeter at the neighbors and our,  and our park course running track in the back.  We need to help.  We have the ability to close this off,  right?  We,  it's actually one of the areas that's most concerning in terms of kids trying to jump over the fence and get in and get access to the club.  We can actually see where there's a wrought iron fence.  Now that's actually been pulled over.  Curtis has commented on this several times.  Yeah,  look right here.  They're,  they're,  they're coming in the backside.  So we had a concern.  We need to get something solid there.  We still need to provide access to it for security.  So the concept that we came forward with was to,  to,  to come through and provide something that was much more architecturally pleasing.  You can see there was actually even a little section of roof on it.  I'm going to,  I'm going to keep going here and see if I can find a little bit better picture of it.  But,  but it's,  it's a concern.  It does not meet the standard requirements for an eight foot fence.  And that's what the last comment in there.  So it's,  it's at 20 feet.  If the commission feels that we should go back and look at that in a different way,  we would be happy to.  We have a couple other alternatives.  If you'd like to look at some,  the biggest thing from our standpoint where that is that that back to park course along the backside offers opportunity for other people to get in,  maybe even access the neighbors on the other way.  So this is a great way to provide security for the neighbors,  for,  for elderly people and kids that are using the club.  That last portion,  having a good secure element was a key component.  And I think that's a key component of our,  of our design and important to us.  Any other questions?  No.  That answered my question as well.  Thank you.  Um,  not directly relevant to this,  um,  but that stoplight,  maybe Nat can answer that.  That stoplight at Longfellow and East First Avenue is the bane of my existence.  Um,  is that,  do you see any impacts,  um,  on traffic,  Matt,  uh,  with these additions?  And is there anything that we're doing as we've upgraded and re-upgraded and worked on timing there to make that a more pleasant experience?  So it's interesting that you say that's been a discussion point.  We actually talked a little bit with Eric on that.  There's been rumors for a long time that there was work that's going to occur on this,  this roadway.  In fact,  Cal Water just underwent a product project where they put,  uh,  installed new water all the way down from Bryan Avenue all the way to Manzanita.  And they do that in advance of other roadway projects.  But Eric did advance that.  The project that was slated for that's been put on hold indefinitely,  which at least means it's not funded in this coming fiscal year.  That's one thing that we'd like to talk with him a little bit because we recognize as well on this picture here for everybody that a lot of people get a full head of steam and the lights red and then make that work.  lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot  any public comment?  I' m going to close the public  hearing and bring it back to the  commission for discussion.  I think you have a great  project here and I applaud the  owners for continuing to grow  this thing.  It' s been amazing to watch and  I' ve loved it even though I  live on the other side of town.  It' s beautiful.  With that I would like to make a  motion that the planning  commission adopt resolution 25-07  determining that the project is  categorically exempt from  environmental review and  approving architectural review  25-02 and modification 25-01 to  use permit 11-20 in motion and  on the commission fitness subject  to the recommended conditions  contained therein.  we have a motion do we have a  second?  second.  we have a motion by  commissioner wall and a second by  vice chair scarpa that the  planning commission adopt res  clarification please madam chair  did that motion include the fix  on the number of condition number  the commission to adjust the  number of off street spaces from  46 to 78?  I wanted to confirm that  included that clerical fix.  I think it'  s subject to recommended  conditions.  the conditions we gave you in  your staff report had an old  number and today we'  d like to replace that with the  current number for the new  expansion of 78. 46 gets  replaced with 78 on condition  number 3.  Good with me.  So we have a  motion and a second that the planning  commission adopt resolution  25-07  determining that the project is categorically  exempt from environmental review  and approving architectural review  25-02 and  modification 25-01  to use permit  11-20 in motion  fitness subject to the recommended  conditions contained therein  with condition 3  updated from 46  spots to 78  spots. So is there  any discussion before we move forward?  Yes, just before we vote. Staff  could you just kind of  advise us as to where  this leaves the issue of the  back piece, the  fence that we were talking about. I think there'  s a condition as it stands  that be modified to comply  and I don' t know if we' re setting  up a  solution here or not.  There could be absolutely a change to that  condition. You heard from the architect  about how they like what they proposed.  The condition simply just says to  bring it down to 8 feet to meet the rear  setback. It' s a good point. There'  s a side on condition there where it'  s not like a building face on somebody'  s backyard. So it' s a unique situation  and it' s up to the commission  to look at that condition as well.  Okay. So I' m looking at the conditions.  I just want to make sure that we know  which one we' re talking about.  I can' t find it again right now  unless they use  permit.  It' s condition number one under  the architectural review. It' s the only condition on the  architectural review.  I' m sorry we' re taking so long here.  I just want to make sure that everybody  don' t have to come back and deal with  this again if it is adopted for this motion  which is kind of resolved. Is that right?  It would be, yes.  Okay.  Mike, if we took out that condition,  then the design that' s presented in  front of us would be what is approved?  Yes. We would just approve that.  Okay.  I' m going to ask the  second motion.  Would the maker of the motion and the  second consider removing condition one  under the architectural review conditions?  I' ll accept that.  Yeah. That' s fine.  Okay.  So, Nicole, I' m not going to reread all of that,  but we will have a motion that approves,  adopts resolution 25-07.  We have updated condition three,  and we will remove condition one  under the architectural review conditions.  Got it.  Got it.  And does the commission understand what the motion is?  Okay.  All right.  Roll call vote, please. Roll call vote, please. Commissioner Wolff? Aye. Commissioner Wall? Yes. Commissioner Sharp? Aye. Commissioner Laffens? Yes. Commissioner Becker-Kaufman? Aye.  Vice Chair Scarpa? Aye.  Chair Scott? Aye.  So that motion passes seven.  Thank you.  We will move on to  item 4.2.  And as  associate planner Madison Driscoll  is coming up on that,  any ex parte communication,  and I' ll start on my right.  I just rode my bicycle around the property.  Okay.  But other than that, no.  Yeah.  I' ll take a second.  I' ve had none.  Okay.  All right.  Good evening, commissioners.  I' m associate planner Madison Driscoll,  and I' ll be presenting the staff report  on this item.  First off, I would just like to  apologize.  These two applications  probably should have been presented  as two separate reports.  There' s been some confusion on the  environmental review aspect  and findings of this.  Both items have separate findings  and resolutions. We processed them  together for efficiency's sake,  but realized, like we said, there is some  confusion.  To make this a little less confusing,  we will present the items separately.  First, the parcel map, and then  the architectural review and site design  to clarify there are two  independent applications  with separate scopes and  secret determinations.  They do not rely on each other  for implementation.  I encourage the commission to acknowledge  and deliberate on the  applications separately.  Moving forward,  we' ll be looking at the site,  which is on the eastern side of  Forest Avenue between the Walmart  and Target  shopping centers.  The parcel  is zoned  Regional Commercial and is designated  Regional Commercial on the City of  Chico General Plan Land Use Diagram.  The parcel map proposes to divide  the 6.5 acre site into  three parcels.  The project application would have  three entrances,  one along Forest Avenue  and two along Bainey Lane.  The Forest Avenue  entrance  would  feed into a shared driveway  that would serve all three parcels.  The existing driveway  next to the Sinclair gas station  would remain for now.  The driveway has an access easement  for the Sinclair gas station.  The new driveway  that's proposed  further east of there  on Bainey Lane is required due to  the future Walmart expansion.  It will align the two  driveways with the expansion  together for easier access.  The recordation  of the parcel map  will result in  construction of curb,  gutter, and sidewalk along  both Bainey Lane and Forest Avenue.  For the parcel map,  staff recommends that the Commission  adopt the resolution  number 2505  including the required findings  and determine the project  is categorically exempt  from further environmental review  pursuant to the  Sinclair gas station.  and the section 15315  minor land division.  I would also like to thank  Commissioner Beichert-Kaufman  for pointing out an error in  Exhibit 1 of the resolution 2505.  Condition number 1 states  that it would result in  the creation of four lots.  That is an error.  It should say there is a creation  of three lots.  I have revised the version.  If anyone would like to see  the changes, it's just a  quick little strikeout.  I have some copies to pass around  if you would like.  We're going to switch gears  and move on to the  architectural review.  As you can see,  it is still zoned  regional commercial.  As we see it highlighted out in  red and yellow, that is where  the proposed car wash is.  The site would have access  from both Baney Lane  and Forest Avenue.  This would be a self-service use  where patrons would drive up  into the car wash and then  proceed to finish the vacuuming  and cleaning of their own vehicles  with the vacuums provided.  The site would provide four standard parking spaces  and 17 equipped with vacuums.  There are additionally two proposed  parking spaces.  The proposed building would have  a footprint of 5,484 square feet.  The design is modern  and incorporates a variety of materials.  The two primary colors  would be gray with red accents.  The key features would include  a curved roof line  and two accent towers.  The landscape plan includes  a variety of new trees  and shrubs concentrated mainly  along Forest Avenue  and the drive aisles.  New trees would include  strawberry trees,  crepe myrtle, maples, Japanese alcovas,  and blue oaks.  The project meets the minimum shade requirement  through utilizing tree canopies  and vacuum canopies.  I would like to also acknowledge a question  that Commissioner Wolf had  regarding the previously approved  Chick-fil-A project.  The landscaping palette  is different.  I would like to clarify that.  There are different trees utilized.  The project does propose  one wall sign facing  Forest Avenue.  This meets the code requirement  for the sign code  of the  commercial regional district.  The project also offers  internal signage for navigation  and menus for the car wash.  Planning staff recommends  that the Planning Commission  adopt Resolution 2506  including the required findings  and determine the project category  for the project.  historically exempt from further  environmental review pursuant to  CEQA section 15332  approving Architecture Review 2404  subject to the conditions therein.  That concludes my report.  I am here for any questions.  Any questions to my right?  Yeah, I have several questions.  One was that existing driveway.  So that is not going to be  connected to the  site.  Is that correct?  The existing driveway behind  Sinclair station?  I do believe that there  will not be a connection there.  I wanted to  actually I do believe there is  a connection there.  It does have that double connection  unfortunately for now.  The reason why it remains is  because the easement itself is at  benefit for Sinclair gas station.  With the Walmart build out, the driveway  will be closed in the future.  Because of the vehicle stacking  itself around the corner  for the turn. So it would be a little bit  too much of a conflict point.  So that is why we proposed this new  driveway.  But yes.  Okay, I want to make sure I understand this.  So for now, there will be  two driveways toward the south.  Correct.  With the intention that  the one further  east would eventually be abandoned?  The one further west.  The Sinclair one.  The one highlighted in this white here.  Yeah, that is east.  I want to clarify.  We essentially had meetings with the applicants and  required them to put a driveway that hits  Bain opposite the future driveway for Walmart.  The existing driveway for the Sinclair people  to leave their car wash is too close to the  intersection on Forest.  When the Walmart project goes in, there is  going to be a bunch of cars stacked up there.  You are not going to be able to get out. You are going to be forced to only take a right hand drive.  You are going to be forced to only take a left hand drive.  So we are trying to avoid  exacerbating that condition  by requiring them to put in a new  connection. And we do anticipate that  someday we might have to close that other connection  because it will become unusable.  And we are going to have to talk to Sinclair about that.  The other question I have  is whenever I  describe to anybody  what we were going to talk about at this meeting,  the reaction was always  why do we need another  car wash?  There is one half a mile down the street  and there is one in the Sinclair station.  So  what I keep wondering is  will this actually  cause an increase  in the amount of tax revenue  that the city gets  or is it just going to  move it around?  And so there would be  less tax revenue  for the city  from say the  surf through  and some from this one.  But it is not going to  fiscally help the city to have  this additional car wash.  I was just wondering if there was any response to that.  We are here tonight to just  review both the parcel map and the  architectural review of the site.  We are not discussing the use.  The use isn't allowed use  outright in the regional  commercial zoning district.  So unfortunately that will not be  up for discussion itself  on if this is an allowed use or not.  This isn't allowed use  by our Title 19 zoning code.  I had one more  question that was about  so you said they would  install a sidewalk  on Forest  and on  Forest is already improved.  I thought there already was a sidewalk there.  It is just going to be a new driveway.  Bainey Lane is unimproved.  It has a curb line but they will be required to do sidewalk along Bainey.  Okay but that is along  what would be the third parcel  but it is  okay so is it part of the third parcel approval?  It was the lot split approval?  It is a condition of this lot split.  Of the lot split.  Okay so not of the car wash.  Yes.  So what I was wondering  is if we could  ask that  sidewalk instead of being  right up against the curb that there be a little bit  of a landscape  strip between the sidewalk and the curb.  We allow  continuous sidewalk  in areas that are already continuous.  It is in our design criteria.  You are correct in the sense  that in new development we took  the sidewalk and we typically will do  separated sidewalk but when there is  existing continuous sidewalk we allow  for that to be installed.  It would be up to the commission I think  to require the  developer to  install  separated sidewalk.  So right now there is sidewalk  along Bainey Lane  between Forest Avenue  and the existing driveway?  Yes by Walmart in and out  along business and is a business  Mike or Bainey.  Bainey and business there is a little continuous sidewalk.  The new Oxford Hotel is installing  continuous.  It is essentially all continuous  along.  So one way to look at it is there is an approved street there.  It is a private street. It is approved street  and we are continuing the improvements across  this last parcel in the  line. Filling the gap.  Okay.  Any other questions to my right?  Um  Madison I did have one question  and I might have just missed it.  I know we mentioned  how many parking spaces there were  but I was wondering in that  queue line  to get into the car wash  is there an understanding  of how many cars can be  in that line?  I don't have  the number with me. I am sure  the applicant could also speak on that but it is  almost a triple barrel that goes  down to one there. So I do believe that there would be  plenty of stacking that wouldn't spill out  onto  Forest Avenue there. It is quite a  sufficient stacking but again  I would maybe ask the applicant  of that. Unfortunately I don't have that number  with me. Great.  Questions to my left?  Yeah. I would say  I am kind of worried that  we are ring up against  piece milling in CEQA.  We have three projects here that we  know what they are. We talked  about one last month. We talked about this one  today and pretty soon we will have  one I think.  We have a lot that is over  five acres that we are dividing up.  I don't think  there would be a major  concern with any of these projects but I do think  we are opening a door to not  to  adding more risk  to the city by taking these projects  on in the manner we are.  By breaking them into three parcels and then  treating them as individual projects.  I just want to make that clear.  I wanted to echo that as well.  I believe there should have been  cumulative with these three uses.  There is cumulative impact  car washes as well as the fast food service  we just approved or intensive uses  on roads and traffic.  So I definitely echo that  sentiment.  I will remind the commission  that traffic is probably the only thing  we would expect to see from any  sort of impacts on this project.  But there are some  other things that we can do.  One is we can't deal with  traffic operational impacts or parking  impacts under  sequoia anymore.  That would be unavailable to us if we were to go down that route.  A traffic study would have been nice.  We actually did a traffic study  just to satisfy our folks down in public works.  It satisfied their concerns.  I will just wait until  we get the public hearing and  we hear from the applicants.  Maybe some finer points on some other stuff that has come up.  Thank you Madison.  We will open the public hearing  begin with the applicant.  Do we have any speakers from the public?  No.  Besides the applicant?  Okay.  We have ten minutes for the applicant.  That would be Adam Decker.  Welcome.  Thank you. Welcome.  Good evening commissioners.  I'm Adam Decker.  I'm an attorney and small business owner.  I partnered with my dad and brother  on a couple of real estate development projects  and recently on a few small businesses.  We chose to  partner with  Tommy's in part because of its history.  Tommy's is one of the  most state of the art  car wash brands  out there in the country.  It's been around since the 1960s.  They really are sort of cutting edge  in terms of technology.  They have over 200 locations  in the United States right now.  We partnered with them in part  because they are just new to the franchise model.  My brother and I will be the franchisees  operating this Tommy's Express here.  I think another question  you raised it  Commissioner by Kirk Kaufman  was why do we need another car wash here?  It's a fair question.  I think the first issue  was the car wash right next door  which is on the St. Clair.  It's sort of like comparing apples to oranges.  That is a mechanical  car wash that you pay  and you go in and you park.  It's called a rollover and the car wash  rolls over the car.  Those can't process  very many cars per hour at all.  They use a lot more water  and they are far less efficient  than the standard express car wash.  Second, you did mention  the surf through.  It's about a mile away up the road.  I think to that I would just say customers need  patience.  They need different options when they are  deciding what to do.  Tommy's is much more efficient  because it can process over 200 cars an hour.  Which speaks to some of the  stacking and congestion issues  that were raised earlier.  It will cut down on traffic  and make the service more attractive  thus increasing the city's tax revenue dollars.  I think the last question I wanted to address  was why Chico? Why this site?  As you know this is a beautiful site  with an amazing trade area.  When my brother and I started looking  into the market we were scratching our heads  as to why this was still undeveloped  because this is in such a prime part of town.  When we heard the history of the  parcel, it's one parcel  so it's difficult for a buyer  to take it down all in one piece.  Given our background  in real estate development and now as  franchisees we thought we  were ambitious enough and maybe stupid enough  to see that we could do it ourselves.  We've been  under contract on this parcel since  December of 23 and shortly  after opening escrow we started  to market to other users ensuring  Chick-fil-A expressed interest in  buying the site  more or less at around the same time with us.  So it's a great  opportunity because now you have  two users simultaneously interested  in working towards developing this parcel.  We want to bring  the Tommies experience to Chico.  This is an amazing brand  it will be amazing for your city.  We think it will add a lot of value to this  part of town.  That concludes my thoughts.  Any questions I can answer  or that my colleague  Jennifer can answer?  To my right, any questions?  I had a question  about what happens  with the water.  Do you have a water recirculation  system? There's a pretty  involved reclamation process.  So Tommies Express,  one of the things that's known for it is  that we're using its water.  So for each car,  I'm trying to get the numbers right here,  but each car uses about 42 gallons  of water. Only about  28 of those are actually city water.  The remaining water is reclaimed.  So it reclaims and recycles a lot  of the water that it uses.  It goes to the tires, sort of the undercarriage  of the car. That way you get a great  experience with minimizing your water impact.  So it probably  uses less water than somebody  would washing their car in their driveway.  Absolutely. I mean there are  studies that I can share that show that.  I don't want to name competitors, but also  with the technology that we have,  you do use less water.  Could you speak to just  kind of your understanding  with the research of Tommies and  car washes, is this use  typically generating  additional trips, or  are you kind of gaining  customers who are already in the area?  So let me rephrase the question.  Am I sucking customers  that are already sort of coming and going,  or am I bringing new customers  into the area? Okay, that's a great question.  I think it's both.  I think, you know, when we were  made franchisees in the business,  they have a pretty selective process.  One of the big things they had,  one of the big suggestions they made was  to find sites that are already in people's  sort of daily commute.  So you sort of prioritize locations  that are in front of grocery stores,  gas stations,  places where they're already going.  But as the express car wash model  is more and more adopted, we are seeing  that it is driving more people to these locations  because it is indeed so convenient.  Take for example  the rollover car wash next door.  If you've got three or four cars  in front of you, you're going to be there  for 20, 30 minutes.  At Tommies Express, you can be in and out of that  in about three minutes.  Of course, if you want to vacuum your car afterwards,  it'll take longer. But what you're seeing  is the trend of people washing their car  more frequently because it's so easy  and because it's already in people's daily  sort of commute and route.  Questions to the left?  Okay, thank you.  Yeah, thanks.  Oh, okay.  It was a little hard for me to tell from the plans.  Are you planning to have a sidewalk  along  the shared driveway with  Chick-fil-A?  Yes, so we have three...  Also, hi, commissioners. I'm Jennifer Kirby  from Kimlinghorn Civil Engineer.  I was here like six weeks ago,  also the civil engineer for Chick-fil-A,  you know, for consistency across the properties.  So we have three different ADA  paths of travel coming to  the Tommies. So there's one connection point.  The sidewalk is on the  north side of that shared driveway  along the southern  portion of the Chick-fil-A property.  So that sidewalk's actually on the Chick-fil-A.  But then it comes south  towards the Tommies.  Then we have a more direct ADA connection  straight off of Forest Ave.  That comes directly into the Tommies parcel.  And then we have a third connection  for pedestrians coming from  Bainey. We also...  We don't necessarily expect a lot of pedestrians  coming to the car wash, but you never  know with employees. And then it's also  just important for us to feel like we have pedestrian  connectivity between  the sites that we're developing.  Well, I was mainly asking because  one of the conditions for the  lot split is  to make it possible  to connect to the  Target parking lot  to the north if  the Target people are amenable  to that idea. And then that  could be a good pedestrian  access point  for  people, say, to go from Target to  Walmart if they didn't want to have to get in their car  and drive, you know, the quarter mile  or whatever it is that they could walk.  Yep. So that's a condition of  the tentative map.  Right.  We are exploring concepts  for that third parcel right now.  In those  exploring concepts, we are showing  pedestrian connectivity to  occur there as well.  I would say it's a little  out of the purview for, you know, the  architectural review, but it is a condition on the  map that we will adhere to,  you know, looking forward to  the third development.  Thank you.  Pedestrians can come from all angles,  all sides.  Any other questions?  Okay. Thank you.  All right. Thank you, Commissioners.  And I will close the  public hearing and bring  it back to the Commission for discussion.  Hearing no discussion, I'll move to the  Planning Commission to adopt Resolution  25-05,  and Resolution 25-06,  approving Parcel Map  24-02,  and Architectural Review  24-04,  Domic Car Wash, subject to the  recommended conditions contained  therein. And I want to make one  comment about the need for an  additional  car wash.  Just like any other small business,  more of the same type  of business not only generates more  revenue for the  city or the county or wherever it  is, it also helps with  competition, makes everybody do a  little better job. You get better  customer service. You get better  rates, prices are based  accordingly. As a former  franchisee of Outfit, I understand  that. And I think that's  something that we should all  understand here in this room,  even though it's not part of our  purview to decide that. That's  a challenge that we all have to  even though it's not part of our  pre-market exercise. And it should  be that way.  we have a motion. Do we have  any seconds?  okay, I'll second.  we have a motion from  commissioner wall and then a  second from commissioner  laffins. Any discussion?  follow up questions. I didn'  t jump in quickly enough. You  beat me to the punch on that  with the motion. Before we move  ahead with the decision to act  on this, I'  ve got some questions about  both the parcel map and the  design review, if I may. This  has to do with my first question  is on the parcel map and that  driveway alongside sinclair is  there right now. If I understand  not on the property that is  the  property that is  the sinclair property  have access rights to cross on  to this site from that driveway  right now? that'  s my understanding, yes.  that'  s an easement.  that'  s why this connection needs to be  retained at this time because that  easement persists. the applicant is powerless to get rid of it  right now. the city might intervene later. maybe there'  s a  road as traffic starts occurring  around here. You guys have  probably gone through this  forwards and backwards. Is there  anything we can do at this point  with this approval to head off  that problem?  is it a preventative  kind of way so we don'  t have to go back?  the concern is it might never be  such a concern that we do it.  because it'  s shutting down somebody'  s driveway is a big deal. the concern doesn'  t really exist until walmart pulls off their  project and we start seeing the car stacking up there.  because that'  s when the stacking goes from like it is now to really impressive, a lot of stacking.  we wouldn'  t want to jump on that too early.  we definitely did work this problem to try to  figure out how to consolidate driveways. we do that all the time.  it'  s a great effort and i see from public works doing it all the time.  there'  s not much we can do right now. this may be one of those situations where we  have to proceed and then respond if something comes up. i understand the conundrum there.  then on the subject of the design review, i had some comments on the landscaping.  there'  s an area kind of the appendage on the south here. it looks like it'  s hydro seated with a couple trees. is that a detention basin or is that going to be a more significant area for the landscape?  that is  it will just be hydro seated. it'  s not a detention basin. the reason why they chose to hydro seat it is to allow some more flexibility in the future itself. there was a proposal originally to put parking stalls there. that is why it was not fully landscaped. i can also allow jennifer also to speak to it as well.  maybe not right now.  a couple other things here. on the landscaping as well.  i think it'  this is kind of relates back to some comments that some commissioners had about piece mailing the project from a sequest standpoint. i share that concern. but also we'  re piece mailing it from a design standpoint. i think we might be missing out on some opportunities here that we otherwise would have had had we seen these projects together or seen the larger project. we could talk about things like the landscaping. what'  s the palette here of landscape materials?  is there a way to pull this?  make sure that the design center on its own and typically you would get a consistent design theme with materials and what not that would pull it all together. We can do it this way too but it makes it more challenging to get the right kind of materials specked out as you make the approvals.  i would like to add a condition to  the design center.  pallets be coordinated on these  projects.  especially with respect to the  treatment along the entrance way  that comes in off of forest there.  we'  ve got the same thing going on  on both sides. it'  s going to start to define the  shopping center. i'  m not just making this stuff up. it'  s actually our design guidelines.  it'  s just some basic principles. i would like larry if you would accept. what is it exactly you wish to have?  something that would be  i think we have some consistency between this project and the one immediately to the north with respect to the types of plant materials being used. we have a more cohesive landscape design approach for the shopping center. the applicant is indicating they'  re fine with that. it'  s an easy thing we can do here that people are in agreement on. i think we'  ll end up with a better project. it will look better in the long run.  if i may add to that.  lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot  the street is actually I think  they'  re all street trees  so they'  re ultimately going  to be up for the urban forest  manager to coordinate in a  coordinated way. They had  Australian willow along the  street whenever we see street  trees here though we have to  realize it'  s conceptual  because it'  s subject to urban  forest or ultimate approval.  is the redwood clash with the  coloring of the advertisements  on the building?  only when it'  s in full bloom  which isn'  t the whole time but it'  s beautiful  blooms.  I understand that.  thank you.  it could be one way to tie it  together I was lending support  for the notion.  would you accept that  amendment to your motion?  I'  ll push a little  harder on the next one that has  hydra seating with that entrance  landscape feature out on bain  e that'  s going to be the  main entrance into the shopping  center and as it stands it'  s not really designed there'  s just some hydra seating  there and I'  m wondering if maybe there'  s an opportunity to do something  more there.  is that meant to be permanent  or is that temporary?  I was wondering the same thing and it seems like it'  s unclear.  it might change.  it'  s temporary.  it'  s part of parcel 3 so it will be developed  some day.  they were originally showing us some back out parking  there backing out into that drive aisle and we did not like  that so we said don'  t show something we can'  t support.  reconciling that area will have to be figured out in the future  when parcel 3 develops but there needs to be an interim solution.  got it.  this is just a  going to be a no man'  s land as a result of the  circulation for the time being.  yes and eventually maybe a modicum of  employee parking.  never mind.  thank you.  going back to the grudgingly  acceptance of the western redbud we did have a second so would you be okay with that shift as well?  yes.  thank you.  any other questions, discussion?  I have a question about the motion.  is it only about the tommys or also about the lot split?  so we have  the motion incorporates  both of the resolutions.  okay.  so I want to be sure that we do include the staff recommendation to provide potential cross access with the target property.  and that is already a condition of approval.  yes.  it is already in there.  I just wanted to be sure it was.  but we did have a condition of approval.  and I will have to go through it and update madison.  yes we did.  it is a minor update to change the wording from four to three.  it is just a small clerical error on my part.  okay.  and are the motion maker and the second okay with that?  yes.  okay.  great.  there was also the typo.  you are right.  it is not the targets parking lot.  it is the targets parking lot.  so yes that error as well.  okay.  So if there's no other discussion, the motion that we have on the floor is to adopt Resolution 25-05 and Resolution 25-06,  approving Parcel Map 24-02 and Architectural Review 24-04,  subject to the recommended conditions contained therein, with a modification on the typo going from 4 to 3,  and updating the landscape palette to include western redbud.  Roll call, though, please.  Commissioner Wolfe?  Aye.  Commissioner Wall?  Yes.  Commissioner Sharp?  No.  Aye.  Commissioner Laffens?  Aye.  Commissioner Byker-Kaufman?  Aye.  Vice Chair Scarpa?  No.  Chair Scott?  Aye.  So that motion carries 5-2.  Thank you.  We will move on to the regular agenda.  There is none there.  Reports and communications.  Mike, do you have anything for us?  Just briefly, Madam Chair.  I want to report.  I want to report that the City Council did adopt the residential readiness phase 2 amendments  that you saw a few months back and those are now in effect.  So there will be fewer projects coming to the Planning Commission as a result of that,  more things being processed at a staff level, and we're looking forward to next year where  we again try to catch up with state law.  Okay.  That concludes my report.  Anything from the Commission?  Yeah, I have a question or a comment, and actually both.  We occasionally have a lot of questions about the planning commission, but I'm not sure  I will just say that we occasionally have an  abstention and frequently have a no vote, but we rarely have an explanation of either  one of them.  I would like to wonder what we can do to encourage people who are voting one way or the other  to explain why they happen to be voting no on a project as opposed to yes or vice versa  even on occasion.  Is there anything we can do for that?  I'm asking the staff that first, and I'll ask the chair the same thing.  Besides asking out loud and asking for it to be, I don't know that there's any requirement  for that.  If you're recusing yourself, you're supposed to say why you're recusing yourself, but I  don't know if you have to explain why you're voting no.  If the Commission votes no on something as a Commission, we need reasons, and we need  to identify those reasons for the applicants, but I don't think an individual no vote necessarily,  it's customary, but not required, I don't think.  I think, Larry, that we got a split vote here tonight, and I think that it probably had  to do more with the environmental review part of it, but I don't know.  I think that maybe part of it is that we're all kind of new, and that would be appreciated,  though.  I agree with you.  I think it just seems like common courtesy, because I don't like to surmise why an individual  is voting differently than I am.  I'd like to know why, because maybe that would affect the way I vote either that time  or the next time.  Good point.  Had more information.  Couldn't that be done in discussion?  Yeah.  Yeah, I think normally it would be.  I think we're just having kind of a freestyle discussion here right now just to encourage,  you know, Commissioners who are going to have a dissenting opinion on something, you know,  just before we make the vote, maybe say I'm going to be voting no.  And here's why.  You know, and then proceed, right?  That's how I've seen it done in the past.  It's not like that.  That's good.  It is all good.  All the discussion is really good for us, too, because then we'll have better informed  about what to bring you back next time.  Right.  So it's a continuous process of correction for us, so knowing all the reasons does help.  And it's good for the applicants to know, too.  Sometimes when I do vote no, I'm not, we're not supposed to come here knowing how we're  going to vote, and sometimes the discussion leads me to yes or no.  So, yeah.  Yeah.  If you're asking, Commissioner Wald, like my no vote was entirely because of the CEQA  concerns.  I am happy the project is going forward.  I saw no reason other than those to vote no, but that was a concern for me.  Okay.  Okay.  There are no other reports and communications.  We will adjourn to the June 5th meeting.  And we have two items on that?  Correct.  Okay.  Anytime.  Anytime.  Anytime.  Anytime.  Anytime.
