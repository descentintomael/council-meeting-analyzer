 All right, welcome everybody to the regular City Council meeting in the City of Chico, May 3rd, 2022. We'll call the meeting to order and we will start with an invocation by Pastor Brian Myers. Welcome. Mayor, Council, staff, thank you so much for your service to our city. I know we live in very challenging times, but I know that God has called you for such a time as this and it's my joy to pray over you. Father God, we thank you so much for the opportunity that we have to gather together. My prayer, Lord, is God for the staff and for the community. I thank you so much for the opportunity that we have to gather together. I thank you for the council on today as they deliberate on matters. Thank you so much for the leadership that they bring our city. God, I thank you that they are city servants and that, Lord, my prayer is that, God, this task would not be a burden, but would be a blessing. Just grant them wisdom, grant them knowledge, give them eyes to see things, Lord, that others do not. And so, Lord, as we live in times that are challenging, I pray, Lord, for a sense of unity in our city, that God would see the complementary nature of how each person is wired and, Lord, that we give you thanks for that. But tonight, Lord, I just pray for a spirit of peace and joy as we serve together as your people. In Christ's name, amen. Thank you. Thank you very much. Please stand and join me in the Pledge of Allegiance. Salute. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. All right. We will start with the roll call. Council Member Bennett? Here. Council Member Brown? Here. Council Member Morgan? Here. Council Member O'Brien? Here. Council Member Tandon? Here. Vice Mayor Reynolds? Here. Mayor Coolidge? Present. All right. Speaker card announcement. Anyone wishing to address the council on any item listed on the agenda should please complete a speaker card found at the back of the chamber. Once completed, it should be turned in to the city clerk. Speakers? Speakers will be called in the order the cards were received. Once the first speaker has been called, additional cards will not be accepted. So just make sure if you want to speak on a particular item, you turn in that card before we start that item. And we will start with a proclamation for National Small Business Week. And accepting the proclamation will be Mark Chrisman, Chair of the Chico Chamber of Commerce, and Carly Olson, Chamber Board Member. If you'll meet me down in front. Thank you. I'm trying to make sure it's working. All right. Welcome. Welcome. Nice to see you. Nice to see you too. Are you in here? All right. That's a nice little proclamation for you guys. And Small Business Week, May 1st through the 7th. And whereas America's progress has been driven by pioneers who think big, take risks, and work hard, and the small business community is at the very core of our nation's identity, and prosperity. And whereas small business owners and Main Street businesses have energy and a passion for what they do, from the storefront shops that anchor Main Street to the high-tech startups that keep America on the cutting edge, small businesses are the backbone of our economy and the cornerstone of our nation's promise. Whereas when we support small business, jobs are created, and local communities persevere or preserve their unique culture. They also persevere. And we're proud of it because of it as well. Whereas the President of the United States has proclaimed National Small Business Week every year since 1963 to highlight the programs and services available to entrepreneurs through the Small Business Administration and other government agencies to celebrate the resolve and ingenuity of small businesses, entrepreneurs, and workers in the communities across the country. And whereas the city of Chico supports and joins this national effort to help America's small businesses do what they do best, grow their businesses, create jobs, and ensure that our communities remain as vibrant tomorrow as they are today. Now therefore, be it resolved that the City Council, City of Chico, do hereby proclaim May 1st through the 7th, 2022, National Small Business Week and urge individuals in the community to patronize a small business, shop local, and support community businesses. And I'm going to add a little here. We have a lot of small businesses represented on the City Council as well, including myself. So this is... This is near and dear to lots of our hearts, and we know the struggles and the hard times that it can be being a small business owner as well. And I always remember a distant relative's quote of mine, which is, the business of America is business, and certainly I think that that should be amended and maybe say small business. Small business. Because it absolutely is. So thank you so much for being here, and we'll turn the microphone over to you. Thank you, Mary. I appreciate it. Small business is the backbone of a community, as it says in the background right there. You know, the health of a community, can be reflected only in the businesses that are in it. And in Chico, we are truly blessed with the businesses that we have. We have a diverse population of businesses, big and small. But the small business is really the one that are the backbone. So we thank you very much for recognizing businesses and appreciate all the work you guys do. Absolutely. All right. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for having us. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. of the council. I want to give an update on the basically the pallet shelter opening and our enforcement activities that are about to begin. Basically, in fact, the clock started ticking today. The opening of the shelter, the best thing I can say is it just went extremely well. We had 45 residents over the weekend. We continue to have about 45 residents today. I talked to Amber of the Jesus Center just this afternoon, and they're staying steady there. And probably most important, no real significant issues have arisen so far in the first week. I mean, there's been little opening pains here and there, but nothing of any kind of significance. The staff is settling in. The residents are settling in. I think one of the things that they hope to do this weekend is really begin some of the wraparound services from behavioral health as well as employment and social services, our partners at the county. So things are going well there. The outreach is going to slow down for a couple days while they kind of settle in and while we kind of go through our first seven days of the enforcement period, which I'll talk about in a minute. But I think kudos to the staff out at the Jesus Center for everything that they've gone through for this first week, and they're going to continue to monitor it. But so far, very, very good opening, and we're looking forward to that continuing. Which brings me to the next topic, which is enforcement. As you know, last Friday, Judge Newman issued his order, which allows the city to begin its anti-camping ordinance and within the rules and the confines of the settlement agreement. I want to begin by sort of stressing, and I will probably repeat myself several times during this brief presentation, for patience. This is not something that's going to happen overnight. It's not going to be in days or weeks. It'll take months to kind of get through this because of the rules and the way that we have to basically do things. So I'm going to start by saying that we're going to begin by sort of stressing, and I will probably repeat myself several times during this This is not something that's going to happen overnight. It'll take months to get through this because of the rules and the confines of the settlement agreement. These basically, the terms of the settlement agreement dictate how and how quickly we can enforce. For example, we can only enforce in identified areas that cover no more than 50 individuals at a time. In addition, each of these 50, each of these areas where the 50 folks are, require several noticing requirements before we can begin. So for example, the first thing is we need to notify plaintiffs and attorneys that we're going to enforce. So we're going to have to have a number of plaintiffs and attorneys that are going to be in the area that we want to enforce. And we did that last evening, or last, yesterday afternoon. So the first, and that begins a seven-day period. And within there, we can't enforce within that seven-day period. We can do some outreach and take some volunteers, but basically for the next seven days, we're sort of in a holding period. At the end of that seven days is when we can begin enforcing and posting notices within the area that basically folks have seven days to relocate. Okay. At the end of that seven days, if it's still present, we'll issue a 72-hour notice that basically really is saying, if you're not gone in 72 hours, we will remove your belongings and we could even potentially arrest you if you're not willing to relocate. During this time, outreach staff will continue to basically go out, attempt to do assessments, attempt to talk to folks, and get volunteers. Our goal for each of these sort of 17-day periods is not to basically enforce. Our goal is to do the assessments and get people into either the tourist shelter or the Pallet shelter. So that's what we're really trying to achieve. So in the perfect world, 17 days from now, the areas we're enforcing in first, we have very little arrests or we have very little type of enforcement because people have already moved in. We're not naive enough to recognize that that's going to happen, but that's what our goal is. The first area of emphasis that we're going to be heading is basically the ! downtown area and Lower Bidwell Park. We notified the plaintiffs yesterday of this, and so we're concentrating on City Plaza, City Hall area, and then into the whole Lower Bidwell Park area where we have identified approximately 50 people who are located at campers that are there. That will include the Annie's Glen area as well as Lost Park areas included in that first round. We chose this area, and I know that no matter what we're going to do, people are going to not be happy about how we're choosing and what directions and how we're prioritizing this. We did these because basically this Thursday, we begin Thursday night market. Our 150th birthday celebration begins. We're going to have a lot more people coming downtown, Friday night concerts, Thursday night market, and with the summer season getting warmer, basically we're going to see a lot more activity out at Lower Bidwell Park. And so we're concentrating on those areas first. And that's our goal. We will focus on that and that is our first 17 days. After that, we will sort of do an assessment. People are still moving around. We'll kind of do a new count and we'll reveal where the next areas are going to be. Probably we'll be moving out from basically the center, probably outwards, but for right now, we're concentrating on that first 17-day period in Lower Bidwell Park. Again, I already mentioned, I recognize that people would like us to be doing more and even another thing that I've been hearing quite a a bit of is why aren't you just taking volunteers in from all throughout the city? We've had a lot of conversations about that. And one of the things that we're concerned about is we can't have the outreach team running all over the city for a volunteer that might be out of Tiger Ponds here and another volunteer out of Comanche and another. We need to do this methodically. We need to do it area by area and we'll get there to everybody. But we need to do it in a way that both the shelter can handle, both Torres as well as the pallet shelter staff. So we need to do this in that way and we're going to continue to do very methodically, bring in 40 or 50 every two or three weeks and hopefully have them settle in and then go to the next area. We need this to be methodical. We need this to succeed. I want to address one other area of enforcement and I think this is another big piece that is that we haven't been doing as much and now we are going to and we started this morning to start enforcing other code enforcement types of violations. We know that, for example, out of Comanche Creek, there's a number of vehicles in the parking lot. Several of those have might have expired tags or they might be inoperable. So we are going to start enforcing throughout the city through other code enforcement violations and that could include like I say vehicle things but it can include other types of things illegal dumping trash I mean so we will be sending our code enforcement team out and they started doing that this morning going out with our target team to do that types of enforcement so enforcement has begun but it's going to take some time and be patient is the the the word that I just keep saying as many times as I can finally I want to thank the staff Eric and his team code enforcement and their team chief Madden and and his team all the city staff as well as basically the staff out at the Jesus Center our partners at the county that have been there and doing it so we are we're now entering this new phase of addressing this vexing issue of homelessness and I believe we're doing so in a way that's creative humane and we're trying to do everything we can to make sure that we're doing everything we can to make sure that we're doing everything we can to maintain and trying to balance the needs of the homeless as well as the community we're gonna make mistakes we're gonna have some problems somewhere along the way out at the shelters and you just need to expect that we're going to have to make choices that cities or some of our citizens may disagree with as far as enforcement but at the same time we're gonna have successes and we're you know basically I think we're doing the best we can and everybody's doing the best they can to help these folks get into a better situation and help them get along with their lives so with that I'd be happy to answer any questions I don't know if the city attorney or Chief Madden want to add anything but happy to answer any questions on that all right questions for Mr. Hunt no all right thank you yeah very thorough and much needed I think thank you very much all right we'll move on to the consent agenda do we have any council disqualifications or no votes on any well we have to hear speakers before you say no votes council disqualifications no all right no speakers on the end okay entertain a motion move to approve have a motion from Vice Mayor Reynolds a second from councilmember Morgan madam clerk take the role councilmember Bennett council member Brown hi councilmember Morgan councilmember O'Brien yes councilmember Tandon yes vice mayor Reynolds yes mayor Coolidge yes mayor Kerri 7-0 all right this time we'll do business from floor members of the public may address the council at this time on any matter not already listed on the agenda with comments being limited to three minutes or is determined by the number of speakers the council cannot take any action at this meeting on requests made under this section of the agenda how many speakers we have six okay three minutes okay and I'll call two names and if you could go ahead and line up in the middle aisle Robin trip will be our first speaker And the microphone is across the top. The microphone is right here on the... Oh, it's over there? No, no, no. It's on the podium. It's built into the podium. I apologize. Oh, I was looking for a little thing on a stick. My name is Robin Tripp. I am the founder of a local nonprofit that's called Chico Homeless Animal Outreach. And I've been working with homeless people and their pets for almost 10 years here in Chico. And the reason I'm here today is to speak about the muzzle requirement that was imposed on people who are living in the pallet shelter. There are three things I'd like to say about it. It's unrealistic and unenforceable. It's discriminatory and it's dangerous. I was out there at the pallet shelter on Saturday and saw many of the people that I've dealt with over the years and their pets. They have no more idea how to use a muzzle than most anybody in this room probably does. I doubt that they're going to use the muzzles. And furthermore, they shouldn't. They are dangerous if people don't know what they're doing. And Dr. Esch is going to speak to that in a minute. It's discriminatory in my view because they're being held to a standard that no other pet owners in this town are held to. There is no muzzle requirement in the city parks. There's no muzzle requirement in the dog parks. They're also being told that they can only have one dog at a time in the dog run. But what about the dog? In the parks that we have here in town, there are 20, 30 dogs running around at the same time. It seems to me the presumption is that the homeless people are somehow not going to be responsible, whereas members of the other part of the community, I heard a distinction made a minute ago between the homeless and the community. And I would like to say the homeless are part of our community. And they're being singled out in this way with regard to the pets. In a way that I think is discriminatory and it really does violate the spirit of no barrier shelter. And so I'm here to urge you to change that policy and make it such that the people in the pallet shelter are not held to a higher standard or a different standard than other pet owners in our community. And with that, I'd like to, as they say in the Senate, yield the remainder of my time to Dr. James Esch, who's a well-known veterinarian here in town, who has worked with us when we did our veterinary clinics at the Jesus Center, which we did for years. And he's going to talk about a lot of that. So just a moment. We'll actually restart your time. You can't give time here, unfortunately. And then Jim. Jim Esch is the speaker at the podium. And then Julie Threed, if you could go ahead and go into the corridor. So there you go. Go ahead. Yeah, I am Dr. Jim Esch, and I'm a veterinarian, and I'm also a board-certified canine specialist. I'm here tonight along with the signed endorsement of at least 10 of my veterinary colleagues in Chico to address that requirement that the companion dogs at the shelter need to be muzzled. So common muzzles made of mesh. And flexible materials like this severely restrict a dog's ability to regulate its body temperature by panting and drinking water, which is all they have. Standard medical advice would be not to put a muzzle like that on a dog outdoors on a warm day for more than 10 minutes. And on a very hot Chico summer day, even that might be dangerous for them, particularly for certain breeds with heavy coats and short noses. Section 597B of the California Penal Code includes, in its definition of animal cruelty and abuse, anyone who, and I quote, fails to provide the animal with proper food, drink, or shelter or protection from the weather. Use of a standard muzzle on a prolonged period on a hot day in Chico would be a clear violation of that and would carry liability for those responsible. Now, you can get around that somewhat by using basket muzzles. Basket muzzles have their own problems. Dogs typically have to be trained. Dogs typically have to be trained to tolerate them for long periods of time. And, in fact, there are veterinary websites set up to deal with that kind of training. And any veterinary professionals who've tried to muzzle an aggressive dog or even some non-aggressive dogs will tell you that they can resist fiercely and they can quickly escalate into very aggressive behavior just because of muzzling. Also, those sites generally carry 6 to 12 different sizes and styles based on the dog's ability to tolerate the dog. The breed and the circumference of the dog's nose and the length of the muzzle. And so unless you're prepared to, you know, stock and maintain a supply of a couple hundred different styles and sizes of basket muzzles, that's not an answer. I suspect you adopted that muzzle thing out of a concern for safety and legal liability. But as she said, it begs the question of why you chose to, you know, impose a rather onerous and dangerous burden on the people at the palate shelter when every other public area in Chico open to dogs is subject only to a common leash law. It suggests that maybe you think that because people are homeless, they're not going to be responsible for their animals or that their animals are going to be inherently more aggressive. And my experience has been that the opposite is true. These dogs are more accustomed and more socialized to being around many different people, situations and other animals than the dog that grew up knowing only his family and his backyard. So the veterinary community is urging you to apply the same consideration to the palate shelter and substitute the, one sentence, we're going to substitute the existing leash law. We have a limit for a reason. So Julie Threat followed by Jessica Giannola. Hi everyone. Okay, so real quick on the city manager's report. It's point one. Just maybe a clarification question. Because we can sign up to speak to that, right? But how do we know what's being talked about under that? That's just a question. Because I would have, if I knew he was going to talk about the palate shelter, I would have put in a card to speak to that. But I'll call up with you maybe later. Madam Clerk, do you want to address that? Yes, let me stop her time. So reports and communications, we, the verbal report doesn't indicate a topic. So we don't accept cards in on that. At this meeting, because of what the update might have been, or what perhaps we had all hoped to hear, the mayor and the council moved that item up. And that's why you heard it. And you can address it now under business from the floor. I'll use my three minutes for my other thing. But so real quick, so 6.1, can we never talk about 6.1? We can never put a card in for 6.1? Well, you don't know what the topic is. Okay. So that's why. Okay. It's a verbal report. All right. Very good. All right. I wanted to say thank you real quick to Mayor Coolidge for doing the proclamation. I'm a member of the Daughters of the American Revolution. We had our 100th anniversary in Chico. So that was fabulous. Thank you, Mayor Coolidge. I'm here again as an advocate for the vaccine injured. My CAT scan, little thing there. And my daughter, who is a healthcare worker, being coerced into getting all the boosters. When I was here two weeks ago, told you about the vaccine clinic at the mall. And it didn't get canceled, but the marketplace was kind enough to push them as far away from the mall as possible. It was set up right there next to the old Outback, way across on Forest Avenue, not near any foot traffic. Unfortunately, we still saw, you know, quite a few little kids getting up there and getting their vaccinations. And all we were asking for is just information. So in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking and Dr. John. So now this week, if you guys aren't aware, Senate Bill 866, rolling through Sacramento, 866 allows your 12-year-olds to walk into that clinic and get vaccinated. No proof of from the parent, no parental consent. You don't even have to be told. That's rolling through. That means that the Chico junior high kids that are right across the street from that Butte County Public Health Department, they can walk right across the street on a dare with a whole group of kids. You name it, they're mad at you. They're mad at the world. They're going to walk across the street, get their vaccination, not even tell you, or they're going to come home and throw it in your face. Anybody that's listening, going to be watching, you all should be on the phone. That's this week that's going to a hearing. We should be calling all of our, I mean, you can be for or against it, but a 12-year-old having the informed consent to know what these lipid nanoparticles are going to do to their heart, to their bodies, to their ovaries, it's outrageous. There's a new study out, just came out today from the World Health Organization, hepatitis, that liver stuff you're hearing about, that's real. And that's coming out from a research study. They said, it's all safe. Oh, now we've got myocarditis. It's all safe. Now we've got menstrual disruptions. It's all safe. Now we've got liver replacements with kids. That's wrong. 866, better be hopping on that. Butte County Public Health, they stopped the county emergency order. Butte County Public Health still has an emergency declaration. So they can continue to mandate or come up with whatever they want to do under their health emergency order. So everyone needs to be aware of that. ID.me, you lose your vaccine card, go try online to find it. This is the vaccine passport. It no longer routes you to, you know, just an easy, put your license number in. It goes to ID.me. This is government passports. And I want to say happy birthday to Lou, Broadberry's dad. Jessica Giannola, followed by Derek Sanderson. Thank you. I just want to, again, ask our council to change the, the policy to allow the public to enter a speaker card after speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking speaking The next thing that I wanted to talk about from Business from the Floor is the pallet shelter and a few things that I see as concerns. Intake seems to be primarily phone-based from what I can understand. There's outreach, and then people are told to call in, and it's just a reminder that a lot of people that are without homes are also without phones, and they may have a phone that works sometimes once they get it charged, but it's usually Internet-based. So if there could also be an Internet hub, a Wi-Fi hub, a pallet shelter, that would help them in their steps that will be taken to getting other resources that will hopefully get them permanent housing. Another thing I noticed when I was out there visiting was that all of the pallet shelters, they are without curtains, and that's not a big deal for any. You'd be like, oh, you have shelter, right? But these people might be here for a while, and we're trying to stuff them up. And being without curtains, anybody can see in, see out. And with that can come like an embarrassment, an embarrassment, potentially shame, anything that you're just reminding that person that you still don't have a home, we still have control, those kinds of things, and that does something to the brain. That sets the brain back into this fear, fight or flight. It raises their cortisol, their stress levels, makes it harder for them to be able to concentrate. Right? And so we're trying to get them to be able to take the steps they need to be able to take with support of finding permanent housing. And we really want to support them. That should be your end goal. Not just get them from out in front of our building here, but to support them in our community. So that a real easy quick fix would be like these sticky clean-ons. You can get them from like Amazon, the window coverings. They can see out. People can't see in. They peel right off. They can wipe right off really easy and clean. Safety issues, the dog muzzles were mentioned. I think that, you know, we're going to have to do a lot of work. We're going to have to do a lot of work. Someone that is a professional in the animal field should have been consulted. I don't want to see people are dying and then why we would be putting these animals at risk by requiring the muzzles to be closed. They need to be able to breathe to cool their systems down. That's how they cool down. They don't sweat. Let's see. Oh, and we need safe parking still. So instead of just giving people tickets and citing them for their cars being out, a date of registration, if we could have some people who are not in the car, So if they have some sort of supportive program that helps them get legal, then they can use their car to drive to work. Derek Sanderson followed by Patrick Newman. Good evening, honorable mayor, council. Many people are aware that Chacon's are going to have an opportunity to vote on a tax measure in an upcoming election. And some people are aware. I've been talking to you. Some are aware that it's just going to go into the general fund. A lot of people actually don't know that it's going into the general fund because of a story in the ER where a former city manager said, these are things that we would like it to go to. There's a perception that all that money is already going to be earmarked for that. As you know, as I know, that's not true when it goes in the general fund. It goes to the whim of the council. Whoever is on this dime, the highest gets to determine what happens with that budget. And because of that, I have a hard time personally supporting that just because of how things ebb and flow. But also when it was approved to go on the ballot, we weren't suffering from all this inflation. The survey was done in 2019. And I'm curious how many Chacon's are going to be okay with allowing an additional tax measure. allowing an additional 1% sales tax when all their cost of living is already going through the roof. I don't see Chacon's supporting that. And as I said before, a lot of Chacon's don't know it's going to the general fund. And so I wonder how many of them are okay with potentially $27 million every year going into that general fund to be spent at the beck and call of the council. The problem with the general fund is there's no real accountability outside of elections. But by that time, the money is already spent. And you can't get it back. In the words of George Carlin, governments don't want well-informed, well-educated people capable of critical thinking. That is against their interests. They want obedient workers. People who are just smart enough to run the machines and do the paperwork and just dumb enough to passively accept it. Unfortunately, as it stands, I can't support the sales tax like I used to think I could. I know that it's already going to go on the ballot. And I know that it's going to take a simple majority to pass it, 50% plus one, which is why it was put on that way. So just wanted to make that known. Thank you. Thank you. Our last speaker is Patrick Newman. I think I'm going to go with Patrick. I think that quote is from Carl Sagan, actually. But anyway, we desperately need an infusion of $27 million a year plus in the general fund to take care of years of shortfall in terms of revenues in the city. I've said this many times over the last 10 years, because we're one of the few cities in the state of California that doesn't have a sales tax. We have left hundreds of millions of dollars on the table. And it shows in our infrastructure. But anyway, another subject. First thing, before I forget to say this, to take motorhomes and trailers from people right now at Comanche strikes me as a pretty cruel thing to do, given that at least the promise of some kind of pilot solution is there. We just haven't gotten to the point where we've invited them yet. But because they're technically out of compliance with a tag, you're going to go and take their... What happens to those people? They get dumped on the street. So, bad idea. But back to the question of the pilot shelter and where we're at right now in enforcement. People forget that two years ago, everybody was being constantly rousted until COVID came along and people had a right to rest, set up a tent. That created a whole new reality. And that's what we're working our way through now. So two years later, that's kind of forgotten. When you go back to enforcement, what you're talking about is in one month in 2020, 2019, there was 400 arrests. Citations and arrests. So we're talking about an environment where we just apply a lot of maximum police time to going through these motions of arresting... Sorry, profiling, rousting and arresting people. That's the reign of error that a lot of people in Chico want. I oppose that entire approach. As far as the pilot shelter goes, there will be many people left behind. And I can tell this already. I can tell already that it's a selective process. And that my guess is that many, many disabled people will be left behind because they don't have the resources out there to deal with them. So there will be a screening process that's not talked about and yet it will affect who's out there. Then the whole question of how many people can survive in that environment. We're going to roll back to a situation where we're going to have some percentage of the homeless population out there, but a large percentage that's not. And then we go back to the old reality of police saying, go to stairways. This was 10 years ago. Go to stairways. That's your solution. Now we go to the pallet. Whether you're able to get in or not is a whole other question. So this is really complicated. And the ER, and I'm sorry to say it, but the city manager is putting a very happy face on all this. But it's way more complex than what the public is seeing. More on that another time. Thank you. That's it? All right. All right. We'll move on to public hearings. Item 4.1, hearing, ordering, formation of maintenance assessment. District A-50, Tower Vista Subdivision. Director of Public Works, Ms. Sutton. Welcome. Thank you. Good evening, Mayor, Vice Mayor, and Council members. The item before you tonight is a petition that we received from a property owner that is in the process of creating a subdivision called the Tower Vista Subdivision to create a maintenance assessment district. We're referring to this maintenance assessment district as A-50. And this is a condition of approval that is required prior to the approval of the subdivision map, which is intended to create eight lots. And the maintenance assessment district is required to provide the means for funding the future replacement and annual operation and maintenance costs of certain public improvements. And the public improvements that are going to be included in this maintenance assessment district, should it be approved, is stormwater infrastructure, straight trees, and landscaping. And these are assets that give a special benefit to the subdivision, and that's why they're included in a maintenance assessment district. The subdivision will include eight lots, and the cost for the property owners will be $795.09 per lot per year. And let's see, there's one owner currently. The property has not been subdivided, so there's one owner, ASR Enterprises, and they're, from what we understand, they're in favor of this maintenance assessment district. And a public hearing is required as part of the formation of this maintenance assessment district. And that concludes my report. If you have any questions, I can answer them. All right, questions? Council? All right, seeing none, we'll open the public hearing. Do we have any speakers on this? Yes, we have one speaker, Derek Sanderson. All right. Three minutes. Greetings, Council. First, I do have to say, I live near there, and it's a beautiful little infill project. It looks like the houses are pretty close to being done. I know that I live in a maintenance district. When I went to, my wife and I went to buy our house a year and a half ago, seven days before it closed, it was, we were notified, oh, by the way, there's an extra $500 a year you have to pay on your taxes. We weren't, it didn't come up in any reports ahead of time. I'm a realtor. I know what I'm looking for and what to look for. And it wasn't until seven days before it closed. My concern is, is simply that the developer is willing to pass it off to the new homeowners, $800 a year for the next ten years. And if you read it, it's adjustable for inflation every year. So earlier I mentioned how inflation is going up. That's a big addition to a tax bill, $800 a year. I get it. The city has to, there has to be money to take care of these improvements and these items. That's just a massive cost for a new homeowner to be able to take on, on top of housing costs that are already so high. I don't know if you guys have looked around, but housing prices in Chico, they're pretty crazy. And so it's just going to make it more unaffordable. And it's actually going to weed out people that would normally be able to maybe afford it. But that $800 is going to push them over the edge. And they're going to be able to get out of the edge every year. And they aren't going to be approved for the loan that they need. So I know this has been done this way a lot of times. I wish there was another way to do it. I just don't think it's fair to the new homeowners that a developer comes in, makes this plan, and says, hey, here's your new house. By the way, you're now stuck paying this additional bill. So thank you. He was our only speaker. All right. So we'll close the public hearing. We'll have the council. I actually had a question for Ms. Sutton. Sure. Could you explain if the developer, it's the developer that's requesting to do this or the city requiring the developer to do this? The city requires the formation of the maintenance assessment district before the subdivision map can be approved. And in regard to the input about developers sticking the homeowners with the bill, these are ongoing. O&M operations and maintenance costs that the developer is not typically responsible for. They're typically responsible for the capital costs of building the infrastructure. And then the ongoing costs of operation and maintenance are the property owner's responsibilities. And this particular maintenance assessment district is ongoing costs for landscaping, upkeep, street trees, and replacement of the stormwater infrastructure after 20, at the end of its useful life. Perfect. Okay. Thank you. All right. Will the council? Second. Motion from Council Member Morgan, a second by Council Member Tandon. Madam Clerk. Council Member Bennett? Yes. Council Member Brown? Aye. Council Member Morgan? Yes. Council Member O'Brien? Yes. Council Member Tandon? Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds? Aye. Mayor Coolidge? Aye. Carries 7-0. All right. Moving on to item 4.2, hearing on resolution declaring weeds, rubbish, refuse, and debris to be a public nuisance, ordering abatement and removal, setting a deadline for abatement, and providing assessment of the cost of abatement. And I believe we have Ms. Sterk. There she is. Hello. Good evening, Mayor, Vice Mayor, and Council Members. As you recall, on April 19th, the council adopted a resolution which declares weeds and rubbish to be a public nuisance that must be abated. This is part of the city's annual weed abatement program. After the April meeting, the council adopted a resolution that would require the public in the city in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in that are to be recovered from property owners at the July 5th council meeting. All right, questions? All right, thank you very much. Do we have any speakers on the site? We do. We have one, Jessica Giannola. All right, come on down. Open the public hearing. Sorry, go ahead. I was reading the little link to that, and I wasn't able to see if that was a specific property that this is regarding or if this is just a policy in general for Chico that we're trying to adopt or adopting. So I'll just assume that's for the whole city then. So I just had some concerns when it comes to things requiring homeowners or renters. I don't know if this is going to apply to renters, but homeowners, that. They may have things on their property that may pose a risk or danger in some way at some point. And I could see how if we have plants growing over the sidewalk, how that's a tripping hazard for people who are trying to walk on them. If this is going to apply to things that are on a person's property and the city is saying, okay, you need to fix this or we're going to come in and do it. I don't know if this is going to apply to anyone who is going to be in charge you. I would hope that the city is making allowance for people who may have disabilities or income restrictions that prevent them from taking care of these items on their own so that they're not at risk of being charged something they can't pay and then a lien being placed upon their property. We're seeing some of this take place in Paradise where people have left their property or they just didn't have the money to fix it. And so liens are being placed against the property because things need to be done and the city's the city is Once their money back So if we had a policy in place that's preventing those that do have homes from losing them from some sort of scenario like this I would I would hope our city would do that for our residents. Yeah She was our only speaker all right discussion or will the council I get a motion from councilman Morgan a second from vice mayor Reynolds, and you need me to read the no Resolution titles do not need to be read councilmember Bennett. Yes councilmember Brown Council member Morgan councilmember O'Brien. Yes councilmember Tandon. Yes vice mayor Reynolds Mayor Cooley I carry 7-0 all right item 4.3 hearing on resolution amending the city's fee schedule we have a report from Barbara Martin Good evening mayor Coolidge vice mayor Reynolds members of the council. Thank you for your time this evening Each year in accordance with our city's budget policies the city's fee schedule is revised revised with certain inflator indexes as outlined Either by the Municipal Code or in the case of the development impact fees the Nexus study The index is used this year We always use certain months. We always use the February consumer price index and this year that was 7.9 percent increase we use the March construction cost index as provided in the engineering new record and That this year was fifteen point one five percent And then we also have some fee because fee increases that are due to personnel costs increases and this year for non safety Employees that was sixteen point two nine percent and for safety that was eight point seven five percent The fees that are before you tonight are those that require a public hearing as well as some new fees that were requested from certain departments And they are presented in your packet And we ask that you approve the resolution and adopt the new fees as amended and open the public hearing and I'm here for questions All right questions Thank you So we'll go ahead and open the public here number of speakers Sorry, we have one speaker bill Webb. All right Come on down Good evening, mr. Mayor Good evening, mr. Mayor Vice mayor fellow council, I'm gonna speak with two hats first hats Chico builders Association My name is Bill Webb if you don't know who I am We'd like to request that the fee update not update but annual increased inflationary indices Discussion be kicked back to finance as it typically is we have a few questions that are still kind of hanging fruit from when the Nexus update was performed with mr Auduboni a couple years back and one being the highway cost index More commonly known as the Caltrans index. It has gone down this year by due to municipal code Language we don't realize the community doesn't realize the reduction of a fee. So we'd like to have that discussion brought back again Fees only increase they don't increase when an indice II is lower second point would be the use of the engineering news record or the construction cost index and the CPI One being chosen as a February to February the other one arch to March We'd like to you know Kind of solidify what time period we're using because there's a vast difference between looking at the enr March over March versus February over February of a tune of about 8% so We feel that this isn't the body to happen We don't have that discussion its finances the Finance Committee to have that discussion So we'd like you to kick it back to finance so we can Kind of fine-tune some of these things before we move on because what we're looking at is upwards over thousand dollars per unit and and fees increase that ultimately gets passed on to the consumer and with the inflation that we're experiencing and labor and material shortages It's just another cost that's going to increase the cost of a unit or an apartment Okay, take that off. Second hat, user fees, which is the other fee that's before you, is going up by, Barbara, I think 16% for the non-safety factor. I don't know if I have an issue with that, but personally, as a business owner and a housing provider in Chico, I would like to see our staff at City Hall five days a week. If we come in for an application, whether it's a tentative map, a building permit, what have you, and we've got staff, your staff, working on it, and they have a question with somebody else in a different department, they pick up the phone, they get no answer, they send an email, they get no answer. It might be a day, two days, three days, what have you, until they get a response back. If that person's in the next queue over, they can walk down there, ask them. Might not have the answer. But at least they've had a conversation. I mean, this happens, ask any of the building community out there, you'll find this happening day in, day out. It's really frustrating from our point. Thank you. All right. That was our only speaker. All right, discussion from the council, will of the council. As the chair of the finance committee, I'd like to move that we send it to internal affairs. I object. Not even typing that one. As a member of the internal affairs. We're not allowing that. I can't type it, it won't take it. Whatever you want, whatever you want. Whatever you want. Go ahead. Yeah, so I was just going to say, if I remember correctly, in the past, doesn't this usually go to finance first before it comes to us? Did you guys have an opportunity to discuss? But I know we've been having a lot of meetings and a lot of stuff going on. You're on the internal affairs committee, aren't you? I am. Ms. Martin. Hi, yes. In the past, it has gone to the finance committee. We had some timing issues this year, and it just didn't get there. We had, because of the 60-day notice and because of the timing for the beginning of the fiscal year, it didn't go through that channel this year. Is it too late to do that channel? It's never too late. All right. All right. I'm happy to revisit it at finance if somebody wants to make that motion, but I'm not going to do it to myself. We'll make the motion. Second that motion. I'd like to comment that some of the fees that are associated with this package are not related to development. And we have heard no controversy, whether there's some things with the airport department and, you know. So if you do want to send back basically the development fees back to the finance committee, we understand. We'll do that. But if you could pass on the ones that are not related to that, I think that would help, and we could get those things implemented. And, Barbara, I'm not sure if we can break those out right here. We can do that. Basically, anything in your packet that is related to the construction cost index, that's what I'm hearing is the most controversial. We can pull those out and talk about those at the finance committee if that's acceptable. Okay. So who made the original motion? Dale, would you consider amending your motion? I have not. One of my issues is I have not had time to review it completely. And I feel very uncomfortable voting on something which increases prices for people trying to get into housing. And housing is one of the biggest topics that we've got going on here in Chico and every place else. So I can't vote for this, and I'm not going to vote for any pieces of it until I understand it. Now, that's not your problem. I'm not being critical of you at all. I want to make that clear. But I need time to genuinely understand all the costs and why they're there before I could ever say yes. I'm not going to go backwards on finding out. I should have read this. I should have understood it. So that's my concern. That is my comment. So I'm saying no. If somebody wants to make another motion, that's fine, but I'm going to say no. So the motion was to adopt the resolution as amended. It's not a motion that was amended. It's a motion that was amended to take out all development fees, construction costs, fees associated with that, and send it back to the Finance Committee, which I believe you're a member of. Yeah, but I think his original motion was just to send the indictment. Okay, so you want to withdraw your original motion? That wasn't my motion. I can make a substitute motion that will make it easy. I don't think I did. No, you didn't. You didn't. I want to take the whole thing back. Okay, so you're motioned. Motion will stand. Mr. Morgan. Okay, so I had the original motion by Councilmember Tandon, seconded by Councilmember O'Brien. And then... Okay. And so, and what I'm hearing the Council say is that you would like the Finance Committee to review the development impact fees and anything related to construction costs. And approve the rest. And approve the rest of them. And that... So I guess we would ask Councilmember Tandon if you, if that is okay with that amendment to your motion. Yes. Okay. Councilmember O'Brien, are you okay with that amendment? I am. All right. Okay. So, Councilmember Bennett, this was just on the fees not associated with development. Correct. So the motion is to adopt the resolution as amended, removing any fees associated with development impact fees or construction costs. All the rest of the fees would still move forward. And then the, those individual fees that are being removed would be forwarded to the Finance Committee for additional review. That's good. Okay. All right. When you're ready. Okay. Just a second. Councilmember Bennett? No. Councilmember Brown? No. Councilmember Brown? No. Councilmember Morgan? Yes. Councilmember O'Brien? Yes. Councilmember Tandon? Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds? Aye. Mayor Coolidge? Aye. Carry 6-2. Excuse me. 5-2. Sorry. Okay. Oh, no. I thought we had eight. Okay. All right. All right. Moving on to our... Hit this next one. Our regular agenda. Confirmation of amendment to City Clerk Employment Agreement. So, Mr. Young. Thank you, Mayor Coolidge. Item 5.1, confirmation of amendment to City Clerk Employment Agreement pursuant to Section 605 of the City of Chico Charter, the council appoints the city manager, the city attorney, and the city clerk. Deborah Presson has served as the city clerk of the City of Chico Charter. She has served as the city manager of the City of Chico since 2000 June. The city council completed the performance evaluation of Ms. Presson, the city clerk, on April 19, 2022, and upon conclusion of the evaluation, voted unanimously to amend the City Clerk Employment Agreement to adjust the salary level commensurate with other department directors. In compliance with government code section 54953, paragraph 6. The council must orally report the following summary of the recommendation for final action related to the City Clerk Employment Agreement as follows. I will make that announcement for the council. The city council is proposing to modify the employment agreement of Ms. Presson as the city clerk and elections official to include a salary increase commensurate with other department directors and to adjust her annual salary to $165,000. The recommendation is as follows. The recommendation is that the City Council authorize the Mayor to sign the amended agreement for Ms. Presson serving as the City Clerk and elections official. That concludes my report. All right. Any questions or comments? All right. I'm seeing none. Any speakers? Yes, we have two. Julie Threatt followed by Patrick Newman. All right. Three minutes. All right. I think this will do. Anyone in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking in speaking It's been 10 years since she got a raise to her base pay. That's pretty incredible. And you've got to look at the total compensation, the benefits, the payroll, the contributions, et cetera, to the benefit plans. And then, obviously, internal equity, which is what you base that on. So if you look at the government salary database, which, again, you've got to be very careful about what survey databases you go out and look on Google. A lot of them are self-serving. But San Mateo, Alameda, Milpitas, Costa Mesa, Redwood City, Pleasanton, Roseville, Palo Alto, Mountain View, Elk Grove, Manteca, Newark, Turlock, Rockland, Concord all pay more than we do. So she deserves more. Thank you. Thank you. Patrick Newman. I read a management book by Peter Drucker a long time ago, and he talked about how five years in any position, executive position, was the limit on maximum effectiveness. It's an interesting concept. But what I see here is... Kind of an entrenched city with a lot of incestuous kinds of behaviors happening that aren't talked about. And then I think the clerk's office has been politicized quite a bit. Something else we don't talk about. So if it was up to me, I would say thank you for your service, and let's bring in somebody from outside of Chico to look at what's happening inside of Chico and to start, you know, like exposing someone. I mean, I don't want to do some of that, so there's some transparency. There's stuff that... Anyway. Let's set all that aside, the politicization and everything else, and talk for a minute about... You guys just waived a whole bunch of fees. Like, you spend money like you've got it. You don't. The city is woefully underfunded, as I've been saying, for ten years. Year after year, there's no sales tax on the ballot. There's finally one now. So I don't want to talk about it. So now we're in this deep hole with our infrastructure and everything else. And during that time period, while most cities in California, almost nearly every city in California, was raising revenue and paying their employees a decent wage, and here's a question. I don't know what anybody's worth. That's a tough question to answer. But we do know that for 12 years, the boots on the ground people in the city did not get a raise. When they got a raise, it was, as I understand it, and this is not my area of expertise, but sounds to me like they got a nine-year-old. That's a nine-percent raise over three years. That's a three-percent raise as of this year. You're talking about a 15-percent raise in one year, as I understand it, one day? On a salary that's multiples of the median income in this area? So now that cuts to the question of how much is any administrator worth? What happens with this exponential increase as we go up the curve? That's a complicated question. But the thing is, if you're going to add $20,000, $21,000 to a person's salary tonight, you've got to go back and think about whether you're really in support of the kind of revenue generation we need in this city. Whether all seven of you are going to stand up and say, yeah, we failed. We didn't generate revenue over 10 years because we don't have a sales tax. And that's ideological, and it's been a failure. And so if you're going to start talking about money here, every damn time you've got to go back and ask, where's the money we haven't collected and where are we now? With salaries, infrastructure, everything else. Conditions for city employees, all of it. So it's a complicated thing. But anyway, those are my thoughts. Thanks. He's our last speaker. All right. Will the council? Move to approve. I'll second. Comment. Before we vote. Fire away. Unveiled insults. Passive insults. Passive-aggressive council members, passive-aggressive city managers, members of the public, personal attacks all the while. Grace, poise, professionalism. That should be demonstrated by every single executive this city or any company should ever see. I have never in my life cared less about what Patrick Newman said than I do right now. All right. Madam Clerk, take the roll. Council Member Bennett? Absolutely. Council Member Brown? Aye. Council Member Morgan? Yes. Council Member O'Brien? Yes. Council Member Tandon? Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds? Aye. Mayor Coolidge? Aye. Carries 7-0. All right. Thank you, council. Thank you very much. Item 5.2, confirmation of interim administrative orders. Administrative Services Director, Mr. Hunt. Yes. With the passing of the unfortunate and untimely passing of Scott Dow as the Administrative Services Director has left a big hole in that department. Fortunately, we have on staff Barbara Martin who has stepped up and into that role on a basis right now and has done an incredible job. Therefore, as a result of the job that she's done, her experience, her background, her background, I am proposing to enter into an employment agreement with Barbara Martin as the Interim Administrative Services Director. I'm proposing to appoint Barbara with an annual salary of $146,000 yearly and a $400-a-month vehicle allowance. I'm recommending to the council to confirm the appointment of Barbara Martin as the Interim Administrative Services Director. All right. Questions? All right. Seeing none. Speakers? No speakers. All right. Will the council? Second. A motion from Council Member Morgan, a second from Council Member O'Brien. Madam Clerk? Council Member Bennett? Absolutely. Council Member Brown? Aye. Council Member Morgan? Yes. Council Member O'Brien? Yes. Council Member Tandon? Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds? Aye. Mayor Coolidge? Aye. Carries 7-0. All right. We have a request for a break, so we'll go ahead and take a short break and then come back. So we're in one in one in one in one in one in one in one in one in one in one in one in one in one in one in one in one in one in one in one in one in one in one in one in one in one in one in one in one in one in one in one in one in one in one in one in one in one in one in one in one in one in one in one in one in one in one in one in one in one in one in one in one in one in one in one in one in one in one in one in one in one in one in one in one in one in one in one in one in one in one in one in one in one in one in one in one in one in one in one in one in one in one in one in one in one in one in one in one in one in one in one in one in one in one in one in one in one Thank you. All right, come back from recess. All right, item 5.3, sewer regionalization project, draft principles of agreement. Mr. Kepsteson, come on down. Good evening, Mayor, Council members. Thank you for the opportunity to speak tonight. I'll be brief on this. This is just the opportunity for Chico City Council to make any comments on the draft principles of agreement. As you recall, on March 15th, we presented an update on the Paradise Sewer Regionalization Project that included the draft principles agreement. But primarily, we focused on the potential connection fee that the SERPAC, which is the Sewer Regionalization Project Advisory Committee, had landed on between city staff and the Town of Paradise staff and the SERPAC members from both agencies. The future connection fee is still at $14.9 million. So just under $15 million, which includes what the impacts will be to our capacity and then kind of a cost for what our plant is worth and what it might be to connect. So this opportunity is just to provide any comments. We've just concluded a 30-day public comment period. There's been multiple meetings from both the Town of Paradise, Chico City Council here, but specifically the SERPAC, where there's been opportunity for public comment as we've formed this draft principles of agreement. All right. It has 17 areas. You want me to close that for you, Debbie? I can't hear you. Sorry. There's 17 areas of focused, and I'll just kind of highlight a few. The Town will draft a sewer use ordinance that mirrors the city's sewer use ordinance. The Town will follow the city's pretreatment program. We have a substantial pretreatment program, which regulates significant industrial users and commercial connections. It will define limits on volume and quality. It will define the quality of the wastewater from Paradise. It will include monitoring, ramifications, access, users' fees, and then, of course, the connection fee of $14.9 million. So really, this principles of agreement is just going to be the guiding document for the larger inter-municipal agreement, which we will form in the future once the project nears and they are approved to move forward. And it nears. So in the meantime, we're in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes in iTunes public comments on this draft document from the just the recently concluded 30 day public comment period all right and vice mayor Reynolds and I served on that committee so what's vice mayor Reynolds you have something that you'd like to have not necessarily other than the fact that we've met gosh 10 12 times I don't know how many it's been and they're usually scheduled for two-hour meetings and we literally went through this word by word by word you know just making sure everything was great I just think the main thing to point out is I know we're talking about our sewer fees here in Chico that none of this will paradise will be taking on all of the financial commitment of tying into our system and that none of that is being passed on to the Chico unit users there's an outside company that's been doing all the analysis on that and really guiding us through the process and I've learned more about water this year than I ever last two years from buying a water poor in this that I probably ever wanted to know in my life. But it's been really interesting. It's been an honor to serve. And both the staff members and the company have worked really well together to keep us educated and walk us through the process. Yeah, and along those lines, if council has any questions for either Vice Mayor Reynolds or myself, we're happy to answer those too. But, you know, I can just say that those meetings were marathon meetings. And we did them both in Chico and up in Paradise as well. So, you know, we gave every opportunity we could. That was a request of our council that we have the meetings down here as well. So we gave opportunity for locals in Chico to speak to it. But literally every word of this agreement was gone through in a very methodic pace and very thoroughly. There were some areas where items were worked through and I think it came together very well. Again, like Vice Mayor Reynolds said, you know, this isn't going to cost the city of Chico anything. It's going to be paid for entirely. By the city of Paradise. But we also did things to make sure that, you know, questions about development springing off this sewer line as it moves down through Paradise and to the city of Chico were answered too to make sure that that wasn't something that was a possibility. And, you know, we talked about 50 years down the road too. So there were a lot of discussions, very thorough. Mayor, can you speak to the development questions and how they could have provided some sort of assured answer that it wouldn't happen? Yeah, and it is in the agreement. And Mr. Guff's, I don't know if you have that in front of you, that specific aspect, but I know you were there for obviously you might be able to cover it better than I. Yeah, included in the principles of agreement where it's the only connections that would be allowed, bless you, are in the Paradise sewer service area, which is basically their town limits. So there will be no connections allowed in the unincorporated areas of Buchanan. Anywhere the pipeline will go through basically down the skyway. I feel a little bit confused as I'm reading this. There seems to be quite a few points that are unfinished. You know, needing to consult with the city attorney, things in brackets that may or may not apply. That's stuff that doesn't need to be fleshed out before we would adopt a final, whatever this is, articles of... Yeah, city attorney review to make sure there's no issues will be fleshed out prior to the June 7th. Formal approval. Again, and this is just kind of a very overarching general guidance document that will kind of guide us when we draft the inter-municipal agreement, which will really go into the finite detail of that relationship and collaboration effort. Okay. Yeah, along those lines, this process has lots of steps. So it's, you know, it covers all bases multiple times, but that further agreement will also come too. Any other questions from council? All right. Perfect. Thank you. Thank you. Appreciate it. How many speakers? One. All right. Patrick Newman. So continuing with this theme of an incestuous mess, the only sensible talk I've ever heard here on infrastructure has come from outside consultants. And I could be wrong about that, but, you know, my casual attendance... I've heard some amazing presentations about our infrastructure, which led me to an obvious conclusion, which is that our infrastructure is failing and it's been underfunded forever. And so we're talking our streets, our storm drains, our sewers, our traffic signaling, our sidewalks, all of that. So now... And you can obviously, you know, discard this, and maybe I'm wrong about this, but I wonder if there's been a real study by an outside consultant that's come in to look at our sewer treatment plant after 10 years of neglect and understaffing. There's constantly holes in the staffing out there, and it's kind of like a rock that maybe we need to turn over. I don't think that's Mr. Gustafson's job, per se, because I don't think he's equipped to do that kind of analysis of what's going on in our sewer treatment plant. But if it's like the rest of our infrastructure, where we have $200 million of road backlog that hasn't been addressed, then an analogy might be, well, our roads are all buckling, but we're going to generate some income from another city, and we're going to let them drive their, you know, trucks across our roads. Well, if our roads were in good shape, that might make some sense, but it doesn't make any sense at all if your roads are failing. So here's my question. What shape is our sewer treatment plant in, and are we just doing this thing where we're going, like, in an alligator, crocodile sort of way, wow, $15 million, let's grab that, because we're always underfunded, and we're always looking for sources of revenue, but we don't do this honestly, because the seven of you, I don't think, have really stood up on this question of revenue, which is really a sales tax issue. So now we're talking about taking on additional volume from an outside city, town of paradise, in an environment where I don't think there's been a thorough study of what we've got going on here. I would advise you, and again, of course, I'll toss to the side, but I would advise you to dig deeper into what's going on here and where we need to go in terms of getting that whole system from the sewer lines, you know, all the way out to the plant, what kind of condition that plant's in, how to get it staffed properly, and everything else before you take on anything else, because... It's irresponsible to do it that way. Thanks. All right. Will the council... It was just to provide comments. So you don't... We don't need to... Okay. So we don't need to do anything. All right. So, no well then. Moving on to council member requests. Pursuant to... Pursuant to... APMP 1010, council members may verbally request an item to be agendized at a future meeting after stating the item would be a majority vote of the council is needed for order for staff to agendize. Council members may also submit requests in writing. Do we have any council member requests? Council member Tanden? I have one. I would like to agendize a discussion about garbage cans or receptacles in the downtown area. It looks like they are... damage and then disrepair and they're not located equitably in the downtown too. Certain blocks have too many, certain blocks do not have any. So maybe we can have a discussion with DCPA and have some kind of partnership and have a study and maybe try to replace them. So it just gives a little better look to our downtown so we can welcome more people out there. All right. That's a motion, right? A second putting that on for a future agenda? I know one community member in particular that would love to be here for that conversation. Mr. Will. So the request is just for a conversation about? That's what I understood. The trash receptacles or lack thereof in the downtown area? All right. Council Member Bennett? Yes. Council Member Brown? Sure. Council Member Morgan? Yes. Council Member O'Brien? Yes. Council Member Tandon? Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds? Aye. Mayor Coolidge? Aye. Carry 7-0. All right. Do we have any further requests from Council Members? All right. Seeing none, we will move into closed session. Do we have any public comments or Council disqualification? All right. No public comment. No public comment. All right. We will see you in after closed session.
