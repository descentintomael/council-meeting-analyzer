 Heather With- Okay Hello everyone, this is heather with granite kiss again welcome to the peak agenda training session today for agenda coordinators.  Heather With- i'm a product training specialist with granite has i'll be presenting the content today, thank you for those who confirm the audio visual check just a moment ago.  Heather With- So this is considered session three of your peak group training sessions so that's we're looking at this highlighted information here in the upper right hand corner, so the our focus on today is going over creating.  Heather With- single and recurring meeting dates in the system and then we'll also be finalizing and publishing agenda so seems pretty basic, we do have a quite a bit of information to go through.  Heather With- If you've had the opportunity to participate in any of these previous sessions, the first session.  Heather With- was.  Heather With- Is the overview and administration settings and session two for drafters and approvers and then we're on session three today, of course.  Heather With- Now, if you are utilizing our granite kiss streaming solution, this will be your third and final session, you will not move on with the rest of us to session for because you'll be processing your minutes differently.  Heather With- But for those of you who are not streaming with granite kiss and i'm you're going to be processing your minutes in peak.  Heather With- Then.  Heather With- You will be.  Heather With- Doing this same this session tomorrow at the same time, so I hope to see you then.  Heather With- just want to give you a few more pieces of information as most of you on this call know.  Heather With- This is day three of our adventure, we are recording this information so i'll get you all a copy of this uploaded to your media manager site.  Heather With- And then, this is a list of what specifically we're going to cover today so we'll start by accessing the agendas and peak.  Heather With- will be adding new meeting dates so we'll go through that.  Heather With- We'll go through the process of adding a single meeting date and a recurring will process and agenda and then generate an agenda and agenda packet.  Heather With- So we'll publish that information to the view page and I legislate and then we'll also go through the process of revising an agenda and on publishing an agenda, if you need to.  Heather With- And then, if we have time at the end of this session, I will just give you a quick introduction into the I legislate application that's what your office members.  Heather With- could utilize to view the agenda that you publish so if there's time at the end of this session and we'll definitely give you a sneak peek into that so as I mentioned we're live and we are recording and.  Heather With- Please submit your questions into the chat box, I have muted everyone's microphones for today, and if you could please keep your questions generic.  Heather With- In content and then, if you have a very specific question about your site or design.  Heather With- Please direct those to your project manager.  Heather With- or to your project trainer and if you're not sure, please just go ahead and ask, and I will let you know and again I thank you for your time today.  Heather With- So i'll minimize this PowerPoint and now you should be seeing i'm I have my web browser opened and i'm going to log into my media manager granite because platform site so.  Heather With- i'm utilizing the granite is university site for training purposes today.  Heather With- But for those of you who are agenda coordinators, you will be accessing the system accessing the system through your web browser.  Heather With- I'm using chrome.  Heather With- And the URL that you will enter to access your system is going to typically be the name of your organization dot grant kast calm, so if you haven't received the URL for your media manager site.  Heather With- Let me know or your administrator or project manager can help you with that if you've received an email from peak to set up your login and password, then you would enter your username and password here and then click Sign in in the future.  future, if you happen to forget your password, it's very easy to recover that information.  You would just click forgot password here. It will ask you to enter your username, and then you will  be emailed a link so you can reset your password. I'm going to click sign in, and then the page that  I am directed to, because I am logging in today as a peak system administrator, but as an agenda  coordinator, you may have different permissions. So your administrator may set up your login  permissions so that after you log in, you land on this page, which is the media manager site,  or also known as the Granicus platform, or your administrator may set up your login where you go  directly to the peak app. So up over here in my upper right-hand corner, I'm going to toggle down  to peak agenda. So you may be landing on the peak dashboard, which looks like this. So we're going  to pick up the page that I am directed to, and then I'm going to click sign in. So if you're  going to pick up from here in just a moment, but for those of you who do land on the Granicus  platform page, this is really the backbone or the house for your Granicus solutions and  applications. So all of our Granicus clients have this media manager site, and then depending on  what applications or solutions you use in this drop-down menu where we just went, you may have  additional solutions listed. So you just navigate. You start out in this media manager platform,  and then you navigate to the application. So you can see here that I have a media manager  application if you are an administrator typically. So everyone will have a Granicus platform option  and peak agenda, and then it just depends on if you have any other solutions here or not.  So a couple quick things about this site as it pertains to agenda coordinators. This is the site  that manages your view pages. So the view page is the landing page where the public is going to go  to see the information that we are producing and we are publishing from peak. So once we complete  those tasks in peak, that information actually comes through this site before it is processed out  to your view page. And so those view pages are managed here under admin, and then I'll drill down  to views. And your system may have only one view page. That's fine if you're keeping it simple. As  you can see, my system does have several different view pages. And your project manager and trainer  will go into more detail on creating additional view pages if need be or on managing the content.  And information or the design. So for today, I'm just going to simply open the view page we're  going to work with and we'll move forward from there. So I'm going to be processing information  that will be published onto this past events view page. So I'm just going to double click and it  launched this page in another tab. So I still have the tab open where my media manager where I just  was. And now I have a new pad, a new tab that's displaying the view page. So our goals for today  in this page are to create a new page. So I'm going to go ahead and click on the view page. And  I'm going to go ahead and click on the view page. And I'm going to go ahead and click on the view page.  We're going to be creating new media calendar dates to display here on upcoming events.  So we'll add another calendar date here. We'll go through that process. And then we're going to be  working with this city council meeting here. So by the end of this session, we will publish a link  to the agenda here and a link to the agenda packet over here. So those are our goals today.  We are going to be popping back into this view page a couple times throughout the session to go  over some more of this information in detail. So we'll definitely see you there. And I'm going to  see this again. For now, I'm going to pop back over into my media manager site. And then before  I navigate over to PEAK, for those of you who are streaming, using our streaming solution with  Granicus, the archives folder is also an important element of your solution because your recorded  videos are stored within these folders. So your city council meeting, the recorded videos will all  be uploaded and saved within these folders here. So but as a particular point, I'm going to go ahead  and hit save so that I have a quick overview of the page so that I have a quick overview of the page so  that I have a quick overview of the page so that I have a quick overview of the page so that I have  a quick overview of the page so that I have a quick overview of the page so that I have a quick overview  of the page so that I have a quick overview of the page so that I have a quick overview of the page so  that I have a quick overview of the page so that I have a quick overview of the page so that I have  And from here, as we were here just a few moments ago, this always brings us to the dashboard as the landing page.  So for those of you who've had the opportunity to participate in some previous PEAK sessions, you're probably already familiar with this dashboard.  But for those of you who aren't, everyone lands on the dashboard when they first come into the PEAK system.  The system is comprised of these four tabs up here in the upper left.  So we are on the dashboard tab right now.  There's also a tab for meetings, which is where we'll be spending time adding new meetings and organizing the calendar today.  There's a tab for items and then a shortcut tab to create a new meeting or create a new agenda item.  So it's basically comprised of those four tabs for end users.  And then if you are a PEAK administrator, way over here in the upper right-hand corner, you do have the option to go into admin.  So not all agenda coordinators are administrators in PEAK.  So you may not have this.  But I am going to be referencing some pieces of information within admin during this session just to help you cross-reference how we're getting some fields and information populated as we're going through this process.  So on this dashboard, the top two tiles are shortcut links into the items tab.  And these are specific to the user.  So the number of items total in the system created by the specific user who is logged in, this will be here.  And then if a user.  Is an approver and has items waiting for approval, then it would show their tally there.  So if I click on agenda items created by me.  This brought me directly to the items tab, but it took me right to the field.  For my items.  So all of these results are my items I've created in the system.  And if I go back to the dashboard and click on the items needed for my approval, even though I don't have any, I can still click on it.  And it will take me directly to the items tab.  But it just is filtering just the items that are waiting for my approval.  So your approvers who are in the system approving these items as you're getting ready to process these agendas.  That's how they're going to go in and see a list of the items waiting for them to approve.  They'll access that through their dashboard and and click here to begin that process.  Now below here.  This is always going to show everyone, all users, the four upcoming meetings.  So the next four meetings in order.  And then everyone in the system will have the ability to scroll ahead or to scroll back.  So your drafters may be glancing at this if they're looking for, you know, a meeting date where they want to start creating items for.  But as agenda coordinators, what we're going to be doing here is we're the ones who are going to be creating these calendar dates so that they're displayed here for everyone on their dashboard.  And then we're also going to be changing the agenda status to final as this one shows.  So we're working on this meeting today.  So by the time we're done, we're going to change this status to final like this one is.  So everyone who comes into this meeting will be able to see this.  You have to have a background so that everyone in the system will know that information so as a gender coordinators, you will be able to click on any of these meeting tiles, and be taken directly to the agenda, but not everyone in the system will be able to do that it this just may be a list or a view only for your drafters and approvers so up over here the meetings tab we, you may have already seen a brief introduction into the meetings here but this is where we are going to create our new single meetings so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so  and a recurring meeting as a demonstration for this session.  And then we've already talked about the items tab  and how to create a new meeting or new agenda item.  So from here, I'm going to take a quick sip of water.  And I don't see that there's any questions or comments in the chat window yet.  But just I know we've had a few people join since we first started the presentation.  So don't worry, we've got everything recorded and you'll get a copy of the recording.  And everyone is muted, but please just send a question or comment  through the chat box throughout the session.  Okay, so now we're moving on to the process for creating a new meeting date in your PEAK system.  So one of the primary responsibilities as an agenda coordinator,  it is fairly simple for the most part.  There are two different ways to create a new meeting calendar date in the system.  If you are already viewing them,  you can click on the new meeting tab with the calendar.  Then you can simply click add new meeting.  Or you can click create new and click meeting here.  Either way, if you're already in the meetings tab,  it's one less click to just click here, which is what I'm going to do now.  So I'm going to add a new meeting and then we'll see it populate here in the calendar.  And then also in the details here.  And then we'll go over a few more pieces of information about this screen.  So when you add a new meeting,  here's,  the screen that is going to list the fields that you'll need to populate.  Now, for the most part,  once you choose which meeting body that you're creating a meeting date for,  all of the information below here will populate automatically.  And so you can see here,  we have the two different options,  a one-time meeting or a recurring meeting.  So I'm going to click here so you can see there's a little bit different pieces of information required.  Of course,  if we create a recurring meeting,  I'm going to start with the one-time meeting.  And I'm going to come over here and select my individual meeting body.  So I'll select the bicycle and public path commission.  So once I selected this meeting body,  you noticed all of the information down here automatically filled in.  And this is based on information that was programmed in administration when this meeting body was created.  So I'll definitely be referencing that a little bit further down the road.  But you can edit the meeting location if you want.  And you can change which meeting type you want to use if needed.  So now the meeting type,  this is an important when it comes to determining which agenda you're using and specifically the agenda format.  So the different sections that are going to be included on your agenda and the order that they're going to be populated in the meeting agenda,  that is specifically the meeting type.  So for example,  you might have meeting bodies that have used several different meeting types or have several different types of agendas.  For example,  if I select the city council,  meeting body,  the regular meeting type is the default because that's of course most common.  But if I come into different types of selection,  our city council may have a specific agenda for budget meetings or joint workshops or special meetings.  And specifying that here just means it's going to pull in a different type of agenda.  So different agenda sections and maybe a different agenda order.  So I'm going to go back to my bicycle commission here.  And I'm going to go back to my bicycle commission.  And pick a meeting date.  We'll have this one on Valentine's Day.  And then the start time,  6 p.m.  This was automatically populated in the system when this meeting body was created.  But the system automatically adds one hour of end time here.  So for those of you who are streaming this,  it does become important that we would like for you to change the end time so that it is more of a realistic meeting length.  For those of you who are not streaming,  you wouldn't necessarily need to enter that information.  For the streamers,  this is just telling your encoder how long it's going to be recording the meeting for.  And you can always stop the recording prior to this meeting length and you can extend it.  But we would like to give a realistic meeting length.  And again, that's just for people who are streaming their live meeting.  Other than that, the end time has no impact on anything in the system.  And in fact, no one else will even see it.  No one in the public.  They're not going to know what time we think this meeting is going to end.  Only this system.  So it's not going to start.  Time will ever be available to the public.  So down below this,  you have an option to add an item submission deadline and cutoff time.  You can enter this information now while you are creating this meeting calendar date,  or you could go back in to the details of the meeting at any time leading up to processing the agenda and add in this date and information.  So basically, if this meeting is on the 14th,  maybe I want everything to be turned in.  Or maybe I want it to start in the evening.  by the week before, and I can enter that specific time. So what happens if you enter this information?  When your drafters are creating a new item, if this submission deadline date and cutoff time  has passed, the drafter will not be able to choose this date for their item meeting date. So it won't  even be listed as an option in the system if that occurs. So that's how this process works. And again,  you can enter that information now, or you can go back and enter it later. And then below this,  the description field, you may or may not be utilizing this with your reports on your system,  but this allows you to add additional information that you might want to be included on your agenda  report, such as if you have Zoom meeting information you'd like to get out, if you would like to  list any of your office members, or if you just wanted to give a specific notice or note about  this particular meeting.  So that's how you can enter that information now, or you can go back and enter it later.  And then down below here under advanced settings, there is one very important key piece of information  that does need to be entered here when you are creating the meeting calendar date.  And that's the last item here, the views. So this is where we're telling the system,  what view page are we going to display this meeting calendar date for the public? So if the public  wants to know where's the bicycle and public path commission meeting, it's going to know to look on  the past events or media manager will publish that on that specific view page. There are a couple  other pieces of information above this that are important to know about most of these media options  do pertain to streaming if you're using that so you may be getting more information about these  settings a little bit later on, but as it pertains to in general, all agenda coordinators who use the  system, some specific areas to notice this usually usually usually usually usually usually usually  checkbox that says show on upcoming events. So it's checked by default, but really that just  means that it is going to show it as an upcoming event on this view page. And then down below here,  the archive folder, this is telling the system on the view page, what folder are we going to put the  past meeting information? So when we publish the minutes information for this meeting, where do we  want those to land or what folder do we want them to be on? So if I toggle up here to my past events  page, that checkbox says it's okay to list this meeting on an upcoming event. And then down here,  it says it's going to place everything in the parks and recreations board. This is the past  or prior meeting content. So the public will come here to find the minutes is basically what that's  saying. So I'm going to toggle back here into my view page and click on create here. And that's  going to save this meeting calendar date into the system.  And sorry, I had an error here. Let me go in real quick. So let's review since I had an error in my  date didn't get saved. Sorry about that. I'm going to create a new public and bicycle path commission  meeting. I want to use that this default meeting type, that's fine. I was making this for the 14th.  And then I'll come down here to advanced settings. And I'm going to bring in my date. So I'm going to  place this on my past events view page, and I'll click Create.  So now you can see in my meetings calendar, it's added  this to the calendar. Now the color scheme that is used used  for each of these meeting bodies is defined in administration  when we create this new meeting body. So if you've got favorite  colors, and you weren't available in creating those, I'll  let you know where they can be set in administration. So here's  our calendar date here. And if I come back out up to my view  page, and refresh, you'll see that it's going to show here's  the meeting calendar date that we just entered. Now that common  mistake that I mentioned here, where if you don't select that  view page, if you forget to pick that option under advanced  settings, this meeting would have not displayed on the view  page. So if you create a new meeting, and it's determined  that  no one can see it on the page, I'm going to come over here to  this meeting we created within the summary category, you can  always go back into the details and edit all of that information  you just created. So I clicked on details here, come down to  advanced settings. So again, this is that piece of information  sometimes people forget to select. So if your meeting does  not show up on your view page, double check this. And then  remember, we mentioned you can always come back in and add a  submission deadline or cutoff time. And you can do that here  as well.  So I'm going to click the back tab, just go back into my  meetings folder. So we've created this bicycle and public  path commission meeting. And then in the summary tab over  here on the left, we can always go back in at any time and click  the details to edit any of the information that we've set up  for this particular calendar date. And I'm just going to use  my browser back arrow to go back into the meetings tab. Now you  may want to set a recurring meeting. As you can see, I've  got some listed in my calendar here, like my  city council is recurring. I'm going to come up here to the top  and filter my meetings just to kind of clean up what you're  looking at here for a moment. So I'm just going to look at city  council meetings. And you can see these are actually set up  recurring for the first and third Wednesday of every month.  And if I come in over here on the left and go into the  details, we can review the details of the specific  occurrence. So if you're looking at the current calendar, you can  see that I've got a list of the events that I've pulled up,  which this happens to be in April, or I can also pull up the  details about the entire series. So here's where you can see that  information looks for the most part the same, but we've had to  add in that this is going to repeat monthly on the first and  third Wednesday. So I'm going to back arrow here and go back into  my calendar. And then I'll do one other example of creating a  new meeting. We'll just real quick set up a recurring meeting.  Again, you can click Add new meeting. And then you can see that  it's going to bring us to the same template to create a new  meeting. And I'm going to click here on recurring. So for  recurring meeting, I'll select a different meeting body. So we'll  do our finance committee. So you can see I selected the finance  committee meeting it populated with their location and their  meeting type. Again, the meeting type is the agenda format and  order.  And then we can see that we have a lot of different meetings  for this meeting body. And then here's where we determine how  many often we're going to repeat. So we've got the option  to repeat daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly. It is most common to  set up a monthly meeting. And then you're going to choose which  day of the week. And if it's the first, second, third, fourth, or  fifth, of course, so we can say every fourth Friday. So this is  usually usually usually usually usually usually usually usually  usually usually usually usually usually usually usually  usually usually usually usually usually usually  usually usually usually usually usually  usually usually usually usually do our start date here on the 25th. Now, the most common question that we get asked about setting up a recurring meeting is this field that I've selected here, the end date. And a lot of times  usually usually usually  usually  usually  usually  usually  usually  usually  And none of us will be around whenever they stop doing it.  But it is a required field.  So we do have to come up with some sort of date into the future.  And how far into the future you want to make it is up to you.  So really, I'm just going to change the year, you know, 10 years down the road.  I mean, I don't know if you'd want to put it 100 years down the road.  But basically, we're just setting this out.  And if we all still work here after 10 years, we'll have to come in and edit this information.  Or someone else will have to eventually.  But when it comes to the end date, it is a required field.  No one is going to see it but us in the system.  But you do just need to come up with a date that is quite a ways into the future, as I did here.  So let me know if you have any questions about that, entering the end date.  And then for a recurring meeting, we still are going to need to put  enter an accurate meeting length if you are using the Granicus streaming solution.  And again, if you're not streaming, you can just keep that as one hour.  Same process as before, you can add a description.  And then also in the advanced settings, we do want to make sure that we're going to show this on upcoming events.  Determine which archive folder these meetings will be saved in.  And then which view page you want it to be saved as well.  And then I'm going to come over here and click create.  And you'll see that our calendar is going to populate with this particular meeting on the fourth Friday of every month.  So I'm going to click create.  come up here and filter out my finance committee meeting. Oh, there was already one scheduled.  So here's where we started our new occurrence. Sorry, this one was already scheduled. I missed it.  Oh, did I do two? Okay. I'm going to click this one.  Oh, yeah, we've got someone else, meet me to it, setting a recurring meeting in our system. Sorry,  I hope that wasn't too confusing for everyone. I'm going to go back to my meetings tab.  So these fourth Fridays of each month, these are the ones that we just configured.  Perfect. Okay, so we've gone through the process for adding a new single occurrence.  Meeting, we put this one on the 14th, and then we went through the process of adding  a recurring meeting on this one here. Does anyone have any questions on that?  Those options? Please let me know. I'll take a quick pause and  check the chat box, and then we'll move on to our agenda.  Okay, perfect. I don't see any questions so far. So we're moving on to the next part of our  training here where we are going to begin processing our agenda. So I'm going to go  back to my dashboard. So there are three different ways that you can access an agenda in PEAK once  you're ready to view that information or even begin processing it. So the first way is right  here from the dashboard. You can just simply click on that particular meeting tile, and you will be  taken directly to the dashboard. So if you're going to go back to your dashboard, you can just click  into the agenda. The other ways, and there are two other ways, are through the meetings tab. So  I'm going to click here on the meetings tab, and we can find our meeting here in the calendar and  just click on it specific in the calendar date. Here we are again, the same agenda we were just  looking at. And then the third way that you can access your agenda, there's another way. So I'm  just back here in the meetings tab again. In the summary column here on the left, we can go to  that specific meeting.  You have to have a nombre so that says the title of the meeting so that says the title of the meeting so  that says the title of the meeting so that says the title of the meeting so that says the title of the  meeting so that says the title of the meeting so that says the title of the meeting so that says the  title of the meeting so that says the title of the meeting so that says the title of the meeting so  system knew what all of these sections to populate when it pulled up the agenda.  And at this time, I am going to take a moment just to toggle over into the admin section to  reference a couple of things that were created in administration as it relates to your meeting  bodies and this agenda. So I'm going to click on admin up here. So again, some of you may or may  not have administration. But here in this first section, meetings, here's where all of your  meeting bodies were created in the system. And here's our city council meeting. So we are working  on an agenda for the city council. And if I come up here to the top, my bicycle, where's my bicycle  board? Here's the one that we created earlier. So I'm going to click edit here. So this is the  information that automatically populated when we created the meeting bodies. So I'm going to  create our bicycle and public path commission. So the default meeting type, that location or that  address that pulled in and the meeting time. And then if I scroll down here to the bottom,  you can see here's where that color scheme is selected. So it's kind of hard to tell, but this  teal color, it's outlined in white. And that's what's indicating the color for this particular  meeting body. So that's how all that information got added into the system when we were creating  a calendar date. It was pulling from this  calendar date. So we're going to click edit. And then we're going to click edit. And then we're  going to click so that the title of the meeting body looks like a nombre so that it looks like  a nombre so that it looks like a nombre so that it looks like a nombre so that it looks like  a nombre so that it looks like a nombre so that it looks like a edit here, this is where you can see how all of those sections were configured and the order they were configured. So you can always edit this agenda information as you are processing your agenda,  edit this agenda information as you are processing your agenda, of course. If you find that you are  constantly editing the same information, then you could come into the administration section of PEAK  and edit that meeting type. And as you can see over here, you've got the different editing  capabilities. So these will all be the same options that we're going to talk about coming  up in just a moment when we edit our agenda. But just know if you are in administration,  these are permanent changes to all additional agendas for this meeting type. But if you're  working in an agenda to process on a one-on-one basis, then those changes that you make are only  to that specific meeting, of course. I do want to point out that when this agenda is created,  there was a numbering scheme selected. So there are quite a few different numbering schemes to  choose from. So those would have been selected also when this meeting type was created. But  there is a numbering scheme selected for each of the agendas that you make. So if you're working  in an agenda to process on a one-on-one basis, then those changes would have been selected also  an option to manually number your items. So I'll point that out as well, just in case  there are not any numbering schemes here that maybe are to your liking, you will always have  the option to manually number those as well. So again, we came into administration and under the  meeting section, meeting bodies, this is where all of your individual meeting bodies were created  and that information that auto-populates when you create a new meeting pulls from. And then  meeting types, this is where your different agendas are created. So if you're working in an  agenda, you can edit that information on those different sections. So I'm going to go back into  my meeting. So I'm just going to go back into this agenda through the dashboard and just click on the  city council tile here. So we've determined that this name here is the name of the meeting type  that is utilizing and how the system determined which agenda sections to populate here.  Here's that option that I was mentioning about agenda numbering. So you can see  my system is automatically using this number scheme. I'm going to open up this.  You can see how it's choosing to use alphabetical sub-numbering. But again,  you can always turn it off and then you'll have the access to edit this information within here.  You do have a toolbar over here on the left. So we'll be going through these options as we're  editing the information.  This information one-on-one, I do want to point out the meeting details.  Once we've got this agenda open, if we're ready to process it and we determined that we wanted  to add in that item submission deadline, if we haven't already, we can click right here into the  meeting details. I'll say yes. And remember the meeting details is always where you can  enter that information. So we could add in the submission deadline and cut off at this time if  we needed to. So you would just enter that information and then save it.  You have to have a background so that it looks good so that it looks good to the user so that  it looks good to the user so that it looks good to the user so that it looks good to the user so  that it looks good to the user so that it looks good to the user so that it looks good to the user so  that it looks good to the user so that it looks good to the user so that it looks good to the user so  that it looks good to the user so that it looks good to the user so that it looks good to the user so  agenda as well. And then as I scroll down through here, we'll see the rest of our items, or you can  see obviously there's no items in some of these sections. So I always like to start off by expanding  everything and giving it a quick scroll through, because what we're going to be doing next, I'm  going to close all these sections, is we're basically going to be addressing two different  aspects. One, we want to make sure that all of these agenda sections that we need are listed,  or determine if maybe we might want to remove some or rearrange the order. And then we're going  to address all of the items that are within each of these sections. So I'm going to open up the,  this particular section. So we can add new items to this agenda, we can remove items here,  we can also rearrange the order. And also it is recommended that we get all of them  under the approved status. You can see we've got a few that are still in review. So we'll walk  through the steps of what we're going to do next. And then we're going to go ahead and  see what we need to do next. And then we're going to go ahead and see what we need to do next. And  what would you do if you've got, you're getting ready to process an agenda, but you've still got  some items in review. So let's, let's address these agenda sections first. So over here on the  right, if you're not familiar with already, we have these three different editing symbols are  located throughout the peak system whenever you're editing or processing. So pencil is your edit,  the four point arrows is your drag and drop or move around, and then you've got your trash can  and the bottom arrow is your drag and drop. So you can edit any of this information. So for  example, on my invocation and Pledge of Allegiance, if I wanted to edit and add some additional text,  I can do that here. So once I've entered that, I'll click Save. Now the system does not automatically  save.  So once you're making changes, you do want to frequently be coming down to the lower right and  clicking the Save button. So if I expand here, you can see I've added in my text. In addition,  we can also move around. So I'm going to use the four point arrow here to move my Pledge of  Allegiance just up one location. And then as I move down here, there may be some sections that  you want to delete. So we don't have any presentations for the city manager. So I can  always click the trash can and delete this section if I'd like. Now, it does,  permanently delete that section from just this specific agenda that we're working on.  Notice that the system did automatically renumber everything. So it is still going to keep our  numbers in order. But we can always add back in that section or add in a new section if we'd like.  So you would utilize the Add Section button over here in the toolbar if you needed to do that. So  I'm going to click on Add Section. And let's say that we deleted the presentation section,  but now it determines that we do have some presentations.  That need to go on the agenda. So now we need to get it back. So basically,  you are just adding it back in from scratch.  Um, so you're basically type that information from here. There's no way to pull up a list of the names  of all of the other agenda sections. So, um, but again, we can always just add back in that information.  I'm just gonna come down here and save it. And then it's going to add this section to the very bottom of  my list.  And then I can drag and move it up to wherever I want.  I would like it to be.  So notice there's not a number, um, because I always forget this and you might forget it too if when you're just starting.  So I'm going to go back and click edit. There's a check box here, the very bottom left.  If you want the system to automatically number this section, it does have to be checked.  So I'll go back and check that box and save it and you'll see it's going to make this item number 12.  And then I can use the four point arrow to drag and move this up to the specific section where I would like it to be.  So when it comes to your agenda sections, the system is going to automatically load a default template type based on the settings and administration.  And you always have the option to edit any of the text within that section using the pencil.  So here's where we've got information that is already populated.  You can potentially edit that and then you can move the items around or the agenda sections around it or also delete.  Now when it comes to your individual agenda items, we really have, for the most part, the same editing capabilities.  So I'm going to pull up my approval of consent agenda and review these items.  So if there were an item that I wanted to remove from this agenda, I could simply just click the X here and that would take it off of this agenda.  It doesn't remove it from the system.  It just takes it out of this agenda date.  I can also edit these item boxes.  edit information on this specific item. So I'm going to  click the Edit button here. And this is opening this specific  item and allows us to view the information or unlock it and  make some edits. So I have permissions to unlock it. So I  can come in and maybe make an edit to the title, maybe I want  to come down and upload an additional document, I can make  any of those changes. And then from the toolbar here, I can  simply click View agenda. And this will take me right back  into the edit the agenda that I was editing. So we're right back  into here. I can also rearrange the order of these items. So if  I want the second one here to be listed first, I just use the  four point arrows to move them around, you can only move the  items around within a section. So for example, if I wanted this  item to actually  be under the resolution section, the four point arrow is not going  to allow me to drag it outside here, it's only going to allow me  to drag it within the section. So if I wanted this particular  item to be in a different section, I would just use the  the Edit field to open the item and change that. So I'm going to  I'm going to click Edit again. So I've opened up this item. And  then if I come down to the agenda section category, I'll  just click in here  and choose the section that I want this to be part of. Again, you  can have an item on more in more than one section on your agenda,  however, most people don't. So I'm just going to delete that  other section and make this resolutions. So I'll come down  here and save. And then I'll use my View agenda button here to go  right back into my agenda. And then you'll see that now we've  added that we have two items under resolutions now. So you can  move items around with the item.  so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so  going to take another quick break and see if there are any  messages or if anyone has any comments. So let me know if you  have any questions about processing the agenda sections  or the agenda information. And then we'll move forward with  addressing those items that are not an approval status.  Okay, excellent. So so far, so good. Don't see any questions  yet. So we'll move on. So at this point, I'm going to expand  my sections and just look through here and make sure  everything is so this one is approved. That one is good. But  down here under my approval of the consent, we do have one  that's still in review. Now the peak system will allow you to  move forward and publish this agenda. If you have items that  are not in the approved status, so any items in review, or maybe  still in draft status,  you can move forward and publish this agenda. If you have items  that are not in the approved status, you can move forward and  there's nothing that's going to stop you from publishing them  on the agenda. But as a best practice, we definitely want  these to be in the approved status within your system. So if  you have items that you need to get in the approved status,  there's a few different things that you can do during this  process. So number one, if you still have time before you're  processing the agenda, you can simply come down and click on  this envelope here. And that sends an email alert to the  current approvers listed here.  Just as a reminder that this item is waiting for their approval.  So that's one quick way you could do it. Or I'm going to click the  edit button of this specific item and open this information up.  You can also move into the approval status. And then within  this phase, so here you can see here are the two users where we  would send a notification. If you're in here, you can also  click this envelope button that sends a notification the same  way. So you can either click that, or you can click this button  down here, and then you can see that this item has been  item, you can do that from editing the item under the  approval status, or within the agenda itself. Either way, just  the people in that phase will get a reminder email. Another  thing that you can do is utilize the item discussion. So if  you're not familiar with the item discussion, we talked about  it a lot during the drafting and approver session. This is a  dialogue box that is only, can only be viewed or seen by peak  users, so the public will never see it. And then if you want to  see any of this information, but it's a tool that allows you to  communicate with each other about an item all contained within  the system. But if anyone were to add a comment in the  discussion, it does send out an email notification to the  drafter of this item, and also to any current or previous  approvers. So in this section, I could just add a note in the  item discussion field or a comment. And then that would  send an email notification of a little bit more information. So  if you want to see any of this information, you can do that in  detail to everyone in this current phase, and also any  previous approvers, and the drafter as well. So everyone is  kind of kept in the loop. So so once I click comment, it's added  to the list here. But now an email notification has been sent  to all of the applicable people who need to help us out in this  process for getting this item moved through through approvals.  So now if you aren't successful in getting all of these people to  approve this item before you need to, you do have the option  of just simply changing the item date. So I can come over here  into item details, and scroll down and put this onto a  different meeting date. So if I change this to my next city  council meeting,  which is coming up here on the 16th,  so that says the temperature temperature temperature temperature I'm going to keep this one on the second for now. And then there's a couple other things you can do in regards to the workflow. Oh, excuse me, I missed an agenda section.  temperature temperature temperature temperature temperature temperature temperature  temperature temperature temperature temperature temperature temperature temperature temperature temperature temperature temperature temperature temperature  temperature temperature temperature temperature temperature temperature temperature temperature temperature temperature temperature temperature temperature temperature temperature temperature  temperature temperature temperature temperature temperature temperature temperature temperature temperature temperature temperature temperature temperature temperature temperature temperature temperature temperature temperature temperature temperature temperature temperature temperature temperature  temperature temperature temperature temperature temperature temperature temperature temperature temperature temperature temperature temperature temperature temperature temperature temperature  I'm going to scroll back up to the approval status workflow for this item.  So we're still trying to figure out how we can get this item in the approval status to place onto our agenda.  So there's a couple other things you can do with this workflow itself if you don't necessarily have to have these people approve it.  One is you can skip the workflow, which means you skip this phase altogether and move it down to the next person,  or you could restart the workflow, and restart it just cancels this entire sequence altogether,  but basically anything that happened up to this point will be removed so in this example, I'm going to click skip workflow,  and that's going to skip this current phase, which we're waiting on, and move it down immediately to the last phase  and this is a  This is a  actually work in this situation because this is just FYI. And  so in peak, we have two different types of approvers, we  have regular approvers, as indicated here, where they have  a checkbox above their icon, that's their an approver who can  edit and also take action to approve or delegate the item.  And then you have an FYI approver that's indicated with  the eye above their icon. And that means that this approver is  not going to be editing or even taking action to approve the  item, they're just getting a notification that the item  exists. So I'm going to click skip workflow approval here. And  then you'll see how this information has moved down to  the last user. So now we're on the current. And then if I look  at again, now we are approved. So I basically just utilize that  skip, skip approval, which skipped through the phases until  I got to the proof. So it kept intact anything that occurred  after that, it just indicates that they've were skipped over so  I'm going to go back into my agenda so I'm just going to use  my view agenda shortcut. And now we have all three of these  consent items approved. And I have a couple other items here  under resolution that I just want to check so I have one  more that needs to be approved so I'm going to demonstrate on  this example, or you could just restart the intersection so that  entire workflow. But just to review the options that you  have, if you need have an item in review or draft that you want  set to the approval status before you publish this agenda.  Number one, you can send a reminder to the current  approvers. Just by clicking on the envelope here. You can also  click the pencil icon and then open this item, go into the  approval status tab and click on the envelope reminder here. You  can also add and start a comment in the item discussion  that will email all current and previous approvers as well as the  drafter. You could change the meeting date. So under item  details, we could scroll down and put this on a different  meeting. And then that gives our approvers a little bit more time  for that to go through the workflow. And then the last  couple things as it applies to this workflow, we can use this  skip option. So if there had been any approval  samples prior, that information will be saved. And we can skip  everyone below or the example that I'm going to show you here  now is restart. So restart means I'm canceling this entire  workflow. I'll confirm. So there is no indication that one was  ever started, it put my item back in draft. But now I have the  option over here to set this as approved. I can click it there  and just put it in approved. So that's the last way that you can  manage that.  So I'm going to go ahead and go back into my agenda. So I'm just  going to scroll back up to the top, expand all of my sections  and scroll through here to see how everything looks. So I did  add some text information.  Everything is approved.  And at this point, we're ready to run a draft of this  agenda.  So we can see what it's going to look like before we produce it to  the public.  One other thing I want to mention to you about agenda items, over here  in the toolbar, we talked about how you can add a section, I almost  forgot to tell you that you can add an agenda item, which is another  option over here. So if there is an item that needs to be on this  agenda, that has not already been populated, there's a couple  different ways that you can add. Clicking this button is going to  display any items that are available to be used. And then if you want to  have a nombre so that says agenda item, so that says a nombre so  that says a nombre so that says a nombre so that says a nombre so  nombre so that says a nombre so that says a nombre so that says a  nombre so that says a nombre so that says a  nombre so that says a  nombre so that says a what section you're going to add it to, and then I'll do add selected, it's going to add it into my agenda, into this location. And again, I can always delete it if I decide I don't want it,  I don't want it. I'm just going to click remove agenda item and it removed it from there.  If you have an item that has not been created yet, you would want to just come up here to the  top and click create new agenda item. Go through the process just like you normally would, like any  drafter would. As soon as you've completed or created that item, of course you'll select  this meeting and this date and then it will automatically be added into your agenda in  in that specific agenda section. You can add items by using this button if they already exist  in the system or you can create a brand new item by clicking create agenda item and it will  automatically be added to that section. Let me click save. Now we are ready to run a draft of this  particular agenda. The process for running a draft is going to be over here in the  toolbar so it's usually usually a quick quick quick quick quick quick quick quick quick quick and then if it looks good, we'll move on to publishing right below here. So you can download your agenda in three different formats, Microsoft Word, PDF, or HTML. Word and PDF are the most  quick quick quick quick quick quick quick quick quick quick quick quick  quick quick quick quick quick quick quick quick quick quick quick quick quick  produce this information. And then I clicked it down here. So  I'll click on this. So if you're following along, and if you've  maybe perhaps created an agenda in your system, of course,  you're just going to look a little bit different. So at this  point, if you create your agenda, and you have any changes  that you would like to make to the agendas in your system, such  as placement of information, or numbering or anything like that,  the process, you can make that request. And we can adjust that  within the reports in your system, we would just ask that  you mark up this PDF document or this document, and add in the  information that you would like to be included, and then send  that marked up version over to your project manager. And  they'll make sure that we get that report designed to your  liking specifically. So as you can see, my report is designed  to, here's my numbered agenda sections. With each agenda item,  if there is an  agenda item, if there is an agenda item, if there is an  attachment, this is a blue, this is a hyperlink. So I could  click on this information, and it will open that attachment.  Close that there. Sorry, I lost my screen. And then once we've  gone through and reviewed our agenda, made sure everything  looks okay, I'm just gonna pop this up again for you to look  at. Once we've gone through and reviewed that everything here  looks okay. If you are publishing an agenda packet,  then we'll want to run a draft of the packet next. So I'm going  to toggle back over into PEAK, and I'm going to highlight  agenda packet. And then down here, you can see we have two  options for the public and for council. So this description  here is very important. So if when we run our agenda packet  for the public, that's not going to include those attachments  that are marked confidential. So when drafters are creating  items, they do have the ability when they upload an attachment,  to make it not available to the public. So this is just a  disclaimer that if one is marked as that way, this packet will not  include that. And then when you do the council, of course, that  will include all items, excuse me, and attachments. And then  the cover page, this checkbox just means that there'll be a  cover page at the beginning of each item outlining the  information. So you'll have a cover page for your item, you  might consider this a staff report, or maybe a cover memo,  or maybe a cover letter. So you'll have a cover page that  that's what I'm going to refer to that as something different.  But that'll be included. And then all of the attachments will  come after this cover page. So I'm going to run a packet that  the public is going to see because of course, that's what  I'm mainly concerned with the public, I'm going to add the  cover pages. And then I'll click here generate packet. So this may  take several seconds depending on how big your packets might be  or what, how many attachments that you may have. So the system  is going to kind of be giving you an update here in this purple  text, what's happening. So several seconds to a couple  minutes might be involved in this. But it's once it creates  this information, we'll be able to open it and scroll through  and see all of those specific pages.  So now you can see our agenda packet is ready to download. So I'm  going to click the download button. So starting off with here's the  agenda. This is the first part of our agenda packet that we just  reviewed. And here's our first cover page, or you may call it a  staff report. And then below this is going to be each of our  attachments. So this is indicating there's one attachment for this  item.  And then this next report is indicating we have two attachments.  And then of course, those attachments will be below.  So once we've reviewed, once we've downloaded and reviewed a draft  of our agenda, and our agenda packet, now we can move forward with  publishing the information.  So at this point, I'm going to move on to publish. And this is where  you're going to choose that whether you want to publish to the  iLegislate application,  and  to the web, or one or the other. But most of the time, you're always  going to select both. And then if you remember the iLegislate,  that's the application that your office members are going to use to  view the published agenda through that specific application. And  then the web is of course, through your view page that the  public sees. So we'll publish both the agenda and the agenda  packet. We're publishing to the past events view page. So I'm  going to click here on publish PDF.  so  so  so  so  so  so  so  so  so  so  so  so  so  so  so  so  so  so  so  so  information is public. So here's our city council meeting. Here's the agenda. And here's the link  to the agenda packet. So the public will just simply click on that link. It will open a new  tab in their browser. And that's how they'll be able to view the agenda that you've published.  So close that screen and come back to here. I'm going to go back into peak real quick.  So just to review those steps. So when you're ready to publish your agenda, you'll always start  with downloading a draft of the agenda and the agenda packet first. In any of these formats that  you're choosing, PDF is going to be most common. The system will not allow you to publish your  agenda or your agenda packet unless you have downloaded a draft first. So if we need to revise  anything, which we're going to talk about next, and you've got the information revised, you always  want to make sure that you download and view a copy of the agenda and agenda packet first.  And then move on to your publishing steps, of course. Otherwise, the system will not allow you  to do that. So I'm just going to pause real quick and see if there are any questions. This is a  quiet group today. We haven't had any questions from anyone since we started. So I'm just going  to pause again to see if there's any questions about downloading or publishing your agenda.  And then we need to talk a little bit about what happens if you've got all of this done,  and now you want to unpublish it, or now you need to revise the information that you  sent out. So that's a great way to do that. So I'm just going to pause real quick and see if there are  any questions. Otherwise, I'm just going to pause again to see if there are any questions. So I'm just going to  to the public. So we're going to be going over that information next.  Okay, perfect. Well, there are no other questions at this time. So now I want to talk about once we  have gone through all these steps, what happens? And ideally, we would be done with our agenda,  and we could move on. But what happens if we have all of this done? And then we need to  have a quick reflection of the development of the development of the development of the  development of the development of the  development of the development of the development of the development of the development of the  development of the development of the development of the development of the development of the  development of the development of the development of the development of the development of the that is when you would want to change the meeting status in your peak system to final. So I'm just changing that over here and I'm going to save it. Now that didn't affect anything that we published to your view page, but what it does is allow all the users in peak to know that your meeting is  is allow all the users in Peak to know that your meeting is final. So I'm just going to back up  here a quick second over to my dashboard. And you can see now anyone who logs into Vue on their  dashboard, they'll see that this particular meeting agenda is final. So changing that menu is really  just this indicator here for everyone in Peak. And if I go to the minutes tab down here, you can  see now my agenda is final. And I also now have access to my minutes as well. So once we've  published the agenda, the system is going to give us a link now to the minutes. And then once we  change the status, that's the indicator here of final. Okay, perfect. So I'm going to go back into  my meeting, back into my city council meeting. So I'm going to just  go back in through this link agenda. So now we got our meeting status set to final. Now there  is one other thing. So let's just say, for example, we need to make an edit to this. Maybe we need to  add an item or remove an item. From this point, you would basically edit the agenda just like we  just did. You can remove a section. So maybe let's say we determine, let's just remove the  presentation section, because this is the meeting agenda. And then we can just add an item or remove  a page so that the page looks like a page with a title so that the page looks like a page with a  title so that the page looks like a page with a title so that the page looks like a page with a  title so that the page looks like a page with a title so that the page looks like a page with a  title so that the page looks like a page with a title so that the page looks like a page with a title  so that the page looks like a page with a title so that the page looks like a page with a title so that  the page looks like a page with a title so that the page looks like a page with a title so that the page looks like a  page with a title so that the page looks like a page with a title so that the page looks like a page with a title so that  I removed it. Sorry, I thought I didn't save it.  So notice down here, I removed it, but I didn't save. So that's why it still showed up.  And now let me go back and download a PDF version of this agenda and review it.  Okay, so now we've got our section removed, or again, if we would have added any items,  they would display here. And then we'll just do the exact same process. We'll come down to  publish the information. We'll select both locations, iLegislate and the web, and then  we'll just click publish PDF again. And that sends out the new version.  The revised version, so I know some people call it different amended version or revised versions,  and then that's what will be displayed on our view page. So I'm going to come back here and refresh.  And when I click my agenda now, this will be the one that doesn't have the presentations.  But now one thing that we might need to consider is, do we need to let the public know that this  is a revised agenda? Because nowhere on here does it say that it was revised. And also nowhere on  here does it say that it was revised. So I'm going to click on the revised version. And then  here does it say that it is revised. So if you're wanting to let the public know that you have made  changes to the original agenda, there's a couple options that you can do. So one option is in peak  in the meeting, you could utilize the meeting details in that description field. So I'm opening  up the meeting details. Remember, this is where the information filled in when we created this.  And we could just type in a description.  And then save it.  And what that will do, I'm going to go back into this agenda.  You wanted to see how it would look.  It adds that information to the top of the first page  on the agenda. So if you'd like to utilize that description field there, you can see so my system is  programmed to put that description in red on the top of the page.  This is one way to add a description. So if you want to add a description, you can do that by clicking on the top of the page.  You have to have a nombre so that it says so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so  system and then we want to go from Peak back into the Media Manager site.  So if you remember, if I want to go back to the Media Manager Granicus platform, I'm utilizing  the apps menu here.  So we're in Peak.  I'm going to go up to the Granicus platform and then I'm going to come over here to the  events tab and pull up this particular meeting.  So here's the meeting we've been working on.  I'm just going to click on the name of it and it's going to open the edit event information  and here next to the name, I can add revised agenda.  It remembers what I've done before, so it adds it in there.  So adding in that description and then saving these changes will update that information  on the view page.  So I'm going to open my view page here again and refresh and then you can see it changed  the text here.  So again, if you publish an agenda, but then you  need to revise the information, you will, let me go back here.  You would have to toggle back into your, if you would like to, the label.  If you want to change this label, that is done within your Media Manager site.  You would find the event under the events tab and then when you click on the name and  open it again, it's naming here and then you would save those changes.  So that's how we can edit.  With the public sees on the view page.  And then if I go back into my PEAK system, so I'm just going to toggle from the Granicus  platform back into PEAK again.  The other way that we kind of helps the public notify that this agenda had been revised,  I'll click on this meeting again and we utilize the meeting details.  So in the description field, we added that information here.  Now, if you wanted to, I'm going to back.  Go back into that agenda.  If you wanted to completely unpublish everything that's out on the view page.  So let's say we've got all of this information here and now we just wanted to remove it and  start over or we're not ready for the public to see it yet.  There is a quick and easy way that you can just unpublish that information.  So here in our publish button, we can simply click unpublish from all views and that's going to remove that information and then you can just  come back to this category and publish it again when you're ready.  So that's how you can unpublish or of course revise it and then publish it again.  Let's see, still no questions.  You guys are so quiet today.  Questions or comments or thumbs up or fun emojis.  Anything to let me know you're alive out there would be great.  So, oh, thanks, Dina.  You're excellent.  I appreciate it.  And happy Valentine's Day.  That was great.  That's a good one for this month.  Okay, perfect.  So at this point, I want to review a couple things of what we've covered today.  So one other thing we might want to do once we're done with this processing this agenda is lock it up here under editing.  So you probably only have a few users who are going to have permissions to work on these.  Agendas, but it is a best practice to lock it so that when any if anyone in the system comes back in, they will definitely know that what they're doing is making a change because they'll have to unlock it first, make the changes.  And then, of course, you might lock it again.  So that's when you might want to utilize this button here.  So I'm going to back up to the dashboard, do a quick review, and then we do have some extra time.  So I wanted to also open up the I legislate app and give some of you if you haven't had the opportunity to see that.  Also, so that way, so that way, so that way, so that way so that way so that way so that way so that way so that way so that way so that way so that way so that way so that way so that way so that way so that way so that way so that way so that way so that way so that way so that way so that way so that way so that way so that way so that way so that way so that way so that way so that way so that way so that way so that way so that way so that way so that way so that way so that way so that way so that way so that way so that way so that way so that way so that way so that way so that way so that way so that way so that way so that way so that way so that way so that way so that way so that way so that way so that way so that way so that way so that way so that way so that way so that way so that way so that way so that way so that way so that way so that way  to the dashboard, the four upcoming meetings can be viewed here and then we can either scroll left  or right. And as agenda coordinators, we are the people who are creating these dates that are  available for everyone to view when they come onto their dashboard or in the meetings tab.  And we are also changing this status to final as we're processing our agenda.  So we went into the meetings tab and we added a new meeting. So we clicked here on add new meeting,  selected our meeting body. We automatically, from the information that filled in automatically,  we did specify a certain meeting type if need be. And then also extended our end time for those  people who are using the Granicus streaming solution. The description field here, this is  what we used at the end when we added that revised agenda description. And then also remember advanced  settings. Everyone has to add a view page if you want to.  The public to be able to see this meeting calendar date. So we created a one time meeting  and a recurring meeting. So remember the recurring meeting. You do have to indicate how often this is  going to repeat and which specific days on the calendar they will repeat. Cancel from here.  So we went through the meetings tab and added a new meeting, a single occurrence and a recurring.  And then we accessed our agenda for the February  2 City Council meeting. And this is where we began processing the information. So we  expanded all these sections and scrolled through and determined if we wanted to add a section or  delete a section. We used the four-point arrows to rearrange the order of these sections.  And then we used the pencil icon to edit where we added in some additional text or maybe wanted to  edit the name of the section. And then when it came to our items, we had all the sections in the  same editing capabilities. So we could have deleted or removed an  item, we could have utilized the Add item shortcut over here, or  we could have created a brand new item to be added to this  agenda. And then you can move around the items by using the  four point arrow, but only within that specific section.  And if you wanted to move an item out of one section and into  another section, that's when you would use the Edit button. So we  were also using the Edit button as we were addressing each  individual item on our agenda, because we want to try to get  everything under the approved status, even though that doesn't  really affect anything in the system, or prohibit us from  publishing, we just always want to do that as a best practice.  So I'm going to click Edit here just to review again, the things  that potentially we may have wanted to change. So from here,  we could change the meeting date if we wanted to, and then save  it, that will place this item on another agenda.  We could have gone under the approval status tab and managed  this workflow, even maybe restarted it or skipped a workflow.  We could have also clicked on the envelope and sent an email  notification to the current approvers. And then we could have  also utilized the item discussion field over here. And remember  anytime someone in the system joins the conversation and submits  their comment, the drafter of the item gets an email along with  any current item.  Also, so that the otherлизлизлизлизлизлизлизлизлизлизлизлиз лизлизлизлизлизлизлизлизлизлизлизлизлизлиз лизлизлизлизлизлизлизлизлизлизлиз лизлизлизлизлизлиз лизлизлизлизлизлиз лизлизлизлизлиз [inaudible] лизлиз  of our agenda of our in our agenda packet. And then we move  down to publish that information to iLegislate and the web.  Clicked here. And then we talked about how if you wanted to  unpublish the information after you send it out, you would just  click this button here. And if you needed to revise any  information, you would simply edit the agenda, and then  potentially change the description in the meeting  details.  And then also potentially rename the information that's labeled  on the view page.  Some of you may also have this last option here send this is a  free feature to all of our Granicus clients when you're  processing or publishing your agendas, you can send a  notification to your constituents. So they will be  able to sign up for that through your view page. And then during  your agenda publishing process, you would simply click here, and  then  start.  send and it would notify all of those subscribers by email. I'm going to click up to the view page  here just to show you how they would subscribe as an example here. So this is similar to what  it would look like if you are using SendAgenda. And if you aren't familiar with it but would like  to, please ask your project manager about it. It would be an option included in your solution.  But basically on your view page, we would give your constituents the option to enter their email  address and then sign up for email updates with subscriber preferences. So anyone who's  entered or submitted their email address here, when you are publishing your agenda, you'll have  this button send and you'll be able to send out an email to all of them. And there'll be a link  to the agenda that they can click on and directly access that information. So this envelope here,  send, is using the SendAgenda feature that featured Granicus Solution. And if you  are not familiar with it or you would like to participate, again, please let your project  manager know. And then one other thing just to review, if you remember, we changed the text that  was listed here on your view page so that the public would know that we revised the agenda.  And remember, we had to do that within your media manager site. So we had to leave peak to make that  change. So I'm going to come up here to apps and go back to Granicus platform.  We had to go into the events and click on the name to change it.  So one last thing that I would like to show you before we wrap up today is the iLegislate  application since we have some extra time. So I'll minimize here. So this application  is available to download on our Granicus support site. Or if you Google  iLegislate application, it will bring you directly there. So it is available to download  for Windows desktop versions, which is what I'm going to be showing you here. Also, if your iPad  users or your office members are iPad users, they can go to the Apple, the App Store and just type  in iLegislate and download the app from there for their iPad. So once you have this application  downloaded, then your media manager administrators will have,  created a login for your office members and your trainer will help you determine how you want to get them access to those logins and how to set those up in media manager. So that information comes in a different training session one on one with your trainer.  So I'm just going to log in here real quick, just so you can see what it will look like.  So the domain is going to be your media manager site. So I'm going to which for me is Granicusuniversity.granicus.com.  And then I'll enter my URL.  username and password. So again, your office members will be given  their I legislate username and password from their media  manager administrator. And so here, once we're logged in, you  can see the upcoming the so these are all published agendas  from my peak site. So here's the agenda that we just did. And  then I can I do have the option to scroll back and look at  previous meetings. But as it pertains to this meeting that we  just published, when we selected published to I legislate in our  publishing process, that's what sent this meeting out to this  application and made it available to anyone on your  domain that has access to I legislate or log into I  legislate. And I'm just going to click on this to view it. So  here is all of the information that we just went through or  that we've published. And so this application now allows your  office members to go through  and review the agenda, view any specific items and attachments  related to it, there is always going to be one attachment  because your cover page is considered an attachment. They  can also add bookmarks to this particular item or make a note  and save it. And then if you add a bookmark or a note, then it  filters them and stores them.  And then it also filters them over here under the notes and  bookmarks areas. So it'll just keep track of all of the items  that they made notes for or all of the items that they made  bookmarks for. So it kind of helps them when they're  preparing for the meeting, to have this tool to view the  agendas. So again, but the landing page when you log in is  going to be the agenda and I just clicked on this particular  meeting. And this is what it looks like in the desktop  application for your office members to review this  information.  Does any if anyone has questions about this application, I'll just  pause for a moment to see if there's any information I can give  you about this.  I'm going to send  there's a link I just sent through the chat box, it gives  you information about the that send agenda feature that I was  speaking about earlier, if you'd like information about that. So  that link went through the chat.  window. And  at this point, I am going to sign out of I legislate since I  don't see there are any questions.  I'll sign out here. And then I'll just bring up my media  manager and go back into peak. Just one other quick moment so  we can, we'll end on the dashboard.  so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so  you who are going to be processing your minutes in PEAK. I look forward to working with you tomorrow  again at this same time. And at this point, I am going to stop sharing my screen. And I'll go ahead  and end the meeting. So again, I thank everyone for your time and attention today. And enjoy your  PEAK systems. Have a great rest of your day.  Thank you.
