Let'  s go back to  roll call.  council member  bennett?  here.  council member morgan?  here.  council member  tandon?  here.  council member van overbeck?  here.  council member winslow?  here.  vice mayor reynolds?  here.  mayor coolidge?  present.  now we'  ll go to our closed session  announcement from city attorney  john lamb.  thank you Mr.  earlier this evening the city  council recessed in closed  session.  all council members were  present.  with respect to the closed  session agenda item 2.1 was not  discussed.  it was taken off prior to the  closed session.  items 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, city  council was briefed, direction  was provided, no final action  was taken.  that concludes my report.  all right.  thank you very much.  I know we have some high school  students joining us here.  hi brody.  we'  ll just want to thank them for  attending.  and then we'  ll start with the  presentation from pioneer  community energy.  we have don eckert.  or eric epsom.  I'  ll go ahead and start  and introduce our reps from  pioneer community energy.  just real quickly I wanted to  intro to segue into the  presentation.  as council knows ironically  five years ago today on october  1, 2019 council adopted an  ordinance authorizing the  implementation of community  choice aggregation here in chico.  and we have a couple of  choice aggregation and then we  quickly at the november 5, 2019  meeting approved a resolution to  join the jpa that formed butte  choice energy that'  s between us, butte  county and the city of orville.  once that was approved staff  quickly worked to start up butte  choice energy, initiated an  implementation plan and turned  that plan into the cpuc and also  filed it with the independent  grid operator cal isc.  unfortunately quickly in 2020  market conditions changed as you  know and start up of cca became  very unfavorable.  those conditions remain today.  the main reasons are the high  cost of energy, the resource  adequacy high cost which is  basically an insurance plan you  have to purchase so much energy  above your peak load,  prepurchase it and have that so  you make sure you meet the  resource requirements and then  also the high cost of financing  a cca start up are still very  unfavorable.  due to the continued rate  increases from pg&e we'  re starting to look at  other options and those options  are now to potentially join a  neighboring cca.  we looked at pioneer community  energy, their financials are  great, they have a fantastic  track record and they continue  to offer a savings when compared  to the investor owned utility and  service to the community.  we have a lot of opportunities  we have a lot of opportunities  with that I would like to bring  up gina stassi vanicore and  lisa dalabi from pioneer  community energy to give a brief  presentation.  we will go from there and here  it is.  thanks eric we appreciate  staff'  s help in getting us here  today.  good afternoon mayor coolidge  and council.  and I will go ahead and fast  thank you.  I wanted to highlight a few  benefits about choosing pioneer  and what makes us unique.  first off pioneer is a community  choice aggregator or cca.  we purchase electricity on  behalf of residents and  businesses in place of investor  owned utilities such as pg&e.  and you still get a pg&e bill  but pioneer basically buys the  electricity.  pg&e still owns the transmission  and lines.  cca's were born out of the  energy crisis in the early 2000s.  the first cca launched in 2010.  today there is 25 cca's serving  200 communities and 14 million  customers.  one of the ways that pioneer  stands out we serve inland  communities with similar  priorities like customer  savings, customer service and  economic development.  we are committed to rate payer  savings.  we have seen a significant  we have saved our customers  since 2018 over $85 million.  we are projecting another 24  million this year.  pioneer is a joint powers  authority.  a not for profit public agency  with a board of directors  comprised of only elected  officials from the communities  that we serve.  so if chico decides to move  forward they would have a  board member at the table.  and it is no weighted voting so  you would have one vote.  pioneer also creates lots of  opportunities to support  biomass which is something that  we advocate for.  and local power purchase  agreements.  so just a few on the slide you  will see el dorado irrigation  district.  we have worked with them on a  10-year $37 million contract.  also pcwa placer county water  we have worked with them on $10  million in contracts.  so our board is committed to  reinvesting in the communities  that we serve and looking at  power purchase agreements and  the local communities because  it creates economic development  and creates jobs.  I wanted to highlight our  current service area for  pioneer we serve placer county  and el dorado county.  we also serve auburn colfax  lincoln lumis placerville  rockland we added grass valley  and nevada city in january.  this slide highlights more of  pioneer's benefits to citizens  but again one of the things we  offer is a cost savings.  we provide a cost savings over  what pg&e charges for  electricity.  and I have already mentioned  we have saved $85 million and  we are planning another $24  million in 2024.  our customers are our  shareholders.  we are a not for profit so we  are not paying back our  shareholders.  and if you join pioneer again  you would have a seat at the  table with like-minded  communities.  and also we offer local  programs.  we have a community action  and it saves customers money.  we have put over $2 million into  local community programs and we  have a community action  committee, advisory committee  who selects the programs in our  communities.  so we have had hvac rebates  where customers can receive $75.  we have other local programs  where residents save money if  they lower their energy and we  that and we can track that.  we also have a proven track  record.  we have an a minus credit rating  from s&p global that we are very  proud of.  those are just a few of the key  benefits that we offer.  so how did we get here?  to recap our discussions began  in spring 2024 when we started  talking with chico, butte county,  oreville and the town of paradise  about expanding possibly.  and then all four jurisdictions  agreed to jointly commission an  impact assessment study to  determine a couple of things.  first we had to determine if the  expansion made financial sense  for all parties.  our board has made it clear they  don't want to subsidize new  incoming members.  pioneer must also have the ability  to serve the increased load.  so those were the two key factors.  so in the summer the impact  assessment study was conducted  and we just received the results.  we shared those results september  19th with our board of directors.  and i'm glad and proud to say that  our pioneer board made recommendations  to move forward based on the study  findings.  and i'm here to present with my boss  the director of communications gina  stassi vanikor.  so there is growing interest in  coming together with like-minded  communities.  we have a total of ten cities and  counties that are looking to join  pioneer including nevada county,  sutter county, tuolumne county,  yuba city, sonoma county, and  sonoma county.  there are eight cities in the  there are eight cities in the  country.  there are eight cities in the  country.  there are eight cities in the  country.  there are eight cities in the  there are eight cities in the  country.  there are eight cities in the  country.  there are eight cities in the  do we have the power supply resources? So essentially with this expansion effort,  Pioneer would be going from 200,000 meters to 400,000 meters or 2 million megawatt hours to  4 million megawatt hours. So I wanted to detail some of Chico's customer data that we were able  to glean from this study. Chico has a total of 49,800 accounts with 43,600 residential accounts  and 5,600 commercial industrial accounts and 538 streetlight accounts using over 429,000  megawatt hours annually. The expansion to the city of Chico represents approximately a 24%  increase to Pioneer retail sales. If you added Chico, Butte County, Oroville, Paradise,  it would represent an increase of 55% to Pioneer's customers.  So I  will at this time turn it over to Gina Stassi-Vanacore, Director of Communications,  to really detail the assessment study in a lot more detail. Thank you.  Thank you, Lisa. Good evening, Mayor Coolidge and members of the council. Thank you so much  for having us here tonight. We are really pleased to be here and talk about the impact assessment  study and more specifically the path forward for the budget budget budget budget budget budget  the city of chicago.  The study examined two  consecutive years of data, years  22 and 23.  I would like to thank city staff  for helping us get the data from  pg&e.  The data was used to track  customer usage in all rate  classes over a two-year period  of time taking into account  things like weather conditions  or other events that could  impact the city.  determine the impact of  pg&e on grid conditions.  The other thing that we did is  we projected the revenues from  our current rates.  Our current savings are 7%  lower than pg&e's.  There have been times when our  savings have been much higher  and we do believe that in the  next few years pg&e will  continue to raise its rates so  we did take a very conservative  approach in constructing the  survey.  The other thing we looked at  was power supply.  There are three primary  components of power supply.  One is energy which is the  electrons that we purchase and  put on the grid.  The energy market right now is  favorable which is indicated by  the green arrow and that is  largely due to the lowering of  gas prices.  Gas prices now are lower than  they were before the pandemic  hit and that is easing some of  the price pressure in the  market.  The other thing we took a good  look at is renewable energy  which is exactly what it is.  It is the different forms of  renewable energy.  In years past, markets have been  really tight.  While they still are somewhat  constrained, they are better now  than they have been.  We are starting to see some of  those bottlenecks open up.  Projects are coming online.  We are seeing interconnection  permits being approved.  That is the renewable energy  market while still a bit  constrained is much better than  what we have seen in the last  couple of years.  The big challenge that was  identified in the study is that  of resource adequacy.  Resource adequacy or RA is a  regulatory mechanism.  It is required by the CPUC and  basically it is designed to keep  the lights on when the grid is  really low.  The other thing is that the !  The !  The !  The !  The !  The !  The !  The !  The !  The !  The! margin, we do come out ahead. That's really important to our board because as Lisa mentioned, one of our board's priorities is  The!  The!  The!  The!  The!  The!  The!  The!  The!  The!  The!  The!  The!  The!  The!  launch which is what we would  have hoped for is not feasible  the numbers do not pencil out.  What we would propose should the  city want to join pioneer is an  October 2027 launch and the  reason for that is it helps  avoid the very costly summer  months when prices are high and  renewables and r.a. are the  most expensive and the supply  is very constricted.  One of the things the other  questions that we needed to  answer through the study is does  pioneer have the resources to be  able to purchase all of the  energy that we need.  We have recently issued an r.f.  p.  We are getting more information  back to figure out what our  resource availability is.  We are very optimistic that we  can make an October 2027 launch  and we are looking at the  The one question that is  outstanding that we are hoping  our r.f.p. will answer is  whether we can launch everyone  all at once or whether we need  a phased in approach.  As Lisa mentioned we are looking  at several different territories  when we are talking about a  phased in approach it would not  be one territory versus another  territory it would be perhaps  residential customers launch  and commercial.  We are looking at that.  We hope to have information back  on that soon and we do owe  information back to our own  board about what we find.  Based on the results of the  impact assessment study we did  take it to our board.  We shared the results with our  board on September 20th.  This is March 9th.  This is March 9th.  This is March 9th.  This is March 9th.  This is March 9th.  This is March 9th.  This is March 9th.  This is March 9th.  This is March 9th.  This is March 9th.  This is March 9th.  see if an October 2027 launch changes their interest in joining Pioneer.  That's part of why we're talking to you here tonight.  Our plan is to go back to our board in December with findings and feedback, and then we are  hoping to come back to see you again in January to determine whether or not this launch is  feasible.  Assuming that we move forward, here's an overview of the timeline.  We here we are in October.  We are sharing the results of the study with you during the next two months.  Pioneer staff will be doing its due diligence to ensure that we do have the power resources,  and if so, what the phase and schedule would be.  We plan to go back to our board and share our findings with them, and that would begin  that would formally begin the expansion process.  We would come back in January.  If there is a plan we would plan for the plan.  If there is a plan we would plan for the plan.  If there is a plan we would plan for the plan.  If there is a plan we would plan for the plan.  If there is a plan we would plan for the plan.  If there is a plan we would plan for the plan.  If there is a plan we would plan for the plan.  If there is a plan we would plan for the plan.  If there is a plan we would plan for the plan.  If there is a plan we would plan for the plan.  the city of chico and the  The other option would be to  wait until the end of 2025 that  is not our preference because we  do believe and the numbers bear  out the sooner we can begin  purchasing power the better the  savings would be for chico  customers.  There is one consideration that  is unique to this area and that !  Is that chico the city of chico  currently is a member of butte  choice energy.  We are very sensitive to that  fact and respectful of that fact  we did check with our  regulatory attorney who told us  that the city cannot  concurrently be a member of two  jpas or two ccas so this also  allows the city some time to  sort out how it terminates its  membership in butte choice and  then can vote to approve joining  pioneer.  We do have several slides as  information but in terms of the  expansion that concludes the  information and if you have any  questions I would be more than  happy to answer them.  questions from council?  thank you very much.  you have one?  go for it.  a simple one.  the solar system and that type  of rooftop usage does that have  any impact whatsoever?  it does not.  pioneer currently has 42,000  solar customers if you are a  solar customer with pg&e and you  come over to pioneer everything  just rolls right on over we are  indifferent to whether you are  on nm1 net energy metering one  two or three which are different  variations whatever plan you are  I think the question is if you  are a net consumer of pioneer we  pay a half cent premium or if you  are a net generator we pay a  half cent premium more than pg&e  if you are a net consumer you  realize the same savings that  pioneer has to offer.  thank you.  you'r welcome.  I would have a lot of  questions to ask and I hope to  speak on other occasions more  than our allotted time allows.  expanding and where do you see  the frontier could we develop  the whole north state in one  community choice aggregate would  that be a desirable outcome?  community choice aggregates  work cooperatively we tend not  to compete against each other  pioneer is unique among the ccas  because of our focus.  if you were to look at the map  prioritizing more on rural areas  inland areas.  the other thing is our priorities  are a little different.  for pioneer we prioritize rate  payer savings and community  reinvestment over all else.  that makes it really important  for us to expand only with  like-minded communities.  the other thing that makes  pioneer a little different than  other ccas.  we prioritize biomass and we  so a lot of our reinvestment  efforts go into helping we  don'  t necessarily fund the plants  but we are an off taker and  we'  re highly supportive of  biomass and that does make us  a bit different from almost  every other cca.  just one follow-up on  that.  we here in butte county have  particular issues with our  investor-owned utility some of  them has to do with fire and  issues with that.  I think the local power purchase  agreements are good there.  other questions in terms of  expansion we have some public  transmission lines running through  chico the anderson roseville line  do you ever make any effort to  take more of the grid off of pg  and e and expand the public power  under the cca?  the lines and poles they'  re not for sale.  I don'  t know that that would be in  our interest to get into getting  transmission and distribution  because we really do focus on  generation.  thank you.  council member ben overbeck.  thanks for coming.  thank you.  what'  s the risk to the city if  your revenue projections fall short?  are we on the hook for anything?  if you are on your general fund  was funding the impact assessment  study it'  s really important to  remember what pioneer offers to  your customers to your citizens is  a choice.  if they choose to stay with pg and  e they can if they want to come  over to pioneer they can but there  is no impact on your general fund  by joining the cca.  I will move on to the consent agenda.  all matters listed on the consent agenda  are considered routine in nature and  therefore can be enacted in one motion.  any speakers?  none.  council's qualifications it'  s a pretty simple one.  entertain a motion.  so moved.  second.  motion by the council member ben  overbeck second by vice mayor roems.  when you'  re ready.  sorry.  council member bennett.  yes.  council member morgan.  yes.  council member tandon.  yes.  council member van overbeck.  yes.  council member winslow.  yes.  vice mayor reynolds.  aye.  mayor coolidge.  aye.  listed already on the agenda and  within the jurisdiction's authority.  council cannot take any action at  the meeting on the request made under  the section of the agenda.  how many speakers?  ten.  I will call the first two  speakers and if you can line up in  the aisle that would be helpful.  estelle pan followed by steven hazel.  .  we want to make sure the next  session is a little bit  one at a time.  .  can you hear me council?  .  I've been here years ago as a  young teenager recruiting into the  military and diversion of what you  have for your economics of the  development of no height of fuel.  .  the distance of it, I have a  problem when I was a child.  .  It was the mansion that you have here in Butte County on Esplanade Memorial Way that went into my name as owner.  I've been gone for 55 years, 55 years total, and I'd like to return home.  I returned home only because of major injuries to my left side of my leg.  I'm okay.  I have breathing medicine because of difficulty because I might die, and they have not configured with me for what reasons.  You know, that what's inhale or exhale of what, you know, if it's exhaust from work or if it's just natural clouds.  So I'm returning home.  I'm asking permission if somebody has knowledge of the old court records.  My childhood of the title so that I may return home with permission without being exerted off.  In the unconditional way of the law side, including by the state law of the makers that actually had notified financial backing was from my name.  And with an account that derived from a pinto bean company that went into my name.  As I...  I don't know what...  As a child, what state, city of the country that I've earned my legal title rights of business into a pinto bean company include Rosaritas of the like the spicy jalapenos.  It took a counselor to actually accept this business, and it went worldly from foreign countries to here, but to the state of California.  Ma'am.  Yeah.  This really item.  I think it's really important within our jurisdiction.  If you have something particular the city of chico.  Yes, it's right here in chico.  It doesn't matter that's necessarily in chico.  We may not be able to deal with it.  You won't be able to do what?  The acceptance of being authorized having to be returned home without being interrupted because of the fuel that you guys are using.  An interpretation of the fuel of what caused this big fire out here.  On the state official.  When it went into court, I was being employed out there fighting with the people.  Then what you guys are fighting for the fire of the abbreviation.  I got called and I was told that my home got burned.  So, meanwhile, what a lot of people are homeless outside.  Most people have respectively sent in their application for the home owners.  Ma'am, we only do three minutes per person.  Well, this is doing the figures.  Your time is up.  The figures of the fire.  If you continue to talk, we will stop the meeting and have you removed.  You can stop the meeting now that I'm here.  I've recorded everything.  Ma'am, your time has expired.  You're welcome.  Thank you.  You may end.  Your time has expired.  So is yours.  You're disrupting the meeting.  I'm not disrupting.  Sergeant at arms, we're going to take a short recess.  Please address the issue.  You should have said that the first.  That's your first amendment right.  This podium is for people addressing the city on city issues.  So we'll take a few minutes, get everybody back in here and then resume.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry. [inaudible]  This part 2.  This part 2.  This part 2.  This part 2.  This part 2.  This part 2.  This part 2. [inaudible]  This part 2.  This part 2.  All right.  Next speaker, please.  Stephen Hazel.  I'm lucky I'm walking right now because I got pointed by the FBI because if you see something, say something, better watch out what you say.  He said, oh, I'll show you jurisdiction.  How about what's going on here?  Man, don't look at me.  I was spoken in the middle.  What's going on out there?  Look at you as a result.  Actually, that little bench you put around, you just brought him close to you.  That could be that skating rink.  It's not going to make any money.  I mean, so I'm not supposed to talk about what.  You see, I'm in that.  I come in and what you're controlling speech.  It is within jurisdiction, especially if they say a little joke made about the towers.  Well, he's at about 9-11, about 131 May.  Did you know you just gave the location of some of them?  But you didn't make that.  That was about 131.  It's OK.  We're not doing this again.  This is your third meeting where you're done.  I spent 14 months in the Jesus Center.  I spent 14 months in Torre Shelter.  I figured out Torre Shelter.  I spent 14 months.  You don't want to say it.  You lied about the availability so you can enforce.  It's a lie.  I spent 14 months.  I was handicapped.  I'm the only one with a single bed.  Believe me.  I spent through joy, through Taylor's story.  I know everything.  If you want to find out all the fraud that was going on, I will tell you the fraud that was going on.  This guy committed a felony.  The only person is at Winslow.  He's the only one off.  The last meeting, I found out it's you.  Why'd you cut my microphone off?  Did you?  OK.  Because what happened was we saw you.  You had to get the last word.  You violated his right to point an order.  He made the point.  You won.  You said, oh, it's the state.  State.  But you don't have the solution no matter what.  Of course it's the state's problem.  But you know what to do with the people.  You know what I have a billion dollars I'm going to give you guys?  I told you.  I am God.  I'm God.  And how come the government acknowledges it?  They do.  I was on a secret witness program.  Sir.  I was.  And it went bad.  We're not talking about.  All right.  It's true.  We're going to stop him right there.  I'm talking about Torre Shelter.  The arms.  We have to stop him.  We have someone disrupting the meeting.  Please excuse him from the meeting.  Thank you very much.  All right.  Next speaker, please.  Bud Caldwell.  All right.  We're going to take a short recess while he's exited.  We will stay here for a second.  Yeah.  Just for a minute.  Okay.  Next speaker.  Bud Caldwell followed by Virginia Lee Gimbel.  I do.  I do.  I do.  I do.  I do.  I do.  I do.  I do.  I do.  I do.  I do.  I do. Turn the volume on, I'm on.  I do.  I want to talk about roundabouts.  I'm a little afraid.  Does everybody know what a roundabout is?  Well, there's a lot of grant money out for roundabouts now.  And there's a lot of people who want to put two pounds of stuff in a 20-pound bag.  20 pounds of stuff in a 20-pound bag.  Okay. Roundabouts, if they're too small, are very dangerous.  A good roundabout, a large roundabout, is the safest way to control traffic.  It's really simple.  Built correctly, they're the safest traffic interchange known.  If built incorrectly, they're also...  the most dangerous traffic interchange known to man.  Normally, if a driver's going through a roundabout trying to negotiate it,  if he moves too fast, which is...  if you go to a roundabout that's too small, you will go too fast.  And that's when you will impact another vehicle.  One way or another.  And for the city of Chico, they're not really worried about that.  I'm really worried about it.  Because it's my insurance that's paying for it.  But if you guys are responsible for making a roundabout too small,  you don't have any dog in the fight.  There's just a couple of us that do.  And the last two guys have retired from my company, and we keep people for life.  We try to.  But they both said, hey, bud, we don't want to do this anymore.  When I retire, I want to be done.  Please don't call me back.  So it's really sad.  We can't get commercial drivers anymore.  Nobody wants to spend the money and the time to get the qualifications they need  to get the new California license.  But anyway, the Department of Pennsylvania State Police  says that a commercial driver risks his career on one trip through a roundabout.  Like I say, it's the safest way to move traffic if it's done correctly.  But if it's $100,000 more to buy that piece of land that you need  to make it 125 feet,  that's a lot of money.  As opposed to 65 feet.  The city doesn't want to do it.  I want to do it.  So I hope you'll consider that.  Both myself and a large number of large truck operators  want to make people aware that small roundabouts are dangerous.  When you get in those things,  I'm done.  I'm good.  Thank you.  Yep.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Virginia Lee Gimbal followed by Barbara Chang.  .  Thank you for this part.  All I wanted to say is I was here on the 20th.  and you were talking about nutrition.  I don't remember if I signed up for nutrition  before you said anything and it was already in place,  but you were implementing it then,  so it was like, whatever.  They had started or I had offered,  but I signed up for it.  I took the class.  I'm over the class,  and she's moved on to another area.  So I wanted to say...  Ma'am.  Yes?  Yeah, but I think you might be in the wrong place.  Why?  Because we don't offer nutrition classes here.  Oh, I know.  She said I have three minutes to speak tonight.  If you want me to send in my comments,  I can send it in and you can see me in eight minutes.  You have to speak on issues relative to the city of Chico.  Oh, well, thank you, because she did say that,  and then she said come anyway.  I'm not sure who that was.  Pardon me?  I'm not sure who that was,  but you have to speak on issues relative to the city.  You're welcome to continue your time.  It was Mia.  It was Mia.  Mia in the health department.  Yeah, we are not the health department.  I know.  You mentioned it on the 20th.  I don't believe we did.  And we're talking about the art boxes on the 20th.  We did.  And I have the minutes of the 20th.  All right, ma'am.  Just continue your time, please.  Pardon me?  You have a minute and 35 seconds left.  Have at it.  Okay.  I heard about the art boxes.  Thank you.  The nutrition is what I signed up for.  Thank you.  And I am the person who is up there on that screen.  Virginia Lee Gimbel.  And thank you.  I lived in Paradise.  I lived there for eight years almost on one apartment.  I was very happy there with artwork because I am an artist,  I'm a writer, and I write poetry.  Would you like to hear something?  Yes.  I travel by air.  I enjoy the sea.  I bank on a drift and I springboard off away.  And when I come next time, I'll come empty so I can take home my memories.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Barbara Chang, followed by Samuel Barber.  This is my first ever city council meeting anywhere.  So, first of all, wow.  I would like to submit a summary, which I will write down and present to the city clerk.  I didn't have time to bring it with me today.  This is part of my journey. was kind enough to find me Jamie Hernandez, who said, oh, you make some compelling points, you should go to city council. So I looked when you were meeting up last night So I looked when you were meeting up last night and first Tuesday, whoops, that's tomorrow. So I don't have anything written, but I am here to ask the city of Chico to govern housing, specifically rental housing. I am new to Chico.  Chico. I came here, I arrived on June 13th. It took me about two months to find an apartment.  I interacted with CY Property Management, and I did find a unit managed by RSC Associate  Property Management. And I know you all do things a little differently here, which is fine,  but it's a little different from what I'm used to not being from Chico.  So basically what I did is I asked. I called Code Enforcement. I spoke with  Renee, your Intake Administrative Assistant there. I wanted to know who enforces tenant  protection act. The tenant protection act came into effect on January 1st, 2020.  It's almost been 5 years.  years.  Her answer to me is Chico enforcement  enforces health and safety.  Well, the issue that happened to me  was a couple of days after, well, soon after I moved in,  I was bitten by some kind of blood sucking biting insect.  Anyway, I had 19 bites.  And I've gone through, on my summary,  I will list who I called and what I've already  explored on my own.  Sorry, I'm not a speaker.  Anyway, my time is almost up.  So Chico has 56% of your residences are renters.  So over a nearly five year period, what happened to me,  probably happened to a majority of other renters.  And they spanned contract fraud, misrepresentation,  negligence, discrimination.  Discrimination, retaliation, intimidation.  I mean, these are all predatory.  There's a very notable pattern of predatory behavior  that basically is brazen in my time.  So you'll have it in writing.  Thank you.  Samuel Barber followed by Mike Johnson.  Hello.  I'm growing increasingly concerned  at the council's inability to properly question  our police department, particularly when  it comes to funding, staffing, and an excessive amount  of military equipment.  The police department has about 140 full time employees  and an additional 100 volunteers.  And it accounts for roughly half of the budget.  Sometimes I wonder if we're a city of trees  or a city of police.  I was talking to some public workers.  And was made aware we have three workers to maintenance  about 40,000 trees in the city.  Not only that, but not one of the workers I spoke to  earned enough to be a homeowner.  Meanwhile, on a few different occasions,  you've given the police a raise without them having to ask.  You gave them a 40,000 sign on bonus to laterals  from other departments.  That's about 2 thirds of the median income of most  of the citizens in Chico.  The most distressing part to me was when the police chief asked,  for this sign on bonus.  One of you indicated it wasn't your responsibility  to question the requests.  And only one of you actually asked any questions.  When you did ask the questions, the police chief  couldn't say if the sign on bonus would actually help  or not, which you give them the money anyway.  If only our council was as easy going with money  when it came to affordable housing,  taking care of our infrastructure,  paying our public workers living wages,  and funding meaningful solutions to the homeless problem.  But the police department was responsible  for the murder of Desmond Phillips in 2017,  a 25-year-old in the middle of a mental health crisis.  In my mind, the incident should have been a clear indication  that the force is inadequately trained  and not to be trusted with lethal weapons of any sort.  They shot Desmond a total of 10 times, firing 16 bullets total.  I worked with a Vietnam veteran who discussed with me  their protocol for being able to shoot back  at an opposing force in an active war zone.  What he told me was even if they were being fired at,  they had to wait a day, two days, three days,  for the higher up to give them permission.  So I'm wondering why our own police department  isn't held to the same standard  when firing at our very own citizens.  I was taking a look at the annual  military equipment use report,  and here's some of the things I found.  I won't go over all of them, there's a lot of it.  16 types of flying drones that range  from 300 to 14.7 thousand a unit.  Bearcat G2 armored vehicle in Chico, 216.  $18,000 for that one.  23 40 millimeter single shot launchers at 1,000 a unit.  71 Sionics SAR-15 patrol rifles, 71 rifles, 1.4 thousand a unit.  And a staggering 47,550 rounds of various munitions,  most of which are lethal.  I could go on, I've only got three minutes.  Instead of continuing to write blank checks  to an overly militarized and bloated police department,  please consider allocating more money and energy  to the actual betterment of this city.  Well, it's time.  Okay, thank you. Thank you.  Mike Johnson, followed by Lynn Haskell.  All right, good evening council members.  Thank you for having us tonight.  Very straightforward, we'll keep it on point.  My concern is what is the perceived lack of decorum  at times when referring to members of the public  that has been at least observed by me  over the last several sessions  and is currently going on for quite some time.  Understanding that you are the elected president,  you are the elected body.  I'm not here to scold,  but I was raised with the mindset  that if you have something nice to say, say it.  If you don't have anything nice to say, don't say it.  You as the elected members are expected  to have a higher degree of decorum  than sometimes the members of the public come up with.  We've seen people here that have clear mental health issues  and other issues going on.  I have personally observed this council  uttering epithets from the council,  microphones on or not,  saying such things as, oh, the crazies are out tonight,  or there's tonight's entertainment.  When someone's having a mental issue  or some other thing that brings them down,  you bring them to this podium,  okay, there's a problem to be had there to be shared,  and they're exported out and they're dealt with.  But we have a right to expect as the citizens of Chico  that our elected officials are going to take care  that you represent the way  that you should be conducting yourselves professionally.  I don't intend this to be a scold.  It's just a reminder that it's a disappointing thing to see  that when we have people here that are coming up  trying to address the council,  whether they're of the right mind or not,  it doesn't matter what their politics are.  It doesn't matter what they're saying.  As long as they're within the rules, so be it.  If they're not, of course you have to deal with that.  Please conduct yourselves  professionally with members of the public  when you're sitting on the dais.  With that, thank you.  Lynn Haskell, followed by Benson.  Good evening, and I'd like to talk about  street safety last Monday, not yesterday Monday,  the Monday before.  My daughter was riding a bike, going to swim classes  for my four-year-old grandson who was on the back.  And  they chose the safest route they could to cross Esplanade,  which was third and Esplanade.  A car came through, turned left onto them,  and destroyed the bike.  Thankfully, my daughter and my son, my grandson,  got away with road burn and soreness and bruises,  no fractures, that kind of thing.  I have seen so many things that have had my heart  leap out of my chest.  I've had a lot of bad experiences with drivers in town.  And I really am pleading with you to do something  about the safety in our streets.  As the gentleman said about roundabouts,  we need to be planning safer streets,  whether that means a campaign from the police department  of Safe September, where everybody talks about,  you know, not texting.  The driver was texting that hit my daughter.  And, um, and I don't expect the city council to do that.  I don't expect the city to do driver's ed to the city citizens.  You know?  But I do expect you to run safety campaigns,  and that the police are here as our protectors,  and to be writing tickets to those people  that are texting in their cars,  which I'd say 90% of the people in their cars  are on their phones.  And so we need to be doing an educational outreach  kind of program.  Billboards.  Police ticketing in areas.  And going after, um, educating the population  to be more safe on our streets.  And that includes in our neighborhoods,  where there's a lot of speeding.  Again, on Third Avenue.  Those cut-through avenues.  Um, you know, I have speed bumps on my road.  And, um, I don't know what it's gonna take,  but it takes a conversation  about how to make our streets safer.  And I'm hoping that you all  have that conversation.  Thank you.  Benson, followed by Gia Monticello.  Yes, good evening.  Um, the first time I'd like to speak to  is, um, from my perspective,  uh, there's two types of solar panels.  Those which can be recycled  and those which can't be recycled.  I would, uh, propose that the city council  could make an ordinance,  craft an ordinance,  um, which, uh, only allows  recyclable solar panels  in our, in our landfill.  Um, I've talked to the folks  on the second floor with this idea.  And they assured me they could craft  such an ordinance such that it would  mandate that only recyclable,  um, recyclable solar panels  could be used in homes in Chicum.  So I would invite you to ask the, uh,  your, uh, staff to look into this.  And, uh, second floor people are  very much being crafted,  so if the two can get together, that's fine.  The second item is a little bit more delicate.  Uh, just, uh, city council's, uh, behavior.  Uh, the council should not ridicule  people living with mental health issues.  A person with mental health issues  should not be ridiculed.  It further stigmatizes citizens  living with social issues.  Um, Trump has characterized  the people living with mental health issues  as being feared.  Ben, so if you could just stick to the city issues,  let's not mention national politics.  I'm talking about the issues.  Weren't you listening?  I'm talking, I'm addressing you on city council behavior.  I know, but we don't need to talk about national politics.  So, go ahead.  Well, all politics are local,  my dear, dear sir.  All politics are local.  Anyway, back to city council behavior.  Uh, shouldn't be cra- uh, ridiculed.  Uh, since Trump himself has characterized  that people living with mental his-  mental health issues are people to be feared,  instead of ridiculing the mentally ill,  you should be showing compassion and helping them.  That's, I like the way Mike Johnson  said you're a collective body.  When that person was characterized as entertainment,  some of you could have spoke up.  You, did you all agree that he should have been  that person who's entertainment?  Like, not just Mike Johnson,  Mike Johnson said, you're a collective body.  Nobody spoke up when that person was ridiculed.  All right, that's fine.  She was doing this.  And at the doors, at the door,  that's not condemned.  Thank you, I'm outta here.  All right, and in the future,  we don't wear political campaigning,  uh, material in council.  I'm addressing the city council on your behavior.  No, I know.  I'm saying your shirt is political.  Thank you.  Okay, anyway, um, next speaker.  Our final speaker is Gia Monticello.  Hi, everyone.  My name is Gia Monticello.  I am coming to you on behalf of the  Associated Students of Chico State.  First of all, I'd like to say thank you to all of you  for wearing your alumni gear.  We love to see you all here.  Um, and I also came because I would like to invite  the members of city council to the Moonlight Safety Stroll.  I know Mayor Coolidge and, uh,  Addison Winslow also went before.  So this year, our Moonlight Safety Walk will be on,  sorry, Moonlight Safety Stroll will be on October 29th  from 6 to 8 p.m.  It's a great event where we address safety issues  on campus and off campus.  Last year, we actually had, um, solved 60 items  from that Moonlight Safety Stroll that we did.  We had 102 labor items, and we have also sent 61 items  to the city of Chico, um, more specifically to Brandon.  And we would like to consider this partnership with y'all  and ensuring our safety for our students  as well as the people enjoying our campus.  If you have the opportunity to come,  I'd love to see you all there.  I will be there myself.  I brought little cards if any of you would like to get in contact with me,  and I'll just leave them somewhere nearby.  And, yeah, thank you very much.  You can leave those with the clerk.  That was a great event, too.  All right.  So, uh, with that, we'll move on to public hearings.  Item 4.1, Belmere SBA Dissolution  and Autumn Leaf Estate Subdivision.  Uh, we have, um,  a report from Mike Solley.  Yes, there he is.  Welcome.  .  Thank you, Mary Coolidge, and good evening, everyone.  and Council Members.  Tonight we have two, um, distinct items  that are interrelated in this first Item 4.1,  and that's the Belmere S- Special Planning Area Dissolution  and the Autumn Leaf Estates Subdivision.  My presentation will go over these four bullet points,  first talking about the General Plan Amendment  and Rezone that affects the entire Special Planning Area
