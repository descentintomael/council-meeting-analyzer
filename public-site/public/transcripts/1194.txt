 All right, folks, we're going to get started.  All right, folks, we're going to get started here.  Welcome, everybody.  All right.  Thank you.  All right, we're going to call this meeting to order.  The adjourned regular city council meeting of October 15, 2024.  We'll start with an invocation from Chaplain Peter Hanson.  Welcome.  Shall we pray?  Almighty God, with our city's council, we meet to join our hopes and designs to meet our common needs.  Thank you.  We all want a good life.  We long for safer streets, happier homes, finer schools, and better citizens.  To achieve rewarding careers, enjoy family life, lovingly care for the elderly and infirm,  and lead lives that honor you while we honor each other.  Let your council seek a meeting of minds, agree on worthy aims,  share one vision, and hope for a bright future.  That by agreement in the ways and means we may achieve great things together.  Our best hopes are met only in you.  To walk paths of peace and respect with gracious words.  Patiently to seek and clearly discover steps for us.  And with one heart, begin again.  Amen.  Amen.  Amen.  Amen.  Amen.  Amen.  Amen.  Amen.  Amen.  Amen.  Amen.  Amen.  Amen.  Pledge of Allegiance.  All right, welcome everybody.  We are in mostly red and blue up here because it's the Almond Bowl this weekend, or Almond Bowl as you see fit to call it.  So we're here just in support of our local high schools and glad to lend that support.  All right, so we will start with the roll call.  Madam Clerk.  Okay.  Council Member Bennett.  Here.  Council Member Morgan.  Here.  Council Member Tandon.  Here.  Council Member Van Overbeck.  Here.  Council Member Winslow.  Here.  Vice Mayor Reynolds is absent.  Mayor Coolidge.  Present.  So, and on a note, on Vice Mayor Reynolds, she's actually doing civic duty down at the League of California Cities.  So, very good excuse for her to be gone from tonight's meeting.  So, all right, speaker card announcement.  Anyone wishing to address the council on any matters listed on the agenda should first complete a speaker card found at the back of the room.  Turn them into my left to your right over here to the city clerk, and then we'll take speakers in the order in which we receive the cards.  And once the first speaker begins, no additional cards will be given or accepted on that particular item.  So, a little extra that we're reading.  Persons demonstrating rude, boisterous speaking on matters outside the jurisdiction of the city or engaging in otherwise disruptive behavior will be called to order.  If such conduct continues, I call a recess.  We've done that in the past.  Requesting the removal of such persons from the council chambers.  Then we'd adjourn the meeting or take some other appropriate action.  So, with that, please note that.  For any speakers.  And then item 1.5 is closed session announcement.  City Attorney John Lamb.  Mr. Lamb.  Thank you, Mr. Mayor.  City Council.  Earlier this evening, the City Council recessed in closed session.  There was one item, item 2.1, conference with labor negotiators.  The City Council was briefed.  No final action was taken.  That concludes my report.  All right.  And the next is the Mayor's Achievement in the Arts Award.  I cannot take full credit for this because I didn't start them and I didn't name them.  So, the Mayor's side of it will just be a little bit.  But I do get to present them along with our Arts Commission.  So, I'm going to meet them down in front.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Welcome, everybody.  All right.  October is National Arts and Humanities Month.  For anyone who didn't know that.  Which is a collaborative recognition of the importance of all art and culture in America.  The city's month-long celebration objectives are to focus on access to the arts at a local level.  Increase the support of individual, organizational, and community participation in the arts.  And to raise awareness about the positive impact of the arts on the community.  And to raise awareness about the positive impact of the arts and the humanities in our community.  I would like to take this time to mention that the City of Chico has a number of art-related programs currently in place.  So, one is the City of Chico's Arts Grant Program, which was created to support Chico arts organizations and artists so they can make quality arts and cultural work, performances, exhibitions, etc.  And make them accessible to the members of the Chico community.  So, funding ranges from $2,000 to $5,000.  And to raise awareness about the arts and the community.  And information about this program, of course, can be found on the City's website.  In addition, the Arts Commission recently proposed a utility box art program.  Which I was very glad to see come to fruition.  Which we approved last month.  And the call for artists is currently underway and will close on December 18th.  So, if you know an artist, we would say submit for that.  We'd love to have you as part of it.  And artists are being asked to design artwork that will be printed on vinyl and installed.  on city-owned utility boxes located in our historic downtown area  and maybe in the future throughout the city.  And then, of course, these awards.  This is a yearly program where nominations are made by our arts commissioners,  joining me here to my right,  for artistic achievement as an outstanding organization or business,  outstanding artist or arts organization leader,  and then also patrons of the arts.  So I'm going to ask Chair Kimberly Rinala and the arts commissioners and  attendants to join me in giving out these awards,  and we're going to go through each of them.  And I think we'll start with our first one,  which is Chico Theater Company.  So I'm going to have to hold this up closer.  There we go.  Okay.  In recognition of Chico Theater Company's contributions to the artistic  community,  outstanding arts organization,  for over two decades,  the Chico Theater Company has been the cornerstone of Chico's vibrant art scene  under the visionary leadership of its founder, Mark Edson.  In dedication to providing outstanding theater experience has enriched our  cultural landscape and fostered a sense of belonging and pride within our  community.  The Chico Theater Company is renowned for its diverse and high-quality  productions,  ranging from captivating comedies and thought-provoking,  drama dramas,  to lightning musicals.  Each performance is a testament to the artistic talent and dedication of local actors and the crew members who come together to deliver this exceptional theater experiences.  So can we have the Chico Theater Company?  Come on in.  Thank you.  And I think we got some requests for photos.  So. Thank you very much and thank you to the city for all the support over the years, the grants that have been given to us and I enjoyed my years on the Chico Arts Council and thanks to Debbie especially she helped us get started 21 years ago with a lot of advice. Thank you to everyone and I appreciate this award very much. Well deserved.  All right.  So, Deborah, I'm not going to mess up your last name.  You don't have to.  Just Deborah.  Jordisma?  That was good.  Close.  Close.  So, my daughter actually answered.  Long ago.  Long ago.  When she was much littler.  So, in recognition of Deborah's artistic contributions to the community as an outstanding arts organization leader,  Deborah has been teaching and working at the Valley as a Valley studio director and teacher for the last 40 years.  That's amazing.  In this role, Deborah has served as an artistic and managing director for both Chico Community Ballet and Chico Creek Dance Center.  Her longevity as a dance instructor, her attention to excellence and detail in her artistic direction,  and her devotion to her students make her an asset to our community.  Deborah's ongoing.  perseverance to fulfill the collaborative mission of the dance school and pre-professional ballet company over the years is priceless.  We honor and thank her for her contributions to Chico's artistic and cultural development.  We'll do some pictures and then we'll hand you the microphone.  All right.  Oh, goodness.  First of all, I want to thank the city council for this and the Arts Commission for all the years that you have supported us through the grants.  It's been amazing.  Also, I enjoyed my time on the Arts Commission about a thousand years ago.  And I want to thank my support team that showed up today.  And the incredible Arts Commission.  And the community.  Mark, yeah, we all support each other.  And just, it takes a village to create all of this.  So I thank everybody that has, over those years, that's helped us. Thank you all. Last and certainly not least, David and Sherry Hopper in recognition for their contributions  And last but certainly not least, David and Cheri Hopper in recognition for their contributions to the artistic community as outstanding patrons of the arts.  David and Cheri Hopper's philanthropic work.  I knew that was going to get me.  Philanthropic work has aided local artists, galleries and educational institutions.  Not only does their business, Paradise Pictures, employ local graduates.  But David and Cheri are talented artists themselves.  I've heard that.  that. David was a founding member of Orient and Flume and now has his own studios. Sherry, a glass  and bead maker, has collaborated with others on public art pieces, one of which, Ascent, is on  permanent display on the exterior of Diamond Hotel, and if you haven't seen that, it's a beautiful  piece. She's a founding member of the International Society of Glass Beads and an expert on perfume  bottles, lecturing around the world on the subject. On behalf of myself and the City Council, we thank  David and Sherry.  Well, my friends realize they don't do... No one knows what's going to happen.  It's going to come out of this guy's mouth. But it's great to see so many people here in the arts,  and Sherry and I have been involved with the arts in Chico for 50 years.  We appreciate this recognition. It's not necessary, but we appreciate it, and the recognition, I think,  helps other people.  It's great to see so many great people come forward with support of the arts. And my good friend, Todd Hall, who's been on the Art Commission for years, he likes to put out the statistics of how much financial significance money is contributed to the Chico community through the arts.  I'll be real bold,  and I'll say,  that  for 50 years,  Sherry and I go to arts events,  and there are  a huge amount of people in Chico that I've never seen  at these art events.  And what I'd like to say is I'd like to see more of the 1%  show up at the art events.  You know, the artists support the artists,  and we need...  financial support.  We need more art in the offices,  waiting rooms,  and so,  buy local art and display it. We need more art in the offices, waiting rooms, and so buy local art and display it. Thank you very much, Chico. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, commissioners.  And as I make my way up here,  if you want to dash out the door, we will not be offended.  So...  It's always hard to find that right time to lead a  effectively council.  Thanks, everybody, for coming.  END END  END END  END END  Thank you.  Thank you.  Good thing we don't have security on the way out, just the way in.  Yeah, and that'll be a testament to how quickly and great our new security system is  that we got all those folks in here and out of here that quickly.  All right.  Give them another second here.  And then we will move on to the wonderful consent agenda.  All matters listed on the consent agenda are considered to be routine in nature  and therefore can be enacted in one motion.  I am going to actually ask for item 2.5 to be pulled.  Mayor Coolidge, we had one more presentation.  Yes.  Oh, the arts grant program.  Yes.  We could have had everybody stick around.  We could have had everybody stick around for that.  That's what I was kind of hoping.  But that's okay.  That's all right.  Tell them to come back in.  Everybody come back.  The security is really fast.  All right.  We will move on to the art grant program.  Sorry, I lost your crowd for you.  But at least you got music.  Stina, can you stop it?  Thank you.  There we go.  I would like to introduce our chair, Kimberly Rinala from the Arts Council.  She is the chair of the Arts Commission.  He will do a lead-in before she plays the video.  All right.  Now I can push play.  Right?  Thank you for having us.  We're excited to report out our 22, 23, and 23, 24 grant cycle report.  I'll go ahead and push play.  Then I'll give you a few highlights after. [inaudible]  E  E  E  E  E  E  E  E  E  E  E  E  E  E  E  E  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right.  All right.  Thank you.  So I wanted to, I'd love to be able to show the archival support that they submit in the reports and see the photos of our community engaged in the arts.  And I hope you enjoyed that little visual tour as well.  We're really looking forward to the next cycle.  It's a very robust group of grantees.  We started holding Q&A sessions for the grantees.  To better understand the application process and the ideas and the reporting process, which has gone over really, really well and beneficial to the grant applicants.  The Art Commission right now is really vibrant and I'm really excited.  It's been kind of a couple of years of up and down, but we've got a great crew right now.  As you can see on the screen, this last April, we did strategic planning for the first time.  And from that, we appointed a liaison to the DCBA.  And you might see the evidence of that as the scavenger hunt for Arttoberfest that's happening right now.  It's pretty exciting.  We also have a liaison to the City Public Works too, so we can continue to build that relationship and connect.  And we're really thrilled of what's to come, including a Fall in Love with the Arts Gala.  We're really excited about that.  So we're excited to see what's coming up this next year, hopefully in February.  So thanks for hearing the presentation.  Thanks for giving it.  All right.  Thank you very much.  Any questions?  No?  All right.  Okay.  We will move on now to the consent agenda.  All matters listed on the consent agenda are considered to be routine in nature and can therefore be inactive in one motion.  And as I mentioned, I wanted to pull item 2.5.  Do we have any speakers on consent?  We have one.  Okay.  But you first need to announce your disqualification.  Yeah.  I have to accuse myself of missing property.  Item 2.5.  2.5.  So noted.  Okay.  Thank you.  And then Council Member Tom Van Overbeck, as a citizen, has completed a card and will speak to the Council.  And he's our one speaker.  He is the one speaker.  All right.  Blame Madison for that.  I'm kidding.  Okay.  All right.  I remember being on this side of this for a while.  I'll be brief.  I was advised by our city attorney to recuse myself because my property entered downtown.  However, it turns out the First Amendment still applies even when you're a city council member.  So 2.5 relates to parking downtown, the parking holiday, which is proposed to be the Fridays in December prior to Christmas.  And I don't think it's any, I think it's a great idea, but I think it needs to go farther.  It's no secret our downtown has some challenges.  And parking is, and the challenge is that we just don't have enough people coming downtown to spend money.  So there are a couple reasons for that.  But one of them is parking has to be rationed.  You can either ration parking with time or with money or with both in our case.  So you have turnover and the owners and the employees aren't occupying the spaces.  But just, it isn't so much the dollar an hour.  It's just the hassle of, you know, either using the app on your phone.  It's inconvenient.  So what I would like to do, propose, actually, I'm not supposed to propose anything.  I'm not supposed to convince anybody of everything, even though it's a great idea.  I don't want to try to convince you.  But I would like us to eliminate.  Have parking be free for the through the whole period between Thanksgiving and Christmas.  And but still enforce the two hour time limit so that we don't have university people taking up our city spaces.  I think it's an important experiment.  This is the time of the year to do it.  It'll tell us a lot and help guide us in parking policy going forward.  All right.  Thank you very much.  With a minute and 13 seconds to spare.  OK.  We're going to take items.  Two point one through two point four first.  Well, why don't we take item two point five first and Tom can rejoin us.  So is that OK, Madam Clerk?  OK.  So two point five will open for discussion.  The reason why I pulled this item was I was I know downtown businesses have the Thursday night.  Every Thursday night in December, starting at five o'clock, have special sales that they're going to be doing as part of a promotion.  So I was going to look to making free parking.  And I'm going to look to making free parking on Thursday nights at five o'clock.  But it sounds like there's some will for some other stuff.  Any other comments?  I would comment back when I was with the DCBA.  We've talked about parking in the city forever and never really made any big changes other than a new kiosk.  I think it's worth doing.  Let's see what happens.  If it's a complete disaster, we'll stop.  And I think that's the challenge is people think, oh, we've we've made a new policy or a new ordinance and it's written in stone.  And it's written down to the council by God.  It's not.  If this goes terribly for two weeks, we'll change it.  I imagine we'll learn something this first time and maybe we do it again next year.  But let's try something different and see what we can do to help the downtown business owners, particularly through the holiday season.  So I would make the motion that we do that.  Let's go from Thanksgiving to Christmas.  But we do need to keep that two hour maximum.  And I would thank you, Council Member Morgan, and I am going to miss you.  I am the liaison for the DCBA and I support this consideration.  I heard the magic word experiment.  It's not a policy.  It's not permanent.  It's going to be an experiment.  And I do fully support it.  I think we need to try something different.  We need to be innovative and collaborative with the DCBA and move this forward and see how it works.  I'll take that as a second.  That is a second.  All right.  Just a question.  How is the two hour enforcement going to work if people aren't paid for it?  Are we okay doing that?  Just have the same enforcement officers going around?  City Manager, please.  Yes.  And obviously we won't have the revenue to offset that expense.  But I can see where you're going with this.  And we're going to have to get together.  And for one thing, there's two different areas.  There are areas that still have to be done.  There's the submeters.  And then there's the kiosk areas.  And I'm not sure how easily the meters can be reprogrammed.  The kiosk, I think, has more options to us.  But we'll have to get in to the software with our parking consultant and figure out how to operationalize that.  Okay.  Okay.  And just to be clear, so it says that there's an estimated loss of less than $10,000?  Yes.  For the one day a week.  For three weeks.  Now we're talking more like four weeks, seven days a week.  Well, weekends are free.  Five days.  Five days.  Yeah.  Just so we have a gauge of what we're looking at here.  But as an experiment, I mean, I think it's fine.  People keep talking about the idea that we should not charge for parking.  And there's reasons we do.  And it's to make sure that there's turnover so that their customers can use spaces.  Employees, students, long-term parkers don't use it all the time.  But yeah, I'm okay with it.  Yeah.  Okay. Brendan, anything to add to that?  No, and I just  add one little thing is that we have the smart meters and then we have the  old, old meters still too. So really it's three considerations  with the kiosk areas, the smart meter areas, and then the old meter  areas. So we might have to have a different strategy for each of those.  But yeah, we can get some ideas with our parking consultant.  Maybe things that they've seen in other communities to  operationalize that and enforce it.  So I know the smart meters have had Friday free parking on them before.  Well, Friday free parking is easy because we just tell  the parking enforcement folks you don't enforce today. Yeah, but it read  it on the meters. I believe. That was just a message. Yeah. But essentially  on the back end all we were doing was not enforcing. It wasn't something we programmed  in other than a message. But it does say it on the back end.  Yeah. Okay. Makes sense.  All right. So we have a motion and a second.  I just want to be clear. We may need some flexibility on how we  attempt to operationalize that with the three different  metering systems. So I would just say  that the council gives you great flexibility in working  any way to get to where we're trying to go. Okay. Yeah. And we can see where you're trying to go.  I'm not going to say anything. Okay.  Particularly after the first meeting in December.  Terrible.  Madam Clerk, when you're in. Council Member Bennett. Yes.  Council Member Morgan. Yes. Council Member Tandon. Yes. Council Member  Van Overbeck is disqualified. Council Member Winslow. Yes.  And Vice Mayor Reynolds is absent. Mayor Coolidge. Aye. Carries  five with one absent and one recusal. All right.  Okay.  Council Member Van Overbeck, you want to come back for these remaining items?  So no further speakers on this topic. So we'll entertain a motion for the rest of the consent  agenda.  Motion by Council Member Morgan and second by Council Member Tandon.  Madam Clerk, when you're in. Okay.  Sorry. Just trying to get to  one item. So that's a motion and a second to approve the consent agenda minus item  2.5, which was acted on separately. And it includes 2.1, which is an ordinance of the City Council of the City of Chico amending the pre-zoning of properties within the Bellmere Special Planning Area from SBA Special Planning Area to R1 Low Density Residential RZ 24-02.  Final reading and adoption by reading of title only.  So Council Member Bennett. Yes. Council Member Morgan. Yes. Council Member Tandon. Yes. Council Member Van Overbeck. Yes. Council Member Winslow.  Yes. Mayor Coolidge. Aye.  Carries 6-0 with one absence.  All right. Public comment. Members of the public may address the Council at this time on any matter not already listed on the agenda and within the jurisdiction's authority. The Council cannot at this meeting take any action on any of the requests made under this section of the agenda. How many speakers?  We have three. All right. Three minutes.  And maybe one more. Is that?  One more.  One. Okay. So we have four.  And I'll call the first two speakers if you can line up in the middle aisle.  And get ready. Catherine Riley followed by Gia Monticello.  Hello. My name is Catherine Riley and I'm in District 7. I'm one of the people that she's supposed to be working for.  It's been so interesting to drive around town and look at the difference in the yard.  I'm a little bit of a fan of the yard signs.  South, her southern area, which is all full of money and everything, big, huge signs cost a lot of money for businesses.  In my neighborhood, the poor neighborhood where low-income renters and homeowners are, we have our little yard signs.  I was so disappointed to hear that you were running again because for four years I felt like I've had no representative.  I can't get you by email. I can't get you by phone. I can't get you by...  And my other friends have had the same problem.  But I thought, well...  That's okay. She'll go away. We'll get somebody responsive.  So, but then at 5.15 this evening, at 5.15 this evening, somebody dropped this flyer off at my house.  This is the most scurrilous piece of hate-filled lies I've ever seen in my life.  And I certainly hope that your opponent has cause to either bring, I'm not sure if it's libel or slander when it's in print, but some sort of charges.  Your opponent is accused. You've got her picture there.  You've got pictures of hypodermic natals in the park.  You've got pictures of homeless camps.  It says she's been, she's the same people who created homeless situation.  And she wants free needle giveaways.  She wants more of these awful camps.  This is just an awful, terrible piece of lies and nasty.  And quite truthfully, Topeka, I don't think that anybody who would...  put something like this out should be sitting on our city council.  And this is going out and, oh, you know, there's a lot of money.  This is very expensive paper with a lot of, lot of ink and a lot of glossiness.  So I have a question for you because, wow, you're here and I actually get to ask a question of you.  I would like to know how much it costs us to have every week the two police officers  and that the nice big...  expensive scanner going through.  I'd like to know what the weekly cost to the citizens is.  And I'd like to know what it was that got you so frightened all and so afraid  that now we have to act like we're in another war zone when we just come to our city council meetings.  There must be a better way to ask questions of my representative, but when she's unavailable, there is no other way.  Now I have some other questions I'd like to ask you.  I assume you're going to win because you have...  you have the money and you have all the big signs and you get the police to endorse you, you get the fire department.  But, you know, you don't have the little people in the northern part.  I realize you have a very difficult district.  It's shaped like a dumbbell.  It goes like this.  And the people...  That's time, ma'am.  Okay.  Thank you.  Well, thank you very much.  Thank you for listening.  Gia Monticello followed by Eli Sabi.  Hello, friends.  I'm just here to remind you all that we have a night safety stroll on October 29th from  6 to 8 p.m. in the BMU 203.  I invite all of you to come or some of you to come.  I'd love to see your faces.  This year we are actually going to be doing South Campus.  So this is a map of where we will be exploring.  So we're going to go from the Chico Street, so I can't remember the names of them, but  the Chico Street out into 5th.  Okay.  And if we have enough participants, we also want to come down onto Main.  So we'll go all the way from Main and Ivy out to 5th.  We want to try to explore the areas that students may be walking at nighttime from the bars,  from our new 18 plus clubs and just the central area that students live.  We do a different area every year.  So this is our new area.  And then we also have our four areas on campus.  I'll provide this to the clerk.  Sorry.  I meant to print out a lot more, but I couldn't figure out how to use a printer.  If you're not inclined to come because you think it's just a lot of walking, we'll also  have free food, cookies, burritos, even guacamole and chips.  So please come.  We would love to have you.  I would love to have you.  I've got two yeses so far, so I'm hoping to get some more.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's all I have.  Thank you so much.  Yeah.  We did it.  Addison and I did it last year.  It was great fun.  So you actually find a lot in those neighborhoods.  Yeah.  Thank you so much.  I'll hold you to the chips and guac though.  Thank you.  So our next speaker is Ilai Sabi followed by Monica McDaniel.  Isn't that great how different we all are?  I'm just going to take a quick moment to let her communicate with the good Lord.  I'm going to say, Heavenly Father, thank you so much for this day.  Thank you for the love and the joy in my heart.  I ask the Lord God that you bless my life.  I ask the Lord God that you let go of my podems.  I ask the Lord God that you let go of my podems.  I ask the Lord God that you let go of my podems.  I ask the Lord God that you let go of my podems.  I ask the Lord God that you let go of my podems.  I ask the Lord God that you let go of my podems.  I ask the Lord God that you let go of my podems.  I ask the Lord God that you let go of my podems.  I ask the Lord God that you let go of my podems.  I ask the Lord God that you let go of my podems.  I ask the Lord God that you let go of my podems.  I ask the Lord God that you let go of my podems.  who knows it could be for mom pa it could be for the person behind me i could be talking to myself  you never know when the lord speaks through you who he's talking to so i got a word and a word  on love no matter how many eyes or nays you say or how many times you fall to your knees and pray  it makes no difference the words coming from your lips today  if you don't have love people looking at their watches you may want a prosperous city you may  think about your downtown you want it to look pretty you may desire a sparkling facade of  community more bars and casinos please but it don't matter if you don't got love no it's not  a beetle song but it is a song you can build your fences higher and higher you can shut off the  electricity  you can shut off the effectively  the bathrooms, and the water.  You can take people's things and huck them in the muck  or throw them in the mire,  but nothing will change people if you don't have love.  So rather than pointing or mocking or shaking your head in disgrace,  not to mention teaching your children to do the same,  you could show your children what love looks like.  As you look at us houseless people, a.k.a. humans,  you look us in the face and say,  say maybe try this,  I am so sorry for what you've been through.  I know it didn't happen in a vacuum.  And perhaps my own actions and my cold heart were a part of it too.  Today I want you to know that I see you.  I see you.  I see you, Jimmy and Thomas.  I see you, Rachel, Rebecca, and Jacob.  I see you, Eli.  And today let's start to work together  because only love can see us through.  And for the record, God is love,  and he is the only reason I have hope.  And if you want more info.  Oh, let's try something different.  That's time, man.  Amen.  God is good, people.  Don't forget.  All right, we'll move on.  Thank you.  I have one last speaker.  Oh, you do?  With four, yes.  Monica McDaniel.  My apologies.  That's okay.  I'm so glad to see so many people here in red and blue tonight.  It's glad that we support our local high school.  I just want to remind everybody who's wearing their colors.  I'm a Viking family.  There's Chico families, but we're all together in Chico.  To buy your tickets for the raffle,  because that benefits all the students and their scholarships and their futures.  Being a high school teacher, I recognize that better than anybody.  But I wanted to speak tonight because I wanted to say thank you, especially to Mayor Coolidge.  You can't take credit from the Mayor's Arts Award because that was established before you came along,  but you can take credit for being a part of a bipartisan group that helped restore 1% of the transient occupancy tax,  which is what helped pay for this, this beautiful presentation that you did.  And it shows the resiliency of the arts and the arts programming in Chico,  and it also shows that you care about arts as an economic driver.  You also helped establish the  I also helped establish a maintenance fund for standalone art projects.  Commissioner Posey and I are part of the ad hoc to help with that with public works.  And I just wanted to share gratitude and appreciate that you recognize the value of the arts in Chico.  Chico is in fact a cultural hub of the region, and it's important that we support that.  Thank you.  All right.  Thank you very much.  With that, we will move on to public hearings, of which we have none.  Item 5 is regular agenda.  5.1, consideration of an ordinance allowing alcoholic beverages,  in the City Plaza during private events.  We will hear a report from Deputy City Manager Jennifer McCarthy.  Good evening, Mayor Coolidge, Council Members.  I'm Jennifer McCarthy, Deputy City Manager.  During the March 19, 2024, Council meeting, after a hearing recommendation from the Internal Affairs Committee,  the Council directed staff to develop an ordinance that would allow for the sale or provision of alcoholic beverages  during private events in the City Chico City Plaza.  As background, in May 2021, the City Council approved a new ordinance,  In May 2023, the Council approved an ordinance to allow for alcoholic beverages in the City Plaza during public events.  This allowed for events such as Chico Live and the Red, White & Brew Festival to move forward successfully.  The proposed ordinance before you tonight would allow for private events,  leasing the City Plaza to provide or sell alcohol to their guests,  contingent on the issuance of a City of Chico park use permit  and a license issued by the California Department of Education.  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively You'll notice that the fees for events in the plaza with alcohol You'll notice that the fees for events in the plaza with alcohol  events in the plaza with alcohol  or double that of events with  no alcohol. Payment of a damage  deposit installation of  temporary security fencing  around the plaza and in  addition applicants must hire  at least one security guard per  100 people plus an extra  security guard stationed at the  entrance to the facility. If the  council is interested in moving  forward with the ordinance a  resolution to amend the fees  will come back at the second  reading. At this point I'm happy  to answer any questions you  might have.  questions?  when we looked at this  internal affairs there was one  inquiry to have an event that  included alcohol have we had  any more?  that is correct we did  have that one inquiry at the  time. We have had some  conversations with for instance  card who will be operating the  that is an option other than  that we have had no other  inquiries.  thank you.  you'  re welcome.  I have had some council  members I have had discussions  with a couple groups around  town expressed some interest at  least initially. I think the  restrictions look pretty tough  so having rented facilities in  this town and all over northern  California it'  s certainly a pretty high bar to  deal with. ABC and the additional  and all of those guidelines  of course sign off by pd as  well. I'  m very comfortable with where  it sits.  any other questions?  no.  entertain a motion.  we have public comment.  we have public comment.  do we have public comment?  I just knew that.  I will make a motion to do it.  we would be the only place in  the sacramento valley you could  probably get drunk on ice.  not sure that'  s true.  I'  ll second it.  all right.  we have a motion and a second.  are you ready?  no.  okay.  that was a motion to introduce  the following ordinance.  ordinance of the city council  of the city of chico,  california amending chapters 12.  18 and 12R04 of the chico  municipal code pertaining to  alcoholic beverages at city  plaza.  council member bennett?  yes.  council member morgan?  yes.  council member tandon?  no.  council member van overbeck?  yes.  council member winslow?  yes.  mayor coolidge?  aye.  carries five with one no and  one absence.  all right.  we don'  t need to read the ordinance.  all right.  5.2.  trying to throw me off.  just consideration of an ordinance  amending chapters 12.04, 12.18, and 12R04.  of the chico municipal code  regarding city parks.  so we have a report from parks  and natural resource manager  linda hurman.  or eric gufson?  i'  ll take this.  yeah.  it'  s a quick one.  thank you mayor coolidge and  council members.  item 5.2 is just a cleanup,  kind of a cleanup item for us.  back in early 2022, if you  remember, city council directed  biddle park and playground  commission to review some of  our muni code rules, kind of  surrounding traffic safety  noise, closing time, and other  topics.  one in particular was drug free  zones.  we had section 12.04.050  allow the city to designate the  park as a drug free zone which  comes with enhanced fines and  things like that for criminal  sentences if you'  re cited for drug use in a drug  free zone.  that had been repealed in 2013.  and we have a lot of  issues with that.  it expired in 2013.  so we wanted to renew that as a  drug free zone because then it  came back by this health and  safety code sections 11353,  11353.1 to reinitiate drug free  zones.  so that was one of the items of  discussion back in early 2022.  finally, november 22, 2022, we  took it to council and council  approved to, one, designate all  city parks as drug free zones  and then change the closing times  for city parks and greenways from  11 p.m.  to 10 p.m.  except for city plaza and upper  bidwell park whereby the closing  times will remain at 11.  so this was passed in 2022.  we just realized recently that we  never brought a confirming  ordinance back to formally put  that into the municipal code.  so this is just an introductory  reading of an ordinance to  formalize those two items.  and so we'  re seeking to make that a !  approval by the city council  to adopt the ordinance amending  chapters 12.04, 12.18, and 12r.04  of the muni code for those two  items.  questions?  i have one.  this is either for the chief,  police chief or for you, eric.  is this going to be enforced?  so we have a curfew at 10 o'clock.  if i decide i want to go camp in  the park are you going to rouse  me out or are we just going to  look the other way?  i could start and then hand  it off to chief aldridge.  we'  re really trying to bolster  our sworn ranger program that'  s going over to pd.  we have two excellent rangers  and i believe one is going into  the academy soon.  i'  ll let billy answer that.  so i think once we get a fully  staffed sworn ranger program that  will certainly help enforce the park  closures.  we also of course have to work  within the parameters of the  settlement agreement which can  sometimes be challenging in the  park.  but we hope to enforce this as  best as we can.  why have a curfew if we can'  t kick people out?  what'  s the point?  i think it'  s good to have it on the books  for if things change in the  settlement agreement we can and  then we get a park ranger staff  that'  s fully staffed to give us  more bandwidth to do so.  but i'  ll hand it over to billy if  there'  s any more to add billy on  enforcement items.  i think you did a great job.  i think you did too.  so the third park ranger is  actually in the academy right now  and graduates in december and  then we'  ll attend the six month training  program within the pd.  so that will give us the three  full time sworn park rangers.  right but right now they'  re going home at 6 o'  clk or 5 o'  clk can you get them to cruise  through at 10 and make sure  that.  no so right now you'  re right in the middle of  right they work their either  day shift but it'  s seven day a week  coverage now the two that are  back to doing park enforcement  unless linda says they have a  special event that they need  them for they'  ll adjust their  schedules for those events.  but in terms of the closure  times any enforcement of that  at this point would come from  patrol.  but as eric stated we do have  the settlement agreement that  we'  ll be able to do that.  but that precludes us from  being able to do that right now.  i specifically asked that  question of judge newman and  was pretty much told too bad.  so yes once the final comes  down from the court as to what  we can or can'  t do with the  settlement that could change.  thank you.  and i'  ll just add too just having  this in place and formalizing  our mini code will help for in  the event when we can.  all right further questions.  thank you.  thank you.  well yes you'  re asking about  specifically people being there  after hours that the settlement  agreement precludes that.  but what about enforcement of  it as a drug free zone because  it'  s separate from sleeping  outside.  i didn'  t want to take your thunder  buddy.  go for it'  s all you billy.  so i'  m a little confused what'  s your question.  will the drug free zone be  enforceable even if the city  is still in the settlement  agreement.  i think it'  you'  re saying crimes relating to  drug use.  well specifically because  part of this ordinance is to  reinstate drug free zone in the  parks.  that has nothing to do with  the closure times.  that'  s an enhancement to someone  that is using drugs in the  park.  which is currently enforceable  though.  correct.  yes council if i also  add it'  s also an enhancement for  soliciting and selling drugs in  a playground as well.  so it'  s not just using it'  s a !  s soliciting and  selling.  correct.  not just free drugs all  drugs.  all right.  it'  s not just use.  i'  m with you.  all right do we have any  speakers.  all right entertain a motion.  move to approve.  second.  we have a motion from  council member ben overbeck  and a second from council  member ben.  when you'  re ready.  thank you.  thank you.  council member bennett.  yes.  council member morgan.  yes.  council member tandon.  yes.  council member van overbeck.  yes.

mayor.  as noted in the staff report  this bargaining unit is a !  all right.  questions.  speakers.  none.  entertain a motion.  move to approve.  second.  so we have a motion by  council member winslow.  second by council member van  overbeck.  when you'  re ready.  council member bennett.  yes.  council member morgan.  yes.  council member tandon.  yes.  council member van overbeck.  yes.  council member winslow.  yes.  mayor coolidge.  aye.  carries 6-0 with one absence.  all right.  item 5.4 chico open board  architecture.  art initiative.  also known as  coba.  we have a report from  artist theme city clerk  debbie preston.  thank you mayor and  council.  another exciting opportunity  for partnerships to develop  and to have different art  projects come back up.  we're eternally grateful at  the arts commission level for  the support and the utility box  program.  which was done with a lot of  hard work.  and now we have another  program that we would like to  bring before you.  it is the chico open board.  it is a  project that was started by  the art initiative and  otherwise known as coba.  and for some of you who have  been around for a long, long  time you'll recognize that this  program was actually started in  the early 2000s if not a little  bit before.  it was funded through rda funds  and focused on generating  permanent artwork to be placed  in the historic downtown area on  both public and private  properties.  you'll see those frames with  the beautiful paintings in  there.  and to revive this project  because we are in the  early 2000s.  we clearly need to have it  revived.  the dcba has graciously been  working on collaborating with  the chico arts commission,  chico arts and culture  foundation, museum of northern  california and butte college to  create a program directed at  engaging community partners and  education institutions to have  students showcase their artwork  in existing coba frames.  they're talking about the frames  that are on public property  which the city owns.  and so there is really no  funding being requested at all  for this.  as monica mcdaniel mentioned  earlier that the council did  direct that maintenance funds be  set aside for our existing  public art.  and that would be that would  also cover any of the frame  damages and anything that needs  to be repaired.  i'm going to turn it over to  audrey taylor who i would love  to have her speak to you about  the program.  she addressed the commission.  and it's an exciting opportunity  and i'm very, very proud of  just getting to partner with  california to work on these  types of projects.  so we only have well we have  two speakers.  and audrey taylor if you'd like  to come up first.  thank you, council.  i really appreciate this.  audrey taylor of chabon concept  and representing dcva.  and i also have with me tonight  linda zorn from butte college  who is the co-chair of this  initiative for us.  and as debbie pointed out this  is a collaboration to just  collaborate with the city of  chico arts center to revive  these open boards to student  showcasing student art and to  celebrate that.  so we have been working over  probably the last four or five  months with collaboration which  includes the chico arts center,  the chico arts and culture  foundation, monca and butte  college to get this formalized  and we were so pleased when the  arts council supported what we're  doing through this process.  and we had put in our business  plan one of our focus areas was  place making.  and for us place making is arts.  arts and culture and history.  and so this is an opportunity  for us to collaborate and really  make that come alive.  and really build the opportunity  and collaboration between our  educational institutes to  recognize students in their work.  so our plan is to create a  community of arts and culture  so our next steps you know as  we move forward we have several  next steps so that our committee  is going to work on and one  that's just kind of inventorying  all the coba bards that we have.  taking a look at those eric  gufston and his team has  already gone through diamond  alley and looked at any  maintenance that is needed for  those boards because that would  be our pilot test because those  are on public property in diamond  alley.  we're going to prepare guidelines  for how this would roll out the  guidelines for the students the  themes that we would like them to  use in those arts.  we will be figuring out a rotation  so that the artist kept fresh all  the time.  there's new opportunities for  students to participate in that.  we would start again with diamond  alley.  one of the things that we will be  doing is setting up a fund and i'm  pleased to say that we have already  had one donor into the fund at the  level of ten thousand dollars.  so you can see that the arts is a  great participation.  but again as i said a big part of  this will be engaging the students  so i want to have linda come up and  just talk from butte college who is  going to be our initial pilot in  working this and then we'll be rolling  it out to all the schools in chico.  so linda.  thank you.  thank you.  thank you.  thank you audrey.  thank you for the time.  one of the goals of the program is to  foster student engagement in public art.  so this project is going to be an  excellent learning experience for our  students as well as providing an  opportunity for them to showcase their  talent in the public space which they  love to do.  students like to show off their art.  so butte college art faculty and staff  will pilot an internal student  selection process that will be included  in those overall program guidelines.  as audrey mentioned the first four coba  boards which are on the parking  structure will be completed by butte  college students.  so we kind of work the bugs out of the  whole system.  and then we'll work on the other four  that are in diamond alley.  so all those eight will be done by butte  college.  and then we'll assist in finalizing the  guidelines and then butte college will  also help roll the program out to art  departments at chico state, local high  schools and middle schools to encourage  student participation.  so we just see this as a wonderful  collaboration getting our students to  learn what it's like to be a part of  this kind of process and then actually  and then actually exhibiting their work.  so we're delighted that all the project  partners are embracing this very high  level student involvement in public art  and butte college is very excited to be  a key partner in this initiative.  so we thank you for your support and interest.  all right.  that's me as i turn my mic back on.  monica mcdaniel is our last speaker on  this item.  okay.  thank you.  thank you.  thank you.  hello again council.  i am so excited to see this on the  agenda tonight.  i am of course monica mcdaniel.  i am a member of the chico arts commission.  i've been on the arts commission since  2009.  i'm the original founder of the chico  arts and culture foundation.  and i give downtown art tours and when  the the coba open board project was  started before my tenure on the  commission and i remember seeing the  open board project at the farmers markets  and the way it worked was artists were  given a four foot by four foot board.  they could do whatever they wanted with  it.  the boards were then put on display and  participants at the farmers market were  given tickets to choose the artwork that  they wanted and that's how you see a lot  of the art that's in the coba boxes now.  giving downtown art tours for the last  seven years we always say well that was  a great program and it went away with  the rda like so many other things did.  so i'm just absolutely thrilled to see  this partnership with the downtown  business association and the arts  commission and the chico arts and  culture foundation to revive this  project and i love the the addition of  adding students into the mix because it  it supports not only chico state  students but college students but also  our local students.  just i wanted to add that little bit of  history.  thank you.  all right there's no action it was just  an update.  okay i'd like to make a comment unless  anyone else would.  all right i i think we're going to go  through the art that we've been  talking about and you know walked  through by these for years especially  the ones in by hotel diamond on the  parking garage and just seem kind of in  disrepair so it's good to see them  coming back to life i think it's well  overdue.  it's exciting so yeah it really is  thank you.  yes.  so monica you you gave me a great  tour of downtown art that's about six  months ago.  the dcba has a historical building tour  that takes you through historically  and talks about the history why  couldn't the arts commission do  something like that for downtown art  because there's some really  interesting stories behind the artists  and the pieces i think maybe we can  talk about it.  okay thank you very much on that item  all right now move on there's no items  after the posting of the agenda so we'll  move on to reports and communication and  we start with the city manager's report  mr. schwarzenegger.  no report.  all right.  oh yeah it worked up like there was  going to be a report and there was no  report.  all right item 6.2 final map pending  community development directors  approval.  see attached and then council member  requests pursuant to ap and p 1010  council members may verbally request an  item be agendized at a future meeting  after staying with the item be a  majority vote of the council is needed  in order for staff to agendize.  i have one but there's a lot of  questions.  i will cede to anyone else who has  one.  i have one.  i would like the internal affairs  committee to consider amending city code  19.44.010 paragraph e which deals with  offices on the ground floor and downtown  north.  right now it requires a use permit.  i've been asked by some commercial real  estate people as well as the president  of the dcba to if we could take a look  at that and allow ground floor offices  without a use permit that's $6,000 is  an impediment to getting people in those  spaces.  there are some spaces like my building  at 300 main where it's grandfathered in  because it was always an office.  so we're talking about places where  there was no preexisting office.  that's a motion.  sure.  second.  motion and a second.  when you're ready.  council member bennett.  yes.  council member morgan.  yes.  council member tandon.  yes.  council member van overbeck.  yes.  council member winslow.  yes.  mayor coolidge.  aye.  carry 6-0 with one absence.  i can't believe the city clerk  actually got all those little numbers  and everything.  i was trying.  i'm not sure they're right.  but i'll go back and listen.  pretty good.  council member bennett.  this is not a request to  agendize.  it's a request to ask the city manager  about a particular item in the  effectively effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  about our presentation with pioneer energy  last meeting and what the next steps might be like to move this forward as quickly as possible  But I realized I remember the dates that he talked about which were out there quite a ways  But I'm just like to request you to update us on what the
