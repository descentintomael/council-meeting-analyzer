 guarantee all parking be exclusively designated for the proposed cannabis storefront retailer use. In further accordance with Chapter 1970, a landscaped planting strip would be provided along the street frontages of Park Avenue and East 14th Street. Decorative fencing and strubs would be planted around the perimeter of the parking area proposed on the secondary project parcel and would have a height of 4 feet 4 inches. Fencing and plantings within a site distance area shall be limited to a height of 36 inches or 3 feet to ensure adequate visibility at this intersection. Parking lot shading is estimated to reach 61 percent at tree maturity, satisfying code requirements. The project is consistent with land use, lot coverage, landscaping, building height, and setback requirements for the CC zoning district. The proposed use would be established in an existing commercial building. Interior tenant improvements to divide the 11,000 square foot building into two separate suites and exterior improvements to the building facade, including new signage, a redesigned awning, and repainting shall be subject to administrative architectural review. No expansion of the current building footprint is proposed. All commercial cannabis land uses required issuance of a commercial cannabis permit through the city manager's office. As part of that permit process, which involved four phases of review, applicants were required to submit detailed plans for the safety, security, and operational characteristics of the proposed use. The neighborhood compatibility plan has been included with this report as attachment F. Additionally, a zoning verification was conducted as part of the associated cannabis business plan.

The project has been determined to be categorically exempt from further environmental review pursuant to CEQA sections 15301, existing facilities, and 15332, infill development projects.

How does that happen? How is it going to be hidden from the public's view? There's no on-site consumption allowed. There's secure packaging. Are you talking about the customer experience? They're bringing stuff in the back door to sell out front, right? So there's a secure loading zone. How is it going to be hidden from the public's view? There's a secure loading zone. That shipments will come directly to the facility and be offloaded in the back of the store and secured until which time they become available for retail sale. Okay. The other question I have is over on attachment D, page 10, under community benefits, we're asking them to donate 5% of their gross receipts. Now, that would lead me to believe that's optional. You don't have to do it. If you want them to donate it, sure they can, but they don't have to. I might ask Angie to confirm if that's the case as a result of the city manager's permit. They don't have a little room in that. They actually have to sign a community benefits agreement saying that they will give 5% and then it gives requirements on when they donate that, when they give that 5% to the city. Well, then we have an issue of semantics then. Donate implies voluntary. Why don't you just say... Whatever it is, they have to give the city 5%. Good point. Yeah. I mean, it's the community benefit agreement for them to come into the city is that they agree to give 5% of their gross receipts. Okay. Change. Donate to give and only half. Yeah. Any more questions for staff at this time? Let's see. Back on one of the photos you showed in front of the whole Brooks. Yes. Perfect. The Park Avenue street parking. Is that currently metered? No. Okay. If I can ask related to that, there is currently no parking on Park Out, no street parking, right? I believe there are some existing spaces in front of the whole Brooks. Okay. I'm not sure about in front of the show of thrift. Is that the end? Mike, you're on the Park Avenue project. How the project was done a few years back. I'm sorry, Matt. Can you say that again? During the capital project that we did a couple years back with Park Avenue, our solar seal project, all of the... All of the on street parking or off street parking was removed. On both sides. Yeah. Okay. Thank you. What's removed, you said? Yeah. Well, the picture that the attachment F shows cars parked right in front of the store. So... I think that might be a... Is that an old picture there? It's an old picture. Okay. Technically, as you drive down Park Avenue and you see a car parked on there, there shouldn't be a car parked on Park Avenue. Okay. The attachment F does say that 11 exclusive parking spaces as well as nine intermittent... C spaces in front of the building on the street. So I'm assuming that this is our attachment F is probably dated. Yeah. Attachment F is from the original commercial cannabis business permit review process, which, like I said, kicked off in 2021 and took quite a ways to get to where we are now. I think Nat probably has the most up-to-date information on parking, and they didn't propose any parking in front of the building on their site plan indicating to me that... There is none. Isn't the street in front of the building going to have bike lane along there? That's why the cars are going to be removed? Did you have any information on that? I had heard plans for bike lanes to remove... There's already a bike lane there. There's no parking in front of it. Right. That was the whole reason why it got removed is there is a current bike lane along there. Kelly, I have a question. Sure. Yep. The second space, which by subtraction... It looks like to be about 4,500 square feet on the west side, I guess, if you want to say, of the parcel. What's the parking situation for that? I mean, where are they getting their parking once that is put into use or rented out or whatever? Yeah, we don't have a separate business that is identified to go in there. That's something that we'll have to look at when we see a proposal. So, if you have a parking space that you want to use, you can come in. They are entitled to a similar off-site parking arrangement. This site is located in a COS corridor opportunity site. So, a potential for a parking reduction request could be entertained. Okay. But this project is using all the on-site parking is my understanding, correct? That's correct. Okay. It may limit the use of that then. Okay. If I could ask a question really related to that one. So, is there a parking space that is going to be used for parking? The Cloud Chaser project, would they be using all, what is it, 26 total spaces? Or is that for both suites in the building? 34 spaces are provided for the cannabis storefront retailer use. Okay. So, can I, a couple of questions. Again, we're digging into the parking issue right off the top. Parking on 14th Street and, so I'll start there. Do we have an assembly? Do we have an assessment of how much parking is available on 14th Street? On-street parking? Yeah. I wouldn't have that data. They are shown on the site plan. The on-street space is there. You can see them marked. Yeah, gotcha. Okay, yeah. So, there is on-street parking on 14th Street. And then back on the 34, is it, I think, spaces across the street. So, related to what I think either Bryce or Dennis were just putting out there, I think there's a lot of information that's being put out there. So, I'm just asking about, so if those are dedicated spaces for this business. That's correct. Then in no sense is this public parking. That's correct. Right. And how would that be, like, monitored and controlled? I assume there would be, you know, maybe on the bumpers or something to indicate basically what the parking is for. But then there would be some sort of, would the business enforce that? I would imagine as you'd be treated similar to other private parking lots in town. But I think the information is there. I think that's the important thing. So, this is not, and for the public, I think, who might be. It's a requirement for the parking in an off-site location. It's one of the four requirements that a suitable long-term lease and it not be shared with another use. Right. But I guess my point, and then I want to come back to that for a second, is that no one should be disillusioned to think that this is a new public parking lot for that neighborhood or other businesses. It really is. Yeah, this is parking associated with the proposed project for benefit of the proposed project. Right. And I think you just said something that may be important to our later discussion, and I am very anxious to hear from the applicant on this topic. But is that in a corridor that's been identified as an opportunity corridor, those parking requirements. Right. Which may or may not be, you know, outdated, can be adjusted. Do I understand that right? I just want to be specific on some of the language we're using here as we continue to talk about probably AB 2097, how that relates here. This is in a corridor opportunity site overlay zone. So, the site itself is specifically zoned with that COS, which has a separate code section, which allows for a, you know, a lot of the parking. And then, you know, the developer to request a parking reduction, and then it would have to meet another set of standards in a separate part of our code. Gotcha. Thank you. So, when you, what you were just talking about, is that, it sounds like you're dealing with what Addison Winslow might have commented. Yes. We did get some public comment forwarded to us. I threw in a couple slides for you guys, too. Just. My impression of what Rich was saying was just about the corridor opportunity site overlay, which was a separate issue from AB 2097. That's correct. Yes. Exactly. So, I think that's a separate issue. There is no parking reduction requested by the applicant for this project. Okay. Thank you. So, AB 2097, if we just want to give a brief overview, as it was brought up by our council member, Addison Winslow, relates to parking minimums and our ability to enforce parking minimums. The government code citation here just defines. Okay. To put it a little bit more in detail, says a public agency shall not impose or enforce any minimum automobile parking requirement on a residential, commercial, or other development project. If the project is located within one half mile of public transit, the government code goes on to define public transit in section 2155 of the public resources code as a major transit stop containing any of the following. A, B, or C. The first two don't apply to this site. And the third was really where we did most of our research on is there an area in town that currently has an intersection of two or more major bus routes with a frequency of service interval of 15 minutes or less during the morning and afternoon peak commute periods. And the answer is no. As of today, Chico does not contain any intersections of public transit. And the 2020 regional transportation plan contains an initiative to enhance B line route 15 south to run at a 15 minute frequency during these peak periods. However, there are no plans in the regional transportation plan to establish a second route with headways of 15 minutes or less, which would intersect this route to create a major transit stop located in Chico. Any other questions? On that? Maybe a point of clarification. And I just want to kind of repeat what you said. Sure. So you said the applicant has not asked for the parking requirements to be adjusted at all? The applicant has not requested nor is desiring a parking reduction. Okay. And when I'm looking at what we have before us, we are not making a special exception or a finding that would say that we're allowed to park at a parking limit. We are allowing for this additional parking that is consistent with what is in the general plan with our land use regulations. And so having this, what we have in front of us is exactly what would be to our city code right now. Yes, that is correct. And as mentioned, this has gone through a previous review process where that site was identified to complete the required parking for this use. And ultimately a factor in the final selection process out of the 29 applicants. So I would say it remains integral to this project. Thank you. Any other questions? Sorry, diving into parking things again. Would you mind clarifying, does a cannabis dispensary in this case fall into the category of retail stores general merchandise? Is that? Yes, that's correct. Okay. So it's regulated at a rate of one space for every 250 square feet. Okay. Floor area. Thank you. You're welcome. Any other questions? Yeah, I have one last question. Do employees, are employees required to be U.S. citizens or legal residents? It doesn't address that anywhere in here. It's a very interesting question. I'm not sure I would have the answer. I assume yes to get that. If you get a traditional work permit, you have to have some sort of citizenship that that would be beyond my purview honestly. Well, could we get a reading from a legal person on that perhaps? Sure. Do we want to ask Vince? Sure. I'll take a look at that commissioner Wale on the requirements for a work permit for employees in this industry. I don't know that that's off the top of my head. I'll take a look at that later. Okay, thank you. It was an important contributing factor that these businesses hire locally and not bring in a full set of employees from maybe a previously established location. So I do know that that was strongly considered. Okay, anything else? Thank you, Kelly. Thank you. Nicole, how many speaker cards do we have? Four, including the applicant. Okay, thank you. So we will open the hearing for public input. We'll begin with the applicant. The applicant will have ten minutes, and then we will allow for additional speakers. They will receive three minutes apiece, and then we will call back up the applicant for a three-minute rebuttal if that is needed. Super. Thank you very much. Thank you for joining us today. My pleasure. Thank you, commissioners. I appreciate having the opportunity to speak this evening. I am Matt Galloway, architect and representative for the applicant this evening. I have been working on this project since the initial application to the Cannabis Committee for the city. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my The first thing is that we determined with the site, taking a look at it, that it was not code compliant with regards to Title 19 parking on site. Obviously, with the level of scrutiny and the level of intensive investigation that went through this, we realized that parking was going to be an issue. So immediately at the time, the owner of the Holbrook's building also owned the property immediately across the street. And that property fell within all the requirements that helped assist with a reciprocal parking arrangement in accordance with Title 19. So we addressed that site, took a look at the opportunity of how much parking it could accommodate. The building is extremely dilapidated, honestly, and has a number of code compliance issues from a number of different directions. So we saw it as an opportunity, actually, to beautify the corridor and to provide some much-needed parking relief. Because... Because honestly, with the Park Avenue improvements that occurred on that street, there were a lot of complaints going on from the neighboring businesses in that region that there just wasn't adequate parking anymore. They had depended upon that on-street parking on Park Avenue for a number of years. So it seemed like a win-win for a lot of different people. One of the things that Kelly had mentioned during her report was that we're addressing all 34 spaces as part of this project. But there is a suite. There is a suite associated with this project that could eventually be developed. So we wanted to make sure that we provided enough parking to provide and allow for our use in that not-a-part scope that's shown at the bottom of this drawing. So we do have an additional 13 spaces across the way that could help accommodate this business as well, a future business that could move into this suite, and maybe other businesses adjacent who have actually already reached out to the tenants saying, hey, would it be possible for us to engage in a lease? And some of those spaces, you could really help us out because we're having problems with parking on our site. Here's a simple floor plan, again, well scrutinized by the group. But it does address one question that Commissioner Wall had, and that was how are transportation of goods occurring? They occur behind closed door in a loaded, secure area. So they're going to happen in-house, under roof, behind closed doors, and visible to the public. Again, I think that's a good point. That was an important part of the selection process. We are proposing some more elaborate upgrades to the facade of the existing building that we're really excited about, kind of a mid-century modern approach that really brings some different architecture into the region, and that's kind of my area of expertise and what I like to kind of show about what's going on. So a different look and a significant upgrade to the Park Avenue corridor. And then obviously how that works in the context of the neighborhood and our proposed parking facility across the way. So I would mention with regards to the parking facility, this isn't an uncommon approach. There's actually two locations in our critical downtown area where we have private parking lots very similar to this. I designed one next door to Sierra Nevada that's very similar to this with some nice amenities with fence and wrought iron and columns around the outside of it. During my discussion earlier with Commissioner Polin, it was discussed that maybe we integrate some of that wrought iron and column approach across the street to create some architectural symmetry and have a language that reiterates from each side to show that there's a relationship between what's going on across the street to this parking lot and the applicant and tenant is more than willing to do that. Thank you. And I think that kind of hits the... I think that kind of hits the end of what I have and I'm happy to answer any other questions that you might have. Does the commission have any questions for Mr. Galloway? Left? Mr. Polin? Did you get a chance to talk to the applicant too about some of the concerns I had about having the... If you're traveling southbound on Park Avenue and you're turning right into the on-site parking lot, I had some concerns that I expressed with Mr. Galloway about that being right at an intersection and if pedestrians are coming and going in that area, if a car is running a red light and slams into a car that's making a right-hand turn. So I had kind of just asked Matt or Mr. Galloway if the applicant would be open to making that a one-way. So they would essentially enter that on-site parking lot from 14th Street. And then it would be an exit only onto Park Avenue. So I did discuss that with the owner group and they were agreeable to that as long as the design criteria met what Public Works wants to see for that. And so honestly, I haven't had a chance to study to make sure. And again, this is an existing condition as the way it is. There have not been a tremendous amount of or any accident reports at that location. I did ask to look into that. So it doesn't seem like it's been a big problem, but we are introducing a population of pedestrians are going to be crossing the street there. So we want to make sure that we're taking care of them and that safety is our utmost concern. We're happy to know that at this location, in contrast to some other locations along Park Avenue, it's a lit controlled intersection. So at that point, pedestrians are not crossing against traffic without being protected. In fact, earlier today I was driving along and you come up or somebody stops. Without a light and you realize that all of a sudden as you're flying up alongside that there's a pedestrian trying to cross without a light. So this location is really a prime location from that standpoint in terms of safety for that. So short, long answer to a short question. Yes, they are willing to do that as long as it fits and doesn't compromise any of the number of parking stalls. Kind of on those same along the same line. And I didn't mention this to you. So I'm putting you on the spot because I kind of thought about it afterwards. I'm sure others. You're going to put me on the spot as well. So I'm ready. Big shoulders. Yes. The access point. So the man gate. Well, actually, just that I can't tell. Well, it does say gate that for the access into the parking lot is along is on Park Avenue. Clearance wise, you know, I don't know what you would know better than me. I don't know what we have here, but if that could be relocated to the corner. So. So it's. Directly behind the. Crosswalk entrance. Making sense just to kind of better direct the pedestrian. So they're not coming out of that gate and just wanting to jaywalk that they're coming out of the gate at the stoplight and crosswalk. That makes sense. Sure. At this point, we've engaged Rose Anderson, role of civil engineer locally, and they're working through some of the dimensional items. Right. So they are engaged in that. And I'll make that request to them and see if we can't direct traffic or pedestrian traffic a little closer to the corner. Thanks, Matt. My question is, again, related to parking. So you mentioned it, but I wasn't really clear the mechanics of how this work that that the applicant, while there will be 34 sites in the lot across the street. And so some of those might be, and you said maybe even local other businesses have expressed interest in those. So again, that it kind of begs the question of how that that would be managed, especially as this evolves, as perhaps that back suite gets filled. So how will those sites get parceled out? And this may be more a staff question than for you. But have you had those? Do you have a sense of how that would work? Sure. So there was a number of conversations about whether we wanted to secure this parking lot via gate. So you could only have card access to get in. And initially, we didn't think because of the quantity that that was going to be necessary. That could be an option. If this gets to the point where we are utilizing and finding that there's not enough space in there. The goal, Lindsay and I talked about that, or excuse me, Commissioner Pollan and I talked about this earlier today. That the goal would be to have employees park at this to keep the spaces on site free for customers. So if it gets to a point where employees are having trouble parking because there's other people in here and there's a policing problem, we could secure it and have it have a card access. We weren't going to start there. It seemed like there was a little bit extra. And again, as future projects come in, whether it's this expansion of the suite that's here or whether it's a tenant moving in one way or the other. Within 300 feet of this project, staff can utilize this as an opportunity to make up for the spaces that were lost during the Park Avenue improvement. And last question. I'm wondering whether you or the owner applicant has had any conversations related to access some attention paid to pedestrians just simply crossing from the parking lot across the street. But other kinds of, you know. I mean, I think we've seen some of the other modes of so is there thoughts of, you know, bike parking is their thoughts of, you know, bike parking is a mandated component of title 19. We're actually going to propose an amount in excess of the minimum. So we've designated some areas already. You know, ideally, there's a lot of concrete on the sidewalk on 14th Street at this area. So we have some opportunity there. We were showing some additional trees at this point. On that side of the street. That don't exist. I think we do have good opportunity for beautification. Landscape architects really excited to get involved in some of this as well. I said landscape architect. I meant landscape installer. So a local landscape contractor who will be doing this has helped out with some of the species here and really excited to get to work on some of those. But trash enclosure was something we talked about that exists on the west side of Park Avenue along 14th. We're going to look at request of Commissioner. So my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my spaces. So, you know, it's not a huge amount, like it's the parking garage, eight parking spaces seems like what would have been on Park Avenue probably in front of both of those buildings and available. Right. And to be honest, Commissioner Scott, the requirement for the parking stalls within the building, there's a significant component of that building, even in the improved suite, that's not retail. And historically, we would do a ratio with that, non-retail spaces don't need as much parking as retail spaces. So we could do a ratio where we have of the 6,500 square feet, we've got a thousand feet of storage. So we can take that as a different ratio and will help. We took a conservative approach again during the application process to make sure that we quantified and made secure that portion of the application. So we were sure with our numbers, we have the ability to sharpen our pencil and my numbers on the ground, we have the ability to sharpen our pencil and my numbers on the ground, honestly, I think we're between 10 and 13 spaces extra on that site, depending upon what moves, if anything moves into the second suite, we could end up using all of those. If we're a restaurant that were to move into that other space, they're very intensive in terms of their parking use. So we want to make sure again, it's not just about the numbers from Title 19, it's also about marketability, right? So as we have these suites and we're trying to invite businesses into our community, as much as we may want to push away from parking, or embrace it, we also need to realize that the market has a demand for what's happening and they want to be close to the front door as much as possible. And we can see in locations in Chico, when there's inadequate parking, that it results in a lack of business or lack of rentals. I have one question. Recognizing that the zoning allowed with this, that you do have to be more than a thousand feet from the front door, is there a need to be more than a thousand feet from the front door? Yes, you can be more than a thousand feet from a school and you are, but just by 254 square feet. But I know you always go above and beyond on all your projects. So I'm just wondering if you had had any feedback from the school or any district employees on this location? Not that I'm aware of. And honestly, during the application process, Angie might be able to better answer that question about whether they, heard anything because obviously there, there could have been complaints that went in through that process, but I have not heard of any. And again, it's interesting because when you try and narrowly hit that 1,500 and the thousand square feet, there were very minimal locations that could work. And this just happened to be one of them. Well, and I also recognize there's a liquor store pretty darn close to that school as well. Yeah. Yeah. Are you aware? Were there any complaints from the school? From the school? Yeah. By this location? Yeah, it would be Country Day, right? Yeah. We did not receive any complaints. Okay. Thank you. Any questions down here? Commissioner Goldstein? No. Thank you. You have a reprieve for a little bit. Thank you. Nicole, who's our first speaker? Our first speaker is Rob Berry and then Ciceri Sherry. Yeah. So I'm here to talk about what I consider to be sort of a casual attitude about recusal. So we heard that there's the issue of, of financial interest, and that's quite clear. But the other part of it is the appearance of impropriety, which is not so clear. And the purpose of that provision of recusal is because the applicant and the public both need to have confidence that they're going to get a fair and impartial hearing out of this commission. So when we have a commissioner coordinating with a particular council member who is later going to hear an appeal, if it appears, then we have to be very careful about that. So my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my organizations that are lobbying specifically and expressly on a number of land use issues and then are sitting on the commission hearing issues about land use when they've made the position of the organization has been made clear on a number of land use issues. So I would caution you, unfortunately my only opportunity to address this issue is after the public hearing has been opened. This should have been addressed specifically before the hearing because I believe there's two commissioners here that should have recused themselves prior to the hearing. So thank you very much for the time. Thank you, Mr. Berry. Next. Cesare. Cesare, sorry. That's what I get at the doctor's office. Okay, I live in this neighborhood. I'm not a fan of the parking lot. If you're going to put in a parking lot, it should be public. That's my NIMBY part. I have mixed feelings about whether or not a cannabis shop should be there, but I'm not going to go nuts either way. However, East 14th Street and Locust Street are pretty wide. And I think the city should explore whether or not they're wide enough to have diagonal parking on one side of the street. And I've lived in that area for eight years now. I think that area could use that anyway. And frankly, the roads are really in need of some help. So maybe installing those parking spaces would help with that. So yeah, I'm literally telling you I'd rather have people park in front of my house than put this parking lot in. Okay, that's how strongly I feel about it. Thank you. Thank you. Susan Baldwin, our last speaker. Hi, I also live in the neighborhood and I feel the same way that Ciceri does. It's not an improvement for the Southwest Chico neighborhood at all. There's plenty of parking lots all up and down Park Avenue. They're not attractive. It's nice they want to put trees in. That's great. You know, beauty it up a little bit, but in the end, it's a parking lot and I disapprove. Thank you. Any other speakers? Okay. Mr. Galloway, any rebuttal? Okay. Thank you. With that, we will close the public hearing and bring it back to the Commission for questions, clarification or motions. Well, I'll go first then. I'm going to make a motion here in just a moment. But first, I want to say, as of the last storefront marijuana place, I'll oppose this one as well. And the reason I really oppose this is the fact that, you know, the city has been a bad example of the state of marijuana. And by putting this in, the city is promoting breaking the law. Quite simply, all the possession, the fixing of marijuana stuff is in violation of federal law. Marijuana is still a Schedule 1 drug. And I think we as a city are setting a horrible example to the kids in this community and elsewhere. By one, even putting a marijuana store in town. and two, by promoting something that is illegal and picking and choosing which laws we will and won't obey. And I think it's real sad that Chico has got itself into a predicament where, in order to move things along on the streets, new business, whatever, that they have to resort to an illegal business, quite frankly. And I think it's a horrible example for the community, and in particular for the kids in this community. And with that, I'll make a motion that the Planning Commission deny Resolution 23-01 and deny Use Permit 22-11, Cloud Chaser, and also to put in the fact that employees need to be U.S. citizens or legal residents. Since we haven't heard back from the lawyer, I'll make that part of the motion. Thank you. Okay, so we have a motion on the floor to deny Planning Commission adopt Resolution 23-01, made by Commissioner Wall. Is there a second? For discussion, I'll second, but I also want to point out, I'm not sure what it would look like to move to not approve something, but also put a stipulation in the permit. I'm not sure how you would do both. Yeah. Chair, I mean, this is a state attorney. I have an answer to the question posed by Commissioner Wall. Great. That would be fabulous. Great. Thank you. So in the United States and in California, foreign nationals who have permanent residence status in the U.S. can be employed under the same condition, as U.S. citizens. All new employees, regardless of citizenship, are required to provide it on hiring, appropriate documentation, establishing an identity, and employment eligibility. So what you're saying is illegal aliens are not allowed to work either in this place or anywhere else, for that matter. That's correct. So you have the foreign national with permanent residence status, and permanent status would not be an illegal alien to that person who would be allowed to work. Okay. So making it part of the motion that you must be a resident, a citizen, resident, or a legal resident to work here. That can be part of the motion. I can get some. Okay. Thank you. I'll leave it there. Commissioner Goldstein, do you still want to second? No. Okay. So is there any other second? If I can offer a perhaps friendly amendment, I'd be tempted to second if that second portion about employment requirement was removed, because as Commissioner Goldstein pointed out, it seems incongruous to deny the use permit and then add a condition on which a now denied use permit can't, technically can't. Not acceptable. So I think again, for discussion purposes, I'll second that. Okay. So we have a motion and then a second by Vice Chair Ober. Discussion? So to clarify, we're discussing denying the use permit. I'll repeat that. Yeah. So the motion on the floor is to deny that the Planning Commission adopt resolution number 23-01. Yes. I mean, I have comments on the potential of approving it, and it feels that it would be better to start with a more positive discussion towards potentially approving it. Would we be able to, I guess I'm wondering if there's a way to start with discussion on that as like a substitute motion? No, because the motion, yeah, the motion on the floor is to deny it. So we could have discussion on that and then settle that and then entertain any other motions if the votes come to a point where we- I'll call for a vote. Call for a vote. Okay. I don't have further comments, but- Commissioner Ober, you seconded for discussion. Do you want to discuss or do you want to- Well, the vote's been called, so I think that becomes a moot point. I, yeah. Okay. Okay. All in favor of the motion on the floor to deny, to deny resolution 20- Can I just ask if we, if we like, if this motion doesn't pass, can we vote on the same motion later because I still want to discuss it more? Yes. Yeah. It depends on how the votes go. Okay. Interesting. But yes, this same motion could be introduced at a later time depending on how the vote on a subsequent motion goes. Okay. Thank you. That's good to know. Really tapping into my Parley Pro skills there. Okay. And we have six people, which I, it could be a tie. Okay. So the motion on the floor is to deny resolution 23-01. All in favor signify by saying aye. Aye. All opposed. Not ready. Okay. So that motion fails with a one, five vote and one abstention. I think so. One worker. Yeah. It's cool. All right. Any other motions? Can we have some- Some discussion. Discussion. Discussion. Okay. I mean, we touched on it briefly. I think my main concern, one of the things that we have to look at as commissioners is the use permit findings and one of those is safety. So, you know, I already mentioned that I talked to Mr. Galloway earlier because I was concerned about having across the street parking lot with the pedestrian traffic and knowing how much traffic comes to and from these locations on a daily basis. I'd like my aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye employees are going to be coming and going much less frequently than the customers. So I would request that the employees park across the street first and allow the customers to park on the on-site parking. Also, another thing with the across-the-street parking that I discussed with Mr. Galloway was the wayfinding. A lot of times in development, when you want people to automatically go a certain way, you use things that are similar. So that's why I suggested can we do some of the same landscape improvements that you have across the street in the parking lot over on the on-site parking side. So that being replicate the wrought iron fence and the columns and the landscaping. One of the site plans showed that the dumpster was along that frontage, so I asked for that. I asked that that be pushed back, again, to help with the wayfinding to know that people know where to go to park when they're visiting that space. Another concern I had was that the businesses not be impacted on the opposite side. So by drawing the attention to the north side and across the street of the building by having those similar aesthetics, I was hoping that that would also solve the issue of those customers parking and other customers parking on the other side of the building. So again, just going back to the safety component that I felt strongly about with having the cross-the-street parking. So that would be probably one of the conditions that I would propose along with having the... which I think they've conducted a traffic safety plan of sorts, but re-look at that and revisit potentially only allowing the on-site parking to come from the 14th street. So my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my hands to the proper way of crossing the street by using the crosswalk. Question over. Vice Chair over. So I'm not sure if we're still able to question staff or inquire, dig a little deeper on. Yeah. Good. Thank you. So I think that the public comment regarding diagonal parking on 14th is an intriguing way of adding additional parking to this area. So I don't know whether that has been in any way considered, regardless of this project or not, on those side streets. And whether there's ever been any determination that that isn't feasible for any reason. So I don't know if staff, I don't want to put it on the spot because it may not have been evaluated. But. I'm curious whether it has. I'm not aware of that. Okay. So, so, you know, I'd be, I would love for us to know, to have that answer or for that to be a part of, perhaps even a use condition that, that that be, if feasible, that that be a part of the project. That may be a little too indeterminate at this point, I realize. But that seems like. That seems like a potential creative part of the solution to the parking challenge with the site itself. I, I, I understand Commissioner's, Commissioner Poulin's suggestions and agree with them in terms of if there was to be a parking lot in this location. Those are really good ideas for how to make it work, as well as the, the egress into the parking lot, you know, on the, on the west side there in terms of, you know, coming in through 14th. And going out on to park that, that also makes a lot of sense. And I think it sounded like, like that might be a possible adjustment that could be made. I guess I'll go ahead and offer now that I do find this project as planned. And this is specific to the parking lot, not specific to the retail establishment. I actually do find this somewhat incongruous with the general plan. I, I, as well as, you know. The, the opportunity corridor, which, which I think does, does not, while permitted. The, certainly the general plan, you know, is instructing us to do different kinds of development, including infill development and residential development in these corridors of opportunity. This one in particular, where we already have, you know, bus lines, mass transit with, it's, it's relatively, certainly given the, not Park Avenue, but the other streets, it's fairly bike friendly. So, putting, you know. Using that parcel, if it's to be used for a different purpose than it is currently. I am actually curious, it doesn't relate to this project, but I'm curious what's happening to the existing business. But regardless of that, if, you know, something else is to be done with that parcel seems to me the general plan would indicate to us that we do something different than a parking lot. And so I have pretty grave concerns about this project just because of that. Everything else about the, the, you know, the changes to the building. the specific use that is obviously allowed. It all seems like a great project. It's taking what I think the general plan directs us to do with that parcel across the street and doing something contrary to the general plan with it, and my reading of the general plan gives me pause on the project as a whole. So I'll leave it at that for now. I'm curious what others might have to say. Other comments? Sure, I think Rich already said a lot of things that I tend to agree with. I'm also very interested in the possibility of diagonal parking as well as other solutions that may make it possible to build this project, which I think in general looks great without having to flatten more of Park Avenue. I joined the commission four years ago to try to ensure that we can apply our plans, which are good. Our general plan states that we have corridor opportunity sites for infill development, for walkability, and transit-oriented growth, and part of the reason for having these corridor opportunity sites is so that we can concentrate growth there, not have to affect our existing neighborhoods as much, and redevelop places like Park Ave that have a lot of used car lots, et cetera. And so I don't feel that adding another parking lot and removing a business is what is best for or complies with the corridor opportunity site overlay in the general plan. And I would like to see other possibilities pursued fully, including diagonal parking on the streets. I actually was against removing the redesign on Park Ave, removing street parking, because it's not good. I felt that that hurt local businesses, even though I bike and I love bike lanes. I think we need to be logical here, and the city could be providing more of that parking resource instead of expecting businesses like the applicant tonight to have to buy or lease a whole building, tear it down, and build their own parking lot. So I just don't know that we've explored all of the potential options as a city for making Park Ave, and I think that's a really good way to get the city to be more eco-business friendly. And I would be interested if there's any way for this to be further evaluated and come back to us. Those are my thoughts. Any comments, Dennis? Okay. Just a couple of points, I think, on Commissioner Pullen's recommendations. I think requiring employees to park across the street as feasible would be something that I would be in favor of. You may have employees who can't park across the street, or, you know, at night it might be better to move your car around. I like the idea of replicating the columns, and I'm not a design person, but it seems to me like that would, across the street, would be in a little bit of a juxtaposition with the mid-century modern look. But I trust that the applicant could make that cohesive somehow. The gate at the corner, I agree. And I would be concerned about cars coming off of Park Ave or onto Park Ave. I feel like doing that would, and I'm not, again, I'm a traffic safety engineer either, but, the propensity to want to do a U-turn seems like that could be pretty heavy if they're coming off of their, just, I've traveled Park Avenue a lot, where I see that a lot, when you're waiting and waiting and waiting for traffic. Like Commissioner Wall, I like to follow the law. When I come in here, I probably put on my commissioner hat. It's a little bit bigger than my American citizen hat, so I like to look at following the law through Title 19 and our municipal code. And really, the applicant has followed everything that's outlined in the municipal code and in the general plan. And I often say this, we don't make decisions on what could be, we make decisions on what's in front of us. What's in front of us meets all of the city guidelines. Do I wish it was an apartment? Do I wish it was a parking lot? Probably, but that's not what I have in front of me and I don't have anything else to choose. The nice thing about a parking lot is it's cheaper than putting up a building and taking it down. And if we do explore later on that we can do diagonal parking or we have other parking alternatives, be really easy to change that parking lot into a use that we might all want to see there, like affordable housing or other businesses. You know, I trust that the applicant, you know, has said that that building is deteriorating and not probably the best use of that site either. So we're not hamstrung by what is there, what we're improving now of what that site could look like in 10 years or 15 years. I do think there is a great need for parking in this neighborhood, especially as we look at the renovation that's going on. And so I appreciate the opportunity to see that. I appreciate the opportunity to create a solution to a problem that the city is partly contributing to with what we did on Park Avenue. So I would support a motion to approve with those caveats. Can I instead move to direct staff to work with the applicant to explore alternatives to reduce parking off street for this project? I don't think we need to handle, you could. We don't have a formal motion to approve. So that could be a motion that we could. I'll second that. Could you restate that for me? I don't know if my language is quite tip top here, but I move to direct staff to work with the applicant to explore alternatives to reduce off street parking. Yes. Just to, well, I guess we do have a, that hasn't been seconded. It has, I second it. So as the second, can I clarify? Sure. So if I heard your language just now to direct staff to explore, did you say reduction in off street parking? Yeah. Or to the use of off street parking? Reduce off street parking. So as in, to clarify, reduce the need for a parking lot. Got it, thank you. Just a point of clarification. Do we have the authority to direct staff? To do anything? City attorney? I tell Mike what to do all the time when he listens, but. Wake up. Do we have the authority to direct city staff to bring back further information or to explore certain, you know, solutions that we'd like to see? Generally no. You know, the direction of city staff comes from the city manager. However, you can ask for information, right? So if you have to ask a question or you see something that's clarified, you can ask that. It brings facts a little different. It's nuanced, but there's a difference. It sounds like that probably wouldn't look like a motion and that would be more of a request. I'm not sure. Madam Chair, it's been the practice in the past to reopen the public hearing in a situation like this and ask the applicant if they would allow a continuance to come back with more information. They have a right for a decision to, for the Planning Commission to deny, approve, or approve with conditions their request tonight. Okay. Thank you. Let me think that through for a minute. Because we would reopen the entire public hearing. Okay. Thank you. Okay. Can you restate a motion that does not have the word direct in it, please? Sure. I move to request further information from staff regarding the potential of reducing off-street parking requirements. Can I offer, perhaps could we move to continue the item to allow staff to investigate? Sure. That sounds great. So if that's the motion, I will reopen the public hearing to allow the applicant to weigh in on a continuance. Just for the record, that as the second, that's fine with me too. Okay. Thank you, Rich. Would the applicant wish to speak on a continuance? So the diagonal parking is an interesting question. I think that does warrant some additional thought. I think there's two concerns at this point with that. First being timing. There is a definite timeline associated with the cannabis permit and when this is supposed to happen. So we need to make sure that there could be an extension on that. The other would be that I want to make sure that this isn't going to entail some sort of alteration or modification to Title 19. Because currently, commercials, you know, are not allowed to use on street parking, offsite parking for their counts. So and I guess a third concern would be that we've proposed this. It's been approved by cannabis committee and city and planning. It wasn't done in a vacuum by any means. This was done by a great number of great minds with our general plan in mind. This isn't the first that this has been vetted. All these brilliant minds looked at this and approved this. And a little bit of concern is, if we change this, does it put that permit in jeopardy? Commissioner Scott's comment about a parking lot being a non-permanent use is an excellent point. And I would make the case that, you know, honestly, if we find we don't need the parking or eventually we can get the diagonal parking, the market doesn't support leaving this as a parking lot. You're going to get a lot more money to have a leaseable building. But at present, there are many unoccupied leaseable buildings along the way. And we're looking at the! So to look at this as a five-year solution or ten-year solution for a problem that's in front of us right now with the thought that as that corridor improves the way it should, and I own property at the other end of the corridor, that we are improving. And so I do think, and we represent people at the other end of the corridor that are making improvements. It's going to get there eventually. It's going to be ten years. So what's the best use of this property for the next ten years? I think at this point, to serve the neighborhood, it is probably a parking structure or a parking apparatus for this building. That said, the other concern about tearing down a perfectly good building, I was advised in the middle of this that that occupant is going to leave this building and the building needs to come down regardless. So if that weighs into your decision, recognize that the building has a variety of code-related and health-related issues associated with it that are going to mandate its destruction. Thanks. Thank you. Any other further public comment? Great. I'll close the public hearing. Bring it back to the Commission. So we do have a motion on the floor to continue the item, to allow for additional investigation of diagonal parking. And we did hear from the applicant on their desires. Do we want to call for the vote or any further discussion? Yeah, I have a question. When you talk about diagonal parking, you're talking about on-street diagonal parking. Is that my understanding? Mm-hmm. Okay. Because the way the city has required it, they're requiring it. They're not going to do off-street parking. So we're asking for a major change in what is going to be required of this applicant. Are we setting a precedent? Is it... Anyway, I just think we need to be aware of on-street and off-street parking. If I could bring up a point. We looked at a project a couple years ago, an apartment complex right around the corner from this, where ordinarily they would have had to put in, I think, maybe 12 or 16 parking spaces, and they got a reduction to do three parking spaces on-site because they could do diagonal on-street parking. So there is a precedent in this same vicinity to do that. Has that project been developed? But that was also a residential use compared to a commercial use, which has different requirements and different traffic patterns. Sure. We were also talking about putting diagonal parking on Oakdale in that case, as we did down the way. Oakdale is definitely an 80-foot street. 14th, I'm not sure. Some of the side streets are 66. We'd probably figure out that it is feasible to put angled parking on 14th. What does that do for this project? They still have an off-street parking requirement. The eight additional spaces beyond what they are required to have, I would say, are available to allow us to approve a use in the unnamed suite, the suite without an occupant yet, and they would be limited to a use that doesn't generate more than eight spaces of need. Okay. So a couple of different things. Just a quick clarification. It says that 26 off-street parking spaces are required, not including company vehicles. So that wouldn't include employee vehicles. It would just be the actual company, like vans or whatever? Yeah, I think we're thinking of the delivery van, which would probably go inside the garage door and park inside. Okay. So there's a motion. How about we vote on it? All in favor of continuing the item to allow for the exploration of diagonal parking, signify by saying aye. Aye. Aye. On street. So, three. Aye. Aye. Aye. aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye May I just get a clarification on what that vote was? Who? Yes. So we had Commissioner Goldstein, Vice Chair Ober, and Commissioner Dermini in the affirmative. And we had Commissioner Wall, Chair Scott, and Commissioner Poulin in the negative. And it was a tie, so it failed. And we had Commissioner Cooper, who was recused. Thank you. Okay. I move that the Planning Commission adopt Resolution No. 23-02, recommending that the City Council approve the General Plan Amendment Rezone. Am I reading the right one? No. Excuse me. Like, we're not rezoning this. At least you can see we do our homework here. Thank you. Oh, my goodness. I move that the Planning Commission adopt Resolution 23-02. Determining the project to be categorically exempt from further environmental review pursuant to CEQA Sections 15301 and 15332. Approving Use Permit 22-11 subject to the recommendations contained therein. With the addition of recommendation conditions that the on-site parking lot, Traffic Safety'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd that the aesthetics of the parking lot also be copied over to the on-site parking lot to help with wayfinding and pedestrian safety. Could you repeat the first one? I have re-evaluated. We probably need something a little bit more concrete there. That involves the one direction, the movement to a single direction from 14th back out onto Park if feasible? Correct. If it's safer. Yeah. I think the applicant said they'll do it if they can. They just need to make work out the geometry. And maybe that might be a right turn only onto Park Avenue. Just something that... How about an additional review of the traffic pattern for the parking lot? Okay. Additional review of the traffic parking lot. Okay. Anything else? Okay. So... We just didn't have to come back to us for approval? I think we could just say based on staff discretion. So we're just throwing out a blank check to see where it lands? Yeah. Yeah. Are we able to do that as a commission? Is to approve one project with conditions that are not on the project or attached to that project? The diagonal spaces on 14th? No. We're not doing diagonal spaces. It's not that. We would turn each of the stipulations into a condition. Kelly would drop those up and send them to the applicant. And then, for instance, the parking lot issue would be resolved between their engineer and our engineering staff to make sure they approve of it. Larry, I kind of see it like when we say we want to add a fence and that's up to staff discretion. Whether it's wood, or... Yeah. Wood, or plastic, or cyclone, that staff could determine what that looks like. But the motion is not dealing with anything on 14th Street in terms of diagonal parking? No. Okay. All right. Do we have a second? I'll second it. Any further discussion? Okay. All in favor? aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye my my my my Madam Chair, we might want to ask from some of the no votes what might make them into a yes vote. What might make you into a yes vote, Vice Chair Oberg? So I'll reiterate. This is a great project. This is the applicant and the dispensary. Everything that's happening on that side of the street, I'm entirely in favor of. My objection is completely in the use on the other side of the street. If there was a creative way for the applicant and the city to resolve the parking issue, and I realize, you know, I understand Title 19, but if there was a way that this could be brought back to us resolving that issue in a different way, then I would be entirely on board and a strong yay vote for this project. So I don't know. Other than, you know. Commissioner Goldstein's proposal that this be brought back to us with some other considerations to address parking, I'm not sure how else to, you know, to turn that into a motion. I also understand the applicant's concern about the timeline. And so if it also could be expedited to address that, I'm not wanting to block this project. I'm wanting to find a different way of addressing the parking issue. So here's one option is we don't hold them to the Title 19. We hold them to the Title 19 parking requirements and we waive them for them. Right. Can we do that? Not tonight. We would like to re-notice it with that in the public notice because that does require part of the approval that we would want to advise in the notice that we would be considering at a future meeting. And I would, just for comment, I would be against that just knowing how much parking these businesses need. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Just for clarification, who were the no's and who were the yay's? Because I thought we'd that passed. Vice Chair Ober, Commissioner Dermedy, and... No, Dermedy was a yay. You were a yay? I thought we had passed. I think the no's, I think were Commissioner Wall. Oh, sorry. Wall, sorry. So it was a tie. It was a tie, so it fails. Oh, there's not a tiebreaker. Nope. Nope. Because that's why we have seven on the commission. So how about just tabling this until a specific date or an open ending one, as you prefer? So if we table it, does the applicant still have an opportunity to appeal our last decision? Because that might be a faster timeline for them than us tabling it. They can only appeal a decision. So our decision was to deny... We're just in ties. We have no decision. Typically, it would be a decision by a board or commission that would be appealed, not a lack of decision. Can the city attorney weigh in on that? Yeah. Vince, do we have a decision that the applicant can appeal? Right. I hear the discussion. So yay, nay, or in this case, a few, three, three ties, no decision on the motion. And the question is, can the applicant appeal, essentially, the tie or the no decision? My thought would be, typically, yes. There's also some... There's also some... There's also, you know, in parliamentary procedure and also in the Brown Act, it's a legally required participation in circumstances such as this by the person who has accused himself or obtained to break a tie. That's also something that is available and that's on the table. So that's something the commissioner that accused himself. So potentially, if you're just getting in these deliberations, it doesn't need to be legally required to use those over the break of the tie. That's also a possibility. Well, that's fun. So you're advising that we could bring back a commissioner who has recused themselves to break the tie without hearing the... No, with hearing the deliberations presentation, it would be the staff redo. The presentation, the applicant redo the presentation. The... It's called a legally required participation. It's set forth in the Brown Act, but it's also set forth in Robert's Rules of Order of Parliamentary Procedure, which the city follows. And the purpose of the rule is essentially to break ties. So you have a situation where you're in a 3-3. If there's something that needs to be advanced or done to break the tie, then that... That's a good point. The person who's recused himself, whether it's a council member or a commissioner, could legally participate in the decision. However, this commission, this body would have to decide whether or not he wants to do that. And then, of course, if so, a commissioner would have to decide whether or not he, if she, he wants to do that. And then the proceedings would go forward. That is, staff presentation, applicant presentation, and then a motion and a motion. So, Vince, isn't a tie vote a... Doesn't it result in a no vote in this case? It results in, yes, in a no. It's a... There's no action. So it would... So it would go on to the... So it would get appealed and go on to the council. Right. Or we could bring back the commissioner. And if they vote... If they vote no, then it would still get appealed and go to... If I'm understanding, Vince, to call in the commissioner that's recused himself, that we would have to vote and approve to bring him back in, and which means we need a 4-2 vote, and I don't think that's going to happen, but I'm willing to try. I have a question for the city attorney. Is there, in our decision to bring back a commissioner who's recused themselves, are the reasons that the commissioner recused themselves pertinent, or do we... Are we just kind of waiving whatever those reasons were to allow the process to proceed and be able to take a tie-breaking vote? The reasons are pertinent. And please bear in mind, as a commissioner, or a council member, that person, or supervisor, that person would have to agree that they're willing to waive... They are personally willing to waive the reasons why they recused themselves to participate with the body. Of course, they may not. They could say, no, I'm standing on my convictions, I'm recusing myself, and I'm not willing to participate. That's impossible. Vince, I just want to make sure I heard you correctly. So our last vote was to approve the resolution, and that had a tie and failed. So if the applicant chose to appeal that decision, they have a standing to do that? That is a decision in and of itself? Not a decision. I certainly don't know how the code speaks to the appeal process. It speaks to a decision. It's a no vote. No action was taken on that particular motion because it resulted in a tie, 3-3. So there's no action taken. So the question, decision or action taken, that's really the question. And the question then becomes, can the applicant appeal no action? My answer to that question is that person can. And the reason is, it was the foundation of... My view is it's called procedural due process. The applicant needs to have the opportunity to go before the legislative body of the city to ultimately be heard on his or her item. If that is foreclosed forever by the advisory committee, which is the planning commission, the planning commission could wield a certain power that will silence or kill several projects by increasing votes all the time. And then the legislative body of the city council would never have the opportunity to hear the appeal of the applicant. And it would be fair, procedurally, in the context of our thinking about due process for that particular act. Thank you very much. So it would be my preference that our final vote would stand and that to retain the integrity of this body. That we allow the applicant to proceed through the democratic process that we have lined out to what our last decision was. I'll also throw it out there that I'd be willing to talk more parking reduction possibilities still. It sounds like we're not. If we're discussing... Yeah, that was my thought. And maybe Mike or Kelly, you can weigh in on this. But if we were to approve this project subject to the bill, would we be able to do that? If my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my going to require you to seek a parking reduction which requires additional findings and it just seems contrary to what we're typically here for which is to say we're here to approve projects that meet the code if i could add one little tidbit of info to reading from our reduction of off-street parking there are findings that need to be made only one of them is that the site is zoned rmu or within a cos overlay we'd also have to make the finding that the proposed parking reduction is not likely to overburden public parking supplies in the vicinity and it seemed there was some disagreement there so might be difficult or challenging to make those additional findings it would be because especially because this is a cannabis dispensary and we only have three allowed in the town and we have no precedent for no more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more I'm gonna propose that we take a quick break before we go to item 4.2. Uneventful end to an eventful discussion. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. just for all those at home and for the minutes, Commissioner Cooper is back with us and is not recusing himself on item 4.2. And I will turn it over to Associate Planner Tina Wilson. Thank you very much, Madam Chair Scott and members of the Planning Commission. Item 4.2 is a general plan amendment, rezone and vesting tentative parcel map located at 442 East Eaton Road. And staff is asking for your recommendation to the City Council on this project. There's the general plan amendment, GPA 2101, from very low density residential to low density residential. So this is essentially changing that land use designation proposal to match the proposed zoning designation from RS 20, which is a 20,000 square foot minimum lot size to R1, which has a 5,500 square foot minimum lot size for corner lots and 4,500 square foot for interior lots. There are 17 residential lots proposed for this project. There were originally 18 residential lots, but it has been reduced by one to accommodate minimum width requirements and setbacks. A more more more more residential development. It's located on the north side of Eaton Road, east of Hicks Lane, and north of the terminus of Silver Bell Road. It includes one public street and one access point on Eaton Road. You can see the zoning map from our GIS department on the right-hand side of the slide. It shows the parcel in hashed lines, which is the RS-20. There are R1 zoned areas around this parcel. It's not in a sea of just RS-20. Across the street, you've got commercial services properties. In addition to the yellow is showing the other R1 to the south, and there's also... some R1 zoned property to the east. This is the tentative subdivision map. In its most recent iteration, it has an existing single-family residence that would remain. That's on proposed lot number 17, and that's on the west bottom right corner of the slide. The pool would be filled with a pool of water, and the pool would be filled with a pool of water. The pool would be filled with more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more there's a five-foot sidewalk and a seven-foot wide parkway. There was a neighborhood meeting conducted last year, and this was held online via Zoom, and there were some participants. There were questions regarding infrastructure improvements. One thing I do want to note about this particular subdivision is they're not requesting any modifications to our regulations. Everything meets Title 18, Title 19 standards and is consistent with our general plan. The project is also infill development. It's below five acres in size, surrounded by development, so it qualifies for the CEQA exemption. It's categorically exempt from further environmental review, and staff is recommending approval of this project. Our recommendation is on the first page of the written staff report, and I'm available for any questions, and I believe the applicant is here as well. Great. Are there any questions? To my left? Okay. Was there any mention or any concern about the residents leaving Street A, as is noted on the map, and turning left onto Eaton Road? I believe it'll be right turn on the right. Only I... I just didn't see that somewhere. That's an excellent question. Let me get back to... It would make sense, because then they could go around and use the rotary or the roundabout. Because that's a fairly high speed road. We're currently doing a traffic study along the Eaton Road corridor, and we're identifying whether there'll be a left turn, right, left or right turn out. Right now we're identifying access to the subdivision, but what access they'll have. So that'll be dictated by the City study then? Yes, the Eaton Road corridor study. Any other questions? Vice Chair Ober? And I've been struggling to find it here. I did read just a fairly brief, I think, report, and I'm not sure if it's in the I thought statement about trees, and I think the statement was to the effect of no trees, you know, that aren't required to be removed or should be required. One just comment, in projects like this, this is relatively small, perhaps, in scope, but in projects like this, we've really appreciated seeing a pretty specific list of trees, both designated to be left behind and to be removed. Right. And I, for one, would have appreciated that, which is just to say that, you know, maybe this will be for the applicant. I'm curious about what we think the total number of trees to be removed and left and what that treescape will look like. It's always a little concerning if a portion of the urban forest is going to be removed and then how long it takes to recover. So that's just a comment on trees that perhaps, you know, the applicant will be able to address. My understanding is that there are no trees. Yeah. That are proposed to be removed whatsoever. So. Is that okay? Yeah. Thank you. That, thank you. Sorry, I missed that. Any other, sorry, any other questions? Okay, thank you. Thank you. So we will open the public hearing and we will begin with the applicant. You're scared of us after the last item, huh? Christ my Christ my Christ my Christ my Christ my Christ my Christ my Christ my Christ my Christ my Christ my Christ my Christ my Christ my Christ my Christ my Christ my Christ my Christ my Christ my Christ my Christ my Christ my Christ my Christ my Christ my Christ my Christ my Christ my Christ my Christ my Christ my Christ my Christ my Christ my Christ my Christ my Christ my Christ my Christ my Christ my Christ my Christ my Christ my Christ my Christ my Christ my Christ my Christ my Christ my Christ my Christ my Christ my Christ my Christ my Christ my Christ my Christ my Christ my Christ my Christ my Christ my Christ my Christ my Christ my Christ my Christ my Christ my Christ my Christ my Christ my Christ my Christ my Christ my Christ my Christ my Christ my Christ my Christ my Christ my Christ my Christ my Christ my Christ my Christ my Christ my Christ my Christ my Christ my Christ my Christ my Christ my Christ my Christ my Christ my Christ my Christ my Christ my Christ my Christ my Christ my Christ my Christ my Christ my Christ my Christ my Christ my Christ my Christ my Christ my Christ something pretty cut and dry after the last item. Yeah, I'll just, I mean, not only echo that, but I do appreciate the, not only the spirit of the fact, but the fact, given the residential nature of this neighborhood, that this does in my opinion, meet what we're looking for in terms of infill increasing density a bit in a very compatible way. So, you know, many of us have been talking about that ad mauseum. People are maybe a little tired of us saying infill, infill, infill, but I appreciate that this is really aiming to meet that threshold. So I appreciate that very much. Okay. Any motions? I'll move. I move that the Planning Commission adopt Resolution No. 23-02, recommending that the City Council approve General Plan Amendment slash Rezone 21-01 and Best Intentative Subdivision Map 2102. Thank you. And do we have... We have a second. I'll second. Okay. Thank you. Any further discussion? All right. And our esteemed note taker has asked me to do a little bit better job of getting the votes and going, maybe going down the line so that she can record those. So, yay or nay? Yay. Yay. Yay. Aye. Aye. Aye. Yay. All right. So that motion passes 7-0. Thank you. We'll move on to the next motion. We'll move on to the next item, which is regular agenda. We have none. Reports and communications. None, Madam Chair. Thank you. Okay. And then when will we have a meeting on March 16th? No, ma'am. Okay. Thank you. So we will see you in April, perhaps. All right. Thank you. Thank you. Well, it's been real, y'all. I don't think they did that. I think they're still... Last I heard, they're still interviewing. I had to give them a little more.
