All right, Ms. Pressom, will you do the roll call, please? Council Member Brown? Here. Council Member Denley? Here. Council Member Huber? Here. Council Member Morgan? Here. Council Member Tandon? Here. Vice Mayor Reynolds? Here. Mayor Coolidge? Present. All right, Item 1.6, Closed Session Announcement from the February 24th, 21 Special Closed Session Meeting. Mr. Jarrett. Thank you, Mr. Mayor, members of the Council. The record should reflect that City Council reset or had a Special Closed Session Meeting on February 24th to discuss the two litigation items, that were on the agenda for the February 16th Council Meeting. Those two items were the lawsuit of Bowen v. City of Chico and Chico Scrap Metal v. City of Chico. As to both of those items, a briefing was provided by our office to the City Council. All City Council members were present for the duration of the meetings. And as to both items, direction was provided, no final action was taken, and nothing further to report. I believe the meeting went from 4 p.m. to 5 p.m. That concludes the report from Closed Session. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Jarrett. Okay, so a little bit different tonight, but this meeting is being conducted in accordance with Executive Order N-29-20. The public may view this meeting, and if you're watching us, you're viewing it either on Comcast Channel 11 or via streaming video found on the City's website. Public participation prior to the meeting, the Engage Chico Civic Engagement Program was available for citizen input on individual agenda items prior to the meeting with comments closed at 4.30, and Council, of course, having a chance to read those prior to the meeting. So public participation during the meeting via Zoom. The public can participate during the meeting by accessing the Zoom platform. I'll turn it over to the City Clerk at this point so she can tell us how it will all work. Thank you, Mayor and Council. So tonight we're introducing another meeting. It's another form of public participation, and hopefully it will work. I'm keeping my fingers crossed. I want to explain how it's going to work tonight, and please bear with me if at the next meeting we adjust as we move forward because of the needs. And this will be the first real live test. We've tested it, but it'll be the first time. So I just want to explain that the public participation is going to be via Zoom tonight. Because we are using this platform for public input, emails will not be accepted at the public comments at chicoca.gov because there isn't any way that we can staff all of these different formats. Because the public is now allowed and invited in to participate kind of in person, at least with their voices, we are not going to be using that technology. So tonight's Zoom meeting information was included on page, three of eight pages of the agenda posted on the homepage of the city's website under current council agenda. So if they're looking for it and wanting to know how they can log on, they can go to the city's website. It will say that the meeting is a webinar. It's still the city council meeting. It's just the structure that we elected to use because it gave us some additional tools for tonight's meeting. Citizens may join the webinar either using their computers, iPads or other devices, including smartphones. If they do not have any of these electronic devices, they may use their phones to call and address the council when they are called to speak. Again, the meeting access information is on page, three of the agenda and can be found also in addition to through via Granicus. They can also find it under the council page on the city's website. It might be a little bit easier. So instructions for our citizens using Zoom for the first time. You join the meeting. You must have audio and microphone capabilities on the device. You are using to join the meeting. When you join the meeting, make sure that you join the meeting with audio and follow the prompts to test your speaker and your microphone prior to joining. Please do not try to use two devices in the same room as it will cause incredible feedback and you will not be able to be heard by the council. To speak on an item using Zoom, the mayor will call the item. The staff will make their normal presentation. And then we will ask for participants who wish to address the council. If you are not pertinent to that pertinent item, please reach out to the staff. You can reach out to the staff directly on the pertinent item that pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert If you're using your phone, you will hit star 9 to raise your hand. So there's an icon if you're using your computer, and you'll see the little hand, and you just raise that. But if you're using your phone, hit star 9. Staff will call each citizen's name when it's their turn to speak. Please note that just like in-person public participation, no additional speakers will be taken once the first speaker begins their comments. The amount of time a speaker is given is based on the number of citizens wishing to address the council. I will inform the mayor of the number of hands raised, and the time allotment will be based on how many citizens wish to address the council. Each time, each item might have a different number. The council may want to discuss that. When your name is called for our citizens... You'll be prompted to unmute yourself. So if using a phone, you will hit star 6 to unmute. Star 9 to raise your hand. Star 6 to unmute. When your time is up, you will be automatically muted, even if you are still speaking. We aren't going to have a lot of flexibility in getting through this if we don't have some type of system. So citizens will still be able to see the timer. It will be zoomed in and they will be able to see that when it goes from green to yellow in 30 seconds left and red. Once it hits red, Stena will actually move on to the very next speaker. It's the only way that we will be able to get through that. I do want the council to know that there is a second or two delay between when Stena calls for the person to unmute themselves. There will be a slight delay. There will be a slight delay. Also, if the speaker can't be heard or is expected to answer the first comment that comes first, you are not pertinent to that delay. experiencing difficulties with their devices, staff will promptly move on to the next speaker. We will go back to that person once we get through all the speakers, and hopefully they will then be able to utilize the system and make their comments at that time. Do you have any questions? Any questions for the clerk? I know that's a lot, and I just asked for our citizens' patience and council's understanding as we work through this tonight, and hopefully it'll be a two thumbs up. Yeah, well, and this took a lot of preparation and planning to get in place, I know. The other thing I would ask people at home or on a phone, if you're in fact watching the council meeting some other way, whether that be on TV or on your computer, is to obviously turn that down when it comes your time to speak, or otherwise you're going to get the delay. And we've all heard those folks who call in the radio stations and hear themselves in the background. So, all right. So for purpose clarification and for a staff request, I wanted to look at item 512 and moving that and correlating it with item 5.1. So 512 is the pension obligation bonds, but it would be appropriate for it to be heard with item 5.1. So if everybody's okay with that, we will go ahead and make that change per staff's request. And if anyone wanted to speak... on 5.1...512, they should just note that they should do that under 5.1 instead. So we wanted to give you at least a little heads up at the beginning. So, all right. Consent agenda. All matters listed under the consent agenda are to be considered routine and enacted in one motion. Do we have any public comments on this item? We have Katie VanderWaal. All right. Katie, you are up. I'm muted. Hello. Thank you for taking my call. I would like to discuss the resolution of the Greater Chico Homeless Task Force. So, Katie, we actually have an item on the agenda to discuss that issue. So we're going to have you wait until that item comes forward. So this is just for items relating to the consent agenda. So I would suggest that anyone wishing to speak on a consent agenda item at this time, raise your hand. Otherwise, keep your hands down. It's not...because we have to take the items related to the item that's being called. So I don't see any other hands up for consent. All right. Do we have any council disqualifications or no votes? Seeing none, we'll entertain a motion. So it's approved. Second. First by Mr. Huber and second by Mr. Morgan. Madam Clerk, take the roll. Council Member Brown. Aye. Council Member Dinley. Aye. Council Member Huber. Yes. Council Member Morgan. Yes. Council Member Tandon. Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds. Yes. Mayor Coolidge. Aye. Carries 7-0. All right. This time we'll move on to business from the floor. Members of the public may address the council. At this time, on any matter not already listed on the agenda with comments being made limited to three minutes, or as we determine if there's dozens and dozens, and the council cannot take any action at this meeting on request made under this section. So how many speakers do we have, Madam Clerk? Well, I need to ask anyone watching via Zoom, please raise your hand if you would like to speak from business from the floor. They're starting to filter in, so it'll take just a second. Sure. Okay. I'm not seeing any other ones. Final call for business from the floor. So we have seven speakers. All right. So three minutes, please. All right. So I'll let Stina go ahead and call them. The first to speak will be Jessica Giannola. Okay. Thank you. As soon as you start speaking, yes. Thank you, Council. Thank you for moving forward with the Zoom option, the speaking option. Business from the Floor is our opportunity to really discuss, bring to attention the bulldozing, our homeless individuals that are in the park that really do not have any most to go. I can't believe that we're taking this direction. I know that the city calls for cleanup and to do something, but that's not what we should be doing. We need to be providing, as a city, more low-income housing. Our poverty rates are way more than other areas in our housing land, especially as the campfire is far lower. I wish that members of the Council would investigate more what the causation is of homelessness. It is not your addiction. It is not your addiction or violence or criminal record. The number one reason is poverty. Even people with jobs, they can't afford the rent and they don't have the workers available here. So please take a different direction. I think you made the point, we're bulldozing people, but we need to stop doing that. That's violence to the right. The city is going to get sued. You're not showing care at all for a poverty-stricken population. Those are our citizens. Whether or not you think they came from somewhere else, or you're going to take care of them, you're going to take care of them. You're going to abuse them until they leave. But if you're the one who wears that, our people's families are secure. And they may be homeless on the street, but this is their home. So please do better. Look into resources and what you can do, building codes, whatever might be. So I just expect to do better. And I'll talk to you more later tonight if you do a different agenda item. Thank you. The next person to speak will be Angela McLaughlin. Good evening. Increasing human suffering is not a solution to homelessness. Yet Sean Morgan's recent line of comment should seem to indicate the council believes otherwise. During a radio interview, Sean said, the police department is going to keep moving them, and they're going to keep moving them. The strivers were just paying the Chico, which was the great majority of them, because it was convenient and it was easy. And they heard somewhere, I can get needles and drugs and healthcare and free camping. They're going to go somewhere else. And those are people we can't help. Is there going to be a little pain in all that's happening? Yes. You're seeing it, and we'll stay on top of it. The reality is that studies have shown that most people living on our streets are from the area. Yet several local council members and many citizens in Chico, as in every city, are inexplicably convinced that people came to this city for some imaginary benefits. This is a myth that has been repeatedly debunked, and it's particularly troubling to see council members continue to spread this information. Evictions without solutions are bad for the homeless, and they're bad for the entire community. As people are moved into the avenues and alleys more desperate than ever, they are far more likely to commit crimes there. The study was done on the effect of SIT-Li several years ago that clearly demonstrated pushing people out of the downtown corridor led to a decrease in police calls in the neighborhoods. If you take safety and fiscal responsibility seriously for our community, it's time to halt evictions and find support and, yes, finance actual solutions. We need a sanction to tend to camp. We need low-barrier shelter. We need the city to commit, along with county, state, and federal agencies, to supporting and implementing real solutions. We need solutions that won't get the city sued. We need solutions that won't continue to cost thousands of dollars every week or two, all in the name of making people's lives more miserable. We need solutions that won't drive the next crime wave by pushing people into the avenues and neighborhoods and the alleys in search of something to help them make it through the night. Thank you. Our next speaker is Emily Alma. Yes, can you hear me? Yes, go ahead. Okay. The homeless situation is on all of our minds, and the evictions have been so disturbing. I have been working for many, many years on 93 Green Room. I was involved well before the present Green Light was established. I was involved with a group of people that obtained a grant that they, to establish the Green Light. I love it. It's a beautiful place. I've poured hours and hours and hours of volunteer time there over the years. And now it is a de facto campground. On the north side of the Green Room, there's, according to the enterprise record, over 75 tents, which means many more people than them, because I'm sure there are many people sharing tents. And I'm glad that those people have some place to be, even though it makes me heart sick that so much of the planning we've done, are being destroyed, and that it's not a comfortable place for the public to enjoy. But I prevail on you to allow the people who are there, and in the other places where they have settled, to stay there until the city comes up with a sanctioned campground. Allow these de facto campgrounds to stay there. My dear, the majority of city council, I don't know where you are coming from, that you think it's okay to just force people to go when they have no place to go. And so many of them are victims of the Paradise Fire, and so many other reasons to deal with, like Jessica and Angela were saying about poverty. Our city needs to find solutions. That are humanitarian solutions. I just prevail on you in spite of how heart sick it makes me that I can't walk on the Greenway and enjoy it, and the public can't do that. That I don't want those people to be moved until they have a place to go. You can find a place for them to go. You can sanction places that can be, there until the city comes up with some solutions to this problem of poverty. Please, please open your hearts. I can't believe that... Chris Marvin. Okay, we'll go to Lisa Currier. Can you hear me now? Is that Grace? That's Grace. So, yes. Go ahead, Grace. Grace, you can speak. Are you... Okay, so I'm going to go back to Lisa Currier. Can you hear me? There, we can hear you now, Lisa. Go ahead. Okay, perfect. So, I also want to express my deep... I don't even know what to say. It's a deep depression and a soul burning compromise for people getting pushed out of... areas into neighborhoods or even pushed out of anywhere right now while we have nowhere safe for them to be or for them to go. You know, I'm disturbed by this because what I'd like to see, and I'm just going to make this comment, but what I'd like to see, there are women and children that you don't see in these areas. So, what we're all up in an uproar about is the scene. And please, if we can take a look into those camps. And I know many of you have been out there, many of you know this, that there are women and children out there in hotels, homeless, you know, on the streets that are just being suffering and abused daily. Bringing bulldozers is an unhumanitarian effort. We need to start walking the path of humanity and stop looking out for our privileged selves. And, you know, I know nobody likes it and everybody thinks you need to shove them aside, shove them aside. But that's not the path that I walk. And here's the path that, as my elected officials, that I require you to walk. You are here to take care of the city. And I know that, you know, it can go either way. But humanitarian effort is the safest way. I know that I've seen gun violence. as a de facto mental health facility. 25% of those people out at the jail are mentally ill, and those are only behavioral health clients, not Feather River clients, not Enfield clients, not any other clients. So what we need to do is take a humanitarian effort. I've offered to take people out and come with me to go meet some of these people. And, Tammy, I'm reaching out to you in desperation for you to take a walk with me and see the other side instead of sitting there in judgment of what actually isn't always the truth. I'm disappointed in behavioral health saying that 75% of those people are drug addicts. It's not true. So our next speaker is Nicole Nava, and I will come back to Grace Marvin in a moment. So, Nicole? Yes, I'm here. Okay. Can I have it? Yes. Go ahead and start. Okay. So, good evening, counsel. First off, I want to start by thanking the counsel for actually making me feel safer in my safety and being able to go into the parks and waterways in some areas and actually enjoy it. I've been using my front porch for the first time in a while, and I don't want you guys to think for acting on what you said you do, so thank you. It's much appreciated. With that said, I don't take it lightly that there are people out there in crisis, and as I've stated before, I believe that there are very real solutions that can be employed to address that. But one of the things I want to point out is that there are people who would like to see them be able to stay and wait it out through pandemic. I want to point out, we've been in this situation now for over a year. That isn't reasonable. It isn't sustainable to expect people to be out there like that. Recently, we had a horrible storm. It was very windy, and I was actually very worried about the people that were out there. I was worried about the people that were out there across because it was kind of terrifying. We did have some trees go down, and that is very dangerous for people that are living out there in shelter. We also had those explosions at Comanche Creek, too. They were significant and required significant response by our local first responders, and it puts everybody at risk. There is a lot of drug use, so I do not agree with some prior speakers, and I think that maybe even the numbers higher than what the behavioral health director expressed. I believe there are mental health challenges out there that are going unaddressed, and mental health challenges do not keep regular office hours. So again, what I would like to say is that I'd like us to employ practices to push on our county to step up to the plate and our state to step up to the plate to provide actual facilities. We need a detox center. We need a mental health hub for people, and I will keep fighting the fight, and I've sent more emails, but if you guys would join together and ask our county or our supervisors, I think it would be impactful. I do want to point out other cities apparently don't require a quarantine period before entering shelter if they are asymptomatic or do the rapid testing, so I would like to see our local shelters kind of step up to the plate a bit more in exploring what other things that they can do to address this population. So please understand the people over in the neighborhoods by Windchime and Comanche Creek and the Lindo Channel are still having a lot of problems, and it is not a good situation for anyone, and it is escalating. So I again implore you guys to reach out to our board, to reach out to the state and see what we can do. And again, I want to close by thanking the council for taking some real positive strides. Thank you. So Grace Marvin. Grace, if you could unmute yourself. Can you hear me now? Yes, we can. Go ahead. Thank you. I hope that everybody here knows that the governor had an executive order at the beginning of his term because he was so concerned about homeless, whereby homeless should be allowed to stay on state-owned or managed property. If we could make sure that we have to do that in Chico, it would allow people to stay in one place and eventually get the services they need to establish a more solid existence. We in Chico have only seen an increase in homelessness with current estimates of up to 500 unhoused in Chico. A major source of that increase was the huge displacement of people after the campfires in 2018, as well as the North Complex by the end of the year. The number of homeless people Even though very many of the citizens want to help them, we just do not have enough public or private organizations that can provide them with help. Thus, there is a long waiting list of homeless seeking help. Instead of recognizing numerous citizen appeals at city council meetings, letters to the editor, and peaceful protests, the council has refused to allow the homeless to stay in areas where they have placed their tents, mostly in parks of various kinds. Even every few days, those in tents are receiving eviction notices. I'll just skip some of this and go ahead and say this is not seeming like a beloved community for the homeless or toward the council members, toward the people who live here. I share the interest of council member Scott Huber in his request to you that you make property within the shape of a house. I'm not saying that you have to make Chico available to these homeless. For example, the fairgrounds or Caltrans property. Other vacant places that the city has not considered include unused parking places, empty airport land, and vacant properties. But I beg you to make an order forbidding the city from removing the homeless and their tents from some state-owned or managed properties. Thank you very much. Thank you. And she was our last speaker. Okay. Well, that went pretty good. I'm not having a heart attack right now. Yeah. So it's better. So and for the folks who do want to comment at the beginning, obviously for not the next two items because they are technically public hearings and we have a little bit of a different process. But as we move on to these next items and get into the regular agenda, I'll ask you to raise your hand at the beginning of each item just so we can make sure who's there. So at this point in time, we're going to move on to item 4.1, which is appeal of the use permit 20-07 Greenfield and Esplanade departments continued from 11521 and 21621 council meetings and at this point in time do we have any ex parte communications? Mr. Morgan. I've talked to everybody. Okay. I've talked to the people in the neighborhood. I've talked to the appellant and the appellants. I've talked to Jim Stevens. There he is. I've talked to the developer. I've talked to the landowner. I think I literally I've talked to everybody in the world about that corner. Yeah. It's easier to say everybody than try to say individually. I would say that I talked to Jim Stevens at 1.2 for a very brief conversation, but that's it. All right. No one else? Okay. I talked to both Jim Stevens and Jamie Jen about this issue. Mr. Mayor, I just want to point out that sometimes Jim would think that talking to him was talking to everyone and I didn't want to insult him by listing all those other people. All right. So our process with this is we have we have 45 minutes for the entire hearing and so we have a staff presentation first, then council questions, of staff, and then we open the public hearing at that point in time, which is 45 minutes. 15 minutes for the appellant, 15 minutes for the applicant, and then speakers determine upon how much time there is remaining, and then we'll move forward with rebuttals, and then we'll close the public hearing and have our discussion in action. So with that, staff presentation. Mr. Mayor, can I make a point of clarification? Yes, please. We do allow public input on this, correct? Yes. Okay, because Larry said no public input. No, we will, but the amount of time depends upon how many speakers we have because the hearing is supposed to only be 45 minutes. So. All right. Thank you, Mayor Coolidge. Good evening, council members. This is a hearing for an appeal of the Planning Commission's decision to approve use permit 20-02, Greenfield and Esplanade Apartments. Located at the vacant corner of Esplanade and Greenfield Drive and North Chico, the site is zoned OR, office residential, and has airport overflight zone Z and corridor opportunity site overlays. Mr. Mayor, out of abundance of caution given everything about this case, can we move to open the public hearing? Oh, sorry. So I need to officially move to open the public hearing. Thank you. All right. We'll have you restart. I'm sorry. I'm still getting the exact way to do this down perfectly. So technically we'll open the public hearing now and have you move forward. Carry on? Yes, please. Thank you, sir. Well, just start from the beginning. Okay. This is a hearing for an appeal of the Planning Commission's decision to approve use permit 20-02, Greenfield and Esplanade Apartments. It's located at the vacant corner of Esplanade and Greenfield Drive and North Chico. The zoning is OR, office residential, in which zone Z is. The use permit is required for multifamily residential uses. It has overflight zone D and corridor opportunity site overlays. The use permit would authorize multifamily residential housing in the OR zoning district as allowed by municipal code. Specifically, the project would add 64 units on a three-acre site, mostly within a three-story apartment building located 60 feet away from the single-family residential uses that front on Eagle Lake Court behind. A clubhouse and a small commercial cafe is also included in the development. As a housing development project in the state of California, the city's ability to reduce the density or disapprove a project like this is severely limited by state law. The appeal lists four main points. Inadequate neighborhood noticing. We follow the code. Traffic safety concerns due to increased traffic. The Public Works Department has looked at the traffic. The city has paid close attention to the bagged bagged bagged bagged bagged bagged bagged bagged bagged bagged bagged bagged bagged bagged bagged bagged bagged bagged bagged bagged bagged bagged bagged bagged bagged bagged bagged bagged bagged bagged bagged bagged bagged bagged bagged bagged bagged bagged bagged bagged bagged bagged bagged bagged bagged bagged bagged bagged bagged bagged bagged bagged bagged bagged bagged bagged bagged bagged bagged bagged bagged bagged bagged bagged bagged bagged bagged bagged bagged bagged bagged bagged bagged bagged bagged bagged bagged bagged bagged bagged bagged bagged bagged bagged bagged bagged bagged bagged bagged bagged bagged bagged bagged bagged bagged bagged bagged bagged bagged bagged bagged bagged bagged bagged bagged bagged bag districts and whether or not this particular property is within a maintenance district for a nearby park is not strictly germane to the council's consideration of a use permit or the planning commission's consideration of the use permit. So we followed, we think we followed the code and we did a good analysis and we presented that to the planning commission and we forwarded the record to the city council on appeal to you tonight to take that matter up. The applicant, since that planning commission meeting, the applicant has revised the design. This is still conceptual. It doesn't lock them into this design or something else, but it is potentially more favorable than the prior design, which was a little more modern looking than this. And I wanted to share that. That's at the back of your packets from the original approval or the original appeal report. And with that, I'll answer any questions you have. Staff is recommending that the city council deny the appeal and uphold the planning commission's approval of the use permit. Thank you, Mr. Sully. Council questions? Staff? First staff. So the picture that's there, can you go forward one? What street is that? This is looking at the building from Esplanade. Okay, go back. The bottom left. The bottom left. The bottom left. Right here. Okay. And the ingress and egress for the whole spot is the upper left-hand corner? Yes. Thank you. All right. Any other questions? No. All right. Seeing none, then we'll... No, I do have another question. All right. Go ahead. Sorry. So I know this came about in a strange... Why wouldn't... Explain to me why this didn't go to agricultural... That word. Them. Before it came here. Before it went to planning. Is that... Well, the applicant only applied for a use permit. Two approvals are required. Design review by the board and a use permit that we sent to the planning commission in this case. So they only applied for a use permit. That's somewhat common for a developer to get some confidence in moving forward with construction drawings that we would be showing the board. So they just asked for the use permit. So why submit anything at all? Because they want to move forward with the project, but they want to kind of lever themselves in slowly to get approvals and then encouragement to move forward with further paying the architect to do more drawings. So the pictures I'm looking at don't necessarily in any way, shape, or form mean this is how it's going to look. The site design better look a lot like this, or we'll say that you're not consistent with the use permit. We like your ARB application maybe or not, but... Yeah. You need to revise your use permit. How do you wish to proceed? Okay. So it's going to have to look quite a bit like this. Okay. Thank you. All right. So at this point, we hear from the appellant, Jamie Jen. And she's here, so we're going to have her approach. You have 15 minutes or less, shall you determine. Okay. Good evening. First of all, I want to say thank you. It's nice to see all your faces in person. We recognize the need for development and housing, not only in Chico, but in California. And we also realize this site will be developed eventually. So with that being said, we are not here to appeal the project in its entirety. We are here when we met in November and heard the planning commission meeting. They said that the use permit could be either approved, approved with conditions, or denied. We are here. We are here to appeal the decision that it is approved, and we ask that it be approved with conditions. So several things we don't feel were adequately addressed by the developer or the city staff during that November planning commission meeting. And we felt forced to file this appeal that you guys are hearing tonight. So we strongly object to the commission findings for residential. We would like to define this neighborhood more commonly known as the Amber Grove neighborhood, that there are 607 homes which border Eaton Road to the north, as well as the SUDAD to the east, and the SUDAD canal to the west and south. The neighborhood has been established for over the past 20 years and is centered around the hard-maintained Peterson Park. There are four entrances to the neighborhood, three of those being off Esplanade, one of which is Greenfield Drive, which, as Sean mentioned, is the egress and ingress and the only for this proposed project. And the other, the fourth, being the SUDAD to the east. And the fifth, being off of Eaton Road. As a result, any residential or commercial development at this site is considered, per our feelings, a neighbor. Also, my house is literally a stone's throw from the proposed project. So I would consider anything I can hit from my house with a rock, a stone's throw, my neighbor. So bringing up the traffic that we feel was not a good idea. It was not adequately addressed. The approved use permit authorized a 64-unit residential development with a commercially used structure on the corner, which is proposed to be a cafe or coffee shop. Questions from the commission regarding vehicular traffic were fielded by the developer and city staffer, I believe it was Matt Johnson, if I remember correctly. However, the questions were only directed towards the increase of traffic from the road. The residential units. No questions were asked or answered regarding the impact from the coffee shop and the current conditions. The Ray Morgan corporate headquarters is located right next door to them to the north. On Greenfield Drive, they have 70-plus employees. And per the submitted plans, again, as mentioned, it only includes one ingress and egress driveway on Greenfield Drive. So during peak times, merging northbound, so turning left out of Greenfield Drive, so headed west, turning left north on to Esplanade to get to the freeway, the Eaton Off-Ramp Freeway, it took me tonight, leaving my home at 527, took me four minutes and 57 seconds to turn left. So, and that's with people coming in. So imagine leaving in the mornings. So, and that's with people coming in. So imagine leaving in the mornings. So I was just going to push the traffic from the apartment complex from the cafe slash coffee shop, whatever that may be, inside of our neighborhood to use our other two entrances and exits that are along Esplanade or possibly even to the Eaton entrance and exit of that neighborhood. It was mentioned in the November meeting that it is a 40 mile per hour speed limit in that area that was increasing in that specific area, which we don't find that it would be safe for people utilizing the coffee or cafe shop coming from local businesses such as Ray Morgan, the Philadelphia Shopping Center, to possibly be jaywalking to use those services that are going to be there. So our proposal is to install a signalized traffic light at Greenfield and Esplanade intersection. There was an incident and a traffic accident there about two to three weeks prior to the November planning commission meeting. Require painted red curbs along Greenfield in the residential neighborhood. Block off Greenfield Drive towards the neighborhood, similar to Wine Blossom Drive in the Epic Homes subdivision and the Seoul Restaurant Commercial Complex. Or install a second ingress and egress for the apartment complex. along Esplanade. We would also ask that the city provide a thorough traffic study of this area. We tried to get some outside traffic studies done, however pretty much all of them in our area, all the way down to Sacramento, mentioned that it was a conflict of interest. So that was a little bit disheartening that we couldn't go out and get our own study done to present to you tonight. But we did try. second an additional item that was not talked about is the hard maintenance districts. I've mentioned earlier the proposed development sits within the neighborhood boundaries of the Amber Grove neighborhood. When using realtors and appraising descriptions we define the boundaries of this neighborhood, this parcel, and that this parcel is within those neighborhood boundaries. boundaries. Therefore, this development should be part of the costs associated with being part of the Amber Grove neighborhood. Currently, the neighborhood pays for both a Chico maintenance district and the Peterson Park neighborhood park fees. The facts are that CARD lacks the funds to maintain Peterson Park and supplements the annual maintenance of the park by approximately $20,000 per year. There are no replacement reserves to replace aging and heavily used park equipment. The development is not part of this district and per CARD's definition of a neighborhood park and quoted from the CARD budget, a neighborhood park provides nearby recreation and leisure opportunities within walking distance, one half mile of residential areas. So the park is 0.22 miles from the proposed park. The park is a new complex, so under that half mile radius to be considered a neighborhood park. However, currently they're not required to pay or be part of this maintenance district and we are requesting that the council would consider including them into this maintenance district since we believe that the park is also going to be a big sale for them and their potential lessees. Third, an additional item that needs further discussion and will be discussed at the architectural review board is a non-conforming architecture, which we understand there was changes made. However, we still feel and we understand that those will go to architecture, but wanted to make it known that we still don't feel that that conforms with the neighborhood. In conclusion, city staff and developer failed to provide adequate proof to ensure pedestrian and vehicle safety to the existing residents along with non-conforming design. The Amber Grove neighborhood is an established neighborhood that welcomes any new neighbor with warmth and open arms. We respectfully ask the council direct staff on what it means to be a good neighbor and return per the COS overlay. Additionally, we did do a change.org petition for our neighborhood and others in district and district one and we have over 364 signatures which are on these papers of people who oppose the current project as it stands. And that's pretty much all I have. Are there any questions? All right. Thank you. Now we have 15 minutes for the applicant. We have Jeff Reed via Zoom and Mr. Stevens as well. You guys have a combined total of 15 minutes. I'll let you determine. Between yourselves how to figure that out. We can do that. All right. Greetings. Jim Stevens with North Star and we're representing the applicant and the architect potentially, although the use from it doesn't typically involve themselves in architectural things that's left to the ARB. Thanks for the opportunity to talk after all of this time in these trying times. Thank you. This team, I suppose, the applicant, North Star who performs the civil services and the architect, Buddy Williams, have had another project in town recently that some of you may remember at the graduate site. And it was a challenging project also and we did learn from that that we want to be good neighbors. And so we brought in a smaller project. We're not going to be doing it in the next two years. We're going to be doing it in the next two years. So the project then could have been promoted. In the COL overlay you can go to 65 feet high and up to 70 units per acre and immediately that was more or less discounted by the applicant as being too much for the neighborhood. We went back to his initial proposal of this 61 units, I believe. Moving forward, after the planning commission meeting on the the first hearing that they approved on the use permit, we heard back from neighbors and from staff and from other folks that saying that the project looked like a spaceship and was a little bit too modern. And that was conveyed to the applicant who directed the architect to tone it down a little bit to have a more classical, I suppose, consistent architectural approach. Once again, this is in advance of what we're really talking about tonight. We really, I don't have much to say because I believe the staff report that Mike prepared and was concurred by upper staff discusses each of these points pretty thoroughly. There are something on appeal item three that might be beneficial. And their concern was that there are very few three-story buildings in the immediate area. But once again, we're at about 35, 36 feet high, and we could have gone up to 65, but chose not to. So we are within the code. We are completely within the code on that. And once again, there was another concern on item three that it was too contemporary. One, we have taken steps toward that. And two, once again, this is an ARB decision and not a planning commission decision. And we're trying to be good neighbors here. I mean, we learned from last time and bring forward a project that we think is going to be consistent and certainly necessary as are virtually any housing project coming before you guys these times. And so we just would ask that you read the materials. I'm going to introduce Mr. Reid to kind of go over the fine points of his concerns. And we ask you to deny the appeal and let us know. And then we'll let you guys get to the ARB, get to the next step. Are there any questions? There are, the applicant is here and he will be conducting the rebuttal at the end. Thank you very much. Can you hear me? Yes. Jeff, yeah. Thank you. My name is Jeff Reid. I'm the attorney representing the applicant for the title that has been appealed to council. I'm not going to focus on the positive. The main problem is that the project, as I believe the staff has been doing a good job addressing that. I want to focus on the legal standards that apply to your consideration. Now some of the things I'm going to say will probably be somewhat unsettling because as elected officials, you no doubt highly regard the discretion in evaluating matters affecting your community, including matters concerning the pertinent pertinent pertinent pertinent pertinent pert pert pert pert Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Appreciate that. Did you bring any more stuff? No, that I didn't, Sean. All right. Thank you. Yeah. Thank you. Mayor Coolidge. Yes. So I had originally called Gene Ping, and then the hand went down. And so I do have two speakers, Mark and Gene Ping. So I will go with Mark first. All right. Let's take those at this time. And do you want three minutes, or how much time do you want from that? Yeah, three minutes, please. Okay. So, Mark, are you there? Yeah, this is Mark speaking. Yes. My wife was speaking on her tablet, and she tended to respond in the app crash talk. Okay. Once again, we have this problem where technology is limited to our ability to respond to this request. Okay. So, essentially, my concerns about this is that this property directly in the bus against the back of our property. So the entrance is directly next to our house. If you look at the site plan, we're the first house that you're on green fuel coming from SLA. We're the one house on the left. That's the closest to the driveway that is presented for the entire development. Which means we will have the traffic. We have the traffic from all of every single car that goes in and out of that place right behind our house. This will dramatically increase the amount of noise and exhaust that we have to deal with. And it's not an inconsiderable health issue, both for mental and physical, for the noise and additional exhaust. I didn't quite catch what the developer said about cycling. But it's pretty easy to check. The third story was directly down in our backyard. And all of the homes along that back fence of the bus, that property, have large glass doors in their master bedrooms. So every single house there will have sidelines directly to the bedrooms. So I'm concerned that the claims about the analyses that have been done are not necessarily complete. And I really would like to have an opportunity to have our neighborhood as a group there rather than... When technology can mess up our interaction. Thank you for your time. Okay, and the last speaker was Jean Ping. Jean, are you there? Okay, so she disappeared again. I don't know. We can probably have her just come in under marks if they're in the same. Why don't we give them a few seconds to figure that out. Okay. Jean or Mark, if you want to just come in the way you did before, and you want to have your wife speak on your device, that would be fine as well. He's not... He's gone. All right. Okay, so with that, we'll move forward and close the public hearing, council discussion, and possible action. I have a question. City Attorney Jared. Okay. Okay. Okay. The attorney for the appellant stated some things about the limitations that we have in terms of our decision-making based on state law. Have you had the opportunity to analyze that argument, and could you speak to that, please? The attorney was for the applicant. Was for the applicant. Yes, we have had an opportunity to review those issues. The Housing Accountability Act is a very progressive approach to housing in California, and the statements that Mr. Reed made are correct as to the law. The opportunity for the city to have advised as to objective standards that need to be followed was within that time frame he provided. 30 days after the application. The application is deemed complete. And the potential penalty issues he addressed are likewise accurate. The $10,000 per unit penalty for denial, attorney's fees, and if you're found to have acted in bad faith, five-time penalties. Thank you. Thank you. And can I quickly ask a question of the applicant for clarity? Is that an option right now, or did I miss my window? I don't know, because we've closed the public hearing. Is that allowed, so? It's up to the council. It's based on the public comment that was made. Yeah, I'm fine with it. So I'd like to ask clarification. You'd mentioned that a study was done to analyze the view. Could you come forward so we'll be able to hear your response? To analyze the view from the third story into the homes abutting this property. You said the study was done, but didn't speak specifically to the response. Was that the result of that study? Can you speak to that? Yeah, so we had the neighborhood at one of the meetings. I can't remember which meeting, but I had my architect. I believe he's on the Zoom meeting. His name is Buddy Williams. He's with Studio KDA. Coincidentally, he's the same guy that did the architectural design for the graduate. But yeah, I know Buddy worked with the neighborhood group and our project design team to identify what the most efficacious way to design the project would be in a manner that had, you know, windows that didn't face and view into the neighbor's backyard, right? So I know we have specific setback requirements from the planning department, and we exceeded those setback requirements out of a courtesy. And we also repositioned the windows in a manner that didn't look down onto the backyard, right? So again, we took feedback. We brought it back to the roundtable. We made a redesign. We repositioned the windows and the project and the setbacks and made it work. Thank you. I appreciate that. Yeah, certainly. All right. Any further questions? Mr. Mayor, before you... Go ahead. If he's done, we should allow the rebuttal by the appellant, given that there's been a couple of statements made after Ms. Jim was given the opportunity to provide rebuttal testimony. Makes sense. Ms. Jim, would you like to come forward? I will stand up. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. We are asking for that traffic study. Was it required? No. But we're asking for it. And if you're so flexible, Mr. Gillian, why not provide us with that? I don't see an issue. I know we only had... Sorry, I didn't see a timer. Well, we don't have one running, but I'm pretty sure we're over the three. Yes. So thank you. Thanks. All right. We'll reclose the public hearing. Council discussion and action. I've got some discussion points. So this is kind of around the corner from my house. I mean, it's farther than a stone's throw. Well, my kid could probably throw a stone that far. I first went to Brennan Veague. I'm like, how did this monstrosity end up here? No one in their right mind that was from Chico would put it here. Now, granted, this was the old spaceship design. It was horrid. And then I got a call. I got a call from the developer, and we talked. I'm like, okay, seems pretty reasonable. And they changed it. I think it's better. I would not want it in my backyard, certainly. I think reasonable. You know, different questions, and I've talked to Brennan Veague a bunch about it, the developer a little bit, Jim Stevens a whole lot. And we got the letter. We all got the letter from the developer's attorney. He's an awfully nice guy. And then it really came down to, and Brennan pointed this out to me a long time ago. He said, Sean, what's happening in California is just the loss of local control. And we're seeing it in development like this. We're seeing it with things like marijuana. We're seeing it with even now needle distribution. And I absolutely support the community going, you know, when somebody's saying, well, it could be a lot worse. And it could be. It could look like the Ray Morgan building. I mean, I don't know how that happened. That was just, and no one does, right? No one's, I don't know what happened here. We can't figure out. Thank God they're not doing that. So those are just like general comments. And I appreciate what Mr. Stevens said. It was interesting to hear what Jamie said. I mean, if you drive, you got to drive another mile down the road before you see a three-story apartment building. And how well does it fit? So maybe this is the time we have that conversation. Apparently it's not, right? The planning commission just follows all these checklists and does this, this, this, this. I also agree with Jamie that, you know, at some point, it's hard to imagine that. How many cars with that one ingress, egress, not having a really, really big impact. That's all my comments for now. I want to hear what everybody else has to say. All right. Any other comments? Mr. Hewer? I had a question for the city attorney. In the comments that the developer's attorney made, it sounded as though going back and doing a traffic study would be disallowed? At this point? Did I understand that correctly, what he said? Yes. The problem, Mr. Hewer, it would be disallowed. I mean, they can do a traffic study if they offer. Right? If. It's not, the city can't request it necessarily, but we can do one if nobody agrees. For the use permit. Does something prohibit us from doing a traffic study? At this point? Yeah. You'd be on thin ice. Meaning, Mr. Reed has indicated their intent is to not agree to do one. Okay. And to challenge the city's ability to do it. Can a traffic study be done if they wanted to voluntarily allow for that? They certainly could. But I'm not hearing that from the project applicant. Could one have been done at the time that this initially started? Yeah. One could have been done. One could have been required. But it goes back also to your comments about the state taking away local control. And on top of that, the city having standards in place. So if you had a city code that said, a traffic study shall be required for every project, that would be one of those. And it had some standards about traffic that were objective standards. If those were in place, then at the time that Mr. Gillen provided his application, staff could have said, your project needs to meet these standards. But to the extent we did not have that, you can't require it now. All right. Anyone else? I've got a follow-up question to that. And maybe I heard it wrong, and I'm not arguing with you by any means, but it sounded like we couldn't go back and do a traffic study and make that a condition of approval, but we could still do the traffic study so we know. I'm more concerned as a safety standpoint. If we do a traffic study and find that there is a huge impact, isn't it then in our best interest to take care of that during the building process and during the approval process? I'm not saying we would deny, but it's information that we should probably know. Anyways. I guess it comes down to if you approve it and with the condition that a traffic study needs to be done, then what do you do with that information? You can't then say, we've got this traffic study now, and we need you to make changes to your project. That ship will have sailed at that point. Thank you. All right. Any other counsel? No. I remember, I can't remember who else was here. I think you were here. When we had a, and I know the skipper was here. We had a local judge order us into a meeting and tell us to take a vote and have a vote on it. Yes. This is what this feels like. Yes. It might have been, well, that wasn't over the jail, was it? It was over the, I don't want to mention the scrapyard. Oh, yeah. All right. I can say, well, I would like to say that it's never really appreciated when someone thinks they need to tell us our job exactly and how to do it. So it's never a warm and fuzzy feeling. And I think we're all up here, and we've learned how to do that. So that's my only comment. So at this point in time, we'll entertain a motion. Thank you. I'll make a motion to deny the appeal. Do we have a motion? Do we have a second? I'll second. All right. Madam Clerk. Let's make sure we actually do this so everybody understands exactly what a yes vote means and a no vote means. So to deny the appeal and allow the project to move forward, you would vote. Right. The motion was to deny the appeal and uphold the Planning Commission's approval by adoption of the following resolution. Council Member Brown. Just one point. One moment. That motion is encapsulated in the resolution that's presented to you for consideration. All right. Okay. Thank you. Okay. So Council Member Brown. Aye. Council Member Denley. Aye. Council Member Huber. Yes. Council Member Brown. Aye. Council Member Morgan. No. And I expect the Architectural Review Board to have a good time with this project. Council Member Tandon. Aye. Vice Mayor Reynolds. Aye. Mayor Coolidge. Just because I don't agree with the project. No. It carries 5-2. All right. We are going to take a 10-minute recess at this point. Sorry. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Grab a door for us, please. All right. We'll move on to Item 4.2, Development Agreement 18-01, Courtesy Automotive Center, Ex Parte Communications. We'll start over here. Mr. Morgan? No one? Anyone? Me either. So we will open the public hearing. I'll do this right this time. Mr. Solley, go ahead. Thanks again, Mayor Coolidge. This is a development agreement proposed between the JP Real Estate Investments, LLC, also known as Courtesy Automotive Center, or just Courtesy, and the City of Chico. It involves a project site located at the very north end of Chico. It's 11 acres on the east side of Garner Lane between Esplanade and Highway 99. The site is also adjacent to the Green Line to the west. Mostly zoned CC, the parts closer to the freeway. It also shares a zoning district with manufacturing properties on 3-7's Lane, closer to the Esplanade. The site plan lays out the auto dealerships, the showrooms for the new auto center along the freeway, facing the freeway with a large colliery. The site is a vision center located back on the property with employee parking also toward the back end of the property, closer to the Esplanade. And we like that design. It helps us maintain the Green Line and kind of focus the energy of the project toward the freeway, where it wants to maybe get some traffic coming in. The project was taken to the board last year, and the Architecture Review Board approved the design. Lots of compliments on the buildings and the design. So the history. And the history. It involves time before this was part of the city. It used to be in the county, and courtesy did a lot of work with the county to get some plan amendments in place, set up them to build there in the county. And the county did a lot of review of it, including environmental analysis, and they adopted some mitigation measures in anticipation of this project being built there. Then the city came along in September of 2017 and annexed the property before courtesy pulled building permits. So the project was designed in the county. More or less improved in the county. They just didn't get building permits. And upon annexation to the city, now they needed city building permits. And when you look for city building permits, we ask for curb, gutters, sidewalks, things that the county doesn't ask for. So that prompted courtesy to propose the development agreement. We've been working that out since. The project's a little bit different than envisioned in the county, and that's part of the reason why it took us a couple years to get here with this. You are seeing tonight a version of the, you know, the original plan, but it's not the original plan. We're going to have to do a new development agreement that's not the full version that we started with, that we've been talking about. Tonight it's pretty much just a development agreement that would allow courtesy to develop the site to county road standards, and then upgrade the city curb, gutter, sidewalk standards over some time over the next 20 years. We would have, the city would have liens on the property to assure that these improvements would go in eventually. And part of the development agreement would also include the mitigation measures that the county adopted, because they did a fine job analyzing what would happen if we built the property. And it's not just a motor, courtesy motor here. And part, one of those mitigation measures is an important improvement at the intersection of Garner at 99. People have to wait a long time to get out onto 99 from Garner Lane, especially if you're making a left. And these improvements would change the configuration of that intersection to allow a lot more people to make a left out of there. And that's one enhancement that is being brought with the project, and we think that's a really good thing. Other minor aspects of the agreement. If you wanted to ask any questions about that, I can explain those. So we are supporting of this agreement because it would avoid jeopardizing the construction of this project that was designed before city annexation took place. They are a major sales tax generator in the city, so it's important that we retain their operations in the city, even though we may allow them to develop to county standards per the development agreement. That's pretty much it. I'll answer any questions if you have them. Questions for staff? Early, early on when they were first starting to annex this, we talked about the attitude of staff to help get to yes. And I know this was a long time coming, but I watched a lot of different steps, including meetings in Mark's office, about how we worked with the developer, the county, and others to make this happen. And these are the type of things that we're working on. And I know that there are situations that the public doesn't necessarily always hear about. And I know it took a long time, and there's just a great effort by everybody to work through all that. And I thank you for it. All right. I had a quick question on the, you said it was going to improve the entering on and off of 99. Is that coming towards the beginning of the project, or is that in the 20 year? Those improvements at Garner 99 are required to be in place before occupancy in any of these buildings. So they want to break ground as soon as possible. Great. Awesome. It's good to see that coming sooner, and then the curb and gutter I'm not so worried about later, but that'll be great to have that out there. Thank you. All right. Any more questions? All right. So we have up to 15 minutes for the applicant. Anybody present or on Zoom? Yeah, I believe James Seagert will be on the line with the applicant in his office. Okay. So if, if you're not sure, I'm sorry. If they could please raise their hand. There's, there he is. Okay. Just a second. Okay. Go ahead, James. Hello, can you hear me? Yes. Okay. Well, hello, my name is James Seagert with Garner Building. I'm here with Jerry Paju. And Diane Paju, the owners of the Currency Office there. As Sean mentioned, we've been working through this for about four or five years now. It's been a long process, working through the transition from county to city jurisdiction. I think that after a lot of work, it sounds and feels like we're basically on the cusp of pulling everything together, satisfying the needs of the community. I know that I've seen that I've seen that I've seen that I've seen that I've seen that I've seen that I've seen that I've seen that I've seen that I've seen that I've seen that I've seen that I've seen that I've seen that I've seen that I've seen that I've seen that I've seen that I've seen that I've seen that I've seen that I've seen that I've seen that I've seen that I've seen that I've seen that I've seen that I've seen that I've seen that I've seen that I've seen that I've seen that I've seen that I've seen that I've seen that I've seen that I've seen that I've seen that I've seen that I've seen that I've seen Thank you for the opportunity to speak in front of you. Mike Sully, thank you for the presentation. And the time that we spent together in cooperation from Mike Sully and his staff has been phenomenal to work with. It has taken us a long time to get here. We're very excited about our project and being able to put the shovel in the ground, if you will. We're excited about our move and having a presentation of a globally known product that we sell here in Greenwich and North Chico. So we're very fortunate to be in this community and be able to go forward with this project. And I'm open to any questions that you may have. All right. Any questions? All right. If you're concluded, we can move forward. Thank you. Thank you. All right. Thank you. Appreciate your time. Madam Clerk, how many speakers do we have on this item? Well, we don't have any hands up, but I would like to ask if there's anyone here wishing to speak on this public hearing to raise your hand. Thank you. That's fine. Give it just a second. I don't see any hands going up. So I don't have any. All right. So technically a three-minute rebuttal for the applicant, but I'm guessing they'll want to pass. Mr. Segret, are you still there? No. All right. Okay. So we'll move forward and close the public hearing at this time. Council discussion and action. I have a motion. Do we have a second? Second. I have a motion and a second. Second. Who? Tammy? What was the second? Sorry. That's all right. Ordinance. Ms. Presson, you can take the role. Okay. I'm sorry. My computer froze. Lots of different things right now. So. Okay. And then who was the actual seconder? Tammy. Tammy. Okay. Thank you. Council Member Denley. Okay. And that motion was to introduce an ordinance of the City Council of the City of Chico approving the development agreement between the City of Chico and the City of Chico. And that's the City of Chico and J.P. Real Estate Investments LLC, DA-1801, City of Chico, slash J.P. Real Estate Investments LLC. Council Member Brown. Aye. Council Member Denley. Aye. Council Member Huber. Yes. Council Member Morgan. Yes. Council Member Tenden. Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds. Aye. Mayor Coolidge. Aye. Carries 7-0. Thank you. All right. If in fact you want to speak on this item, please raise your hand now. And we'll move on to Item 4.3, Hearing Ordering Formation of the Maintenance Assessment District A42, Merriam Park North. Mr. Adubani. Yes. Good evening, Mayor, Vice Mayor, and City Council members. Item 4.3 before you is a hearing to form Maintenance District A42. A condition of approval of a final subdivision map requires the property owner, in this instance, MP, Merriam Park North, to approve the! Operating Operating Operating open the public hearing. Madam Clark, any speakers? We don't have any hands up and you had introduced that at the beginning and noticed that, so I am not sure that we have any speakers. Alright, so we will close the public hearing at this point and entertain a motion from the council. Move to approve. Second. Motion from Vice Mayor. Second from Council Member Morgan. Okay, Council Member Brown. Aye. Council Member Denley. Aye. Council Member Huber. Yes. Council Member Morgan. Yes. Council Member Tandon. Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds. Yes. And Mayor Coolidge. Aye. Carries 7-0. Thank you very much. So we're going to move on to the regular agenda at this point, item 5.1. If you're interested in speaking on this item, please raise your hand now. And Mayor Coolidge, that was a consolidation of 5.1 and 5.12. Thank you very much. As we discussed originally. So if you want to speak either on 5.1 or 5.12, you would do so with this item. And this is the five-year projection update as well as information regarding the pension obligation bonds. Mr. Dowell. Good evening, everyone. Thanks for the opportunity to come and give you an update on our how we're doing financially. Forgive me, I ran over from the other room and I'm catching my breath. Anyway, it is good to be here. So for our new council members, we try to give these updates on the five-year projection for our general fund. And what we've found is it's a helpful tool to take current financial data and look how that applies to the future. And we started really focusing in on this the last few years and I think it's been a helpful tool for council as well as staff. So I won't go through every line here, but this is really 5.1 of your agenda here. So as we look through this, there's multiple lines here, but this column here is really the actual information for that year, 1920. And then this is the estimated finals for the current year that we're in that would end June 30th. And then we have these four additional years, projected out. The top section here deals with our revenues. And then we come below here and we start getting into our expenditures. Under the expenditure section is an area that's highlighted in red. And this is the area with salaries and benefits, but it also talks about CalPERS retirement employer contributions. And then the second line is, CalPERS employee contributions for MPEC. That means, that's the amount that the employees are I'm sorry to say kickback, that's not the correct word, but they're kicking in towards the employer portion. So that's been negotiated through the unions. So employees are picking up a portion of the employer cost, which is really a phenomenal thing. I think years ago the city employees didn't even pay their share. Now they pay their share, plus they're starting to pay a share of our share as a city corporate. That next item is a potential savings from POB issuance. That's on another slide here that we'll talk about. So I want to give you two scenarios. One scenario is without pension obligation bonds. And then the other is with the effects of a pension obligation bond scenario. So you can see this area here. It kind of continues down. The green line down here is kind of saying net operations before capital expenditures. We want that to be in a positive. You don't want that to be a negative. Okay? Scrolling down, we come to this next page. And this item up here used to we have it highlighted, and this was the line item that I hated. Because what it represented is in order for us to have a balance, a positive cash flow balance going forward in future years, this meant we would have to do some type of cost reduction. You can see here as we're sitting here today looking forward, we don't have that in our distant future. So the city is doing the best it's done financially in several years. Okay? We've recouped, and this last year we were in the middle of a crisis. We were able to become fully funded on the general fund side. Which has not happened, and I say fully funded with our reserves. That hasn't happened in many years. I'll say at least 10 years, probably. Yeah, 2013. Yeah, 8 years. At least 8 years. So we're in the best footing that we've been in in many years. Would I say that we are super healthy with everything ready to go? No. I wouldn't say that we're 100% healthy. But I'd say that we're 100% healthy. I would say that we are doing much better than we were before. We are preparing for the future and the next steps that we have coming forward. And this is monumental in that we're not looking at doing reductions here in the next 5 years. So as you can tell, and you look through, you come to this section here, net revenue over under expenditures before other sources. There's some negatives, some positives, and we have transfers. Net revenue or benefit, you can see positive, and then these next few years, they're negative. Okay? So as we're looking at it, we're not having to do reductions to maintain a positive cash balance, which is this bottom line here that we look at. You can see this last year, we finished with almost $15 million in the general fund. Okay? If we don't, if we keep status quo, we'll still have a positive cash flow balance of $1.4 million in 5 years. That is really, that's good. I mean, you would always want to be growing just to maintain the needs, but this is a positive thing, as I said, where I sit in the finance seat. We have what we call a desired operating reserve, which is a minimal amount that we like to keep. In that account, you can kind of see here in year 3 or 4, we start to get below that, but we still have a positive revenue, a positive cash balance. So this is good news. It's not perfect news. As a finance guy, I'd always like to see it be better, but we're not ready to go into bankruptcy. So that is great news from the city management, and as you as counselors, thank you for your guidance and direction. If I can, I want, if there's any questions, do you have any questions on that concept or what we talked about? Because I want to show you Oh, go ahead. If I could, I just want to recognize this is extraordinary. Sitting here today, from when I got here almost eight years ago, this is absolutely extraordinary. And I know being some of the newer council members don't know what we went through the past, for those past years that we had to go through, this is absolutely incredible. I never thought we would be sitting here this quickly with the condition that the city was in when I first got here. So I just want to compliment city council for the diligence that it's shown. I want to thank city staff for the perseverance that they've shown, because like Scott had mentioned, they weren't even paying all the employee share, let alone the city share. This city has moved mountains over the past number of years. And I just felt I needed to say that. It's easy to look at this and go, oh, okay, we're doing okay. It's been an extraordinary moving of mountains for many years now. So I just want to echo that. Thank you for all your work and the finance team. So, anyway. Thank you for sure. Appreciate those comments. And as Mark was sharing, we've come a long way. Then if I may, those comments are well deserved. Yes. So, again, it's not perfect. So as staff, we're always looking and going, okay, are there ways to really maximize our resources? And so these next slides is a possibility. So you may recall back in January, we talked about issuing pension obligation bonds. And the concept is we have a debt to CalPERS. It's called an accrued, unfunded accrued liability, which represents if everything was to stop it today at a certain time frame, the assets would not be enough to cover the liability. Okay? Almost, I would say, 80 to 90 percent of public, public agencies in California have a very large unfunded accrued liability. So we are not alone. We have that. We do not have others have what are called OPEB liability, which is for like insurance when retirees retire and they pay for lifetime medical. We don't have that here. So we don't have a huge liability that other cities do. But we do have this pension obligation. And it's approximately $146 million. So in January, back in September, we started with coming to the Finance Committee and said, hey, we've done pretty much all we can do from a financial standpoint to stop the bleeding or minimize the bleeding with CalPERS. This accrued liability. There's really only one other thing that we can do. And that would be to issue pension obligation bonds. So the idea would be to take this pension debt of $146 million that is on our books. We reflect that in our annual financial report. And restructure that at a lower interest rate. This debt is at a 7% rate. Restructuring this and issuing bonds at a rate between 3 to 4%. Because the interest rates have dropped so far. So we brought this concept to Finance Committee. Again, just kind of taking baby steps. Let's educate ourselves on it. Finance Committee recommended that we bring it to the full council. So in January we brought that. We brought in a firm to come and talk about that. And describe that. So taking that information we looked at one option which would be to take that debt and refinance it over 20 years I believe is what the scenario is here. If that happens, what would it do to our cash flow, particularly for the general fund? So that's what this screen here represents. So, and I'm just going to pop down here back here to the red line here. Potential savings from pension obligation bonds. So this is just hitting the general fund only. And that's approximately 75% of the savings that we shared. The other 25% would be reflected in other funds. So you can see that it becomes significant and it becomes even larger in the years following. Mr. Dowell, just a quick question. Is that the 20 year? Yes. So the concept it would be is that we took the shorter return, shorter life to restructure but we have many options to choose from and that would be the part two of my presentation or discussion is kind of giving, wanting to get some more information so we can come back to you. So these savings are here. You can see we're going to, forgive me as I jump down here, you can see as we continue on, look at how the cash flow, the cumulative cash flow continues and we would still have a positive operating reserve. Okay? So we wanted to show you a before and potential after effects with that. So this is kind of the 5.1 part of my presentation. I don't know if you want to bifurcate out if there's questions on 5.1 and then I could go into 5.12 or however you want to proceed. I think we can round up questions at the end. Okay. Perfect. So with this information that you have here, staff is coming to you and asking now for some direction. So in the staff report it kind of summarizes some things but basically our next steps with this, which does not obligate the city to anything, it's just taking this next baby step forward. And that would be going through a legal validation process. What that does is we take our records to the courts and we hire a legal firm to come and do that. Take our records to the court and have the court walk through a process with us to see if it would be legally feasible for us to issue bonds. It's almost like taking yourself to court. But to get that verification and that approval that you could legally issue pension obligation bonds. Now the cost of that is about $25,000 to $30,000 to do that scenario. It would take about four months to go through. At that time we would also like to continue with the education and running through scenarios. So for instance the one scenario I said was let's pay off the bonds as soon as possible. But there are other options that we talked about in January. You could have a longer payoff which would mean more cash savings earlier on. But you would incur more interest over time. But it would be coming and taking and doing some number crunching. Doing what's called stress test. Working with our outside consultant to come back with scenarios and say okay here's what we work with staff with. Here's options here. If this happens like for instance if the stock market crashes what would happen? How would that affect you? Those are stress test scenarios that we would come back through. Primarily we would work with the finance committee. I think it's probably a logical place where we can kind of walk these through, these scenarios through and then before it comes back to council. So we're asking tonight is basically if you would allow us to go forward with the legal validation process with that funding of up to $30,000 and the public education and continue analysis by the municipal advisor between $10,000 to $20,000. We would like to see that and once you do a legal validation it stays with you. So it's not like it becomes stale after two months or three months or a year. It stays with once it's done it's almost like you're pre-paying for it. You're creating another asset that you could draw upon later on. Why we're coming with it today is interest rates are at historic lows. There's some volatility there. They may start to go back up. And so we think it would be prudent to start this process now because if it takes four months we want to be prepared. So that's kind of the gist of what we're looking at today and I'm happy to answer any questions. Alright. I actually have a question. So the court process for the issuance of the bond, is that just relative to a pension bond or Just pension. Just pension. So if it was any other type of bond you'd have to go through that process again? Well each categories of bonds have different requirements. Okay. And then is it relative to a time period as well? So let's say interest rates spike up for a couple of months we want to sit and wait and then we finally go down. What's the time period that you can take? So my understanding is if you do a legal validation it's pertinent for an extended time almost like permanently. Once it's done it's done. Okay. And so you don't have to come back even if it's. So we don't even have to come back? You don't have to come back. Let's say in a year from now you may wait a year and go hey let's do it now the rates have gone even lower now let's do it. We've already done our validation process. Okay. Perfect. Thank you. Any other questions? You had mentioned on the doing the 20 years and that 75% of the savings goes to the general and 25% goes to the other. Is that something that's locked in or is that something that is presented back each year? Or is that just a you mean like the share between the two? That's just an estimate. It's just the best. We kind of use that when we talk about a global liability approximately 75% of that's general fund. Again I tend to focus on the general fund because as the general fund goes so does everything else because there's so many things funded from that. Great. Thank you. And then do you know how often these are denied? The court process? According to our consultants I have not heard of any being denied. And there's a lot of agencies, they're very popular right now because everyone's trying to take advantage of the low rates. In fact, you know the city manager has had this on his horizon for several years and it's always been, we've always talked about going it just doesn't make sense the rate, it just doesn't make sense. And now is one time where we go okay if we're going to do that it seems reasonable time to approach it. Yeah. Well and I was just wondering if that ever occurred. I hadn't heard a specific case. Okay. Any other questions? Just one last thing. I know that there are tons of people that get super freaked out about the whole bond process. And I know that when I met with the consultants individually they did assure that there's a pretty robust public hearing part that I just kind of want to get on the record in case they didn't hear it when you, where there will be public education and time for people to come in and learn about it. And if we make this step this is just setting the step that we want to get certified and we are not locked in to doing anything in the future. I just, as I tend to the, I probably will vote yes on moving forward with this. I just want to make sure that just because we take this first step doesn't mean we're taking out bonds. You're correct. Yeah and I concur with the Vice Mayor. I think you know this is just due diligence. Although I like the baby step analogy. It means we're moving in that certain direction. I think we're just exploring it as we need to and it needs to be explored thoroughly. So I would agree. So any other comments or Alright so speakers on this item? Okay I would like to ask those of you who are listening if you would raise your hand to speak on item 5.1 which was the five year projection update and then the additional item of 5.12 which was related to the pension bonds. Thank you Mr. Duck. We have a few. So we have four. Let me, I'll just skip adding their names in. So the first speaker would be Katie VanderWaal Cook and this would be on these items that we're talking about. Hi, thank you for letting me speak. I would like to speak about the pension obligation bonds. I'm very much against the city going forward with this. This is what drove two cities in California into bankruptcy. Both Stockton and San Bernardino. As a reminder, the market always wins. What is our plan B when the market wins this time and Chico loses? Thank you. Thank you. Okay. And then the next speaker is Angela McLaughlin. So Angela, are you there? Okay. So we'll move to Jessica Giannola. . Okay. So this will be Angela McLaughlin. And if you could mute Jessica, please. . Okay, go ahead. . . Okay, so Angela, you are good to go. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . citizens living in the ground. We have a high population of folks without homes, so we need HUD staff, so we need sponsors, HUD staff, whatever it might be. We have a housing deficit in our city, and you're discussing the funding of our future, and you can't keep ignoring our present needs. Our people, everyone, all of us, you, me, everyone, taxing, not taxing, we're all working to invest in our health and safety for the entire city. We'll come from a criminal, we'll be away, ignoring or ruining our house of citizens. And then these children, to be unified as upwards of 500 homeless children are at risk of being homeless. So we need to budget for our needs that we have right now. They've been existent for decades, but over the last few years, we just can't form. And I just don't understand why we're not including anything that has to do with sheltering, low-income bills, permit, fee waivers, incentives for investors and builders to get on board with having the creation of more low-income housing. We have to do that. This homeless situation is not going to go away. It's only getting worse. And I just would like to see the city acknowledge that and do their part in resolving that issue by asking for its resolution, real resolution. That's all for now. Thank you. Thank you, Jessica. And then our last speaker is Nancy Wirtz. Okay. So Nancy, if you can unmute yourself, please. Hi. Okay. Are you there? Hello? Can you hear me? Yes, I can hear you now. So go ahead. Thank you. I'm a little late to the party, but I saw the chart of the next five years of general fund balances, cash forward. And I was... pleased and impressed that there is a cash forward now, which will take you through five years of deficit spending. So I wanted to say thank you, previous council. And I don't know enough about bonds, and I will struggle to learn about it, but I don't have anything to say about that. I just thank you. I'm done. Okay. So we do have one last speaker, and that's Lisa Currier. I apologize I didn't catch that one. So Lisa? Yeah, I'm here. Okay. Go ahead. ahead. So I want to echo what the other people said. I also want to congratulate the previous council for and the city staff for working through five to eight years. We're looking good. But taking out bond measures is kind of like, you know, getting an extra bonus paycheck and spending it all right at the moment that we get it. So I'd like to see us continue to have this growth and have growth in our infrastructure and growth in housing for our most marginalized or, you know, some kind of health there. I also, I'm not a big fan of bond measures. I, you know, we're over in the Bay Area, you know, it just never seemed to work out very well. And that's fine. But thank you for getting us to where we are now. And let's keep it going and let's keep bonds off the measure. Okay, thank you, Lisa. All right, that was our last figure. Yes. That's it. All right. Mr. Dowell, could you come back up real quick? There was just something I was hoping you would address about maybe the city stocked in in terms of their bonds and the issue that they got into. Right. They did not go bankrupt because they issued pension obligation bonds. So they had significantly different issues. And I'm not even sure the pension obligation bond, they had issued pension obligation bonds to my knowledge. They definitely did not have revenues to meet their expenditures. So pension obligation bonds in this case again is we're trying to take one debt and restructure it in another format at a lower interest rate. Some people can think of it as like refinancing their home. The challenge with that is CalPERS UAL can continue to grow even if we've refinanced it. So that's one of the risks that's there. But again, I'm not aware of those particular reasons being directly related to a pension obligation bond. I think it was maybe their pensions rather than their pension obligation bond is my understanding of Stockton's issue. Do we have any further questions or any discussion by council? I have some discussion. Fire away, Mr. Warren. And you just pointed this out while I was asking Mr. Dowell. Part of the challenge with the pension obligation bond is people confuse the pension and the bond and they go Stockton went bankrupt because of this and this place went bankrupt because of this. So as the chair of the finance committee, I thought it was important that I understand this pretty well and I did not. So we got what I would consider the best financial minds in the city together privately. They privately funded to have the consultants come in and tell, tell them this is how this makes sense. We had a private meeting once that Scott attended and we had some very, very smart people not in the beginning to Mr. Dowell's point. They said, okay, this is as simple as we've got a mortgage at 7% and we can refinance at 3.5%. Why wouldn't we do this? And there was a big long discussion about it can't be that simple, it can't be that simple, it can't be that simple, we're missing something, we're missing something, we're missing something. So then these private entities paid for the consultants to come in for the day. We went for, I don't know, three hours of discussion and came back to the fact that at the end of the day we pay 7% to CalPERS on the $149 million in change. And because, as just was noted, the city has done a very, very good job, which started eight years ago and had very little to do with the last council, started with Mark Sorensen, we have an unbelievably good credit rate, something we did, did not have years ago, something that Mark Warman, Chris Constine, Scott Dowell, and Barbara Martin and those people helped walk us through. The biggest risk is if the CalPERS rate drops to 3.5%, whatever we end up borrowing the money at, and then we're not really saving anything. But every time CalPERS lowers their rate, CalPERS is run absolutely horribly. It's run by the unions, for the unions. It's the most worst way to invest money in the world. But for them to drop, even from 7% to 6% would raise our cost of covering the difference by millions of dollars, and the unions controlling CalPERS don't want that because then they know there's less money for operations and raises, which we're well aware everybody wants one of those. So after the group came back and met with these private people, we went back to, gosh, after you look at all the different instances, what happens to the CalPERS rate, what if the market does this, what if the market does that, what is the risk here? And we went back to, it really is like, lowering your mortgage rate. So we've got a curve, we've got a bell-shaped curve, and our payments to CalPERS are going to suck up a lot of money. What the pension obligation does, simply, is flatten that curve so we can better budget. So people are saying, oh, we should spend this money on all these other things. They actually have it backwards. If we don't figure out how to flatten that curve, the money for infrastructure or homeless services or police department or fire department, it's going to be harder and harder and harder for us to meet. Back to Scott's point to the skipper, and I asked Mark this two months ago, you never talked about this before, well, the rate wasn't where it was. So what we're talking about tonight, and I don't expect to influence any of you with my little monologue here, but what we're talking about tonight is just starting the validation process. So if this looks like this will be a good idea, help flatten that bell curve that we've got to pay all this money so it's easier to budget for the city for all of the expenses we have. Whether the things you want to spend money on or things somebody doesn't want to spend on, we have to have it. That group will come back, they'll come back multiple times, they'll do public meetings for the public to understand. When I hear the people going don't do this, don't do this, don't do this, I know emphatically they do not understand. And I was absolutely in the same boat. But instead of going no, no, no, no, I said let's hear. And they will come in and they've said they'll come back to finance committee if need be and they'll come to council and instead of using actuaries with bazillions of pages of Excel documents, get it down into three or four pages that the average person can understand. Because if we are going to move forward, the citizens do need to be comfortable, the council needs to be comfortable. Yes, we're making the right call and we're not leaving a mess for a council that's going to be here long after all of us are gone. So, I would move that we move forward with the validation process which obligates us to absolutely nothing. All right, we have a motion. I'd second it only because it doesn't commit us to anything. All right, and then we have a second by council member Denley. Council member Brown. Aye. Council member Denley. Aye. Council member Huber. Yes. Council member Morgan. Yes. Council member Tandon. Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds. Aye. Mayor Coolidge. Aye. Carry 7-0. All right, item 5.2, consideration of legal services agreement. Please note for the record that the city clerk has provided each of us with a copy of the final AGC agreement of which was updated into Granicus on Friday. So, everybody should have been provided that as well. So, and we have a report from, which is probably running over Mrs. Cannon. So, before you have, okay, I guess Ms. Cannon will come here. There she is. Happy to cover for her, but here she is. All right, and as a reminder for those who want to speak, please raise your hand at this point so we can be ready for after her report. Maybe Mayor, Vice Mayor, and Council, the report you have in front of you highlights the timeline of events that have transpired since our original RFP for City Attorney Services in 2019. Attached to the agreement is the AGC agreement along with the associated exhibits most commonly found in our PSA documents, and I'm happy to answer any questions. Questions? All right. Thank you. I think I have a question. I'm not sure, Jamie, that, that, um, whether you're the right person to ask this but I'll ask it anyway. So, can, you know, we, we made a big effort to put out an RFP six, six months ago? When was that? We, I don't have it directly in front of me. I apologize. I want to say we did one in mid to late 2019 and then a subsequent RFP in early 2020. Okay. So, we went to all this effort and now we're apparently hiring a, without having them go through that process. Is that, can we do that? Well, actually, they did go through the process. So, AGC was one of nine firms that submitted a proposal on our original request. From that grouping of firms, the council determined to select AGC. So, AGC was originally awarded the contract of city attorney services. However, the appointee at that time, Mr. Andrew Jarrett, then left employment with AGC and went to a different firm. Council then, in light of the whole COVID pandemic, determined that they would do a bridge agreement with CHW, Mr. Jarrett's now current firm. And then, at a later date, council submitted another request for proposals and then added that grouping of six folks who submitted proposals to the original nine. Council did a series of interviews. I believe three firms were interviewed. And at that time, CHW was selected. So, technically, the eligibility list that was created from those two RFPs, are still good. And council then went back and selected a firm that was originally selected back in 2019. So, even though in the second round of RFPs, we only had three responses, we can still go back to the previous responses from a year before that? Correct. In the second round, you had six responses. So, you had a total of 15 proposals submitted. Council interviewed four firms, selected two firms, one, one, and now back. So, it's almost like a recruitment pool. We'll do multiple recruitments for employment, and that recruitment pool will last for a series of one year to two years, and then our hiring authority can go back and pull from anyone on that list at any time. Thank you for that. And then one more question. So, it looks like there are no changes to the budget. Does that mean that in total, AGC's numbers, charges, et cetera, are not significantly different than what we had from whatever the name of the other firm was? Correct. They are not significantly different, and you can see those, I believe, in exhibit B attached to the agreement. Okay. All right. Thank you. Yes, sir. All right. Any further questions? All right. If not, public comments? We do. We have one comment, one person, Chris Nelson. Chris, are you there? Yeah. Thanks. Can you hear me? Yes. Go ahead. Thank you. I'm very active with the junkyard. I'm really concerned about scrap metal and their continued location on 20th Street due to the proximity of that neighborhood that John found. And at the time, the city challenged us and Vince Ewing said, oh, she was ratting out a little day for the case and the city ended up, he was incorrect and the city ended up paying $200,000 for the court case that was all lost. And basically, the man is incompetent and he didn't even show up for months. And the only way that I could see that you would rehire him is because of cronyism because you, this conservative council, worked well with him in the past. And the city not a good attorney. And I don't think that anybody from Beverly Hills has any idea of what it is like in Chico, California. This is pure and simple cronyism and I am asking you not to go far with this person because he's not a good attorney and he is not Thank you. Madam clerk, no one else correct? That is correct. All right. To entertain a motion from council. I'd like to make a comment. Yes. Yeah, I just want to provide a little bit of context. I voted against this change and I'll do it again tonight. And I think that this is a very important step for city and as well well well as this is a backward is not the best option for Chico. In my opinion, it's solely based on personality and personal preferences for policy approaches. But there are some key ways that the city pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert The firm being replaced tonight, the current firm's expertise in city-related matters is unparalleled. They are head and shoulders not only above AGC, but above every other firm in California. Finally, they have more lawyers and closer proximity to our area, which means more breadth and depth of experience as it relates to city business and more awareness about our local area. In my opinion, this was an unwise decision and a bad deal for Chico at best, and shady at worst. I don't support it. And on a purely procedural note, the decision announcement following closed session was not recorded, making it impossible for the public and the media to be informed about the action taken unless they were present in chambers. The media and the public had no way of knowing what action was going to be taken and therefore had to scramble to ensure that the public was informed about this hasty late night decision. There's an appropriate way to do this, and this is not it, so I will vote no tonight on this item. Okay, anyone else? All right, entertain a motion. I'll move. Move to approve. Second. I have a motion and a second. I did just want to make a comment here that certainly didn't echo anything we necessarily heard in closed session, which obviously is closed, so certainly should not be disclosed. But in terms of the report out, it was actually given by Mr. Jared. So, and I was standing right next to him in the same fashion that it had been done since every council meeting that I've ever been at, and realizing that certainly a phone call from any member of the press asking what that report out should be afterwards could have easily taken place to not only any single member of staff, but myself as well, which I've in the past gotten multiple phone calls at midnight or one o'clock in the morning from reporters asking, and those types of questions. So, nothing further? Madam Clerk, if you could take the roll. Council Member Brown? No. Council Member Denley? Aye. Council Member Huber? No. Council Member Morgan? Yes. Council Member Tandon? Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds? Aye. Mayor Coolidge? Aye. Carries 5-2. Thank you. All right. Moving on to item 5.3. If anyone wants to... Oh, that item is actually being postponed. My apologies to March 16th. Item 5.4. This item is also being postponed to 3-16. It's consideration of the upper parking fee implementation plan and a request for capital funding in the 21-22 budget cycle. So, 5.5, consideration of boards and commissions applications. Madam Clerk. Thank you, Mayor. Council Member Coolidge and Council. So, really, tonight I was just asking for the Council to consider a possible special meeting maybe next Tuesday. We would do it all via Zoom for everyone to hear from the applicants themselves. You know, this has been an extended period of time. It's unprecedented in the 21 years that I've been here. We have always done the recruitment in the fall of an election year. We did that. We had to keep extending. And... Um... And then, you know, with the COVID restrictions and several Council meetings being canceled, here we are. And what... You know, I really want to thank our board and commission members who are still serving and willing to serve. Our code is set up that they continue in their positions until they're replaced. And so, we really have a great group of people. They dedicate a lot of time. And so, I was hoping to get the meeting scheduled. And if Council's willing to do it via Zoom, we don't even have to be in this room. We can set it up completely Zoom to accommodate everyone's schedules. And I'm happy to do that, especially after tonight is kind of working. So, I'm okay with that. We do have the system. Looks like it is working out pretty well, actually. It is, actually. So, before we launch into questions and everything, maybe we should take public comments on this item. So, let's ask folks to raise their hand at this point in time if they would like to speak. So, let's ask folks to raise their hand at this point in time if they would like to speak. And that does not necessarily, well, does not, if you are an applicant, this is not the time for your interview. Correct. So, this is just time for the public to comment on the action. So, it looks like we have two hands up at this point. And so, we'll start with Nathan Mevin Terry, if you're there. Let's see. Nathan, are you there? Okay. Then our next speaker will be Jessica Giannola. Thank you. I just have a comment when it comes to the work commissioning of the 5.5 correct? That one? Yes. Just a couple more. Selecting work commissioning options that we're trying to reverse. And keep the work commissioning in place. Keep people on or inviting people on to the boards who have an invested interest in the health of the community and don't have the ulterior motives of being on and denying services, health, et cetera. I know you try hard to get the people who apply for the board, but just keep an eye on that. And the community is making sure that it's a diverse group of people who live in the district. That's all. Okay. Thank you. And we don't have any other speakers. All right. So, any discussion? I actually have a question. So, and I'm going to put you on the spot a little bit here, Madam Clerk, is if how many applicants, just for the public's sake, do we have on airport? And actually, could you just tell us how many applicants we have for everything with the board? With the exception of, because I know Planning Commission, we have quite a few as well as parks and playgrounds. But for the other commissions, how many spots are open and how many applicants we have? Okay. So, on the Airport Commission, we have two positions that need to be filled and we have five applications. On Architectural Review and Historic Preservation Board, we have three positions that are open and we have six applicants. Now, mind you, some of these people, those are not their first choices. So, it is very difficult to go and engage who really wanted to be on what because they could number a myriad of advisory bodies that they'd like to be on. Arts Commission, we have four positions and we received a total of six applications. On Bidwell Park and Playground Commission, we have four four-year term positions and one two-year that was due to an unfilled or an unscheduled vacancy. And we have 19. And we have 19 applications on that particular commission. Climate Action Commission, we have five positions. One of them is a two-year that was an unscheduled vacancy as well as four four-year term positions. We have a total of seven applicants for those five positions. Planning Commission, we have four positions and we received a total of 16 applicants. So it is, you know, in the past the council has always directed, and again I've been doing this for a long time, and the council has always directed that they, you know, that we bring back as many as possible applications so that you actually do have choices that you can make. You know, we received 19 on the Bidwell Park and Playground and 16 on Planning Commission, and those are great numbers to work with. Not that we can't work with the other ones, it's just, it's up to the council what you would like to do. All right, I have one more question in terms of, I know we have some ad hoc committees, things along those lines that are created, like out of Bidwell Parks and Playground Commission, things along those lines. Do we have set parameters for when those are established? Or when those are chosen? Well, actually years ago when we, when the council enacted work plans, and at that time they developed work plans because the boards and commissions at the time, and this was in 2006, were actually really trying to delve into policy and not so much just making recommendations to the council, but actually wanting to get involved in that. And so the council felt like if there was a work plan and they proposed things that they were working on. And any subcommittees that might need to be required, then that would need to go to the council first and be approved. Well, that was pretty labor intensive and eventually that was amended and taken out of the policy. But I know that I staff the Arts Commission and we have one subcommittee that meets on some of the grant applicants or the applications to review them and present them to the full body. So I would assume that there are other boards. I know that the parks. The park commission absolutely has a variety of subcommittees, but I'm happy to pull a summary together and bring that back to you. If you would like to see that. Those are additional meetings and that is why council years ago did say that any new subcommittee should be approved just because it does take staff resources for those. Alright. I have a question now for our city attorney. So if and in fact I wanted to make a motion that. Was you know scheduling a meeting. You know maybe going back out on a few of these committees and then also maybe looking at our subcommittees. Can I do that all as one motion? Yeah. Or should I do that as individuals? It depends on the way you want to formulate it. You could do it as a single motion. Alright. Well, we'll attempt it and see how it goes. So I think in regards to the Bidwell parks and playgrounds and in fact all three which are direct appointments. So I think in regards to the Bidwell parks and playgrounds and in fact all three which are direct appointments. So the arts commission Bidwell park and playgrounds and planning commission that we move forward and do the interviews on Tuesday of next week. Second part of my motion is at that time we could also review the process for creating any subcommittees or ad hoc committees at or through any of our boards and commissions. And then the other individual commissions is at that point in time at that meeting as well discuss the possibility going back out for additional applications. Okay. And so the additional applications or applicants you would be seeking would be for the airport commission, architectural review and historic preservation board? Okay. And so the additional applications or applicants you would be seeking would be for the airport commission, architectural review and historic preservation board? And climate action commission? Correct. And I think that's important too because some of the people on those lists are also people who might be chosen through the planning commission in Bidwell parks and playgrounds. And that was a worry because some of them wanted to be on you know different ones. And that was a worry because some of them wanted to be on you know different ones. And obviously if you selected them for a planning commission that would take you seven hours to gather them all together. out of someone for the airport commission. Okay, so that's my motion. Okay. Question before I second your motion. Sure. You didn't mention a date for the meeting. Oh, thanks Susan. Same time? Yeah. Would you like it to be solely virtual and not here? You guys can do it from the luxury of your homes or would you like it to be... Well, I mean it's an interview process, but we do have obviously discussion in terms of these other items. No, that's true. It's true. Oh. I mean we can do it completely virtual or we can come in here and then it would it was always my intention to be able to have the applicants speak to you via zoom. So if we had that if we had the applicants speak to us via zoom but we were here if it's not too much of a burden on... it's just hard for us to have a discussion. Absolutely. So no, I... Even though the system is working well I'd still prefer us to be on site if we can. No, absolutely. So if... I think we could do it with limited staff. So just to clarify your motion, come back next Tuesday at 6 to do the interviews for whatever the one the boards you talked about. Arts Commission, Planning Commission, and Bidwell Park and Playground. Possibly open the other ones and then also have a discussion about the mass number of subcommittees that we don't even know exist that are sucking up staff time. So if I paraphrase that... In a roundabout way, yeah. Second your motion. Can I ask a question for clarification? I'm gonna be out of town next Tuesday because I opposed... I figured we did not have a meeting so either we can... can we look at a different date or is there an opportunity to virtually participate for council members? So now would there be a possibility for her to join the meeting? Absolutely. Because we're setting it up as a webinar you can be a panelist. So we can work with you to make sure that you can attend. It's definitely not ideal but... Well so that was gonna be... I don't... I mean where you're going or what you're doing or how long are we gone? I can't think it's gonna be very difficult but... Oh. I would prefer... I would... But is there... is that... no my... the reason for my question is there a different... would like Monday or Wednesday be any better? No I leave on Monday. Are you back by Thursday? Yeah I believe so. Not that I need your personal life. Forget what I just said about your life doesn't matter. I do come back on Thursday. And where are you going and who are you going with? What are you gonna do? What's it all about? How much are you spending? Do you brush your teeth? I could do Thursday evening, yes. Does Thursday work for anyone else or not work for anyone else? Do we have that? Can you zoom in Sean? Is there... or is it this way? I think that's what we're trying to avoid. She's gonna check and see real quick if there are... if there might be a meeting in here. No, Thursday's out. Don't look. Thursday's already out? That Thursday's out. What about Monday the 15th? Is that too far away? No. You know actually we can pick... If you want to, I mean I guess we could consolidate it and just do it on the 16th and bring in the interviewees. I don't think... I think it's gonna eat up a huge amount of time on an agenda that's already gonna be crowded. Okay. It would have been my preference to do it that Tuesday but anytime next week is fine. I was just trying to have you in the room. I would like to be here. I know. I just... I cannot do that. I know. I totally get it. So and the reason I was looking for like next week was so that I could bring once you have conducted the interviews now for these three commissions, I would be able to bring back and you guys could make those appointments because you've got some commissioners who are probably wanting to get on with their lives and you know who didn't reapply and they're still serving. So that was... and I was gonna do that. Bring back those final appointments for the full council vote on the 16th but I'm open to whatever the council would like. All right. Let me... and I'm not even looking at my schedule so you know I'm not going to but what about the 8th in the morning out? I can... That works? Mr. Morgan? What was the time? 8th sometime in the morning. On Tuesday? Okay. No. Sorry. Well no. The only reason I ask is because a lot of the applicants are working and I'm not sure if they're gonna be able to get on with their lives. I'm not sure they would be able to attend. I was just gonna say I have a question. I was just gonna say I have a question. I was just gonna say I have a question. I was just gonna say I have a question. I was just gonna say I have a question. I was just gonna say I have a question. I was just gonna say I have a question. I was just gonna say I have a question. I was just gonna say I have a question. I was just gonna say I have a question. I was just gonna say I have a question. I was just gonna say I have a question. I was just gonna say I have a question. If there's any chance of pushing it to the following week, that would be the most ideal scenario. If not, then it makes sense to me to stick with the 9th, and I will zoom in rather than being present. So my first request would be, could we do the week of the 15th? Well, we have a council meeting, though. Right. And any of those evenings, though. And then the alternative would be just stick with the 9th, but I can't be here. Thank you. You get the preference. Anyone? What about the 15th, Monday? We could do the 15th, or we could do the 18th. Does anyone have problems with either of those days? 15th is the COC meeting, so then we miss the council. Yeah. Okay. So let's go with the 9th. Okay. Sorry. And then I will work with... Council Member Brown to actually try to help facilitate that. Thank you. Okay. And we do have to actually vote on this now. So we have a motion and a... Yeah. We have a motion and a second. Yes. To set the special meeting to conduct the interviews for the Arts Commission, Planning Commission, Bidwell Park and Playground Commission to discuss the subcommittees. I'll provide you with an overview of all of them throughout the organization in terms of boards and commissions. As well as... I know that I've seen that you've seen that you've seen that you've seen that you've seen that you've seen that you've seen that you've seen that you've seen that you've seen that you've seen that you've seen that you've seen that you've seen that you've seen that you've seen that you've seen that you've seen that you've seen that you've seen that you've seen that you've seen that you've seen that you've seen that you've seen that you've seen that you've seen that you've seen that you've seen that you've seen that you've seen that you've seen that you've seen that you've seen that you've seen that you've seen that you've seen that you've seen that you've seen that you've seen that you've seen that you've seen that you've seen that you've seen that you've seen that you've seen that you've seen that you've seen that you've seen that you've seen that you've seen that you've seen that you've seen that you've seen that you've Thank you, Council. All right. Should we take a 10-minute? Oh, yeah. Yeah, I think so. All right. Thank you. We'll be back in, yeah, 10. All right. All right. All right. Gosh. How did the best one apply? All right. Roll tape. All right. Here we go. We're readjourning from our break. Item 5.6 is being postponed to 316. Item 5. What's that? Oh. Is it? I didn't know it was my job to close the door. All right. Item 5.7. Mayor Kulik's request to discuss a sales tax measure for police and fire and a bond for road improvements. And I imagine those actually, so obviously I have to bring this up because I brought it forward. But ideally what I would like to see is the Finance Committee, again, just like we're doing with the pension obligation bond, I'd like us to just take that movement forward, send this possibly to Finance Committee if the Council so desires to discuss this. But kind of what I envision, if and in fact this goes through, obviously it's on the ballot. I'm not sure if the city attorney knows the answer to this. I'm sorry I didn't prep you for this at all. But if and in fact, you know, I thought originally maybe this was something that we could do if there was a recall that you could actually place something on that ballot. But I was told by somebody that you have to, it can only be done on general. Election. So tax measures can only be done on general election. I know that's pretty specific knowledge, so I don't know if you have it at your fingertips. It is pretty specific knowledge. I haven't done the exact research on it. It is my general understanding that you're correct. The other way it could be done is by declaring a fiscal emergency and by unanimous vote calling for a special election. But given the prior report. Well, and I wasn't really thinking a special election would be the way to go. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I was just wondering if any of our senators at our city incurred that extra cost, particularly when we're talking about raising money. So. I must say that might be a possibility. I have not researched it. Okay. In detail. And perhaps that's something that when we get to the Finance Committee we can find out the answer to. So ideally kind of what I envision for this and certainly open for discussion as anyone sees fit. Even if we are to send a Finance Committee is, you know, a portion of this being for police portion of this being for fire. and then a portion going to actually take out a road bond for a period of a certain time. You know, whether this is a quarter cent, whether it's half cent, whether it's a full cent, you know, all those I think are up for discussion. But you guys know as well as I do that our roads are in horrific shape, that we keep falling, that number keeps falling continuously. Continuously. Each year, even spending three or four million dollars, we've all heard, you know, Mr. Gustafson speak about that and the level of which our roads are at and continuing to fail. And I know our community knows that as well. So anyway, that's basically what I'd like to have the council discuss. We should probably take some public comment at this point. I probably should have told people to raise their hand. Right. So if there's anyone... We have 41 attendees. And so if there are any individuals who would like to address this item, it is the request to discuss the sales tax measure and referring it to finance committee. I don't see any hands. All right. So moving on from public comment, then discussion. So just to clarify, what you're looking for is direction from the council to send this to the finance committee to discuss, to bring back to... Yeah, absolutely. I think it needs to be explored fully there. I think we need to get options. I think we need to obviously find out. And I think that's the right venue to do it. You know, find out what a quarter cent a year, you know, how much that is compared to a full cent. You know, look at percentages between a bond, between a road bond and police and fire and have all those discussions there before we bring something back to council. Well, my two cents is I am 100% in favor of having those discussions. I'm not going to be able to do that. I'm not going to be able to answer that pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert pert hesitant on pursuing these things. Whether or not they might be totally necessary, I don't know yet. They could very well be, but I don't personally know yet, so I'm hesitant. Just wanted to communicate that. Yeah, no, I understand that. And I think, you know, certainly I don't think it's going to be a rush through process with finance. I don't think it's one meeting and out. I think it'd be probably multiple meetings, so it'd probably take a while to get back to the council anyway. Well, it can't be rushed through because you can't put on a ballot. Right. Well, I mean, that being given and, of course, pending the answer of the city attorney, which I think you were both correct in our guess, that, yeah, there's no rush to this because it wouldn't be on until November 22. So, all right. Any other comments? Madam Clerk, would you take the roll? Council Member Brown. Before I respond, just to clarify that this would be a dedicated sales tax measure for police and fire and then a bond for roads. Well, that would be the format of the tax that you'd be discussing. Well, I think it's open for discussion about how much would be used to pay back. So, what size bond you could get and how much percentage of that sales tax would be used for a road bond would have to be discussed. But this would not include a discussion about a general sales tax or funding other city services? Correct. Great. Yeah, I think because of the limited scope of that, I'm going to vote no. On the discussion. All right. So, it's a no. Can we, can you read back what you have down for the motion, please? The motion was to refer Mayor Coolidge's request to discuss a sales tax measure for police and fire and bond, a possible bond for road improvements and refer it to the Finance Committee to have those fleshed out and explored. So, if I may just take a back up a step before we go ahead and take the vote. Okay. Well, we're already in the middle of the vote. So, Mr. Jarrett, can we do that? You can still discuss what the motion is, yes. In the middle of the vote? Okay. Yes. No problem. So, back to Councilmember Brown's question. Is the only model you're interested in having the Finance Committee discuss one that is strictly sales tax for police and fire and strictly bond for road improvements and refer it to the Finance Committee to have those fleshed out and explored? Yes. So, I'm just wondering if you can just say that you're interested in having the financial aid for road improvements or can it be a discussion of any configuration of those things for any of those three items? Yes. The latter. Any configuration of those for the discussion. Okay. So, I'd like my motion to reflect that change. Yeah. Or clarify that change. And I think I was having a hard time on the clarification of it, but yes. Okay. So, what was the clarification? The clarification is that we're going, the Finance Committee will discuss the possibility of taxes or bonds for the fire, police, and road improvements. Yeah. But one more time to clarify. We're talking about a general two-thirds vote tax for these, for these. I don't think we've talked. I don't think that discussion is. That's what I'm understanding based on what you said. That's. By its nature, it has to be. Yeah. If you're going to limit where you're going to spend the taxes, it has to be. Yeah, it has to be at two-thirds. But you just said. So, you did not say that, but by its nature, Ms. Brown is correct. And I voted no. I think. I think you just said the general in reference to the tax. It would be a special. A dedicated special tax. It would be a special tax. Yeah. Okay. That's why I'm voting no. And Madam Clerk, yeah. Thank you. Never mind. You got it. Okay. All right. Continue, please. Council Member Denley. I'd like to abstain. Okay. Council Member Huber. Yes. Council Member Morgan. I really, really, really want to vote no, but I will allow the discussion to continue. No, we can be the chair of the friends. Okay. Okay. So, that was a no? Okay. Council Member Tandon. Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds. Yes. Mayor Coolidge. Aye. Carries five with one no and one abstention. All right. Okay. Next item, 5.8, commercial cannabis revenue generating models and fees. Mr. City Manager. Yes, Tom. I'm here. Council. You'll recall at your meeting of December 15th, the Council's vote on the commercial cannabis fee resolution was reconsidered and resulted in the pausing of the application process. And Council asked staff to return with some additional information related to revenue generating models utilized within other jurisdictions. You'll see in the snapshot before you that there are a few avenues cities utilize to support revenue generation surrounding commercial cannabis, and that includes some development agreements. Community benefit agreements and also tax assessments. Attachment C to your staff report provides an overview of those varying models being used by some other cities within the state. And so, I would ask that Council give city staff further direction on if there are any that you are interested in pursuing. Obviously, there's no action scheduled for tonight other than further direction so that staff can proceed to bring back specifically something that you would like to see. And that'll enable staff to move forward. I did have a question. I did put this together rather quickly. We lost the individual working on the cannabis tax to another city. He moved on. And so, I put this together knowing that there have been investments made in our community by those interested in this endeavor. And so, this will at least bring clarity to staff and those individuals as to where the path that the Council would like to go down for further evaluation. With that, I'd love to have some clear direction. Thank you. All right. We're going to ask anyone who wants to speak on this issue to raise their hand at this point in time. And that's all we have for today. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. chairman. Any questions for Mr. Orme from the Council? Yeah, I have a question. I was interested in the idea of a community benefit fee but had never heard that terminology prior. And so, I'm curious if you can expand on that a little bit and then perhaps, Mr. Jarrod, could you speak to, you know, if there's any kind of legal because I hadn't heard this in cannabis advisory committee meetings or anything else, any legal implications as it relates to the community benefits fee? Yeah, just so you're aware, in this report, I'm not referring to the cannabis advisory on whether or not I believe any of these are valid approaches. So I will tell you that they are approaches that other cities have made. With the community benefit, it is somewhat similar to a development agreement, however, it's more of an entity, there are no rights attributed to it. It's an entity saying, I'm willing to give community benefit back to a city. I've actually not seen one of those agreements that has been fully signed off by our city attorney team to say, hey, this is a legitimate community agreement. So that's why if it's interesting to the council, staff can pursue and go see if there are some legitimate models out there that we can look at. With regard to the development agreement, what I've found is that potentially there are some concerns with regard to Prop 218 issues surrounding those. So just for my initial blush at this, and by no means am I an expert on any of this right now until we're asked to go research further, I do have some hesitancy on that because of the Prop 218 since I have some hesitancy on that area with Prop 218, I tend to lean towards maybe having some concern with regard to the benefit, community benefit agreement as well. However, what I've been told by individuals in the industry, it is a path that has been used to enable, if there is a tax at a future date, that this is kind of that mechanism to get additional revenue until there is a tax on the ballot. That's where I was told that it helps get revenue coming in earlier. Once that's won a tax. Exactly. And so typically what you'll see is cities have that in place, and then once a tax is either approved, was approved by a community, then that goes away and then the tax is in place. That's my understanding of it from a rudimentary perspective. Sure. But those are the three models that we've seen. Great. And so recognizing your comments about that this has maybe not been vetted fully, can I direct the question to Mr. Jarrett? Yes. As Mr. Orme mentioned, the state of the state, staff report was prepared very short notice. I did not analyze any of the information or issues in here. But he hasn't stated anything that I would scream is incorrect by any means. These community benefit agreements, my research on that, very brief research on that is yeah they're like an alternate to a development agreement that they were very popular several years back when we didn't have that bag of bag have statewide regulations and statewide allowing, Prop 64 allowing this type of use. It was kind of in the early days when these got started. I don't know if they're still that popular or if they're essentially holdovers from a different time. I tend to think it's the latter. What I hear more about are general taxes being put on the ballot and special taxes being put on the ballot to specifically identify attacks on cannabis. And those by and large within the last year or two years have been very successful. Thank you. Sorry, my mic doesn't work. All right. Madam Clerk, how many speakers do we have? At this time we have 10 hands up. I'd like to ask... I'd like to ask any others who would like to address this item to go ahead and raise your hand now. And then Crystal Kesey will be our first speaker. Will that be three minutes? Three minutes. Okay. Crystal, are you there? If you can unmute, there you go. Yes, I'm here. Okay, go ahead and start. So first I want to thank the Council for postponing the receipt of the applications. I had an appointment on January 1st. report to turn in my dispensary application. I'm a resident of Chico. I own a state-licensed cannabis company called Golden State Herb. But I was diagnosed with breast cancer in November and had a seven-hour surgery in January. So preparing that dispensary application while fighting breast cancer is a little bit of a challenge. However, I've spoken to a lot of government officials, and one of the taboo subjects is that we're not supposed to give patient stories, that government officials don't want to hear patient stories. Well, now that I'm a breast cancer warrior, I don't care that you don't want to hear my patient story. I want to share it with you because there's one tight camp that's very important, and that is after my surgery. I had a seven-hour breast cancer surgery at UCSF when I was released from the hospital. From that day forward, I didn't use any opioids in my recovery from the surgery. I used a transdermal THC patch that I bought in a licensed dispensary to manage my pain. Now, I can only get those tested medicines to manage pain in licensed dispensaries. And I'm not the only cancer patient. I'm the only cancer patient in Chico. And I would love for cancer patients in Chico to have access to the same pain, non-opioid, non-addictive pain relief that I was able to purchase because I'm connected to the industry and I work in Chaston Lake where there are licensed dispensaries. Another reason why I want to thank you for postponing it is because my team was able to apply for a dispensary in Redwood City. In the meantime, I'm like, Chico, Redwood City decided to accelerate their process. They are going to have 18 finalists for six dispensary positions. And I feel like my company, Old Estate Herb, and our dispensary, Village Free, is a big contender in the city of Redwood City. And I'm very proud of that. And one of the things that was very important in the application process was the community benefit offerings from the offerings. And so I strongly endorse, as an introvert, the measure to provide revenue from the get-go for the city. So please consider a community benefit fee that sunsets once a cannabis test is passed, which it surely will in Chico, given that the Prop 64 was passed by 64%. So I thank you for your time, and I thank you for the patience. Please let this process go forward so we can have a licensed cannabis test. Jennifer Pratt. Okay. Go ahead, Jennifer. Yes, hi. Good evening. We can hear you. Good evening. Excuse me. Good evening. I'm so happy to be able to participate, even when thinking I wasn't really there. Did I hear the voice? I heard the voice. So I'm so glad to be able to be here. So the first thing is the public community. There are so many important items on tonight's agenda already, and I appreciate all the hard work staff is putting into making this possible for us all the time. In regards to this item, I would love to see the council move forward and consider adopting the community benefit agreement, or development agreement in the meantime, until we put a tax on the status. These agreements have been really successful across the state, as the means in the interim. Each local government is taking the steps to make the agreement more effective for the to generate funds that help ease the burden of a newly regulated business type like cannabis, law enforcement, and other agencies involved in enforcement and management of those businesses. Also, these agreements help contribute beyond just a general fund for the city and can positively impact the community. After the last few years, I think bringing more businesses, more local jobs, and more local revenue is in alignment with what Chico needs and deserves. As a current applicant, I know that one of the things we're most excited for, should we be grabbing one of the funds, is to be active and contributing members to the Chico business community throughout generating revenue. Also, we're very excited to be a part of this. We're very excited to be involved and raise the money, activism, and volunteering with our community. I thank you guys so much and hope you all have a great night. Thank you, Jennifer. Next speaker is David Peterson. Go ahead and unmute, David. There you go. Yes, go ahead. Thank you, Madam Mayor, Vice Mayor, Council Members, and staff. Like you know, my name is David Peterson. I'd first like to thank all of you for your support. I'm sure you'll find your new or continuing positions with the Council. I will say the initial impact the Council has made so far seems to be positive and wants to be heading in the right direction, so thanks for your leadership. As for the cannabis revenue topic, it is the right decision to qualify a direct revenue source from this industry. I personally would like to recommend establishing a community benefit fee at a reasonable percent of sale receipts. This fee can remain amenable. It can sunset the approval of the tax meter. That way, the revenue will remain in case the tax is never approved. Developmental agreements are more complex and can end up working against the licensee and the city because this industry is still emerging and changing. The benefit both the city and the licensee invest is from a benefit fee structure or tax that will increase or decrease revenue to the city along with the cost of the city. The benefit is that the city and the licensee will be able to continue to make the right decisions and the market trends will reach a lot. That being said, I hope the City Council can move forward and continue the licensing application process that began this past November. The pause has done significant damage to those that invested in the process early and has given time to those larger companies and corporations to establish residence. Somehow they have taken over any of that to a local point of path by being the one maximizing the awarded points. That is the reason why the City Council is so committed to the local business enterprise album and application guidelines. Any applicant that has begun the process of putting together an application for submission has absolutely no doubt that it is going to be a fee or tax imposed at some point in the future. So as the only current submitted applicant, I was always aware there was going to be additional changes that would affect my overall revenue. I accepted this notification and moved forward with my application. Please take into consideration that with confirmed applications, the City Council will be able to continue to pertain to the pertinent changes that pertain to the application process that pertain to the application process. I hope that you understand that I was very pertinent to that. while the staff is detailing how they managed the ordinance, which would successfully codify the revenue from this business to the city. Further delaying will only hurt those local investments to contend as an outcome. I appreciate your time, guys. Have a good one. Thanks. Thank you, David. Jessica Giannola. Go ahead. Thank you. I have to send my concerns and heart out to one of the previous callers who is in the business to offer a service and has undergone her own medical trials that really require this medicine, really, to help ease her pain and her procedure. I'm blown away at how long the commercial madness issue is taking to go around because of the pandemic. I'm so glad that we're able to have an operational meeting. We're discussing finding a budget tonight and hearing how to guarantee revenue source. And we can't even utilize it yet. And it's been so long. It keeps being pushed aside. We keep requesting more. Let's look at this and look at that. And what a shame that we have both the city revenue source and the medical resource remain unaccessible, still even now. For what reason? This hearing is pieces of the night. I don't know how you would have had time to get enough research and Google. Classes, entire classes and schools are online. It seems like we should have had access at this point to find what we need to get the cannabis, commercial cannabis resource out there. In Chico, making money and bringing a service to the people who need it and want it. It is people. We should be doing, you should be doing a better job at making sure it's successful. And that you have your funding source coming in to help the city. Let's see. I agree with one of the other callers that suggested that we have a temporary agreement put in place, have a timeline on it. We'll watch you for extension if you're needing it. If you're needing more time to figure out what's in our tax rates, place upon service. In the meantime, you can still. Have access for our citizens. And they can be building a customer base. So we're going to have more revenue once you have that tax put in. So just keep waiting. These little add-ins and not sure's. It just looks like you're dragging your feet. And really it looks like to those of us out here, there's no real, real reason that it makes sense. Other than there's too many people on the council board that don't approve it. And want to use it. And we take as long as we possibly can to get something in motion that's going to have it. And so at this point, let's just move forward. Do the temporary agreement. And make plans to finalize it. And I should report it. If it changes, we do it. We've done it before. So just work together as a team. And it was to the city. The city would like to have the street store available. ACP. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I just wanted to say thank you very much. I know that I've seen you on the street. I know that you've seen me on the street. I know that you've seen me on the street. I know that you've seen me on the street. I know that you've seen me on the street. I know that you've seen me on the street. I know that you've seen me on the street. I know that you've seen me on the street. I know that you've seen me on the street. I know that you've seen me on the street. COVID has really hit our business hard. We were first to shut down back in March a year ago, and we've been kind of struggling ever since. And through that time, I started looking into the canvas opportunity in town and started educating myself on that. And I'm really excited about the business model. I've been to a bunch of dispensaries and I've studied it and there's a lot of similarities between the two businesses, the one that I run and the canvas retail business. I've formed a team of local business people with one goal in mind, and that's to put a state of the art retail dispensary in Chico. And I would like to really encourage people to come and see the canvas. I would like to encourage you as you move toward the canvas tax issue that we absolutely support the idea of raising canvas tax dollars at the local level for the city of Chico. In our application, we're looking forward to spending the money. Our team supports the new TA business self-tax. The head of the voter approved the canvas tax in 2022. In other words, we don't think the state should wait for the tax to come. We're looking forward to spending the money for a year and a half before they see the money. So I like the direction we're going to head. We would like to support the self-tax for a dispensary that puts it at 5% of the gross receipts. That's a sustainable number. A lot of cities throughout California have different licenses that canvas businesses, Sacramento and Reading, both tax their storefront dispensaries at 5% of the gross receipts. It's basically an excise tax that could be passed by the voters. But we think that you can move forward prior to that and go ahead and start taxing that 5% on the gross receipts until 2022. I encourage you to keep the canvas business program in the city of Chico on track. I also encourage you to restart the application process. For the applicants, as soon as possible. Thanks for your time. Thank you, Doug. Thank you, Doug. Katie Maple, please. Yes. I'm the vice president of government affairs and compliance with . We're a vertically integrated canvas company that started in Sacramento about ten years ago. We've now expanded to the city of Sacramento. We have a lot of We have a lot of We have a lot of We have a lot of bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag right now, and that's the city of Riverbank. The other one is the city of Turlock. And they're both models that work well, and they don't have any points as far as I can tell to actually pass tax. They haven't had any issues with this. However, we do support, we understand legal implications of putting a tax in the ballot. So, with that being the preference, I think doing some interims is a great way to get tax revenues in the meantime that can be used in the city. As an example, we started our retail store around Muscogee and Marysville about two years ago. We've actually, just with our own tax revenues, we have funded one new police officer for the city. And then, of course, in places like Sacramento, where there's more volume, we're contributing close to $2 million a year to the city, just from our businesses. So there's a lot of opportunity here for revenues for the city. There's a lot of opportunity for these businesses to give back and to bring a good job here. So I hope that this will happen soon. As I think we're not the only ones that have been paying for either a lease or a mortgage for quite some time, we need to apply. Thank you so much. Thank you, Katie. Angela McLaughlin? Hi there. California approved recreational cannabis in 2016, and Chico Brothers overwhelmingly approved it at the time, with over 60% of the population. So we're in a lot of good favor. Here we are in 2021, and we still have not managed to pass any ordinances about this or actually get any businesses started. For a business-friendly council, this is alarming. And I'm also very worried about the folks who have invested in the community already, and the anticipation of this, that are now stalled again and losing money. Commercial cannabis will bring immediate jobs and additional revenues to Chico. That's something that we desperately need as this pandemic continues. Hopefully we're on our way out of it, but right now we have a lot of people out of work and a lot of businesses struggling. I don't have the exact numbers in front of me, but something like for every dollar spent in a cannabis dispensary or on campus in a community has an actual benefit. And I can find that information and get it to you if you're curious, but all the way around, this is good for the economy. Chico Brothers want it. We need to just move forward with this. Thank you. Thank you, Angela. Mike Trollander? Mike, are you there? Can you hear me? I can. Go ahead. Just very short, I said I didn't belong. There's a lot of reasons to slow down, but I didn't belong. But my one comment is that other municipalities have put together impact needs based on nexus and the idea that it's not all positive. And I'm not told to do that, but I do hope that that would be in conversation, because we know that not all the impacts are positive. And so I would hope that that would be a part of that conversation. Thank you. Thank you, Mike. CJ's lesson? . CJ, we can barely hear you. If you could speak up or get closer to the microphone, please. All right. Absolutely. That works great. Thank you. All right. So you guys have heard a lot this evening and obviously talked about a lot of things. This is related. That seems to be what this topic is about. And I appreciate you guys taking the time and putting it together, this presentation on such short notice. I think you guys said, actively zero down some courses of action that are appropriate for Chico. I'm not going to waste any time. I think a lot of things that have been said. Obviously, you know, we want to get money to the city in new, creative ways as long as possible. And I'd like to congratulate you guys on having successfully done that as demonstrated by your previous discussion on how budget and how positive it's going. So that's clearly a testament to how well you guys are able to tackle that dynamic issue. So kudos to you guys for that. So with that said, you know, I think given the time and the opportunity, I think we're going to have a lot of fun. I think you guys have experienced the track record thus far. You know, I have no doubt in my mind that you guys are capable of tackling this issue while moving forward with the adaptation process and pursuing it. So that would be my main comment is to urge you guys, as you work through this, you know, pursuing the adaptation process, that way you know people can continue to have their investments, at least continue to move forward without paying for the new food. Thank you. So with that said, this is going to be our first time. Thank you guys for all the work and the support and caring more about this and the future. Thank you. Our last speaker is Charles Burton. Okay, go ahead. Good evening. Can you hear me? Good evening. Can you hear me? Yes. You are loud and clear. How's it going? My name is Charles Burton. I'm a senior at the University of Michigan. My plan was to apply for several applications. We had to quit from January 4th, but after the Easter day, we were obviously unable to. In order to get our applications ready, we had to go through many steps and hurdles. Several of them involved obviously getting a secure location together and signing leases. I personally am due five-year leases with the hopes of getting several licenses once these applications go. So tonight, I am here to say that we are absolutely in support of getting some types of tax measure together once we can get that on the ballot. In the meantime, picking up community benefit fee seems to be the best way to kind of get things going through. But one thing I would just kind of like to get it clear to Ron is a timeline of when we can expect to get like an answer on what exactly will be going on with your decisions. So thank you very much, and I hope to hear some positive things from you guys tonight. I know that I've perturbed you guys very much. I know that I've perturbed you guys very much. I know that I've perturbed you guys very much. I know that I've perturbed you guys very much. I know that I've perturbed you guys very much. I know that I've perturbed you guys very much. I know that I've perturbed you guys very much. I know that I've perturbed you guys very much. I know that I've perturbed you guys very much. I know that I've perturbed you guys very much. I know that I've perturbed you guys very much. I know that I've perturbed you guys very much. Mr. Orem gave us in the report, seven of them have community benefit agreements. One of those also has a development agreement. Three of them have a development agreement. One also has a community development agreement, both. Four of them have nothing, most of those because they have taxes in place. And one has a public benefit, which I'm not really sure what that was. So I think there's several other cities that have made it pretty clear that there's a pretty easy pathway forward on this. My recommendation or motion that I would like to make is to send this to the city attorney's office to have them get back to us with a report on the legality and the difference of the community benefit agreement versus the development agreement and what will it take to do to restart the application process back up. Do we go back to square one? Do we? Do we pick up where we left off? What kind of noticing do we need to do? And all that. And I think if we could have that information, then we as a council could move forward on making a decision. I'll second that, but you might have to make it shorter. Sorry. So direct the city attorney to analyze the difference between a development agreement and a community benefit agreement and report back on what we would need to do to continue the application process. Would you accept a first? Yes. And secondly, a moment just to carry the conversation about sales tax forward as well to have them, have staff also bring back the beginning of a discussion about putting a sales tax measure for cannabis on the ballot for 2022. Absolutely. My intention, if this moves forward, would be that the community benefit would sunset at the time of a tax being passed. If the tax is not passed, then the community benefit would stay. Okay. Honestly. I just want to make sure the staff is clear that both of those opportunities would be analyzed. Just for the sake of separating the two, because they are separate, would you mind sending it to finance committee? The cannabis sales tax? Yeah, the cannabis sales tax, because we've got two years to take care of that. Yeah, I mean, I would like to also be learning, and it's hard when stuff like that comes back to council without the educational piece. But as an initial discussion, if some of the options, I would be open to sending it to finance. Okay. So was that a yes to finance or no? Yes. Okay. You know, under the, I guess for me, it's just for the clarity that it would come back to council and we'd get some education as well. Oh, yeah. Yeah. But if somebody wanted to, they can make a secondary motion directing the city attorney to come back with all the things you just talked about and the best way to move ahead with the sales tax measure, you know you need eventually. Right. So you don't need to separate them. That feels true to me as well. I'm not making that secondary motion, but somebody could. That was the clarification I was requesting from Vice Mayor Reynolds. If we could also continue the discussion about cannabis sales tax and some options available to us, I would accept that second friendly amendment to the motion. Mayor Kulich, would you accept? Sure. Thank you. I just have a quick question about continuity with attorneys. So, will that mean, will Mr. Jarrett start on this and then hand it over to the new attorney or will Mr. Jarrett continue to work on it after he's no longer, you know, as a special issue after he's gone or how will that be handled? I don't think he's going to work on it tonight. Yeah, I think, well, I don't think I'll get much in on this before Mr. Ewing takes over. The only reason I'm jotting stuff down here, and I'm going to ask a clarifying question, is for his, I'm assuming that Vince would be handling this. Well, and if I may, we did hold up some continuity in our closed session about, you know, continuing forward. So there's, there's definitely that. That was the reason for my question. Yeah, because this is a matter I think it probably should be. Mr. Ewing and I will be talking about all those issues and I don't foresee any, any hiccups happening there. My only question on this issue is, is there a timing component to this where, so now would be the time to indicate, do you want this back next meeting or when he's available to achieve a proper report or by a deadline? I would say by the time he is available to achieve proper report, I think maybe saying next meeting might be pushing it a little bit hard, but I wouldn't see it taking months and months and months by any means. I was going to say, this is the 16th. If we see everything we already extended, but. Would it make sense to set a deadline of, you know, second meeting in April or first meeting in May? I think the reason I ask is for the same reason that you would have some concern is that there's a lot of people are holding leases. They're local folks. They're wanting to apply for this process. They don't know what the timeline is. And so for us to be able to, to say that this is a priority item, we want to hear about it within the next month or two would at least allow a little bit of a breathing room for folks who are holding onto those leases and mortgage payments. Absolutely. Can I ask a clarifying question? Could you please? Could we have it come back on the 16th just to ask Mr. Ewing to give us a estimation on how much time you said how much he needs? And if he comes back and says 30 days is good, then we could review it at that time. Because I don't want to speak for him and say that we'll have it back by April or May. Well, that would just be an update from him in terms of so. Yeah. That way it comes back and we're reporting back to the people. Well, well, all you would be doing at that point in time would be giving an attorney's report on the item because you wouldn't be wanting to accept public comment or. You'd have direction necessarily. You'd just want to report an update and then he'll set a timeline. You know, if we don't like that, we could get the next meeting, move forward on something. You could certainly go that way. And I think you're absolutely correct. I don't know how productive that would be. And if it's a very full agenda and we're going to have 10 more speakers saying essentially what they've said, it might just chew up some more time of your agenda. I think the direction you provided that on those three items coming back at some point, whether it's on his own, when he's ready to, or you give a date certain deadline, that might be helpful. I'd be surprised if we didn't see something by April for sure. So I don't know. I think if we get to the beginning, if we get to second meeting in April, we haven't seen anything, we bring it forward and require it by then. Sure. All right. I'm certainly willing to second that motion if that happened. In addition, we place all your directives onto the planning calendar and Mr. Ewing will see that and he'll be able to address it. He'll address that and tell staff when that item can come forward as well. So he's going to be made aware of it by talking to city attorney, Jared. And so. Yeah, I do have one additional comment that I'd like to make because I've gotten calls from dispensary after dispensary after dispensary. And there's only a handful of options in the city for dispensary. So some people in this process will not make it through this process and they need to realize that. Because, you know, it is part of their business investment. You know, in my business, I sometimes do well and I sometimes do badly based upon whatever decision I might be making or something along those lines. Mine's obviously very different, but, you know, they are incurring risk and realizing that the level of frustration that they're having with us doesn't also speak to the factor that, I mean, less than a third of them are going to make it through. With the current number that we have in there. I just, you know, it's, I think there's some false hope being generated. And yeah, because I've talked to at least 15 or 16 people, half of which have told me they've already acquired space. And if that's the case, there's going to be some serious losers in that. So I think they need to evaluate their positions based upon how we're moving forward and when that takes place. But of course it is their risk to assume. But I, I did want to make that a public comment. I do want to ask a question about that. I see that, and I was not there. So I just wanted to clarify that in the ordinance, we see the retail storefronts, we have four of them, but all the other activities, it says no maximum limits. I'm just curious that why did we choose four for retail storefronts? And how are we going to control the other activities? If we don't have a maximum limit on it? Maybe Mr. Jarrett or Mr. Orr? I'd be happy to. Fire away. So my recollection is that the, for the storefront, what people often call dispensaries, storefront retail, four were identified as the preferred amount, because of a calculation of 25,000, one store per 24,000 population. There was some discussion in the ad hoc committee about, if we just had one, it would be a monopoly and prices would go sky high. If you had too many, then like 10, then they would be everywhere. So an issue of, let's put it as to a benchmark as to the city's population, 25,000 was surveyed amongst other cities. And, so that ended up being four. In the ordinance itself, it talks about as your population grows, then the council would have the option to let additional licenses. It's also that, this is probably going a little beyond what you asked, but the four is the maximum. You're not required to issue four. But as the mayor mentioned, there are a number of people who want to apply. As to all of the other types of uses, the four other uses that are allowed, and mind you, cultivation and micro business are not allowed at all. The other four types were identified by the ad hoc committee and then by the council as being essentially not having the perceived negative attributes or any types of issues associated with them that couldn't be mitigated. So instead of going, going through the process of having a development agreement or a conditional use permit, all of those conditions that we typically put on a use in order to mitigate the negative effect on a neighborhood, put that into the code, and then allow those other four types to be given by right. So if somebody wants to come in and do a testing facility, manufacturing facility, or the retail delivery sites, the mitigation measures are already in the code in order to prevent or to address the issues associated with those. So that's really essentially an across the counter type of approval. I'd like to add just a brief bit of context for Councilmember Tandon. By far, storefront dispensaries was the vast majority of the time that the Cannabis Citizens Advisory Committee spent discussing. It was clearly the greatest cause for concern, and there was the greatest desire for limitation to be placed on that particular business type. The other business types, there was very little in the way of discussion about limiting those businesses. And so it was an opportunity for us to, because that is a public facing business, they have a storefront, people can walk in through the door. The committee felt and council ultimately felt that placing additional restrictions on those businesses was prudent. That for deliveries, the market would kind of take care of how many businesses were able to survive in this environment. And those other types of businesses would not be public facing businesses. So as it relates to Mr. Jarrett's comments about impacts, they were not identified as having the potential for impact that storefront dispensaries might. And then finally, there was one other aspect. Those other four types, testing, manufacturing, et cetera, those four types also had not a lot of takers, people interested. So putting any type of barrier to entry for that, and testing is going to be imperative for the success of this program statewide. So there was an identification that making that easy will then foster the growth of the program. All right. We have a motion and a second. Madam Clerk. Would you like me to read it back, or are you guys all okay with that? We're all comfortable. Okay. Awesome. Council Member Brown? Aye. Thank you for the motion. Council Member Denley? Aye. Council Member Huber? Yes. Council Member Morgan? No. Council Member Tandon? Yes. Council, excuse me, Vice Mayor Reynolds? Aye. Mayor Coolidge? Aye. Carries 6-1. All right. Okay. Item 5.9, Vice Mayor Reynolds' request to discuss code enforcement has been pushed to the 316 meeting. 510 is Council Member Denley's, we're good with time, yes? Okay, good. Request to discuss the Greater Chico Homeless Task Force. Council Member Denley? Yes, thank you. It barely squeaked in under the 10 o'clock. I was watching closely. So I want to begin by reiterating that my request tonight is just to discuss the possibility or interest in possibly making the Greater Chico Homeless Task Force an official city commission. There have been rumors that possibly I wanted to disband it, and I just want to clarify that's not part of my request to discuss. I have no intention of personally wanting us to discuss disbanding the commission. Beyond that, I just think that this discussion to bring some more legitimacy to the task force would be great. I think it would bring a more diverse pool of thought to the commission, as well as some more accountability. I think that with the current state of the relationships in our community around the issues of homelessness and just the really great divide we have right now, I think that the echo chamber that currently exists within the task force could benefit from a change. And I would like to see that discussed. I think that that discussion be had. And the commission, or the task force, has been around for over two decades, and it was created at the request of a council member. So I think it's due time we revisit it and see what we're thinking about it right now. So I'd like to hear comments. All right. If I can at this time, can I ask Clerk Cresson to just give us a brief history on this committee? Well, I don't have to... Top of your head here. Exactly. I don't have the specific dates or the timelines. However, former council member Colleen Jarvis, this was a huge interest of hers and a passion, and she was committed to that. And she actually started a warming shelter ad hoc committee. It wasn't on the mayor's appointment list or anything like that. That was just something she felt passionate about, and she started. And then... Kind of went into the homeless task force, and actually, former council member Andy Holcomb, we had lost our council member Jarvis to cancer, and he wanted to make sure that her legacy went on and added that when he was mayor to his list. And over the years, it had been appointed, and it wasn't until probably around 2008 that it was actually added. And so, we had to make sure that it was added to the mayor's appointment list. Since that time, then, former council member and current supervisor Tammy Ritter was our representative on that in 2012. And then after that, council member, former council member Renette Filmer also served, and then she stepped down, and I believe council member at the time, Stone, took over for her. And then when council member Brown was elected in 2018... She took on that role, and she served in that capacity, I believe, for the last two years. So, that's kind of how it morphed, and... Do you have any other questions? That was kind of just like off the top of my head. I think those are really good for off the top of your head. I have some extra questions. Does anyone else first, though? First that? No? Okay. I don't want to presume I have the only question. This question is actually for... For Mr. Jarrett, but I'm going to try to phrase it in a way that doesn't get us into trouble. So, are all city committees governed by the Brown Act? We can just do yes or no if you want. Are all city committees governed by the Brown Act? Yeah, but not all city committees would be Brown Act bodies. Right. Okay. Okay. I'm asking in a specific way for a specific reason, because I don't want to point to an egregious error made for years and years, because I'm not saying there has been one. And what constitutes, in that respect, a city committee? Is that staff attending, or is that a council member attending, or what is that? In general sense, the Brown Act requires... A body becomes a Brown Act body when the council creates... By council... By council action. Either by resolution, ordinance, charter, or you just create the entity. So, if there was a body that became an ad hoc committee, but it became then a standing ad hoc committee, as a true ad hoc, you're governed by the Brown Act, but you're not a Brown Act body. Right. And so you don't have to go through all those processes. Okay. But that ad hoc committee can keep meeting and meeting and meeting, and... You know, de facto, you're a Brown Act body at some point. At some point. So it's not an endless path of ad hoc. To cut to the chase on this one, I don't know if it's a Brown Act body or not. It's in some... We're assuming it would take some investigation we don't necessarily want you to do. And from what I've read of the community comments, it's a lot of people have gotten together. There's not bylaws. There's some money that went to them. One year, maybe... A couple of years. I don't know. It doesn't... It's... You know, there are other types of bodies that I've seen, not on less facts, but on some more facts, have become... Sure. Brown Act bodies. Okay. Okay. Well, maybe someone can answer this. I'm not sure they can. So, Council Member Brown, you might be able to answer this, too. I haven't been able to find anything specific as to the website and what happened exactly with it. And I don't think I actually watched that meeting. And I know at some point they either received money or a grant or something for a website. Could you tell us about that? Yeah. I think you know the best. Yes. I made the request. Okay. So, at the time, I was the chair of the Greater Chico Homeless Task Force. We were in budget season. I asked for a very small allocation from the city to help support a little bit of the work of the task force, particularly creation of the website. And purchase of the domain. The previous domain had been purchased by one of the executive team members. That person passed away. And so, we didn't have access to the URL or to anything else. And so, really, it was just an opportunity to fill that gap. We didn't spend all of the money that had been allocated. I think it was somewhere in the world of $126 that was spent simply to purchase that URL. And because of, you know, complications and tragedies that were occurring, we didn't have the opportunity to do some of the projects. That may have used some more of those funds, like putting on a conference and doing a little bit more educational outreach to the community. And so, those funds were not used. And I think the maximum that was used was somewhere around $126. And then, the following year, those costs were absorbed by individual committee members who wanted to keep the website going, knowing that there wasn't city funds available to fund it. So, it was just the domain name and the hosting? Yes. The first time? Yes. Okay. So, there wasn't any... There wasn't any creation costs or design costs or anything like that? No. That was... Actually, I created the website with an MSW, Masters in Social Work intern. It was one of her projects, and we worked on it together. And those updates are maintained by the executive team at no cost. Okay. I did actually... That was not the story I had heard, so that's good to know. Of course. All right. Any other questions before we move on to public comment, which at this time we should probably tell people to raise their hand? Yes. We do have hands that are being raised. I would like to note, just for the record, Sure. that when... And I can't recall... I believe that Mayor Sorensen at the time brought forward an item that was talking about any of the nonprofit agencies who were receiving funding from the CDBG grants, and that kind of thing would become Brown Act so that there could be a full transparency on that. And the council at the time voted to move in that direction. And then following that, um, because, you know, obviously the Brown Act allows and invites the public to the table and that kind of thing. But so when council did that action, then there was a flurry of emails and letters from the nonprofits indicating that they wouldn't be able to conduct their businesses, their business in that type of an environment. And so that kind of got rolled back. But that happened in... I believe... Yes, you were there. I'm sorry, I remember these names. And so I think it was around 2016. Yeah, I think so. On that. And then we have seven hands that are up and... All right, let's give them a chance. Possibly eight. So the first speaker will be Mike Trollander. Go ahead, Mike. Can you hear me? Yes. Go ahead. Yeah, this is a great conversation. I appreciate Council Member David for bringing it up. My comments are that I think that it's time to decouple yourself from the task force. Maybe it's okay to hang on to it, but council needs its own task force. It needs its own strategy. It needs to create its commission or whatever it's going to be. We put... We have to not tie into the city's position on homelessness that we get on cannabis because it could be a long way down the road. And so I hope to use this time to look at how to move forward on this and not just solve the issue of a task force. Those are my comments. Thank you. Thank you, Mike. Thank you, Mike. Next speaker is Katie Venn. She's a wonderful cook. Go ahead and unmute yourself. Thank you. Go ahead. Hello, Glenn. Thank you for taking my comments. Conferring the Greater Chico Homeless Task Force, it's crucially important that this task force stay as it is and that it stay functional. It brings together such important groups, the community, and it's created a network of people that can communicate and work together. And through it, as all of you should know and I'm sure do know, it's created Torah Shelter and CHAT and has helped to bring together small partners that work together quietly to help provide simple transportation and medical care and things that aren't noticed and aren't talked about loudly that create big differences in people's lives. These aren't things that should be swept under the carpet. And they're certainly not things that should be dissolved with trying to dismantle something that has been a 25-year program. And for someone who's only possibly attended one meeting to look at discussing changing it now, is... lunacy. I mean, why would we look at changing a 25-year program while homelessness is at its worst in Chico? That's adding gasoline to a fire. We need to look at expanding this, getting more people involved, and inviting more people to the table to help change this situation, not fewer. And if this council is really serious, about this situation, they would put council member... the former head of this program back on instead of council member Duff. Thank you. Chris Nelson is our next speaker. Go ahead and unmute Chris. Oh, okay. Thank you. Am I on now? Yes. Okay. So the important thing about this task force is it's all about collaboration. And we get professionals, people who are working in the field, people who know what they're talking about, and who work well together. You're able to problem solve and plan and advocate and remove barriers, increase access to safe and decent housing, and get services. For people who are unhoused, for people who are at risk of being unhoused. And it is really a different model than the Commission. The Commission is... looks down. It's like the overview thing that kind of focuses downward. It doesn't work in terms of the kind of problem solving that we need in Chico. You all are completely failing to help our unhoused people right now. And I'm sick. sick about what we're doing. But the service providers, the people who are in the tourist shelters, look at all the people that Chatham has housed. They have over 140 people that are housed right now. And it's because of collaboration. And this is why you don't want to break something that isn't broken. You want to be part of a successful team. So I would advise you guys to start meetings. You can all do that. I believe in it anyway. And I just cannot believe what you're doing in the Hunthouse. What you're doing, pushing these poor people around place to place, I mean, to me, it's like ethnic cleansing. I think you should all be just so ashamed of yourselves. It is so. It's so horrible to go out there and see these people. And the way that you've been treating them, I mean, it's like, eh. You know, I can't even tell you how dismayed I am about you. But don't destroy the few things that are working. Please. Thank you. Nicole Nava. Go ahead and unmute. There you go, Nicole. Hello. Thank you. You're welcome. So I am a student. I am definitely in favor of having some better oversight and connection to the council. I feel like it will benefit the community at large to have more transparency, be around what's going on, hopefully to get more professional type minutes and other outputs that the community can see happening. I think that people are speaking to these are the experts, people. They're the people that know what they're doing. And yet the homeless problem has grown. The issues experienced are not being addressed at the level they need to be addressed. And there's been an ample time and collaboration happening. And I think I'm happy that there has been new insight and input. And I think fresh eyes and voices are exactly what is needed in this situation. I think Ms. Councilmember Kami Denley has done her homework with statistics. And come her own way. And she's been prepared to meetings and been insightful into things that are going on. And so I think she will bring a fresh passion and energy to the process. And I have seen her be collaborative on things and have reflected and say, push the pause button. So I don't see a problem with that at all. I think unfortunately it's turned into some kind of think tank and like back padding experience, if you will, by too many people. And it's almost like too many cooks in the kitchen be affected. And I think it needs a revisit and a revamp. Ms. Denley has noted that she wasn't talking about dismantling. So I think people are running with rumor once again. As to some of the other bills brought up about the council failures, I don't think this current council is failing us at all. I think they're doing exactly what the community of Chico has asked for. I think they are trying to give due time and attention. They brought several solutions to the table to be discussed. Things were actually pushed back on by prior council members that would have immediately housed the homeless. So I think we need to reflect and consider. And by the way, I'm a neighbor near an area where someone's been speaking of. And I know very well what I've experienced, which is not feeling safe and having several fires near me and being exposed to things people shouldn't be doing. And for the Comanche Creek area that had the two propane explosions, that is extremely scary for people. And so we need people who are going to get in, understand that we're about keeping the community safe. And that means the unhoused as well. And that means getting maybe some new lifeblood into the situation. So we can get the county to the table faster and hopefully the state and hopefully reenergize these NPO states. Melody Probstel? Hi, thank you for including me. My name is Melody Probstel. I'm the regional director and chief advocacy officer for the United Way of Northern California. And I just wanted to speak to my concerns about this approach that has been taken. I hear the community talking about issues of transparency and making assertions that community service providers are failing to do their job. And I think that part of the concern, the issue here is that people are not actually getting involved. So when Nicole Mello was just saying, you know, just before me, that new voices should be infused into the process, well you're welcome to come. Please do. Come to the task force meetings, join the conversation, listen to what people are talking about, listen to what the challenges are, and take some time to really reflect on what your role is. I don't think that there is any way that as a community we could ever address homelessness without actually creating housing. That is the solution to people not having housing is that you create housing so that we can fail to provide affordable housing because the community doesn't give us a right to then go and punish people for not having housing. So I just want to point out that, you know, the community task force has brought a lot of great new ideas to the community. You know, such as the Torrey Shelter and CHAT. And it's really important that we don't lose track of that history and that value that this task force has brought and just continue to build on it. Again, you know, if people want to be involved in the conversation, the door is wide open. The community meetings are open. Right now, because of COVID, they're all conducted over Zoom. And anyone who wants to be involved, you know, you can go to the chat box, it's welcome to join them. And so I'm not really sure why there is this concern about lack of transparency. People are doing the best that they can in the current situation. Our nonprofits are doing the best that they can. There's not enough money, like people are talking about. And it's really important that the City Council really recognize that we're talking about citizens of your community that you are tasked with supporting and meeting their needs. And so I really hope that you will kind of take some time to look internally and recognize that these are people too. They may not move here from out of the area, just like members of our City Council, members of our City staff. But they are members of our City and they deserve to be recognized as such and to be treated with dignity. So thank you so much for taking the time to listen. I hope that people will get involved in the conversation and be willing to listen to the existing conversation that's been going on. Thank you. Okay, thank you, Melody. Jessica Gianola. Thank you, Council. I would like to first support the keeping of the existence of the task force positive. This request, it speaks to the clear misunderstanding that people in a park are not allowed to be involved in the work of the City Council. I think that's a really important part of the group to begin with. When I hear the late say words like accountability and echo chamber and giving more diverse thoughts and voices, I think that what we can expect is more instruction and even less help for a population that's already suffering and enduring more trauma because of misunderstanding the people that are there. We've even given less accurate information out to the public when we have people who don't understand the population taking control of the groups designed to help them. There are enough opportunities for that in Chico for instruction and pushback without taking control of another service where we need to add services and groups. The voices of the advocates are informed voices. They're professionals. They know their field. They believe it. They have degrees. They don't have an agenda. They have knowledge. And they have the new profession that they're missing greatly, especially from our current council leaders. You need to have that when working with traumatized people. People who are homeless are living in their primal brain. Every function is about surviving. How they're going to stay safe for the night, where they're going to get their next meal. They're not overly concerned with if they look unkempt or they left some trash in the ground. They need to have somewhere safe to sleep and not be assaulted in their sleep, raped, abused. All those things happen to our homeless out there. And they are our homeless people. Some of you out there are related to some of them. You can't keep acting like that because they're poor and they don't look kept, that we can't care about them. Or if they're from a different area, so it's okay to disparage them. Or if they're addicted. They're not worthy of being helped. So we need to make sure that we're protecting them, understanding them, and working together to keep them out of that situation. Please join with what's there. Dilly can join, like other people have mentioned. She can join if she's curious, if she's needing more information, which I think that she does need more information. There's a few out there that should. Leave comments. Create your new resources. Create a new group. Hi. I'm Dilly. I'm from the If you find it hard to do so, the more resources, the better out there. And I hope that each of you look further into who's out there and why. And what you need to do in your role to pull them from it and work together as a team. Thank you. Angela McLaughlin. Go ahead and unmute. There you go. Hi there. First, I want to preface this by saying I am the current chair of the task force, but my comments right now are as a black citizen member of the task force. Anything that I said on behalf of the task force would have to be approved by the task force membership, and my comments have not. So we've talked a little bit about the history of the task force already. I think probably the most important thing that we can bring up here. Is the collaborative nature of the task force. And as was mentioned earlier by city staff. Any kind of, if there was a requirement for Brown Act compliance, that would essentially eliminate the ability of service providers to collaborate. And that's a constant in our community, especially in this last year or two. Service providers are regularly in touch. And so that would be a no go. And that would essentially eliminate the task force. If you want to create a separate commission, by all means do so. It would certainly be costly in both dollars and staff time. That said, we are faced with a huge issue as opposed to the state right now. And if we can put more resources to that, to address some of those issues, it would encourage the city to do so. I'm disturbed that Cammy doing this, it strikes of just a punishment of people and groups that she has not agreed with in the past. She attended one task force meeting after bringing this forward, not before. Prior to that, she never attended a task force meeting. She doesn't have a clear idea of what we do at the task force. I would encourage Cammy and all city council members to attend a few meetings. One of the things that I just love about the task force, and it's actually an emotional sort of attachment for me, is that not only is it service providers, but it's like I said, community members, city staff, and service providers all come together. And everybody has an equal vote. You can become a member by attending one meeting and requesting a meeting. And then you can have a voice in that conversation and vote. Your vote has equal weight. It's arguably the most democratic institution in the city. I don't know how we could possibly ever oversight, you know, receive or disburse any funds. So there could be oversight of attending a meeting. But beyond that, I think this just doesn't make any sense. Okay. Thank you. Lisa Currier. Hello again. Go ahead. So I just want to echo what everybody said. I'm not going to repeat it again. But the beautiful thing that I find about task force is I've been a member for many years. And there are some times where I just can't manage to go every single month. But that's where I met. I met everybody in the community that services. The other thing about the task force is it is volunteers. Volunteer efforts from nonprofits and other people who come together, like-minded or not, you can agree to disagree, you can move forward. They have valuable information. And the way that I look at things is that there is never a stupid question. And only knowledge can be gained from going through this. So I believe that we should lead the task force as is. I believe just last month at the COC meeting or at the task force meeting, there was like 40 to 60 people there. That's a lot of big organizations such as the tourist shelter, the Salvation Army, the veterans, my organization, crisis care. The county supervisors, the city council. You know, everybody is welcome to come. If you don't like meetings, then don't come. Transparency, I don't know what anybody was talking about because there's myths on the website. There is a vow of reporting with three of them. What are we talking about? I need to confirm what transparency means. Does it mean that we're coming and you don't see the transparency of what someone else is doing with their agency after the meeting? Because this meeting is fully open to anybody who wants to attend. People generally like to attend. And that's where I build great friendships and relationships and collaborations with lots of agencies. And lots of different people. So people come in, people go from agencies and meet new people, new flash lines and new ideas. And sometimes I even take a break for a month or two and then come back and learn something new or have something new to offer. I think that we should embrace it, support it, and not run by a government body. I think that we're doing okay right now. Thank you. Thank you, Lisa. Ann Winters? Go ahead. Hi. I kind of attend a lot of meetings. I go to COC council meetings. I go to a lot of meetings that involve discussions around homeless folks. And Homeless Task Force is the only one that I go to that is attended by folks who are experiencing homelessness. And those folks about actually sat on the meeting. And I'm the one that sat on the council. So we're making sort of friendships, relationships, and we're having these collaborations happen. We're doing it with everyone. And we're not making decisions above the people that are experiencing these things every day. We're doing them hand in hand. I kind of find it interesting that Nicole talks about that it's a think tank. It kind of is. I don't really know what the sort of bad connotation of that is. We receive no funding. We control no funding. We have no say as to where funding goes. So it is a group of like-minded volunteers who get together and come up with ideas. And so I'm not really sure why a think tank is a bad thing in this instance. Additionally, I'm kind of also baffled by suggestions that this is not a transparent group. Again, as somebody who attends a lot of meetings, this is one of the more transparent groups that I attend, if not one of those. And I'm just really kind of wondering, and I'm sure there's a reason for this or justification for this, but I'm kind of wondering where council gets the power to do that. And I'm wondering if there's a reason for the power to come in and just take over this group. I know we talked about the history of it and that there were council members that were involved in the start, but it's existed for this long and no one decided that they needed to take it over. And I know that the coalition is not responsible for the creation of the Torage Alternate. We're also responsible for the creation of CHAT. But those groups were born out of the collaboration that happens there. So I'm not clear on how council gets to come in and just sort of decide that it should be a commission. I don't argue that we need a commission for homelessness. This isn't it. This is an entirely different animal. I think that it's kind of almost a bullying tactic to think that they can come in and just take this coalition over. Okay, our last speaker is Mary Kay Benson. So, she's using an older, we've gotten a message that she's using an older version of Zoom. Okay. I'm going to go ahead and promote her to panelists for a second. Go ahead, Mary Kay. Okay, thank you. You're welcome. You know, I just wanted to say that I'm a new member of this task force. I just attended one meeting and become a member. And I'm really impressed with it. I think that the city having a commission, another commission would be fine, but commissions cost money. No one's talked about it. I think that the fiscal impact of commissions. But I would like to just quote from somebody who knows a lot more about these things than I do. Quote, I sometimes fear that people think that fascism arrives in fancy dress, worn by protests and monsters, as played out in endless reruns of the Nazis. Fascism arrives as your friend. It will restore your honor. Make you feel proud. Protect your house. Give you a job. Clean up your neighborhood. Remind you of how great you once were. Clear out the venal and corrupt. Remove anything you feel is unlike you. It doesn't walk in saying, our program means militias, massive prison rooms, transportation. War and persecution. In my work with the defendants at the Nuremberg trials in 1945 to 1949, I was searching for the nature of evil. And I now think I have come close to finding it. The lack of empathy. It's the one characteristic that connects all defendants. The genuine incapacity to feel with their fellow man. Evil, I think, is the absence of empathy. That quote is by Captain G.M. Gilbert, the Army psychologist assigned to watching the defendants at the Nuremberg trials. And I just want to say that my friend Robert Van Fleet was arrested tonight outside the city council chambers. And I was threatened with the rest of my life. Okay. That was it for our speaker. All right. I have a couple of questions. And Alex, you might actually be able to answer some of these. But I think, Mr. Orem, you're going to have to chime in here as well. So we have, so let me start with Mark. Mark, we have a staff member who attends this meeting, correct? It's my understanding that our housing manager has attended these meetings for quite some time, yes. Marie Demers. On City Time, correct? That's on City Time is my understanding. And doesn't the department send out the notices of the meetings? Does the city have a meeting too? My understanding is she helps facilitate getting information out on the meetings. Yes. So the city, the housing department manages the MailChimp account that agendas and meeting minutes go out through the executive team is responsible for sending the agenda. So we do have some city involvement, obviously. And are the meetings still, I mean, obviously during COVID they're not held here anymore. Yeah. But are they still technically held here? I mean, like was the last one in February of 2020 held here? The last in-person meeting was held in conference room one. Is that? Yes. So they typically use the conference room. My guess is they don't pay to use the conference room. That's correct. Like every other non-city committee would. Sure. Okay. So, you know, I just want to say this is, and as people were talking about the board, that worries me a little bit. That you can attend one meeting and all of a sudden you're a member and you're a voting member of a board. That's not exactly accurate. Okay. So how does that? So anybody can attend a meeting. Anybody can be a member. And really being a member is being on the distribution list, getting all the information, having access to that stuff with ease. During my tenure as chair on the committee, really there was a strategic planning effort to try to get more people involved and also, you know, build a lot of people. And so we've been able to build a little bit more collaboration into the group. And so the process now is that there's organizations. It's a group of service providers and concerned community members. There's organizations who are voting members. An organization can say I want to be a voting member and then they have one designee that can be a voting member. Okay. And so that's how it works right now. I think, unless it's changed since I was part of it. So who sets the agenda for the meeting? The executive team, which is elected by the membership. Okay. And the council member appointed by the city council is automatically a member of the executive team. So you said you chaired it. Did you chair it because you were the city council member? I chaired it because I was selected by the executive team to be the chair. Okay. All right. So just from the information I've heard, I think we're on the happy path to a lawsuit. And probably should have been. But I think that's my opinion and everyone else's opinion who knows anything about boards and commissions and how they function in the Brown Act. So I'm very worried about the committee. And I'm not necessarily weighed in on one way or the other. But it can't stay the same. Because it's just a matter of time before someone says, yeah, that's not correct. You're using city. So either we need to take out the city. My opinion is we either need to remove the city staff from the committee, which some of the board members that are members that I talk to said, yeah, they don't really care. So that sounds fine. And it's more of a every point, everything said, but he said it sounds like more of a discussion place anyway. I'm violating my own rule to go too long here. So I apologize. I'll make this quick is. But if it goes the other way, then it has to be. So it can either be an official committee or they have to be out on their own. I don't think we really have any other choice. We have to make one of those decisions. So any other further discussion, Mr. Huber? It looks like you're reaching for your microphone. Yeah. A couple of speakers, I think, hit the nail on the head. Ann Winters was one who said, you know, there's nothing wrong with having a city commission, but this isn't it. Make the Greater Chico Homeless Task Force whatever it is, whatever you want to call the entity. But we should have a separate city commission on homelessness. I don't disagree with that at all. Can I make some comments? I'm chomping at the bit. Okay. Yes. Just to briefly touch on, Mayor, your conversation with Councilmember Brown. Just at the last meeting for the task force, they voted on executive board members and they had that voting session. And in order to be eligible to vote to make decisions, you just had to have attended one meeting and asked to be a member. And you were able to make votes. So just to that's how it was currently going. So it's only being done as of a week and a half ago. And then to address some other mentioned misinformation, I have this as short as possible. I promise. So to address some other mentioned misinformation in the last few minutes, the Greater Chico Homeless Task Force meetings are not all recorded. Even after a community member questioned at the last meeting why it wouldn't be recorded, they still chose not to record it. If you view the minutes from previous meetings, they are vague at best. And anyone who wasn't present would not be able to say for exactly what happened at that meeting. These are just a few aspects of transparency. And I'm not going to go into too much detail about transparency locking in the task force. In addition, when I mentioned a desire personally to share the link to the Zooms with the public, I was asked not to by the current chair because they felt it was a security issue. You must email the task force to request a link directly. Again, another issue and lack of openness with the community, which is a problem in our current environment with the homelessness and the issues surrounding it. Again, it's also been briefly mentioned that the Greater Chico Homeless Task Force is closely tied to the COC, which I brought up earlier. I believe is another important aspect that we look into. Its operations and voting members. As many of you know, the state auditor released a report last month indicating severe mismanagement among COC's continuums of care statewide. The task force does in fact have a vote on the COC. And that task force vote does affect where millions of dollars go in our community that as of now are not being allocated effectively. With the volume of money coming into these organizations and the lack of diversity in their decisions, I believe it would be behoove of us to revisit the intentions, makeup, and status of any connected committee, which would include the Greater Chico Homeless Task Force. I personally would like to see a restructure and more clearly defined mission. And one efficient way to do so would be to convert it into an official commission. Since the task force was created at the request of a previously seated council member, it is my understanding that we have the authority to revisit council created committees and amend or abolish them if the council chooses. Again, I'm not suggesting we abolish it. Those are just our abilities. And what we're allowed to do. As it stands, as it was mentioned, we already have city staff attending these meetings. So the creation of an official commission would see little change in regards to staff attendance and time. I believe that creating a commission would not exclude anyone currently participating in the task force and would in fact bring a more diverse board of voting members that's having a greater chance of affecting meaningful change in the community. The biggest piece we're missing here is that if everyone in the room has the same view on an issue, you're only going to get a reflectively small sample of solutions. The broader the range of views, the larger the pool of solutions. Anyone should view that as equally valuable. The creation of an official commission would not exclude local NPO's from participating in a continued roundtable style meeting. The only thing the amendment to become an official commission would do that might be viewed as negative would be the application of the Brown Act rules. If an organization is fearful of the Brown Act regulations, that to me is a sign that an amendment is in fact justified. I would like to make a motion to direct staff to look into the process around amending the task force to be an official city commission and bring it back to the council for consideration of a final decision. Mr. Martin. So, Cami, thank you for... There was a lot of questions about what this was all about. I had some and I think you just wrapped it up nicely. I think you have two questions. One was for a speaker that says this commission has been around 25 years. Why would you get rid of it except things have gotten worse? So that was kind of reverse logic. But my question, if we're going to have staff look at it and go, okay, do we make this an official city commission? Maybe put Suzy involved. Suzy Ketchum is the homeless solutions coordinator. From the speakers I heard, it sounds like all those people are going to take their balls and go somewhere else, which is probably okay. So it sounds like maybe you're saying let's set up, and to Mr. Huber's point, I think, let's set up our own commission and people that want to come and play with the city of Chico and what we're doing can come listen, but we'll lead it instead of the other way around. Is that kind of what you're saying? I understand that concept. However, as I mentioned, part of the concern with the transparency around this city-created task force is that, you know, the vote on the COC and the money allocated there and how it's being effective or not effective in our community, and if we create a brand new commission, that doesn't stand, which will continue to not be oversight. But that could be part of what the staff comes back with? Possibly. Okay. All right. Council Member Brown? Yeah, just a couple comments. And for clarification, you know, when I joined the task force, my number one goal was to get a really good understanding and lay it in the land of what the heck this is. And I think that's what the task force was and what they were doing and where they originated from. And so in that process, learned, and as new executive team members came on board, learned essentially what Ms. Presson illustrated, that this task force was not created by vote of the council, but was a passion project of a council member who had interest in confronting and addressing issues related to homelessness. For years, the city had no participation in this group prior to Andy Holcomb coming forward and saying, in honor of Conley and Jarvis, we should appoint a council member to participate in this group. It was never run by the city. It was never facilitated by the city. It was certainly born of a passion of a city council member. Look, the task force has been around for decades. And in my time as chair, what I found to be the most valuable piece is what a lot of the people on that Zoom call had shared. The most valuable use of this space is that it creates a forum for service providers, city leaders, and community members to explore and discuss evidence-informed solutions without the competition of funding on the table for, you know, to color and cloud discussions. We've had plenty of conversations about that. Preserving that function is the utmost importance for this group, and I'm really unclear as to why now is the time to change course on something that's been well established and running on its own for so many years. They elect their own executive team members and set agendas to help drive initiatives. Oftentimes meetings consist of an educational component by a service provider, talking about a program or service that they're offering, or some aspect of homelessness that we need more education on. Those topics are driven by the executive team and the body itself who can request topics to come forward for discussion or education. Oftentimes it includes people, as was mentioned, the executive team itself includes people who identify as homeless, allowing them some opportunity to be involved in the decision-making and the agenda setting around these issues. And to be quite honest, a lot of these meetings, when I was attending them, uncomfortable conversations were had. I think it was very clear by the speakers in this, during this meeting, that we have, sorry I say we because I was part of it for a couple years, have a culture of being able to agree to disagree. As a council member, I faced a lot of scrutiny in that room, and because I was showing up not expecting that I ran the group or that I was somehow in power of the group because I'm a member of the Chico City Council, it was an opportunity to listen, and I think that is the opportunity that we have. Community members need forums to explore solutions and discuss items related to homelessness without government intervention. If we want to create something, an official decision-making body, and put the staff time and put the money into setting agendas and noticing and putting out meeting minutes, I'm fine with having that conversation, but as was stated, this is not that group. This group has an opportunity to continue. It's grassroots nature, and I hope that if we make decisions, if we make decisions today to shift that lens or to try to transform it into something else, they continue to do their work independently of us. Mayor Coolidge, as you had mentioned in your discussions, there's not a lot of resistance to the idea of the city pulling out their support for the group itself through staff support and meeting space. And if that's what feels is necessary, then I'm not going to vote for it, but I get it. I get where you're coming from. I just don't think that this is the group, that something needs to be done by us to meddle in this group that has long, long operated independent of any support from the city. No, I appreciate that, and I know that wasn't necessarily towards me, so... No, not at all. No, but, you know, I do have a legitimate concern. I think we should all have a legitimate concern that the way that this organization is running right now is not legal. I mean, we would not create a committee this way. So something has to change. So, and I have no doubt that if, in fact, we change this committee and alter this committee, that you, in fact, end up with this, the members of this committee going, oops, creating something else that's the exact same thing without city staff, which they should probably have already. Can I make a really quick note, a point of clarification, because of something that councilmember said? The reason that the Greater Chico Homeless Task Force has a seat on the COC is not by virtue of city participation in the committee. It is by virtue of a place being reserved on the COC for local coalitions related to housing and homelessness to have a voting seat on the committee. It's not because it's a city-run group. Oroville has one as well that is volunteer and community-run. They have a seat on the COC. It's just by virtue of being a group that's invested and involved in the community. I just wanted to poke that out just to understand that. back but I didn't understand it or I didn't I don't remember it's been a lot yeah more so the motion was to direct staff to look into the process around amending the task force to be an official City Commission and bring that information back to the council for consideration of a final decision so we would hear back what our options are so I'd like to make a substitute motion which would be that the city discontinue its involvement with the greater Chico homeless task force and if this is not part of the motion but if that means starting our own Commission then that's fine but my motion is that the city discontinue its relationship with the greater Chico homeless task force so they can continue to do effectively what they do now just without the city participation I'll second that motion although I do hope council members will tune in all right mr. Jared when you have a substitute much because my first question is on the City Commission and I think it's important to know that the City Commission is a City Commission and I think it's important to know that the City Commission is a first time substitute motion so you take the substitute motion first take the substitute motion yes and that was a motion by councilmember Huber seconded still hold on sorry we were still waiting for a second on the first motion so does that matter or no okay all right clarification thank you go ahead so a motion by councilmember Huber seconded by councilmember Brown to discontinue the city's participation in this task force did I capture that okay all right councilmember Brown councilmember Denley no councilmember Huber councilmember Morgan no and I'll explain why after we're finished voting okay councilmember Tandon I'll abstain vice mayor Reynolds mayor Coolidge no but I think we have to like I said I think we have to take one direction or another so okay so it failed like to see us go one way so I'm gonna ask for a friendly amendment to Cammie's original motion and that that amendment be the the city clerk's office lead the analysis because they deal with the boards and the Commission's more than anybody I think mr. Huber to your point I was just about to vote yes I think it's an I think it's inevitable we're gonna go do this and they're gonna leave I just don't be like well Chico decided not to play I think that's gonna happen anyway so I didn't want to be like well we voted not to play with them let it be on them and if I understand mrs. den delay correctly and I think I do she just it's just like the pension obligation bond look at this look at how this could be is this a different way I'm sure the city clerk's office will confer with the city manager and the homeless solutions coordinator ago is this is there a better way for us to be involved here and then we'll see how the cards land. I'm perfectly all right with that if you're okay with my friendly amendment. I would accept the friendly amendment to have the city clerk feedback and direction. And then are you seconding her motion then? Yes. Okay, with your friendly amendment. All right. And I just wanted to make a quick comment is that I do believe this is probably going to come back and we probably will end up disbanding it. And I would like to see us do something perhaps instead of a standing committee that's going to be going on forever that is costing us a lot of staff time, maybe look at doing an ad hoc committee that has a defined goal of maybe like what we're working on right now with Susie of an immediate solution to whatever it is, a camping location, getting tiny houses done, whatever it is that has a defined action in a short amount of time, maybe it's six months or 12 months or whatever. But I'm hesitant to take. Disband the commission and take on another commission just because of I know staff time is limited. So that was my. Is that a substitute motion? No, that was just a comment before my vote. Okay. Okay. Council Member Brown. No. Okay. Hold on one second. For some reason, my computer is frozen. So I'm just going to wing it. Council Member Denley. Yes. Okay. Okay. I don't know. Hold on one second. I have to do it the old-fashioned way. The computer. All right. So Council Member Huber. No. Okay. Council Member Morgan. Yes. Council Member Tandon. Could you please repeat the motion? The motion was to direct the city clerk to bring back the analysis on what it would take to convert the Greater Chico Homeless Task Force to a commission. I understand that it was not pertinent to the commission. I understand that it was pertinent to the commission. I understand that it was pertinent to the commission. I understand that it was pertinent to the commission. I understand that it was pertinent to the commission. I understand that it was pertinent to the commission. I understand that it was pertinent to the commission. I understand that it was pertinent to the commission. I understand that it was pertinent to the commission. I understand that it was pertinent to the commission. I understand that it was pertinent to the commission. I understand that it was pertinent to the commission. I understand that it was pertinent to the commission. I understand that it was pertinent to the commission. I understand that it was pertinent to the commission. I understand that it was pertinent to the commission. but it would be at this point just an analysis of what it would look like, what would it take, and what would the purpose be. Okay. Madam Clerk, while we're voting on this one, can we take down at least the screen for the old one? It's frozen. Oh. That's why I'm doing it by hand. So absolutely. So I just, so Council Member Tandon, is that an aye? Okay. Vice Mayor Reynolds? Aye. Mayor Coolidge? Aye. Okay. That carries 5-2, and it will be reflected in the minutes, and that is not the vote for it. All right. All right. So it is, well, not done yet. 5-11 is my request to discuss the housing committee recommendations, and that item was already postponed, or actually it was added to this meeting, but because it's after. It's after 10 o'clock. It needs to be postponed, correct? So, and then 5-12 was already added back in. No items added after the posting of the agenda. So on the reports and communications, the following reports and communications items are provided for the Council's information. No action can be taken on items under this section unless the Council agrees to include it on a subsequent agenda. City Manager's report. Just really quick. The Homeless Solutions Coordinator has been very, very busy. Had a very productive meeting with the Council, the county, in relation to homelessness. Been having very productive meetings with federal officials, looking at all the varying funding mechanisms, finding more hurdles than there are access points. Been viewing some shelter options, actually on Sunday. She was busy looking at some potential sheltering options. There's a lot to come, but I just want to assure the City Council, and I know that I was asked to come back where I could to kind of give simple updates, and that update will be coming forward once there's more meat on those, but I just wanted to reassure the City Council that there's a lot of discussions and productive movement on that front. So we'll be coming back later with some more on that. Thank you. All right. So 6.2, Councilmember requests pursuant to APP and 1010. Councilmembers may verbally request an item agendas at a future meeting after stating what item would be a majority vote of the Council's need in order for staff to agendize. Councilmembers may submit requests in writing. Thank you. Does anyone? Mr. Huber first raise his hand. Yes, thank you. So the City Clerk has handed out a description of a short-term plan for outdoor sheltering in place. I'd like to request that the Council allow for agendization of a presentation and discussion of a short-term plan for outdoor sheltering in place. I'd like to request that the Council allow for agendization of a presentation and discussion of a short-term plan that a group of private citizens have been working diligently on, which would utilize a combination of private, federal, state, and grant funding to operate an outdoor shelter on private leased property. Allowance of a use permit for camping will be needed as part of this, what they're proposing. And a key component of the presentation will be to request a temporary permit for camping. A temporary permit will be to request a temporary halt to campsite evictions until a lease is in place or until a specified date. So this conceptual framework for a short-term plan is on the back of the request that I made, and I'm seeking help in getting that on a future agenda. All right. I'm happy to support it and have this discussion. I haven't had a chance to thoroughly review the proposal, but I think we need to exhaust all options, and clearly using city-owned property isn't leading to as much results as we might want. So I'll make the motion to agendize the discussion. All right. We have a motion. Do we have a second? All right. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. Motion dies for lack of a second. Oh, we did? I was . No, she made the motion. Give me a second, and if you want to vote on it. Okay. That's what I was waiting for. Okay. All right. We have a motion and a second. Okay. Council Member Brown? Aye. Council Member Denley? Abstain. Too much information. Okay. Council Member Huber? Yes. Council Member Morgan? No. Council Member Tandon? Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds? No. Mayor Coolidge? You know, I think our city manager just detailed out a fact that we're already pursuing this in multiple ways, and I think that's a good thing. And we've been having several emails and conversations along with city staff as well as county, so I'm going to vote no as well. Okay. It fails due to a tied vote with one abstention. I have a request. All right. Council Member Brown, you were next. And I'm sorry for the length of this. I feel like I need to make a little bit of context, but I'm going to do my best to speed through it. All right. So in the staff report related to creating an outdoor sheltering environment at the BMX site, we were provided with a program that was not available to the public. It was a progression synopsis that included relocating the BMX site to a new location at the airport as essentially a critical component of using that property. While I understand that's the ideal scenario, there's some new information that's been brought to my attention that that might not be the only scenario possible for utilizing the BMX site. In that report, it was also proposed that the outdoor sheltering environment would cost over $600,000 for operational costs for three months and one-time purchases. My understanding is that the BMX site is not available to the public. I think this was a best case budget scenario presented by the North State Shelter Team who is the entity that has agreed to help operate the campground and not a minimum budget necessary to effectively operate an environment like this. Again, new information for me. So I'm going to try to speed through some of this. It's been brought to my attention that the current of the BMX property has engaged in several discussions among them with the North State Shelter Team, previous council members, that he would be open to the northern-most vacant four-room. fifths of an acre of the BMX property to be utilized immediately as a sanctioned campground, as long as a fence was built to separate the campground from the rest of the utilized site. I called the owner to confirm this, and he shared that this would absolutely be a viable opportunity under those circumstances as we work collaboratively. He didn't say this was a condition of it, but as we know, we're working collaboratively to raise the funds necessary to finalize the BMX site's move. And so we can either support the raising of funds for the new BMX site or partially or fully fund that effort to honor promises made by previous councils. This really does seem to be an amazing opportunity to establish a small outdoor sheltering environment for a fraction of the cost previously proposed to us. So we have a portion of land that's available and a willingly see. We have the service providers who are ready to step up and manage the environment. We have the opportunity to look at partially or fully funding this effort and exploring additional funding. For the COC or other COVID dollars coming to the city, what I'm asking, but more than that, we have a dire need for a facility like this and an opportunity. Not to interrupt, but this sounds more like the actual discussion than the request. Well, the request is coming. I needed to lay out the context. My request is that, my motion is that council bring back the discussion of an outdoor sheltering environment on the proposed four-fifths of an acre at the BMX site and direct staff to work with the leasing and the leasing of the BMX site. And ultimately, what I will be requesting is to direct staff to work with the leasing and the shelter providers who are ready to run the project to look at budgeting and operational requirements. It seems like we, you know, we've covered a lot during that meeting. This was something that was missed. We didn't get an opportunity to discuss it. It seems viable. And, you know, across the aisle, I see an outdoor sanctioned campground as a viable opportunity to move people out of homelessness and along that continuum. And so, this seemed like a great thing to approach. All right. So, I don't think she made the motion. I did make a motion. Oh, okay. So, you made the motion. Good question. You said you talked to the owner? No, the leasee, right? We're the owner of the site. So, essentially, the leasee just said, there's four-fifths of an acre that we're not using. If you build a fence, we're good. And so, you know, there may be other hoops, but that's the conversation that I've had, and that was shared with me. The only hesitation I would have towards that, that conversation has been had by Suzy multiple times. And we haven't had that conversation, or had that information shared with us particularly. Maybe some of you have, but I... No, just because it came to a flat dead end is why. So... Anyways, we're... Yeah. Yeah. Okay. We're going to agendas. Madam Clerk. Council Member Brown. Council Member Denley. No. Council Member Huber. Yes. Council Member Morgan. Yes. Council Member Tandon. Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds. Yes. Mayor Coolidge. Yeah. Like I said, I think we're already doing it, but yes. Carries 6-1. All right. Anyone else? Okay. I have one. And it's for a review of the COC, just like we're doing with behavioral health. Because I continually get questions from constituents asking, what's happening with the COC? Where's the money going? Why don't we have it? Why aren't they helping? And honestly, I don't know the answers to most of those questions thoroughly. So... Can I make that a motion? Yeah, I'll make that a motion. Okay. I second it. All right. Thank you. Madam Clerk. Okay. Let me get it entered. Council Member Brown. No. Council Member Denley. Yes. Council Member Huber. No. Okay. Okay. Council Member Morgan. Yes. Council Member Tandon. Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds. Yes. Mayor Coolidge. Aye. Carries 5-2. All right. Okay. At this time, we will adjourn to... Oh, sorry. Monthly financial reports. Okay. Information only. But this time, we'll adjourn to closed session. We'll be reporting out closed session at the end of this. If anyone has information, information that they miss or happen to miss at closed session, they're more than welcome to call the city clerk in the morning, and she will provide a closed session update to you. Just... Thank you very much. Just for the record, there were no public comments on closed session and... Okay. Before we adjourn officially, public comments on closed session? There were none. No public comments. I just needed to have that in the record. We'll now adjourn the meeting. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.
