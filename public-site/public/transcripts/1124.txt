So the first announcement I have is that item number 5.2  regarding the AHRPB amendments has been continued to a future meeting  at the request of staff in order for them to continue their discussion on that matter.  Speaker card announcement.  Anybody that was wishing...  Any person wishing to address the Council on any item listed on the agenda  must first complete a speaker card,  which can be found at the back of the Chamber.  Once completed, please turn in the card to the City Clerk.  Speakers are taken in the order the cards are received,  and once the first speaker begins their comments,  no additional cards will be accepted.  So, item 1.6, budget presentation.  Mr. Mark Swanson.  Thank you, Vice Mayor and Council.  Thank you, Vice Mayor and Council.  Thank you, Vice Mayor and Council.  Pursuant to the City Charter Section 701,  it is my honor to present you all with proposed budget for fiscal year 2023-2024.  We have an interesting backdrop, as I'm sure everybody has noticed.  Very interesting world events.  A lot of economic uncertainty, whether you're looking at the state,  the federal level, even the world level.  And it gives us plenty of reasons for concern as we look ahead at the budget.  Indeed, one thing we did call out in the budget,  is that we have noticed a flattening of sales tax.  So, we all want to keep an eye on that as we move forward.  Measure H revenues offer great news in terms of more resources to address things like roads, infrastructure, public safety.  But unfortunately, as we've discussed previously,  it's built on a fairly old projection that didn't have any hard facts behind it.  It was really based on looking at trends,  and other similarly sized districts.  So, we're really looking forward to having some actual data to actually lean on heavily.  And additionally, there is a ballot initiative on the ballot November of 2024  that has the potential to nullify Measure H effective in December of 2025.  So, all of those factors cause us great concern about reliance too heavily on Measure H  for ongoing operations.  And on top of that,  public safety operating costs, leaving about a $4 million cushion that, again, helps us  account for some of the uncertainties as we move forward.  In the category of good news in the past year, we saw a rebuilding of our HR and risk management  department that was at about half staff, now fully staffed, at least for a few more weeks,  before we have to fill one expected departure.  Building department, some really fantastic news there, a department that had nine vacancies  out of 15 positions just nine months ago, by the end of this month, fully staffed.  And it's firing on all cylinders under building official Dale Fletcher's leadership.  He's really creating a place where people want to work and really want to deliver stellar  customers.  So, thank you to our service from our building department.  Engineering, welcome back.  Brendan Autobani, but unfortunately, he's got some work ahead of him.  He's got 13 out of 35 positions vacant.  And particularly with the Measure H funds, we desperately need that engineering capacity  to deliver the projects that the public is expecting from us.  Another challenge, police department.  The chief will be talking about that.  Later on, here again, we have a high level of vacancies, roughly 13 out of 80 officer  positions are currently vacant.  And without addressing that unfortunate reality fairly quickly, we see that number growing,  which obviously is not helpful towards delivering the level of service that I know you all want  to deliver.  Thank you, sir.  In closing, I'm honored to report that your city staff has worked diligently to provide  the necessary support for the city to prepare a budget that does, to the maximum extent  we think possible, make Chico a safe place to raise a family, an ideal location for business,  and a premier place to live.  And with that, I'm going to introduce a video and then turn it over to Barbara Martin.  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  And good afternoon.  And good afternoon, everybody.  We wanted to show you that video kind of to give a little taste of what we have accomplished this year.  We kind of keep going and look forward to the next thing, to the next thing.  But there are many things that we've done here at the city that we've accomplished.  And that's just kind of a tip of the iceberg of everything.  But really is a good way to look at over a few minutes what we have been doing around here.  So as we look forward to next year, let's talk about 23, 24.  Before budget.  Okay.  Before we get started, I just want to take the opportunity to thank all of you council members for being here today and participating in this,  as well as all the department directors and all the departments that were involved.  This almost 900-page document doesn't get done very easily.  And it's quite a process.  And it takes many people to do it.  Our administrative services department all have hands in it.  Okay.  And I want to do a special thank you to Amanda McGar and Sarah Lurda and also Sherry Kelly back over there.  They were a small and mighty team who put this together.  And it was many hours, many days.  And just want to say that before we get started.  So the City of Chico proposed annual budget.  You will see in the beginning pieces of the document, we have some icons.  Last year, there was a process that was done by the city council.  Where some strategic planning was done.  And some vision and goals were established at that time.  You will see throughout the presentation today and also throughout the budget document.  These icons that represent kind of those goals.  So we can really show what we are focused on and what we are intending to do.  Balanced budget.  Obviously, we want to be able to have sound fiscal established resources and funds available for what we need to do.  Infrastructure.  Obviously, a high priority throughout the budget.  We want to be able to fund them and to maintain them to current and high standards.  And then public safety.  Make sure that we are a safe place to live.  Housing.  Looking to increase housing and establish housing for all citizens of the City of Chico.  Economic development.  How do we do all the things that we want to do.  We need to grow our economy and develop the relationships in the businesses so that we can do that.  And then finally.  As Mr. Sorensen indicated.  Our motto is the City is committed to making the Chico a desirable place to live, work and recreate due to the City's commitments to its parks and community.  That's the main focus.  So as we get going forward in the budget.  I just want to highlight some of the things that are new in the budget document.  We try to keep things standard.  Because it's easier to read and it's easier to find things if you know where to look.  But some of the changes that we have.  We have just a couple minor editorial changes in our budget policies this year.  And then fund five.  Which is our measure H fund.  Going over quickly the budget policy changes.  I have the page numbers in the actual binder document here of the budget policies.  But as you can see this is just a strike through piece of the language in the budget policy regarding economic development.  And then for our budget policy that is regarding surplus funds.  I wanted to make sure that we are delineating that.  That that is just the fund one portion of our general fund surplus.  Because measure H now and the funding for that fund is part of the general fund umbrella.  We just know that those are for special purposes.  And Council directed.  Proposals.  Projects.  So we don't want to put that in this same category as this general fund surplus budget policy.  Because we have we don't know what is happening with that fund specifically yet.  And we want to be able to have some flexibility there.  So just adding the fund one piece there.  And then on the flip side of that.  Because measure H funds and fund five are part of the general fund in general.  We want to make sure that any operating costs that are in the fund.  Part of that are part of our reserve policies.  So we have an emergency reserve fund policy where 20% of our operating costs are put aside for a rainy day.  And we want to make sure that fund five is incorporated into that.  And also 52.  But 52 is just our community specialized community service fund.  And that's where we do most of our pallet shelter costs and that sort of thing.  And that's a direct transfer from the general fund.  It doesn't have its own funding source.  And then also.  On the operating budget side.  We have a policy that 7.5% of our operating reserve.  Which means we want to have a bottom line at the end of the day.  Of about 7.5% of our operating expenses.  We're also including fund five in that as well.  Now measure H fund.  PDF 50 that's the PDF that's on the website.  And the budget page 48 in the binder.  We have designated the fund five as measure H fund.  So that we can see exactly what revenue is coming in.  And what exactly we're spending it on.  So anybody who's interested.  Public or anybody can see.  Exactly what we're appropriating those funds for.  And where it's going to be spent.  You will see some details on the bottom of the fund summary.  I'm not expecting you to see that.  Those words there.  But that detail on the bottom.  We do transfer into our roads fund of monies from measure H.  And we have a fund that's going to be used for the next five years.  So we can specify what projects are being paid for by measure H on the bottom there.  Trying to make it clear and transparent for everybody.  Now I just want to also call out new capital projects.  Again not intending you to read every single piece of these lines.  But just want to call out that we.  This list of projects here is everything that we started anew.  That we're proposing for 23-24.  So we already have a pretty long list.  We have a pretty lengthy capital project list.  And CIP program.  And these are all the additional things that we're intending to add this next fiscal year.  So you can find that on CIP page 7 in the PDF 383 if you're interested.  Now moving on to some of the general fiscal issues.  Want to make sure that we talk about the five year projection.  Now when I talk about the five year projection.  That is talking about the general and park fund.  And the funds encompassing.  Like I say funds 1, 2, 5, and 52.  These are our discretionary funds.  These are the funds that we can use as the council.  As the public.  As everybody as city manager recommends and sees fit.  All of our other funds are used for specific purposes.  So this is where we really want to keep track of our operational costs and etc.  To make sure that we're doing things in prudent financial ways.  So looking at our revenues.  To begin with.  Sales tax.  We have the district sales tax which we estimate is going to be about 26% of our general and park fund revenues.  And then our normal sales tax as you would call it of 31%.  So sales tax in general makes about 57% of our revenue.  So when that goes up and down that can be a real fluctuation in our operations.  And what we have to spend going forward.  So we really try to keep our eyes on that.  And not do things too overzealously.  Talking about district sales tax and Mr. Sorensen saying that we are looking at that from a cautious standpoint.  We're kind of waiting and seeing how that's going to go.  And hoping to be able to come back later on after we have maybe two quarters of data.  So that we can provide you with an update of what those revenues may look like.  And if there's additional funds available then perhaps appropriate maintenance.  And then we can see more projects or what we need to do at that point.  So you can see the other splits of the different revenue sources.  Property tax being our second highest.  And then different places there.  Utility users tax.  Transit occupancy tax.  That's the tax on hotels and short term rentals, etc.  Okay.  Five year projection.  So if you can see this.  This year we're estimating that our revenues are going to be about $74 million.  Next year we're increasing it to $94 million.  And that's a specific product of the district sales tax.  Looking at all of this.  We can look at the bottom line.  And see that we are balanced.  Which is our ultimate goal.  You can see here.  This is our district sales tax line item.  Right now we're looking at a projection of about $24 million.  We are initial thoughts is that it will be closer to what the amount is in the general sales tax.  But again, we don't want to overshoot that.  Because we don't like to do that in our financial world.  And then as you can see in the line above that.  Our general sales tax.  You can see for next year we're actually looking to have it reduce a little bit from this year.  But then pick up again.  And conservatively looking in the out years that we're going to be at about a 2% growth going forward.  Again, we're in such uncertain times from an economic standpoint.  We don't want to over overcharge that.  We want to overshoot those areas.  And again, at the bottom line.  We're balanced all the way through from operations.  Now this isn't all the spending that we're doing.  That's not our bottom line.  Bottom line.  But that's if we were to cut out all the one time funding for projects and et cetera.  That's where we would be.  You can see our sales salaries and benefits costs are the biggest cost drivers for the general fund.  And those costs that we have in the out years includes any additional costs that we have in the general fund.  Salary increases that are already established based on pay schedules.  Any estimated increases that we have for CalPERS and other benefits.  And those type of things that are known.  So looking at expenditures by department.  You can see that we have everything split out.  And this is all expenditures in the general fund.  A lot of times we look at this from just an operational standpoint.  But it's important to see that all of the dollars that are coming in through the general fund are being divided through the general fund.  And that's what we're doing throughout the different departments.  Fire, police, general government encompasses administrative services, human resources, city clerk, city manager, et cetera.  You can see that community development is just a small piece of that.  And that's not to say that we're not funding them at all.  It's just that they have their funding sources are majorly from development fees and things like that.  So they don't draw from the general fund to a great deal.  Public works includes both engineering and public services.  And operations, engineering itself doesn't have a big piece of the general fund because they do a lot of capital projects which are funded by grants, development fees, et cetera.  So looking at the kind of bottom of the five-year projection, that top line there is where we left off on the last slide.  And you can see that we have capital improvement projects.  That's not to say that those are the only capital improvement projects that are being paid for by the general fund.  You can see that we have capital improvement projects.  That's not to say that those are the only capital improvement projects that are being paid for by the general fund.  And you can see in the other financing uses, you can see that $22 million that's for next year.  I'll go into that in a minute.  But that's a big chunk of it.  And that's really just transferring to other funds that are paying for capital projects.  So as you can see, our desired operating reserve is $4.3 million for next year.  We're targeting about $6.5 million.  Again, this is we're doing a conservative approach when it comes to the capital improvement projects.  on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on  worth around November or so and be able to have a better idea of what that's going to  look like for the rest of the year.  At that point, we could possibly come forward with additional appropriations for other things.  Again, in talking about other financing sources and uses, that's this section here, and that  goes to this page.  Now, you can see there's many things that the general fund transfers their dollars to  for other purposes.  Things like equipment replacement, fleet replacement, technology replacement.  The biggest one is the streets and roads.  That's our streets and roads fund.  That is what we pay for for all streets and roads activities, including maintenance, including  capital projects, et cetera.  You can see for next year, the general fund is transferring $15 million and going on into  the out years.  That's kind of where the funds are going.  It does reduce over the years because over time, our operational costs are going to increase  at a heavier pace than what we're projecting for revenue, but of course, that can change.  Before I go any further, I encourage you all, if you have questions along the way, to ask.  I have a question.  Yeah.  Both sources of sales tax are 1%.  Yes.  Why aren't the numbers the same?  Because they are charged differently for different.  Things.  So for the Bradley Burns tax, which is the general sales tax, it is charged on different  things, and it's part of our pool, which comes from online sales.  And then the district tasks, it's very much driven by shipping point and where things  are delivered from.  And so it can shift a lot because there's a lot of delivery sales and that sort of thing  that happens.  We just don't know.  Let me throw out two quick examples.  A big segment of sales in Chico are building materials.  So let's say you ship a $50,000 truckload from Chico up to Paradise.  We get the Bradley Burns 1%, but Measure H does not apply.  Instead, Paradise's district tax applies.  Vehicles, another huge category for City of Chico.  When it comes to the district tax, it's based upon the registration address, not where the  sales are.  So we don't know exactly how those are going to play out, just as two big examples.  When you did say that Measure H funds may turn out to be the same as the other sales  tax, though, you mean so that sales tax would then be higher and Measure H would be higher  because there is this discrepancy, like always, between them?  Yes.  Thanks.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  So just to point out, talking about roads, because that is a big topic, we have a Streets  and Roads Fund.  Again, don't read the small print, but I just want to show you where it is so you can see  it.  All of road-related activity is in this fund.  It's Fund 307.  It's on Budget Page 77 and 78.  You can see here that it's two pages worth of capital projects that are happening here,  along with other operational activities that are happening.  Total expenditures in this fund between this year ending 22-23 and fiscal year 23-24, we're  looking at just under $150 million of appropriations for all these different activities.  Now, this isn't funded all by general fund.  It's not funded all by gas tax, but you can see below that the final section, the different  sources of funds that come in there includes general fund, includes gas tax, and then you  can see the grants to a high extent, some of the different development impact fee funds,  et cetera, bond proceeds, and some from our public infrastructure replacement fund.  So if you want to see the details there, that's where you can find it.  Now, that's kind of a broad overview of where we are with all of the financials, and then  we're going to get into departmental presentations.  And what we have going on in each of our departments.  And I will lead things off.  So for the administrative services department, we have goals.  We want to make sure that we are providing timely and accurate financial reporting, safeguards  to process financial transactions, in other words, internal controls, so that we make  sure that our transactions that we're putting into the system is accurate and secure, making  sure that we are monitoring cash, monitoring financial activity.  And then also from an information systems perspective, providing a secure and functional  computer network system.  And our mission.  We are really an internal service department, so we provide the tools for other departments  to do their activities, both in finance and in information systems, make sure that their  computers are working, make sure that their different activities on programs are working,  we make sure that they're paid from payroll.  So we really serve the other departments.  We're funded by a general fund, internal service funds, and grant funds.  Grant funds being mostly for our fiber utility.  New for 23-24, in finance, we are asking for an additional $60,000 for our financial system  upgrade.  We have a system that we upgraded, I think, in 2016-17, and we're about at the point where  they're not going to support.  They're not going to support our version anymore, so we're going to be forced to upgrade.  It's not a full change of the system, it's just moving to a newer version, so it's not  as expensive as establishing a whole new system.  So that's what that's for.  And then in information systems, we are asking for a new position called a cybersecurity  analyst.  Really, this is top priority for our information systems division.  I know that you hear in the news quite often about ransomware.  In fact, I'm not sure I've heard that before.  No one's ever spoken on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on  payroll information of every all the employees of the city and then also our  water pollution control plant is very computerized and if that shuts down you  know what we're in deep so this person will really be on kind of on a day-to-day  looking at the vulnerabilities and what we have there we were like a lot on  software that we have currently to do that but of course those are standard  issues that software is looking at not really taking a deep dive this position  will also look at updating our policies to make sure that we are kind of doing  good practices within the city to make sure that we're not vulnerable to these  to these attacks working with employees to make sure their passwords are update  make sure that we're doing dual authentication and just really being the  internal auditor of that activity so and then amongst those things will also be  in a support to the information center  systems department in general and then the other piece that we're asking for on  the personnel side is just upgrade we have one of our information systems  analyst to a senior information systems analyst and that's just to provide  better service so that we can have more duties covered by a more senior level  person now just talking about information systems in general there's  three divisions to the information systems  divisions on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on  to kind of work through that. And in that lane, there is a request for funding for conduit  for road improvement projects. So currently when we have our road improvement projects,  there's not always funding for the tubes that go in the street to pull fiber someday. This is not  for the actual fiber or broadband specifically, but it's to have money set aside there so that  when road projects come online, we have the ability to put that conduit in there and have  a place to fund it so that down the road, we don't have to go back and dig up the road and  put the conduit in later. So it's kind of a reserve for that purpose. Continuing to look at  the pilot project, we are almost at construction. We're trying to get the final RFPs for construction  going. So we're hoping to get that going.  Very soon. And then information systems. Again, internal service. Access control improvements.  That's all of the key cards that everybody gets going into the doors, making sure that we have  secure environment for all of our employees. And then assisting departments with paperless  process improvements, trying to go into a more digital age so we are saving trees and having  a better way to file things. Always doing replacements for computers. And then also  getting the information systems. So we're hoping to get that going. And then information systems.  on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on  in a building that's a city building that our police and fire are able to communicate  their radios and not have any dead spots. And then the P25 replacements and go live. This is  an ongoing project in our radio world. It's to upgrade all of our radios. It's already funded.  We're not asking for any more funding. It's just ongoing. But it's to replace all the safety radios  so that they can eventually communicate with other agencies because this is kind of the standard  and also have the most up-to-date. We had radios that were very, very old and broke and were  unreliable. So we don't want that with our safety folks. And then finally, our mock alert for fire  stations 2, 3, 4, and 5. That's the alerting system that wakes everybody up and tells them  you better get going to the next emergency. And that is what we have on the Administrative  Services Department. Before I pass it on to the next department director, do you have any questions?  Question?  Thank you.  This, the page you have up on your presentation, it's not in the budget binder, is it?  What page? Which one?  The one that's on the screen. Yeah, thank you.  Oh, the Project 50588, that one?  I was trying to find this page in the budget.  Oh, no, this is not in there. This is just highlights from the presentation. I'm sorry.  I misunderstood what you were talking about.  I'm sorry. I didn't explain that correctly. Thank you.  Yeah, no, this is just for this. But we will have the presentation online once we're done.  Ah, that's right.  Yeah.  I knew you would be ahead of us.  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right, we'll move on to the City Clerk.  Thank you, Mayor, Collegiate Council. It is an honor again to be here, and thank you so much  for  your time.  Thank you.  Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to talk about my department. I will not belabor  it as we just recently went over a lot of things in my evaluation. So, let me just see. We  did talk a lot about, obviously, the management, the records management program, which is well  on its way to beginning, and I believe that in the end, we will have a robust system that  will protect the integrity of all of our records. And I can't think, again, I will acknowledge  the City of New York for that. I think it's a great opportunity to talk about that. I  believe on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on  and training session for our newly appointed boards and commission members, and that's  required in APMP 10-1. And we're excited about that. We believe that it'll provide those  individuals with the tools necessary to understand their role, responsibilities, and be able  to get through public meetings in an efficient manner. We're also working with Granicus,  the peak agenda management program. That is a program that, again, as I mentioned before,  we tend to look in the city clerk's office, how can we streamline, how can we develop efficiencies?  And so this is a part of our program that we are evaluating to see if that will actually help us.  We are also going to be providing some trainings this year for our staff members, especially  brand new employees who are coming in, and this is their first public sector job. We're very  excited about that and look forward to providing them also with some background into our  system.  So we're going to be providing some background into our system, so we're going to be providing  some background into our city, the history, as well as the purpose and anything that we can do to  assist them in their roles. So let me see. So obviously our mission is to maintain the integrity  of the city government and the city of Chico, and one of the things that I value and what I pride  myself on and I know as well as my staff is that we're the first contact often for our citizenry  and for our council members, and that is very important. And we want to make sure that they  are citizens and the council have access to their government, as well as accessing meetings,  which we do through our streaming videos and through the public TV channel 11. We also make  sure that we maintain accurate recording of the city council proceedings, and that's through those  minutes. And while sometimes we spend hours on minutes, they are very, very important. And when  you go back into my office and you look at the books that were handwritten and  calligraphy from the 1800s, you'll understand why it's important to protect the history.  So again, our mission and where our records management program works well is preserving  city documents and records, and which ones do we keep, which ones can we destroy because they  have reached their shelf life, and how do we do it appropriately? So again, that ties back into  our records management. We are funded by the general fund, the Granicus side, anything to do  with council meetings, we're going to be doing that. And we're going to be doing that for the  city council meetings and citizen access through our Granicus programs, that's through the PEG fund.  And you can see our total budget requested, total personnel cost, and our current number  of positions are five. Now, as mentioned before in my evaluation, we did request a multimedia  and communications coordinator. Just want to do a shout out to our contracted team of  videographers who sit in that booth each council meeting and board and commission meeting.  They've, Kayvon has been doing this for, well, longer than I arrived, and that's been 23 years  ago. And looking to add and bring that position in-house to make it robust and to be able to  provide videos for trainings that other departments are putting on, as well as possibly some  communications aspects in terms of our city website. We did ask, and unfortunately, it's a  large chunk of money for $450,000.  No, but on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on  Does anyone have any questions?  Questions?  Do you have any more?  We don't need to get into it here, but do you have an overview of the records management project?  I would really like to understand that better.  Perhaps you could send a summary out to the council members.  What I'll do, as soon as we develop that whole management plan, we'll send that out to the whole council.  Great. Thank you.  Happy to do that.  Any other questions?  Thank you.  Okay.  Mr. Sorensen, welcome.  Thank you.  A lot of this is the same as last year, but I did want to highlight bullet number three,  mostly driven by Jennifer McCarthy.  The city manager's office is always engaged in engaging businesses  and understanding their needs.  In terms of city services, often that relates to these folks over here, building, planning, engineering,  and try to streamline those processes as much as we can.  Clearly provide not only fiscal, but I refer to it as service quality leadership to the organization.  And again, look to these folks to deliver the services,  and our team is to support them any way we can to make them all successful.  And obviously, effectively operationalize city council policy direction to the best of our ability,  and to ensure that all of the city staff is engaged in the directions that city council decides to go.  In terms of year over year changes, we're about even with last year's same number of positions,  even though we'll have to hire one since Debbie stole one.  But otherwise, no changes in the city manager's department.  Thank you.  I just noticed that your strategic goals, there's more of them on your slide than there are in our budget binder.  Yeah.  Good afternoon, Mayor, Vice Mayor, members of the council.  So our human resources department has grown and been staffed exponentially this year.  Which is really wonderful to see.  We are now fully staffed at six positions.  And this is my mistake.  I'm asking for a seventh position.  So the proposed would be seven.  So I think that was a little error on my part.  Our funding sources are from the general fund and internal service funds.  Our strategic goals.  We want to create and enhance strategic partnerships within the community.  Thank you.  We're reaching out now that we are moving into a post-COVID era to rebuild our community partnerships,  get out there with our recruiting teams and really cultivate that diversity inclusion out in the public  so that we can attract people and aggressively market the city of Chico as an employer of choice.  We're working with our different departments on how best to do that because, as Mr. Sorenson mentioned,  we are not going to be able to do that.  We do have some critical vacancies in our departments.  And so that is a core goal of ours to get out there and, again, market city of Chico as an employer of choice.  And then retain our talent through growth opportunities internally.  We, again, continue our mission through these partnerships.  We want to make sure that our applicants understand that we value them, even if they don't get selected for the position.  Everybody has.  We want to make sure that we are not just a small number of people that are not selected for the position.  We want to make sure that we are not just a small number of people that are not selected for the position.  We do try to provide that external customer service as well to let people know where they are in the process.  We want to make sure that the city of Chico is known as an employee-centric work culture.  We're an employer of choice.  We're an agency that promotes employee advancement.  And then in the future, city of Chico will continue analyzing areas of risk for proactive mitigation  because we do have the risk management side as well.  We want to enhance safety programs and training for staff and use technology to streamline our efficiencies.  Any questions?  Any questions?  What's the new position?  Did he say anything?  It is for office assistant.  We currently have a temporary office assistant who is leaving us for Chicago.  She has purchased a home there with her fiancé and so is headed out in a couple of weeks.  So we would like to turn that into a program.  She is in a permanent position as the work she does is truly invaluable.  Thanks.  That's still my question.  So any others?  Mr. Vanover?  So one of your goals is, can we go back again, cultivate and embrace diversity and inclusion among the citizens of Chico?  What's that have to do with HR and risk management?  It's cultivate and embrace diversity and inclusion in the workforce.  Oh, okay.  All right.  That makes more sense.  Yep.  Risk management.  So risk management.  So risk management.  So the records, I presume the risk management on the records side is with the city clerk.  So you deal with insurance, whether we self-insure or with all that, the financial risk.  Okay.  Got it.  Thank you.  So I would like to thank and commend you for projecting a lowering of the general liability claims.  It's great.  Good luck.  That's our goal.  Okay.  Is to be successful.  Let's be strategic about what we do and get out there and be proactive.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  Come on down.  Mayor, Vice Mayor, Council members, thank you for letting me speak on behalf of the Fire Department and our budget requests this year.  Thank you so much.  other department, we have our strategic  goals. They align  with the city's goals  as a large.  These were developed back in 2016  as part of the strategic planning  process fire department went  through. And until we get our new strategic  plan, these will continue to  roll forward. So attain long  term and sustainable  staffing solution. We're  still working towards that.  Hopefully in the next several years we'll be able to  accomplish our long term goal.  As well as  stabilizing our  staffing needs. Updating  our radio and communication systems.  This is falling under  IS and they're  diligently working towards getting  that P25 which will be a huge  advantage for us and ability  to communicate better than we  are now with our old UHF  system that  are very problematic for us in certain  parts of the city.  Create an effective  planning process.  For facilities and maintenance and we work  closely with  facilities and  public works to facilitate  that and over the last several  years we've made some significant  strides in that manner  which I'll touch on here in a moment.  Develop a fleet program  that's tied to the facilities  process as well.  Evaluate an EMS  priority based response policy.  We made that change back.  In late 2018 and we've  maintained that as well. We've evaluated  different models for EMS service  delivery and  we will continue to do so as  the climate changes regulatory  from a regulatory standpoint.  We continue  to work on and improving  our public education.  For the most part it comes  in the form of fire prevention  and with our crews going out  and doing some public  education programs as well.  And then finally our  development of our training programs  based on best practice.  The implementation of the  training captain last year was a huge  benefit for us as it focused  our ability to have an individual  that maintains all our  very onerous  education and training programs  that we have to  meet as part of the state mandate.  Our mission is  highest, provide the  highest quality of fire  rescue emergency services  to our community and do so  in the most compassionate,  caring and professional manners possible.  We have  currently 73 positions and  that includes six positions  that the council approved last  year for the fire dispatch  center and so we'll be  continuing that project forward and I'll talk  about that in just a moment.  So we provide four core  services, emergency response,  which everybody understands and is a  person who knows about. Emergency  management and pre-planning is probably  one of our weaker areas  and I'd like to shore that up  in the next few years.  Fire code enforcement,  the  realignment of our  code enforcement bureau  and adding a fire marshal  will give us a lot more  capacity and capability than  we've had in years past and make  a much more sustainable program.  So I'm excited as we're  moving forward with that.  We've flown the fire marshal position  this last couple weeks and we hope  to get them onboarded here soon.  And then finally, public education.  So last year's accomplishments,  I want to take this moment  to really praise our folks.  We maintain 17 response personnel  per day and that was  16 firefighters on apparatus  which allowed us to staff  five pieces of apparatus,  four engines and a ladder truck  and we've been able to  maintain that for a long time.  And then our battalion chief,  we did so maintaining 90% of the time.  And that was a pretty big  accomplishment in so much as  our call volume actually went up  10% this year and then had  gone up by 10% or 21%  last year.  So we're starting to see that  the call volume continue to climb  to previous years  prior to the pandemic  and 2019 where we had  another significant drop in our  call volume.  But more importantly,  the amount of leave  in particular work comp  and retirements,  vacancies  has put a real strain on our  workforce  that has caused a lot of overtime  to be generated as a result of that  in order to maintain our 17  a day  firefighters per day on apparatus  and the battalion chief.  And that's a real testament to the  commitment and dedication that our folks  have to get that  staffing level to meet our  minimum requirements to  achieve good and  efficient services  to the city.  We completed RFP  and initiated build out  of three new apparatus.  The tiller truck  and then two engines  are being built currently.  In fact, Chris Zinko,  operations chief,  is out doing an inspection  with fleet manager  of the new tiller which should  keep coming in about a year to a year and a half  depending on how quickly they can get it built.  We initiated  a new standard of cover  that should be completed by the end of this  year and then that will roll into the  new strategic plan as well for the fire department.  And then  a big project of getting a new  records management system  to replace the old one  as it got bought out  and so we had to replace that regardless  of whether we liked it or not  which we didn't. So this one should be  a much better program as it  also interfaces  and is the same records  management system that  Butte Fire uses,  SSV, and  Butte EMS will be using as well.  So there should be some  interoperability there that we can take advantage of.  And then  last fall  we presented on the CWPP  the community wildfire protection  plan and we're excited to have that  in place to start addressing some  projects that will help reduce the risk  to our community  with respect to wildfire interface  fires.  So this year's goals, we want to  continue with the upgrading of our fire  and communication systems  going from our  current UHF to the P25  that's a huge project and  it will take a lot of dedication  on both our department part  and certainly IS's  commitment to it as well.  Reorganizing our prevention  bureau is a continuation of  what we started last year and like I said  by the end of this year we should  fiscal year or into next fiscal year  we'll have that position filled.  Secure funding for  building station 6, we're in the process  of putting out an RFP  to do a design  design  rendering and  costing of a new station that  we'll be able to bring back to council  later this year or next  year into next fiscal year  so we can start to put that money  aside to build station 6 and create  better coverage on the  northeast side and northwest  side of the city.  Again, completing the  standard of cover  and the big one, recruiting  and training our  dedicated fire and EMS dispatchers  and then building out the dispatch  center which accounts for a big  amount of the money we requested  this year which is  the measure H  monies, the one time monies that we're  looking at this round of  funding to come in and this was a  perfect opportunity to use that  to provide relief to the  police dispatchers and then  create a more efficient program  dispatching program for our  fire side of the house.  And then  lastly, we'll put together  a strategic plan  sometime into next  year and then this  is the rendering of our new ladder  truck which we'll give you a  ride on when we get it.  And that's all I have for now.  So if you have questions. Can we drive?  No. You cannot  pull a Kramer on that one. They won't let me.  I have three.  What is, can you explain standard  of cover and are you  fully staffed regarding the  firefighters? And the third one  was something I  forgot already.  No, we're not currently staffed  fully. We have two long term  work comp positions and  two vacancies  and I had made a request this year  for additional engine which  will tie into the standard of cover  so we'll be able to evaluate the need  for an additional fire engine  to help provide some additional support  and capacity that we don't have now.  All right.  Standard of cover is our risk  assessment. Takes a look at the  entire city, how's our environment  changed when the standard of cover was  created in 2016.  See how things have changed  and what are we gapped and then  what's our plan of action to move  forward to address those  issues.  Can you address  about how far we are on the  separation of dispatch and what's  anything that's holding us back? It's been a long  glorious process. A lot of  pieces that had to go into that  not the least of which was labor  issues that we had to, we're navigating  right now and  we should be close to getting that  resolved and then with the funding  for the new dispatch center  which will be, the fire piece of it will be  located at the fire training center  and so that was another big piece  of that is trying to navigate what  was the most optimal way to  make that happen. There were a lot of  technological hurdles we had to  overcome so as we started moving  through that process it took  us a while to start to hone  in on what was optimal location.  So happening  this year do we think? Yes.  We'll start the process  in the fiscal year, yes.  And then the only other one is you said  you have a fire marshal going to code  enforcement. Does that employee's  budget still stay with the fire  department but they work under code enforcement?  No, the fire marshal is  within our chain of command.  Right now we use what's called a fire  prevention officer that is  dedicated, that is assigned that role  but it's not truly a fire marshal  position so this position would create  continuity and would mirror  what would be best practice in the way  we operate that. When he says code  enforcement he's referring to fire code  not nuisance code. Not nuisance code  that's what I was trying to say. Two different  codes. Okay perfect.  Thank you.  Council member Bennett asked one of my questions  which was about the vacancies. You said that  retirement vacancies and leave really increased  overtime and I wonder, it's not  maybe a question for you but could  we get a look at overtime  like per department overtime?  Because you're saying it's increased from years in the past  right? So I want to clarify  there's an offset. When we lose a  body we're no longer paying  for that position.  So when somebody leaves the department  we're filling that position with overtime.  Same with  work cop. When we have workers cop  compensation that money is then  if we fall below  or we go  above our budgeted amount  then the monies would be transferred  over from our work cop  provider or  work cop fund to offset  what was spent.  So there's an offset  and overtime may go up  and our total cost of  salaries and benefits decreases  and it actually is  an inverse relationship  in terms of  at our overtime rate of  just over 1.5  is less than a fully burden rate  of firefighter.  So even with vacancies you still don't  really end up with a lot of surplus funds  at the end of the year? We will this year  because we didn't fill the  six positions for the fire dispatchers  nor did we fill  the portion of the fire marshal's  salary and benefits that come  out of the general fund.  I don't know if anybody else agrees that would be  a reasonable ask to look at overtime.  You're on?  The other questions I had were related to  these Measure H projects and some of them might  be more public works than you but the fire dispatch  center, can you elaborate on the need for that and given  that the fire training center is in  the public works yard so it's in the same  rough location as the current dispatch center  but they want to create separate dispatch centers?  Part of it is  a smaller space that's existing  now for the PD dispatchers.  So we looked at  putting them, placing them in the  current dispatch center but there are  some logistical issues there with  space and then creating  the dispatch center  over in the FDC, the space  is available although we'll have to give up  a class for anyone to do that  and it provides continuity in terms  of the way it's managed and  what we would need from our dispatchers  relative to what  place dispatchers do and need.  The role of a dispatcher is  expanded exponentially  and the police side of the  house has  significantly different needs  and requirements for their dispatchers  than we would need for our fire dispatchers.  So we can get our dispatchers  hired, trained  more rapidly and  they're focused on the fire EMS side of the  house versus trying to do both fire  and EMS. The business  models are just very different.  So that's proved to be too difficult to get  dispatchers to be trained in both  the fire and police.  Yes, and I don't want to speak  on behalf of Chief  Aldridge but  the amount of time  it takes to recruit,  train and then retain those  dispatchers  is significant to  recruit and train and then to  retain them is another thing as well.  They're doing two significantly  different jobs if you will  and that's just an evolution of the position.  Right, oftentimes we do  send out both a patrol  car and a fire engine and we dispatch  the same location. So would sometimes these calls  be handled by both dispatchers?  Not, even now  it doesn't necessarily occur that  way even though we're sending a  police vehicle  to one, to the  same incident as a fire  that were dispatched by a different  dispatcher than is likely  dispatching police.  Yeah, and so this whole  dispatch center would be held in one location  if it weren't for just the space issues of  the dispatch center we currently have in there.  We would still bifurcate that  functionality out in there creating  the ability to manage  it from my standpoint  so we can address our needs  more effectively and same with PD  but ideally down the  road we would want to have them co-located  even though they'd  be still segregated from a functional  standpoint. Right, I mean  obviously the reason I'm asking is because  the budget item is about $1400,000  for this fire dispatch center so looking  at it would be logistically beneficial  to have dispatch in the same place  and eventually all these facilities are  going to need to be replaced and we couldn't  if we make this investment now into  this one location it's not going to be the ultimate  location of the joint dispatch center of the future  right?  Well right now there are no specific  plans for that and I'll let the  city manager speak to it in more  depth but  there's nothing on the  table right now. Yeah I mean you're right  if money were no object and  we had a place to park  them having them all co-located  makes the most sense we just don't  have a physical location  as it is PD  dispatch to say the facility  is too small and  inadequate  doesn't begin to describe the situation  so this plan  of attack was developed last year  to  give some relief to the physical  constraints of the PD facility  and yeah it's a big dollar  number but compared  to building a new facility somewhere else  it's a tiny fraction  of the cost plus we don't have a  somewhere else at this point in time  right  can you explain a little bit like why the  because we have an existing structure  there and I assume there's some  technology that needs to be introduced but what is it  that takes a bulk of the $1400 roughly  $1000 for the fire dispatch center  it's $1.3 million it  has to do with all of the 911  and communications here  so that is to  retrofit the building more than it is to purchase  equipment it's a little of everything  we have to soundproof the building  we have to create security  there are new  consoles that will have to be purchased  and the consoles now  are now going towards the next gen  um  technology as well which would  have been replaced anyways  so there's a  significant amount of technology that goes  into a  telephone system has to be upgraded  as well  right okay thanks for that detail explanation  can I get you for one more  sure  it's the fire station 2  dorm and bathroom remodel  I read about that and it's like  it doesn't explain much in the budget  item here about what  exactly is being done there and what's the  the emphasis  of the need on it one of the things I mentioned  is the ADA requirement to the bathroom  which for firefighters I thought was kind of interesting  and could you explain that  it's a requirement that we're  bound to follow  I can't exactly explain  why it needs to be in a fire station  where we would not necessarily have  the need for it  but it's a requirement that we have to follow  what else in the bathrooms  and dorms is  is in need of remodeling  well station 2 has been in the  number of years of  remodeling and we're in the last phases  of the remodeling  for the battalion chief area  right now that's being  that used to be the administrative  areas but I'm  not sure I can answer your question  as to what the specific needs are  I guess I was trying to get to because we're  prioritizing the use of measure H funds for it whether  it's like a health and safety thing this really needs  to be done this year or whether it's something that is  more like we've been intending  to do it for a long time and it would be  nice  it's been deferred for a long  time I think fire station 2 was  built in 1962  so it is  way past time  a similar one I can't recall if it's in  this budget is  redoing the locker room  at PD which I don't know if you've  taken that tour but that's another  example of something that  is I'll just say fully depreciated  I'm sorry  council member Wenzel  I want to be I was thinking  station 1 and I was a little  but station 2  station 2 was built in  62 or 63 and  the  the restrooms in particular  really in a hard  condition in fact we have a urinal  that's been out of service  a lot of it is it's just  bad infrastructure and that's why we'll be  looking at  evaluating replacing that building  it's in dire need of replacing  so we've got  piping that's old and  dilapidated that's making noises  when you turn on the water  and then you have another bathroom  that's just unfunctional  one thing we did put off is  it's also in need of a roof but  we can we think we can eke out another  year or two because that's another half  a million  it is definitely a station that needs  a lot of repair replacement  so there's been discussion in the past about  replacing the station entirely but this is us  committing to keeping the existing one  at least for a period of time  because once again  we don't have another location identified  so that would be a multi-year process  and facilities  folks advise that this can't wait  that long  thank you  thank you  council member winslow i just wanted to  mention in our monthly monitoring  reports on a quarterly basis  the reports that come to council  there is line item detail  about all of the different salaries  and benefits all the different categories  operationally so you can actually see in there  on a line item basis by department  over time etc if you're interested in looking  you can look  at those too  welcome chief thank you  the floor is yours  mayor vice mayor  members of council city staff thank you  for your time this evening  this is my first  time presenting a budget so  to say i'm a little nervous is a  little understatement and then  the fact that debbie shut daggers  at me when i texted  her about stealing debbie or  from angie from the city manager's office  i'm a little nervous right now  so strategic  goals for the police department i think  the number one most important  strategic goal that we have  is the function of a police department what is  that is to provide a safe place to live work  and recreate and that's what we strive to do  every single day all day long  and we have no shortage  of challenges in doing that  so every day that's what we  we go out there and provide  for this community and hopefully  we are doing well in that  reduce fatal vehicle  accidents through education and enforcement  as you recall we got a grant through  the chp's cannabis  tax  initiative that came through last  year we had that grant went through really  well one of the things  that we got to keep out of that was the  the trailer that we  do DUI enforcement  out of with  the checkpoints  so with that we were able to do  one  every quarter and our goal is to continue  doing that every quarter as staffing  allows  as you recall last year we had  10 fatalities in the city  this year we're at 5  i'm hoping that number stays at 5  but we never know what  the roadways will bring us with these  drivers in the community so  we will work hard to continue to educate  the public and with the introduction  of the  recent automated license plate  readers i think that that will help  us in finding folks who are  a nuisance out there on the  streets if we get that information  from the community commitment  to community engagement and partnerships  that is one of the things that i work  really hard at is getting out  into the community engaging with the community  members talking to people  giving my time up to  folks who ask for it and  that is the big portion of  my calendar every day is meeting with  folks in the community letting them  pull my ear a little bit longer than what they would normally  get from members of the police department  i think that's important i think it gets us  a lot of mileage i think it gets us  that trust and  respect and transparency is built  for the organization so that's highly important  for me and the organization  um  and then likely the maintain  transparency within the organization community  as you know we did our AB 481  presentation to council and then we  did the community engagement meeting shortly  thereafter and  i'm in the in the middle  of creation of the new police chiefs  advisory board you'll see that  come out probably this week for a recruitment  process and it'll look  quite different than what some of you  have seen in the past just  taking some  advice from community members who  want to see some change in that so  i'm going to try and see how it goes  so our mission statement  is right in par with  our right in line with our strategic  goals which is to create a safer chico  and improve quality of life by partnering with our  community and providing dedicated service  and i think that the partnership  we have with multiple entities throughout  the community helps us provide  that service and so i thank everyone in  the community that works with us and helps us  we're part of the general  fund and currently  we are authorized 179  positions or we are  looking to up our positions  to 179  so some of the things that we've done  over the past year  um technology  is a big piece of just about  anything in any organization in  the city right now  but specifically in the  police department we are using  technology to uh  you know expand services where we just  don't have the staffing to put  police officers or support  personnel in place  to help with some of those issues  that we're seeing in the community  our number one piece of technology  that we use on a day near daily  basis is our  unmanned aerial systems  and if you recently saw our press  release on  the shooting we had over on archway  you see we are  showcasing that  technology and showing the community just  what um  that piece of equipment can do for both  the police department and those community  members and making it a safer place  to live work and recreate  um we partnered recently  with the butte county sheriff's department  in a super agency agreement for  our uh rims project  and what that means  is that we are now  sharing the same servers we have redundant  systems where if their system  goes down they can  pull up into our lot log into our  dispatch computers and have access to  their information likewise if something  happens at our center we can go  to butte county center and log in and  have direct access to  our information that's stored on their  servers it also allows us  to share information across  every agency in the county  and that is a  huge huge move and i thank you  all for your support in that  we were the last agency  who was not part of rims  and that was a problematic  scenario for us because it  created more work for those  dispatchers who are already  handling hundreds of calls  per day  automated license plate  readers uh another program that  i want to thank you for uh in  funding i think that we're already  seeing the fruits of that labor  out there we in the first week of  having officers trained we had three  people in custody for stolen vehicles  we used it for our recent uh  homicide on columbus we used it for  a couple other significant cases that  we had around town and  we're nearly complete with all of the  training i think i'm probably one of the  last people that hasn't completed the  training yet but i don't think i'll ever  log into it to investigate a case again  but i will be getting that done so that  we have full compliance with all of the  training required for that  so some of the things we're asking for  in our operating  budget we have expanded our less lethal  uh launchers in the organization and  with that comes the need for an increase  in the budget to  have ammunition for those less lethal  launchers we've looked at many different  pieces of technology to  continue to de-escalate situations and  use those tools to  hopefully get people into compliance  without escalating that use of force and  this is one piece of equipment that  we have been able to use to  successfully both when it comes to  you know replacing shotguns in the  patrol cars we converted those to  beanbag guns  we put the 40 millimeter  sponge  launchers into the cars so every car  either has a  40 millimeter launcher or a beanbag gun  in it now so every patrol car that's out  on the street has a de-escalation tool  sitting  right there at its disposal  but like i said that creates the need  to increase that ammunition account by  fourteen thousand dollars  three ammunition line items the less  lethal  range and duty to track expenses  independently so what we  are saying is that we're going to  separate our ammunition accounts now  so that we know exactly where we're  tracking  in terms of duty ammunition versus less  lethal ammunition so we have a good  idea of how we're spending that and  where  the increases or decreases that we're  doing  on on on on on on on on on on on on on on  the middle of creating a recruitment website and we have our current recruiting staff on hand  getting training on how we can utilize a new piece of technology in terms of in the cell phones it  can have a recruitment line where the folks call it and lets them know if it's a lateral police  officer entry police officer or someone who's looking to go through the academy or ring to a  specific recruiter that we've assigned to that team they'll be able to make contact with them  instantly which starts the the connection with the organization at that moment and so that we  can continue to dialogue along the way but we are going to job fairs and you know with job fairs  you'd like to have the swag so that you can advertise for your agency and and so this is  why that increase of 30,000 has been asked for. Increase in background expenses  you  we continually go over in our background account and unfortunately  I believe last month we had put 13 people through since January and only four of those I had  selected so that means we continue to put people through backgrounds we're just not having a lot  of success in finding folks who can meet the requirements of our our background process so  when you continue to put more through it it's one of those ones where you  just can't kinda you're just guessing at it as to how many you can get through  a background process in a year but when people are failing out of backgrounds you  continue to put more in so that creates the need to increase that budget line on  item. And then like I was saying with the drone technology, it has been the game changer for us.  With that comes the need to create a line item for parts and supplies in those pieces of  equipment. Batteries are one of the main pieces that we purchase and blades. Everything else is  pretty sturdy, but those essential parts, they just get nicks in them or the batteries go bad,  so we have to have a line item to be able to replace that equipment as needed. We just don't  have that line item as it is right now. Throughout the year, we work with IT on different things that  pop up within technology that require subscription-based budgets. And we've tried to  do a really good job of analyzing what it is we foresee in the future that we can  add to that line item. And we've tried to do a really good job of analyzing what it is we foresee in the future that we can add to that line item.  on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on  The way they manage their training and their deployments is through a handwritten log and a binder.  There's technology out there that lets us put that on a cloud, have it at the fingertips for clicking right to information that we need,  any kind of public requests that come down for those documents.  We have that available for the city clerk's office at a moment's notice.  So we're looking to purchase that canine software at $1,700.  I think that's a great deal for that piece of equipment or that technology.  We're looking to get away from servers and put everything on a cloud.  This is one of those products that we will ask for the initial cost to move over to the cloud,  and then IT would take it over in subsequent years.  With inflation and the increase in animals that people are surrendering,  we're seeing the food budget is in dire need of increase.  We want to take care of the animals, and we want to do it in a way that is humane.  And so to us, we need to have the food available to feed those animals.  And so in planning ahead, it looks like we need to increase it by $5,000.  And then lastly, the increase in our maintenance agreements.  I know that looks like an odd number, and the reason it looks odd is because,  currently, it has a budget of $5,330.  And so what we find is that throughout the year, like I said,  things change and we need to have another subscription for a piece of software or something else.  So we just figured at a $20,000 line item, that would help us cover the cost of anything that pops up.  So that $14,670 is the addition to bring it to that $20,000 number.  Thank you.  Staffing, we've got a few positions here that we're asking for.  We've been in need of a fifth dispatch or communications supervisor for years.  We have a team that goes unsupervised direct supervision at night on the weekends.  And so we want to be able to cover that.  We all know that direct supervision creates an environment of accountability  and catches issues that potentially have liability attached to them.  So we want to be able to cover that.  We want to be able to attach a new supervisor position to our comm center  and have that 24-7 coverage for supervision.  And this will do it for us.  Crime analyst.  The new tool in law enforcement is cell phone forensics.  And every time we have a case, the DA's office, the first question they ask us is,  do you have a cell phone and have you downloaded it?  That can be quite onerous on us.  And we think that that's a position that will have a full-time workload  with all the cases we have coming through the police department.  We have the programs already that we use for those forensics.  But we're using detectives who, in between cases,  have to sit down for four or five hours and process one of these cell phones.  And add in some of these cases have six, seven, eight cell phones attached to them.  It can take a lot of time to get through.  Uh,  the download,  of those cell phones through search warrants.  And we want to add a crime analyst to take over that position.  The reason we're calling it a crime analyst versus just an evidence tech is this is a position that is going to be highly trained,  highly sought after by many different agencies.  And we feel like, uh,  just calling it a crime analyst and paying it accordingly would attach them to the PD and retain them instead of losing them to other agencies.  If we are paying them as just a evidence tech.  So,  we're going to be asking for a community service officer to say,  so crime analysts are specifically trained for different types of forensics.  And this is one that we will have no shortage of work for.  Community service officers were asking for five.  Um,  and if you look at the bottom there,  there's two sergeants that are being requested,  one of which is a CSO supervisor.  Our goal is to create a unit of community service officers that will augment patrols,  patrol and be able to handle those more cold calls.  We call them,  I know that calls burglaries,  stolen vehicles,  things of that nature.  Uh,  we can train them for accident investigation and,  uh,  potentially to assist with the drone program.  But this helps augment the already short staff patrol.  And it is a program that we felt like we can stand up,  um,  pretty quick and get,  get people trained into that,  uh,  into that position.  And help provide service to the community that we're not able to provide now,  or at least in a timely manner.  And then we have,  uh,  we,  we did have a lieutenant position that oversaw our dispatch center,  uh,  records and evidence.  But when that lieutenant promoted to captain,  it left that position,  uh,  vacant.  And that captain has continued to,  uh,  to manage those three areas,  plus his entire support division.  That,  that he is currently managing.  So it's,  it's one of those tasks saturation things.  That's just overwhelming.  We did have that position once before,  but we moved it over to our patrol division because we needed four lieutenants on our patrol side.  As you know,  we're very busy on patrol.  And so for me,  it was more important at the time to have that management oversight for our patrol division,  for all the critical incidents and decision making that needed to happen to ensure that we were able to get the job done.  So it's all about ensuring that we're handling things in a very decisive manner,  things that were being handled in a manner that,  uh,  kept liability mitigation in mind,  um,  and accountability on the supervisors of those patrol teams.  So for me,  it was more important to move that lieutenant position to patrol.  Give us that 24 seven coverage that we desperately needed.  Um,  but it came with costs and that cost is I have a captain who is being overworked right now in those areas and we need to move it over to our patrol team.  to split that workload for his ability to manage his support division correctly.  And then that other sergeant position at the bottom,  my goal is to continue to ensure that we have that span of control adequately handled.  And so on patrol on the weekends, my goal is to create a fourth patrol team once staffing comes up.  We did it on the weekday side.  We did have three patrol teams.  But what we saw is there was a span of control issue with one sergeant watching eight to ten people at one time.  We know that when you have a patrol division that is being staffed adequately  and you have one sergeant managing eight to ten people, it just isn't effective.  So we split that and we created a fourth team during the weekdays, Monday through Thursday.  And it has worked out.  Great for us.  We have a great overlap there.  We have great coverage and provide great service to the community by doing that.  My goal is to do that on the weekend teams also.  Once staffing comes up, we'll split and make it four patrol teams.  But we need an additional sergeant to do that effectively.  Probably the most important piece here, the dispatchers.  You know, these chairs and dispatcher use 24-7.  And if you don't have that, you're not going to be able to do that.  If you don't have the right chair, if you work in an office, you know that if you don't have the right chair,  you can walk away every day feeling like you've been sitting on a concrete block.  And in dispatch, we want to make sure that they have the right equipment to be able to do their job comfortably,  prevent work comp claims from lower back injuries.  And we've been buying these chairs here for quite a while now, and they have assisted us in that.  They're pricey.  So we wanted to create a capital project.  We want to create a capital project for that where we save $3,000 a year for five years and replace them every five years.  That's about the lifespan we get out of them.  Our drones, like I was saying, we've now had them operational for a little over a year.  Each of these drones only have about a five-year lifespan on them.  And at the rate that we're using them, they're probably going to be a little bit less than that, to be honest with you.  But in planning for that.  We would like to save back every year $15,450 to replace them at that five-year lifecycle.  That'll help us replace the entire fleet after five years of being in service.  Money well spent, as you can see from recent operations.  The automated license plate reader program.  We just want to make sure that we have the funds to have the existing cameras.  We want to make sure that we have the fees for the subscriptions accounted for.  And as we build out this program, of course, we'll be coming back at some point looking to expand it.  But right now, we want to make sure that we have the fees for the subscriptions accounted for.  And so we want to create a capital project for that.  And that amount was...  I believe it was roughly $106,000 a year.  For that maintenance agreement.  In my AB 481 presentation to you, I talked about the need to expand out a couple of pieces of equipment.  Two of those pieces of equipment are the robots.  These robots, as I explained to you before, are something that creates a safer environment for both the officers  and the maintenance team.  The person that may be behind doors or in a residence or building.  We have looked at these thoroughly.  We feel like these are items that will assist us in liability mitigation, officer safety, and community safety.  So these are really new, advanced pieces of equipment that are out there.  Several agencies are using them.  And we would like to create a capital project to purchase these two.  They each have their own mission.  The one you see on the top there is the one that has a camera.  It can climb stairs and it can deploy a chemical agent remotely.  The one on the bottom is a door breaching robot.  Essentially what it does is uses hydraulics to spread the door jam and then just pushes the door open  versus an explosive entry that we would typically do into a facility.  This picture is a picture of a robot that is being used to destroy a building.  This picture I guess is supposed to be funny.  With the robot, or I'm sorry, the dinosaur we located that was stolen from the Sinclair.  But this is exactly kind of what we're talking about in terms of expanding that community service officer program  and providing that service to the community.  You never know what they're going to be assigned to.  We feel like assigning them with a truck would help.  It would help with anything from picking up found property to returning stolen property as in this case.  We worked with Director Gustafson and gotten the quote to be approximately $61,800 for one of these trucks.  That's fully outfitted with all the computer systems, lights, stickers, and things of that nature.  But this will be one additional truck that we have to have for that project to work effectively.  And with that, that's all I have.  And I'm answering the questions you have now.  Okay.  Let's start on the left.  I've got one.  Chief, so you've got an automated license plate reading system.  Is it integrated with the one that's used for parking?  No, those are two separate systems.  Why are they separate?  I would think that having the parking system scan thousands of license plates every day would help with stolen vehicles.  Yeah.  So I'm going to have to direct part of this to Eric.  So I believe they're the same camera systems.  They do talk.  But the way information is loaded into those systems is different.  So specifically, the vehicle that's used for parking enforcement, when they drive around and collect data on them, they're not going to be able to see the vehicle.  So it's not just the system that knows.  It's about timelines of where they're at.  And the system knows how long they've been there, which vehicle is over the time limit, so to say, or has not been paid for through the new digital system.  So it somehow works with that system and can issue parking citations through our new system.  I'm not sure if I'm speaking off.  I know I understand that.  But I would think if you've got a common database, it would be helpful to you.  Yeah.  It definitely speaks to the system in terms of loading information.  But it will not tell that operator, hey, you just got a hit on a stolen vehicle.  Because we don't want a non-sworn person dealing with hits on stolen vehicles.  We want that to only be on sworn.  Legally, they fall into two entirely different categories of operation.  I'm just thinking if you, I get that.  But I'm just thinking if you had a single vendor and a single maintenance contract, I might.  So, I mean, just if you guys would talk about it over lunch someday and see if that's something.  Yeah.  Worth investigating.  I know there's a difference between the mobile ones and the fixed ones in terms of how they communicate.  I have not dug into that system in its entirety.  But I know they do communicate some, just not all the way.  If that answers your question.  All right.  Mr. Winslow.  I wanted to ask if you could elaborate somewhat on the community service.  The community service officers.  It seems like there's sort of a change in the job position overall.  And like where that came from.  Where it's going.  And all sorts of what you see them covering.  Really, it's grown out of the need to provide service to the community.  With our staffing levels in the sworn ranks dropping so low and the inability to recruit and retain people, you have to get creative.  And so what we look at is what can we have another classification do for the community that doesn't necessarily need a sworn officer.  And so for, I mean, I've been at this agency for 18 years.  I was at a previous agency locally four years.  And they've had CSOs the entire time.  We've got one CSO that's coming up on 26 years with the PD.  So it's a service that we've always, that we've had for at least 30 years at this agency.  Where they can provide, you know, reports.  They can go out and respond to accidents.  Things of that nature that a cop doesn't necessarily have to go to.  And what that allows the community to get is a quicker response time.  Allows them to get that report that they need.  It allows them to get that accident investigation done.  Whereas right now, they may be delayed for a day on getting to a, you know, a cold call.  So our idea is that by staffing that.  And then figuring this out.  We'll have them on throughout 20 hours of the day.  Just about where they can provide that service to the community.  And our officers can focus on the more serious incidents per activity to prevent those types of serious incidents from occurring.  That's great.  I think it's a wonderful idea.  I kind of think it's funny.  If I were to propose something like that, the conversation might be different.  But that's, yeah.  It's good that we're able to shift some burden on things that aren't needed for police officers.  And I can see eventually we get to the point where we see a reduced need for staffing of police department overall.  Or of police.  Because we're able to shift to community service officers.  And we see success with that.  On funding.  There is a list of new staff positions.  Including the five CSO officers.  And are those all to be funded through the Measure H operational expenses?  I'll defer that to the city manager.  Or Barbara.  Yes.  All of the police positions are in the, excuse me, operational expenditures of Measure H.  How much of the operational expenditures allocated to police in there does it account for?  Most of it?  Or all of it?  Or less?  Most of it.  Yeah.  Okay.  I think there's one more.  That is, this seems like kind of a random thing.  When I was in this, like, the Citizens Police Academy.  We had the animal shelter presentation.  I noticed that they had a Yahoo email address.  And I felt like it was my responsibility to humbly recommend that we consider getting them a City of Chico email address.  I don't know what that cost.  But perhaps you can look into it.  The animal shelter had a Yahoo?  It had a Yahoo email address.  I have no clue what that is.  But I recently learned they have their own website, too.  So I'll take a look at that.  Thank you.  Yeah.  All right.  Further questions for the committee?  Vice-President.  One quick one.  The donation that we've been receiving the last week.  It's been two years under salaries and employee benefits.  Have we reached back out to that donor?  And do we know if they're willing to continue?  I know who that donor is.  I don't know if that conversation has occurred.  I don't know who it is.  I don't believe that conversation has occurred.  It was a multi-year, one-time donation a few years back.  Gotcha.  Okay.  And then the other one I just wanted to kind of repeat in case somebody missed.  The fact that our original drones were actually paid for by a community organization.  We did not purchase those.  And that's why we're budgeting to repurchase them.  But I would also say that maybe we should continue to reach out to that agency and see  if they'd continue our ongoing support of that project because they are very good community  partners.  And they might continue to help in that project as well.  All right.  Thank you, Chief.  We're going to take a short break.  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right, we had to take a break just to prepare for the amazing Community Development Department presentation.  Nice lead in.  There you go.  Can you get me up on the screen?  So, good afternoon, Mayor, Vice Mayor, Council.  Again, Brendan V., Community Development Director, with the honor of overseeing the city's planning, building, housing code enforcement, and GIS divisions.  So, quickly, while CDD's responsibilities, I believe, touch on all of Council's goals, the three primary goals are the ones in front of you.  Housing, economic development, desirable place to live.  The Community Development Department has identified its own goals to achieve those goals,  which include expeditiously process development applications in accordance with state and federal and local regulations,  ensure the city's general plan and land use regulations are consistent with quickly evolving state housing and land use legislation,  plan and administer affordable housing programs and funding,  provide up-to-date GIS data and information to all city departments as well as the community at large,  ensure that residential and non-residential constructions consist of a California building,  fire, plumbing, mechanical codes, and then maintain and improve the quality of the community through enforcement of local and state codes and regulations.  We achieve these goals by ensuring that the general plan, municipal code, and climate action plan are up-to-date and consistent with state law.  New development meets or exceeds the goals of the community as set forth in the planning documents I just mentioned,  and that we bring those before the city's boards and commissions.  The new construction conforms to the requirements of the Community Development Department's plan and regulations.  of the state building code and the city is maximizing funding opportunities to  develop and retain affordable housing. So I'm going to go division by division  because there's a lot of unique differences between the divisions and  the roles they play for community development. Starting off with planning  division, it's primarily funded by private development enterprise fund with  some support from the general fund and revenue special revenue funds. We have  seven positions and a budget of approximately two million five hundred  and sixty four thousand. So again what do you get for that general fund  investment? We utilize it to be directly available to the community every day but  we also are working on council priorities, state mandates and the need  for coordination and planning with local state and federal partners regarding  housing and economic development. At its core planning seeks to implement the  general plan and apply city development standards to proposed projects that  ultimately help the city meet its housing and jobs goals.  And  in addition to serving the city council, planning is busy staffing the planning  commission, architecture review historic preservation board, map advisory  committee, the zoning administrator as well as the climate action commission.  And as you can imagine because you guys have a lot of management with your  agenda, there's a lot of management also for agenda, applicant commission  communication, public noticing, community engagement and ultimately providing an  open and transparent decision-making process. Development activity continues  at an extremely high level and we are committed to implementing the plan in the future. So I'm going to go division by division. So I'm going to go  on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on  of commercial and office uses.  The environmental review for this project is well underway,  and I would expect it to be before Council in early 2024.  Also, there's long-range planning programs,  and they're at an all-time high  as the Division continues to promote free accessory dwelling unit building plans,  implement the Council-approved Climate Action Plan,  we coordinate the Island Annexation Plan  to consolidate the City's boundaries  and provide efficient delivery of services,  and also we're utilizing money from the State  to pursue a series of code and general plan amendments  to streamline housing production.  On the housing, it's solely funded by non-general fund sources,  including federal housing and urban development funds,  as well as the Affordable Housing Fund and fees collected.  Housing has three positions  and is looking at a budget request for approximately $600,000.  Affordable housing is the primary focus of the Housing Division.  They receive funds from HUD,  and they coordinate with affordable housing developers  to implement the goals identified in the housing element,  as well as within the approved HUD Consolidated Plan.  So, excitingly, many new resources have been made available  through the State and federal government  to the City to address the growing housing shortage,  the impacts of the Camp Fire, as well as COVID.  There have been two rounds of State disaster tax credits  made available for affordable multifamily housing.  The City facilitated funding  and also provided land for the recently completed  101-unit Creekside Place Senior Project  across from Marsh Junior High,  and also provided funding for the 160-unit North Creek  crossings at Merriam Park  and the 1297-59 unit project on Park Avenue,  both of which are also due to be complete  by the end of this year.  Other projects using disaster credits  have also received significant City support  from all departments.  In addition, due to the Camp Fire,  over $32 million were made available  in the CDBG disaster recovery funds  for the City's use,  also for multifamily affordable projects.  An important note is to make that Chico  was the first city to have a disaster recovery fund.  The first jurisdiction in all California  to complete all the due diligence required  under the State program,  and that they allocated funding to three projects  for an additional 183 affordable units.  Again, it's hoped that at least two of those projects  will be in construction in early 2024.  A portion of the $61 million available  through that program to Butte County  also will be utilized within the City limits  due to the availability of existing infrastructure  and services.  Projects totaling $2.5 million  will be used to build a new housing system  and the rest of the city will be built  in Chico.  So, if all the projects  that I've just referenced  get built over the next several years,  that will be over 1,400 new affordable units  available in the City of Chico.  This shows me that affordable housing  can get built in Chico  if funding is made available  by the State and Federal Government.  As an update,  staff anticipates bringing  the State-mandated housing element  for adoption very soon.  I think I've been very candid in the past.  It's been a very drawn-out process  with the City of Chico.  We've been working with the State  to produce a compliant housing element.  And finally, staff anticipates  the City will receive its permanent  local housing allocation funding  from the State later this summer,  and that will provide additional funding  to support additional emergency shelter.  So, the GIS division is funded  by a number of enterprise funds  with some general plan support.  There's two positions,  total budget of approximately $350,000.  GIS supports every City department,  whether it's staff answering questions  from the public, field crews maintaining  City facilities,  or updating 9-11 dispatch information  to support police and fire.  GIS accomplishments for last year  and goals for this year  continue to be the same,  and that's to work with internal  and external customers  to improve the input of accurate data  and to enhance its usability.  GIS is requesting a new central portal  to house the City's GIS  as we can no longer operate  under Chico State's  Education License Agreement.  The purchase and implementation cost  is approximately $100,000,  and the total budget is $250,000.  The overall benefits are significant,  include lower renewal costs,  increased user accounts,  enhanced data development and use for field staff,  and hosting in the cloud to ensure continual updates  and uninterrupted service.  On the building,  building's entirely funded  by the Private Development Fund.  It has 15 positions,  and the total budget request is $2,457,000.  Ultimately, the building division is responsible  for ensuring the safety of the community  by ensuring that  the construction is compliant  with local ordinances  and the myriad California building codes.  One of my greatest challenges as a director  has been filling vacant building positions  with qualified and experienced staff.  We're competing head to head  against other jurisdictions and consultants  that often pay more than we do.  However, after lengthy recruitments,  we've successfully filled the building official,  senior plans examiner,  and key building inspector  and plans examiner positions  with incredibly talented and competent individuals.  As Mark alluded to earlier.  The upcoming year looks very bright  for both the building division  as well as the development community.  Building continues to see steady growth  on both residential and commercial development.  In 2022,  on the calendar year,  there were 202 single family,  437 multifamily,  and 44 accessory dwelling units completed,  totaling 683 total new units.  As of the end of this month,  or last month,  I'm sorry, April,  there were an additional 807 multifamily units being constructed, 136 single-family or duplexes, and 40 ADUs under construction.  Again, the message is simply that there's a lot going on and the City of Chico is open for business.  This past March, Chico's building division was recognized for its hard work and dedication  and was named California's Building Department of the Year by the California Association of Building Officials.  The division also received a special recognition from Congressman LaMalfa.  These accolades are noteworthy and they reflect the hard work of highly competent and dedicated staff and outside consultants.  The Code Enforcement Division is primarily funded by the General Fund and has five total positions.  Budget request is $735,000.  Code enforcement, as you're all aware, plays an important role in maintaining and improving the community's well-being  by responding to resident concerns and addressing complaints before they fester into larger problems.  I'd like to quickly share some impressive, what I believe are impressive, code stats.  In 2022, there were approximately 1,600 code cases opened.  98% of those were closed based on voluntary compliance.  That incredible volume was accomplished with three code enforcement officers and one supervisor.  And doesn't acknowledge...  The incredible annual community benefit programs they also oversee, including weed abatement and drop and dash.  Also last year, code enforcement abated over 400 abandoned vehicles and trailers.  So, as I mentioned earlier, over the past year, community development has very successfully and successfully filled a number of long-standing building department positions.  And for this year, we're only asking for one request for the upcoming fiscal year.  We're looking for a part-time hourly building plans examiner to come in and help us.  But continue to help us with the ongoing heavy demand.  That's the end of my presentation.  All right. Questions?  In this hourly building plans examiner, this is all enterprise funded 100%?  Correct.  Total cost recovery?  Yes.  So, community development does a whole lot with a very small sliver of the general funds.  If there were to be a general fund, would you be able to do that?  If there were general fund dollars available for supporting community development, where would you allocate that towards?  So, the areas that we have grown our general fund use has been primarily planning.  A lot of what we do doesn't fall in just supporting the development community.  There's constant things coming from the state, initiatives from council, requests for engagement from our regional planning agency or other local groups.  So, that's where we've kind of also created a capital plan.  We have a project called the general plan implementation.  We use that to pursue a lot of the long-range planning or climate action goals and policies.  So, that's primarily where we have historically used and grown our general fund.  Okay.  You know, some of the, in all the conversations about the use of measure H funds, some of the promotional material emphasized leveraging grants.  And I wonder if you see any, like, opportunities in community development or if you have more staff in certain areas, you'd be able to pursue and manage more grants than we're currently taking on.  I mean, that's a reasonable expectation.  It seems like there's emergencies popping up.  So, even when we get new staff and we think they're safe and dedicated, they get sucked into the next emergency.  But, yeah, certainly we would be able to.  Great.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I would hope we'd be able to, with some of these funds, be able to alleviate some of the impacts on some of these departments given that we have so much activity going on.  Thanks.  Okay.  All right.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Thank you.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  obviously a lot of the budget stuff was actively being worked on with myself coming back on board.  So I have a short presentation, but available to answer any questions as it goes on.  So in the engineering department, we really see ourselves as the overseers planning, design,  constructing, and maintaining the built environment of our community.  So we take a lot of pride in our ability to understand the needs,  whether it's for development, providing infrastructure to serve the development  that you just heard in the community development department, safety issues.  You heard from the police department of education enforcement.  The third E in public safety or traffic safety is engineering.  So we typically have projects that address safety issues,  as well as continuing to build out vehicular bike and ped infrastructure  that, again, our community uses on a daily basis.  We consist of essentially four divisions, development engineering,  traffic engineering, sewer storm water engineering,  and then our capital projects division.  Plus we have administrative support, and then we also have a GIS function,  since we're such heavy users and implementers of a lot of the data.  Our funding sources vary greatly.  So a lot of what we do is from state transportation funds, development impact fees,  a lot of the grants that we obtain,  implement and build infrastructure with.  So a very diverse set of funding sources.  So the funding here identified does not include the capital.  So next year alone, we're looking at upwards of potentially $60 million in construction  on top of the operating and personnel costs.  We have 35 positions.  And as mentioned earlier by the city manager, we have 13 vacancies currently.  So over a third of our department right now is vacancies.  So we're looking at about $1.5 million of those vacancies.  So that kind of leads into one of our top challenges in this upcoming year  is filling those vacancies first and foremost.  We are not requesting any new positions.  We need to focus on filling the ones we currently have vacant  and addressing that issue.  Some of these positions have been vacant for several years.  And so we're looking forward to hopefully being able to fill those  and be able to deliver the projects set forth in front of us.  The capital improvement program,  while a lot of the community only sees,  maybe a few projects going out to construction each year,  we have about 102 active capital improvement program projects,  various phases from concept to design through construction.  So there's a lot of different projects being worked on  and a lot of different phases.  Our goals for this upcoming year, obviously with Measure H,  we're looking at a lot of planning efforts to identify where the needs are most  so that we can deliver projects cost effectively.  We're looking at some projects that are going to be built,  some different options that we can take advantage of  to increase our efficiency of delivering projects year after year  on the road maintenance aspects.  Delivery of high quality capital projects to address those current deficiencies  as well as the infrastructure serving development, as I mentioned.  And then one focus that has been kind of over the last couple of years  and hopefully bringing forward this year is a lot of our master plans.  So a lot of what we need to do with our infrastructure  is plan ahead and build out conditions.  So as infrastructure is going to be built,  as interim situations come up,  we're building towards that ultimate build out condition.  It's not piecemeal in nature.  So that includes our storm drain master plan,  our sewer master plan,  updating of our active transportation plan,  updating of our local road safety plan,  and then the pavement management program as well.  So a lot of activity on the plan development that we utilize on a daily basis  is critical for the safe and functional use of infrastructure as we build out.  I wanted to highlight two,  two projects real quick.  Unfortunately,  the Bruce Road widening project,  we opened bids on May 4th.  This presentation was submitted May 5th.  And on May 8th,  we had a setback in the award of the construction contract for Bruce Road.  So our engineer's estimate on the project was 25.5 million.  We received three bids.  The low bid contractor,  apparent low bid was a Tiger construction at 26.2.  The two other bids,  we received were 30.5 and $31.5 million.  We received a letter from Tiger construction,  acknowledging an error in their bid and basically requested removal of their bid.  And therefore we don't have the funding to deliver the project.  So we're going to reevaluate it,  do some cleanup and we'll try and identify some additional funding with the  hope of rebidding that project later this fall with construction starting next  year.  One of the reasons,  I think for the high prices as well as the time of year that we bid,  typically you want to bid projects in the late fall,  early winter time when contractors are working on developing their backlog.  So they're a lot more aggressive and hungry to sharpen their pencil.  Whereas been in it in May,  a lot of those big time contractors for this type of project already have a fully established backlog of work.  So they're not as aggressive in their bidding procedures and costs.  So,  for those that don't know,  Bruce road,  why any project consists of widening Bruce road from two lanes to four lanes from highway 32,  all the way down to Skyway,  which includes the existing bridge over little Chico Creek with landscape,  medians,  lighting a 12 foot wide separated bike path on the west side of the corridor.  And that will have dedicated bike path lighting as well.  That will connect a lot of the existing and future development along that corridor in a efficient manner.  Okay.  The other project is the Esplanade quarter safety and accessibility improvements.  So this was a feasibility study that we brought forward to council.  I believe in 2016 subsequently we submitted a active transportation program grant,  which was awarded an amount of about $6.9 million.  And so we've finalized the design and we'll be putting that project out to bid later this fall with hope of starting construction next spring.  And so the project involves,  um,  constructing a separated bike path in the Eastern side of the Esplanade corridor,  uh,  as well as a roundabout at the Memorial way,  uh,  only under intersection,  um,  to an acute angle,  the intersection with poor site distance,  um,  that's currently stopped controlled.  So that roundabout will improve a lot of the,  uh,  pickup and drop off traffic circulation associated with Chico junior high school.  Uh,  so that concludes my portion again,  short and sweet.  But,  uh,  certainly available for any questions you might have.  All right.  Question.  I'm sensing a theme here.  Mr.  Watson.  Um,  I should have said a really similar cause I just kind of asked the same question to Mr.  Mr.  Vig about the,  um,  the need for,  um,  staff time to fill out grants in order to get more resources and like stretch our funds further.  And there's an item in here for grant writing and research.  Um,  and you asked $50,000 and wondered if that is,  um,  if,  if you could use more and better utilize that,  um,  grant funding bill.  Yeah,  that's something that we established a few years ago.  Um,  as opportunities arise,  having that availability of funding.  And a lot of times what we have to do is hire consultants to write a lot of our grants.  Um,  we've had a lot of success,  I think close to a hundred million dollars in the last six,  seven years,  uh,  that we've obtained in,  in infrastructure grants.  Uh,  in addition,  the federal interest,  the federal infrastructure package,  a lot of that funding is coming in the way of grants.  And so,  um,  we haven't requested this go around again,  but,  um,  the hope is in,  in future,  we look at opportunities to maybe add like a,  a dedicated grant writer,  grant coordinator type of person.  Um,  because right now it's kind of a portion of one staff member's duties.  And,  um,  yeah,  it really could be a dedicated position with scouring the different opportunities.  There's a lot of reporting that is associated with grants as well.  So that person would be able to do that.  Um,  but we're just not quite there yet.  And so we'll utilize that $50,000 capital project as needs arise to hire  consultants to write those.  Um,  I think that,  uh,  well,  some of it might happen under operations and maintenance.  Um,  the span of road projects that we're looking at is,  is really incredible.  Um,  I think it'd be worth taking the time to like look at some of these places  that we're doing one piece by piece,  because I'm sure members of the public will be,  um,  very thrilled to see the sort of projects that we have proposed in the next,  um,  year or two.  Um,  and moving forward and some of the larger projects,  the,  um,  yearly road rehabilitations,  um,  there's really rough project descriptions for it.  Um,  and while it's,  it's often,  you know,  maintenance rehabilitation,  there's good things.  Sometimes it mentions closing sidewalk,  um,  gaps like we have,  uh,  I think budget for this year is closing sidewalk gaps along PV,  FC,  and NOFIS and along Bidwell,  um,  junior high school too.  Uh,  it,  there isn't a reference to bicycle infrastructure in a lot of these.  And I understand that we have policies that would require us to put in some bicycle infrastructure.  I wonder if you can comment on,  um,  where that will fall in and at what point is the right time for council direction on the,  um,  the description of these projects.  Yeah,  yeah,  this is a great question.  Uh,  as a policy,  and I believe it's the general plan,  uh,  anytime we're rehabbing roads,  we're looking to integrate the new standards,  uh,  which includes bike lanes.  And so through the past five years,  we've done several road rehab projects that have all integrated,  uh,  the installation of new class two bike lanes.  So for example,  Cohasset road,  I believe was 2017,  2018,  uh,  Esplanade was in 2020,  Park Avenue,  Mulberry,  all,  all four of those,  I guess,  um,  integrated new class two bike lanes where they didn't previously exist.  Um,  so we're always looking at those opportunities,  not just for biking infrastructure,  but utilities.  Uh,  so when we do a road rehab project,  we look at,  if properties aren't served with sewer,  we are stubbing out laterals to outside of the roadway prism so that when someone's septic system does fail,  they're not having to trench through our road that we just invested money and time into.  And so,  um,  a lot of those types of opportunities,  yeah,  we're looking at full road,  um,  needs and demands,  and we try and do as much as we can at that time.  Okay.  Um,  yeah,  I'd like to request that as,  as the design comes up,  some of these like larger projects,  if,  um,  if we could have,  um,  some awareness of it,  in order to evaluate ourselves.  yeah,  that'd be great.  Absolutely.  And I'll,  I'll add,  we follow our,  our adopted bike plan.  So as I,  as corridors are identified for those types of improvements or types of,  uh,  classifications of bike facilities,  we integrate that as part of our projects.  Is our active transportation plan supplanting the bicycle plan to some degree?  Yes,  to some degree it'll update it and then also add in the pedestrian element,  which a lot of the grant programs,  uh,  are requiring now.  Okay.  Great.  yeah.  And one,  one more question,  I think I have a lot of sticky notes that probably have more of it.  That's okay.  Um,  there is a budget item for downtown access plan and,  uh,  we've had direction from this council about redesigning the downtown streets.  And I wondered if you could elaborate on where we're at with,  um,  with that project and how it relates to the,  um,  the project item,  which is no,  not downtown street barriers.  There is a downtown access plan.  I think is what it's called,  where it is renamed.  You know what I'm talking about,  right?  Yeah.  The downtown,  uh,  act,  uh,  downtown circulation right of way is what the downtown,  uh,  the name was changed on it.  Sorry.  Um,  so yeah,  that's been a long standing discussion.  Um,  I know going back to,  I think,  I believe the 2006 timeframe,  a charrette was done for the downtown to identify opportunities to make improvements in downtown,  including reducing main and Broadway from three lanes down to two lanes,  enhancing the bike and pedestrian,  um,  facilities.  So that it's more,  more of a walkable engaging downtown,  uh,  in 20 18,  I believe it was,  we,  we brought forward the,  um,  downtown access action plan.  Um,  and again,  kind of further develop some of those concepts.  And so right now with that project,  the intent is to look at it more holistically of how that circulation is going to,  uh,  function and what type of improvements we can do within the constraints of the existing right away.  So roughly an 80 foot right away.  Um,  in terms of widening sidewalks,  bike facilities,  parking,  and then the travel lanes,  how we can kind of fit all that in,  in a cohesive functional way.  And so,  um,  the hope is that by the end of this year,  we have some concepts coming forward.  And,  uh,  with that direction,  hopefully by council approving one of the recommendations,  then we can initiate and begin a lot of the design work.  And that's a several year long process,  uh,  a downtown that's historic and old,  as ours,  uh,  buildings are always built at different elevations.  And so making it ADA compliant takes a lot of detailed engineering work.  And then I think we all know in our downtown,  the PG and E facilities and utility relocations,  we have to replace sewer lines.  Um,  there'd be a lot of prep work with that type of stuff.  So it would be a long plan,  but again,  I think it's important to have that plan so that we can build out efficiently and towards an ultimate vision for what it's going to look like and function.  Right.  So,  um,  so while this,  this project appear appears to have,  um,  had funding taken away for this year,  we're in a different stage of a related but different project.  Um,  and the actual design and engineering will take place next year.  You're saying,  yeah,  yeah.  Depending on if we can get brought forward the conceptuals and get council direction on what the preferred alternative is.  Um,  so yeah,  there's existing funding in that project and it's,  um,  adequate to meet the current phase that we're in of,  essentially preliminary design,  conceptual design.  Okay.  Love what your department's doing.  Thanks.  Thank you.  All right.  Thank you very much.  Mr.  Goff's,  um,  last but not least,  operations.  I'm starting to get a complex.  Yeah.  I don't know if that's good or bad.  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you for the opportunity to speak tonight.  Um,  I will go quick as it feels like we're moving through this pretty quickly.  But I know we're,  we're approaching the five o'clock hour.  So these are our strategic goals and the operations and maintenance side of public works as it have been the same for a couple of years.  So I won't go through each of those.  Of course,  our mission is,  is remain the same to maintain safe,  reliable,  modern infrastructure and services for the greater Chico community.  We have multiple funding sources,  general fund,  capital project funds,  enterprise funds with both the,  um,  airport sewer and some parking funds,  special revenue funds,  which are Chico maintenance districts,  CMDs,  um,  and then also internal service funds for,  for our fleet facilities divisions.  We operate and,  and I have,  and are staffed with 10 divisions.  Um,  so it really shows how diverse public works operations and maintenance are,  or is.  Um,  but I also want to highlight three additional divisions that we commonly charge time to.  We don't have any permanent staffing in those divisions,  but we work quite actively in those divisions.  That's,  uh,  the first one was division one,  10 environmental services and manages our waste haulers.  Um,  franchise contract,  um,  and there's going to be a lot of uptick in workload in that division with the coming Senate bill 1383,  you know,  food diversion and,  um,  organic waste diversion requirements that are mandated from the state.  Our public works administration division is just kind of a catchall for some administrative duties.  And then the,  um,  Chico maintenance districts is a division on its own 941 that requires quite a bit of management too.  Next,  I thought I'd just kind of quickly,  touch on a few project highlights that we've accomplished in this fiscal year.  Um,  2223 were we finalized and finished the upper park road,  a repair project and are excited to open that in the,  in the coming next few weeks,  all the way to the top,  uh,  as a very long project.  Um,  a lot of environmental constraints.  We repaired over 43 erosion sites with new culverts and,  and different,  uh,  storm drain infrastructure amenities that,  uh,  we're excited to open up to the public here shortly.  Okay.  Um,  I wanted to touch on our,  uh,  sustainable solution turnkey program,  um,  projects.  We've finished up,  uh,  phase two with some significant solar replacements at our wastewater treatment plant and our corporation yard.  Um,  we've,  you know,  we realized savings about 230,000 from phase one,  several years ago,  phase two will yield us about 603,  604,000 in electrical usage savings,  um,  which is about 70% of,  of our usage.  And,  on top of that,  on top of that,  on top of that,  on top of that,  on top of that, We're in the design phases right now for phase three, which will include some additional solar and a new cogen and some heating elements stuff at the wastewater treatment plant that will help us get close to net neutrality. So that's a common theme that we're working on a common project. I just thought I'd touch on it because you'll see some requests in the coming months that I'll bring to you for phase three. I wanted to touch on the success of our outreach and engagement team this last year.  engagement team this last year. They've assessed 401 people since May of 2022. So that's pretty  significant. They've sat down with, you know, had a one-on-one conversation with 401 individual  people and tried to find them solutions and connect them with resources and get them out of  our public spaces where they were residing and camping and hopefully into a better living  situation. So that middle picture there shows both Eden and Brian. They're a fantastic team  and are doing great work to help us clean up our public spaces.  I want to touch on the Pallet Shelter quickly. We just celebrated the one-year anniversary.  Things are going quite well there. Currently there's a little over now 207 occupants  and close to 90 dogs. So I just kind of wanted to paint that picture of over 200 people and  almost 100 dogs at one facility. So considering that mixed use, if you will,  thank you so much for joining us.  Thank you.  So we're very pleased with our site operator, the Jesus Center, who does just a fantastic job  operating the facility. We really appreciate that partnership and hope to continue it long term.  I will say we're looking at some upgrades to the facility that will be a cost savings long term.  One of the largest operating costs of the facility is the shower and laundry trailer service  that comes in daily to provide those required elements of the settlement agreement.  We're looking at establishing some permanent facilities there.  That's going to be a lot of work.  That would probably reduce the need for those outside contractor trailer units to come on site  and provide those services. So we hope to implement those in the coming months  and save some operational dollars on an annual basis.  I wanted to touch on the encampment cleanup efforts.  This is a little bit more than the video you saw earlier just because it encompasses  all of 2022 and 2023. We've cleaned up a total of 908 tons of debris  for the entire facility. We've cleaned up a total of 908 tons of debris for the entire facility.  from public spaces in Chico since that time.  3,600 cubic yards, 598 tons in 2022.  And then out to date, including the most recent enforcement operations in 2023,  almost 1,500 cubic yards of debris weighing 310 tons.  And that was 14 larger encampment areas that we have enforced and cleaned.  Here's just a few before and after pictures  of some of the encampment areas that we have enforced and cleaned.  some of those locations.  And this gets us into some of our facilities-related efforts.  And Council Member Winslow, this might answer some of the questions you had previously for  Chief Standridge as well.  Currently, we're involved in a PD remodel for the shower and locker room to create a  much more usable space there.  The design is underway, and we're looking for construction phase funding this coming  fiscal year in 23-24.  City Hall was built in the early 90s and has remained largely unchanged, so we're also  in the design phase now for some improvements and some better use of office space at the  City Hall facility with construction phase funding requested this coming fiscal year.  Our Municipal Services Center, where I'm housed out in the courtyard, if you will, we completed  roofs, new roofs, on Buildings 100 and 200, and now we're requesting funding to complete  the roof on Building 38.  This is all part of our plan for this coming fiscal year.  Fire Station 1 remodel.  I wanted to touch on this for a moment.  Phases 1 or 2 have been completed.  Phase 3 is almost completed.  It's underway now, and we're wrapping that up shortly, but we're requesting funding for  Phase 2 this coming fiscal year.  And, of course, we had to break this up into phases due to the costs and budget resource  constraints over the last couple of years.  We weren't able to do it all at once.  Plus, phases helped us.  A phased approach helped us.  You know, maintain it.  serviceability of the firehouse too because obviously firefighters live there 24 7.  The overarching theme that I wanted to at least convey is our buildings are aging and the city  is growing. Obviously fire station one was built in the 60s, fire station two same vintage, same era  with similar problems. The first phases phase one and two and fire station one  it's about a $620,000 remodel that created seven dorms and redid multiple bathrooms. A couple  pictures there, the center picture is one of the bathrooms. It was built in the 60s and we knew we  were peeling an onion to a certain degree. There was lead and asbestos remediation that had to take  place and we experienced a 27 percent cost addition from change orders which is not what you want to  see.  A capital project I think kind of a manageable change order amount is about 10 percent in a  capital project. So we knew we were going to see those types of issues as we got into the building  and started the remodel process but it ended up being about 27 percent of the cost. Phase three  it's about down to 12 percent so we kind of have our hands around it now but the point is we want  to take lessons learned from remodeling station one and not make the same mistakes on station two.  And we'll talk a little bit more about that in a coming slide.  So these are some of our new capital requests. Ironically this building needs a new roof and  window upgrades. That's part of this budget request. Our shop, the fleet services division  that supports all of our city departments was built in the early 70s. It needs new roll-up  doors. The bones are good, the facility is good, the doors as you can imagine go up multiple times.  We have quite a few issues that cause multiple delays in providing service to our end users. So  we're we have a request in to replace the doors. We have a fence around the MSC yard which abuts to  the police department that has some insecure parts that we're looking to reinforce. So we're looking  for a new fence around the MSC yard and the police department.  And then the final phase for fire station one is being requested. That's the apparatus bay and roof  replacement and this will this will finish up fire station one nicely. Obviously that station is  there, it's been there for a long time, it serves the community strategically so we don't have any  intent to move that station or relocate that station. So I'm pleased with the remodel results  from all four phases of that that we've conducted over the last few years. We do we did have a real  request to replace the roof and the apparatus bay doors in station two but we're not moving  forward with that request at this time just due to some budget constraints and then looking  strategically at what we might do differently with fire station two. As I mentioned before we  don't want to make the same mistakes with fire station two that we made with fire station one.  But we do have an immediate need to create a better living situation for the firefighters  and as Steve Standridge mentioned earlier it requires a pretty significant bathroom  remodel to really make it usable at this point. So we are moving forward with with those requests  along with a we have a request in for our fire training center and emergency operations center  refurbishment. However we pulled the funding request from that item it looks like it might  be moving forward with the community funding that Congressman LaMalfa's office is putting forward. So  we're excited to to look at those opportunities.  So thinking about  the needs for fire station one and what we experienced excuse me the needs for fire station  two what we experienced with fire station one if I had it to do all over again I would not remodel  a building that was built in the 60s with that significant amount of lead and asbestos that takes  remediation and just your costs just accelerate. So we're looking at this strategically and we have  a request in to do a strategic facilities assessment. There's a lot of wording on this slide  but I'd like to if you don't mind humor me. I'm going to go ahead and get started. So we're going to look at the  on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on  to capture public safety and public works needs,  and fire, police, EOC, dispatch, and municipal public facilities  that will ensure appropriate strategic coverage of said services throughout the city for years to come.  The assessment would redress many issues, including properly sizing municipal facilities,  with the aim to account for future community growth and expansion of municipal services.  So what we're asking for is just funding to do a long-term strategic facilities plan  that will help us right-size and properly locate specifically public safety facilities into the future.  So that will really determine if we invest in the existing fire station two further than the dorm  and the bathroom remodels that we intend to do this fiscal year,  or will we look for another opportunity to place or house a fire station  that would serve the community a little bit better.  This is going to fit nicely with the conclusion of the fire department's standards of coverage plan  that they're doing now, so this will fit right in line.  So we're going to work with that and give us proper strategic direction moving forward.  Another new capital request is removal of three dilapidated buildings at the airport.  These buildings, again, are riddled with lead and asbestos,  have been there for some time, are quite the eyesore, are pretty much condemned, if you will,  and they're sitting on prime developable real estate for the airport.  Two of those buildings have been removed.  They have direct airfield access, so I have a funding request in to remove those buildings  and really have a blank canvas to try to promote economic activity at the airport.  And then, of course, there's a handful of sewer-funded projects,  mostly condition-related at the wastewater treatment plant,  that we want to accomplish this fiscal year.  And I just wanted to touch on this, the Measure H items.  Really, our role at this point is going to be to perform,  those labor-intensive dig-out and crack-sealing items,  one year ahead of any surface treatment projects.  So we're really focused on that, identifying those areas that we intend to come in  with large capital projects from the engineering side of Public Works,  big surface treatment operations,  and we're going to do kind of the heavy lifting in that  to really do those dig-out repairs prior to those efforts of the surface treatments on those roads.  So that's what we're really focusing on at this point,  to prep those areas for larger surface treatments,  that are coming from capital projects in the years to come.  These are the three new positions that we are requesting this year.  We are looking for a senior maintenance worker in the landscape division  to create some efficiencies there,  and provide better service to both our internal departments that we serve landscape functions to,  and then some outside areas that we perform landscape functions at.  We're looking for a new maintenance worker  in the Traffic Safety Division to help with our sign deployment efforts,  and on the Street Trees Division.  If passed, this maintenance worker on the Street Tree Division  will give us three full crews.  A full crew comprises of one senior maintenance worker  and two maintenance workers on the Tree Division.  Ultimately on-term, I'd love to have three fully staffed Tree Crews.  With this addition, it's going to give us two.  and that will buy us some time for some years to come. Another part of the budget  for us is several reclassifications of existing positions and this is just  better to create some efficiencies and to better serve the community and  some of our internal service providers.  Again these are existing positions so these aren't new positions it's just  reclassification to increase the service level in a certain area.  That's it, that concludes my portion of the presentation. Our staffing  requests align with our 2017 staffing plan that has incremental  increases as budget resources allow utilizing temporary positions to fill  the gaps and reduce the long-term financial commitments through these  steps.  With the staffing requests and capital requests and operating requests we can  continue to serve the community well and maintain our mission to provide maintain  safe reliable modern infrastructure and services to the greater Chico community.  And that's it.  All right, we have questions.  I have one.  Go ahead.  You have a lot on your plate. So I have a concern about the, we don't  know, we've been talking about the urban forest master plan and I'm very  concerned about the maintenance or lack of maintenance on the trees in Bidwell  Park, particularly between the freeway and about five mile. There's a lot of  scrubby undergrowth competing for water and light and it's compromising the  mature trees, lots of grape vines that need to be pulled out. And I'm concerned  that there's not, and it's not only health of the trees issues, but it's also  a fire problem when you have a lot of undergrowth. So I'm concerned that you don't have enough  resources to deal with that because it's a big project and it doesn't look like anybody's  really dealt with it in a systematic way for 20 years.  Well, we, I will say we have a pretty aggressive pruning schedule, specifically in lower Bidwell  Park where we try to get through there every four, three, four years and really do elevation  prunings and look for safety hazards specifically in the, in the Valley Oaks.  We have a Bidwell Park tree maintenance capital project established that is decently funded for  us to, to maintain those efforts. And if we need to focus some efforts on as that stretch that you  mentioned, we definitely can. Yeah, I think we, we have a, you know, it's a balanced approach of  you know, internal services that we have with our own staff. We have some capital project  funds included in the budget that we contract out. I've always had that hybrid approach with,  you know, some of our internal city staff and then utilizing local contractors  to, to assist and bolster our efforts. And we, we do the best we can and try to maintain  a balanced approach and, you know, within budget resources. Yeah, it just feels like the lower park,  it is, is well managed and maintained. And once you get east of the freeway overpass, it's not.  And maybe someday you and I and Richie can go for a walk at lunch and I'll show you what I mean.  Yeah, we have a more intensive focus obviously in lower park because that's where you have the  highest frequency of pedestrian and bicycle traffic. And then we start to shift our management  style as you get to middle and upper park to really open space, to open space management  deployment model.  Just a guess.  Yeah, no, actually I have some itemized things and I just, I'm a mess and I have sticky notes on them.  And if, if anybody else has a comment, just, just like jump in at some point between things,  that'd be better. But I'll start with street trees. I mean, I share a concern that,  especially with Measure H funding, I heard so many of the complaints about lack of infrastructure  were that hazards posed by streets, streets that are not well managed.  And so we have an urban forest master plan we're looking at finally adopting at this meeting.  And there's a budget item for that. It's $20,000, which just seems like a very small sum of money  to go towards that sort of thing. And along with that, there is a budget item for corridor and grid  pruning, which would be where we're going along main streets and, and, and taking care of the  trees. And there's, it looks like there's a $60,000 budget cut from last year to this year when we're  seeing a $24 million cut.  And so we're looking at that $25 million increase in city funds. And can you address where urban forestry funding is at like last year versus this year?  Well, we are requesting an additional maintenance worker for the street tree division that will really help our efforts.  We have several options for capital projects that are that are pushed towards trees. So I think one was I just mentioned in the park division that's parked  on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on  if we will, where we really identify an area, South Campus, for example, is one that's in the  queue next. We'll focus, you know, a specific amount of resources and staff time that mainly  outside contractor help to focus on that area and really do some corridor grid pruning where they've  got parameters and they're just doing those sections that we've identified.  Tree work is quite interesting. It's difficult to get contractors. We have two on contract now,  and I think the reduction for the corridor grid pruning capital project was due to we have a  balance in there now that we haven't been able to spend just due to contractor availability.  So trying to manage that accordingly where we don't build up a balance that we're unable to  spend, you know, and thinking holistically of the citywide budget, we trimmed a little bit off there  just being realistic on what we're going to be able to deploy and get contractors help with this  coming fiscal year. I hope that, I don't know if that answers it or not, but that was  you.  Mainly the reason for the reduction because we have several other that were contracts that have  resources in them and it's honestly, it's been very difficult to get contractors.  Yeah, that's good information. So yeah, I wasn't sure.  Was there a thought that you hire more tree crew then if you're not able to find outside contractors?  That's an option.  Definitely. A lot of trees need a lot of maintenance in the city.  Yeah, that's definitely an option.  We're excited to get two full crews. Again, if this budget is passed, we have that maintenance worker request in there.  That will help us and I think give us a pretty good balance between, you know, internal staff and outside contractual help.  And in the coming years, as I had mentioned earlier, my ultimate goal is to have three fully staffed crews in the tree division.  So three crews of three people each.  I couldn't, so I wasn't able to find, I only, I couldn't find the staff that I needed to find.  No one's on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on  Right, I think that, I hope it doesn't sound like the position that we're at, whether it's  due to contractor availability or staffing funding, we're not going to see tremendous  increase in care for the trees like this fiscal year anyway.  It's just a concern of mine.  And would you mind going back to the pallet shelter slide?  Yeah.  Then we can not have a blank screen on you.  I was going to ask about it.  Should be up here.  Let's do this.  There it is.  Is that the one you're looking at?  Yes, thank you.  Okay.  So you said that there is a project to improve the pallet shelter related to the  showers and bathrooms.  As I understand, there's not on-site water connection.  Is that correct?  There is.  Oh, yeah, there's on-site water.  There's just not water plumbed to each unit, only electricity.  Yeah.  So there is a general facility that has all that?  Absolutely.  Yeah.  Both in the admin building and then there's several drinking fountains and faucets outside.  So what are the bathroom upgrades and the hygiene units that are proposed?  So pallet shelter, the company, the manufacturer, saw that at the beginning of the year, they  said that not only our site but other sites too, there's a need for, they call them hygiene  units, but it's really bathroom and shower facilities.  And so they've developed a unit that is, it's a combination of a bathroom and a shower unit.  So they call it a hygiene unit.  They're not cheap, but I think amortized over time, it's much cheaper, much more cost effective  than the trailer units that we have on site now with contractors.  So we're trying to reduce that cost because it's enormous when you look at it from an  annual perspective.  So we're willing to really investigate these further.  We think we could purchase them and get them in place, make the sewer connection and the  water connection appropriately, and then reduce our annual operating costs.  Are those permanent structures?  Well, they're like a pallet shelter.  So it's not necessarily permanent, it's temporary, but it's a lot more permanent than a trailer  that comes in on a daily basis.  Yeah.  That doesn't actually get transported like a mobile home.  Right.  So it looks like, they look like a pallet shelter.  You could look at their website, hygiene units, but it's like two pallet shelters in one,  if you will.  Half is a restroom and the other half is a shower unit.  Right.  And the funding for the pallet shelter is under intergovernmental project, right?  Correct.  And it looks like there's a lot less funding this year than there was in previous years.  And one question is, does intergovernmental project also include the sanctioned campgrounds  on Eaton and Cohasset?  Yeah.  I believe...  I don't know.  I think it's under the fund, 052 is intergovernmental fund, and it is source fund for division 688,  and that's where we charge for items for the alternate site on Eaton and Cohasset and  then operating costs for the pallet shelter.  And the intergovernmental project was actually just for the build out of the pallet shelters  themselves.  The actual operational costs, the contractual costs, et cetera, are under the operational  line item for that fund 52.  Okay.  So that's where you would see the increase to account for the bathroom.  Yeah.  And then the general fund upgrades and pallet shelter hygiene.  Yes.  Is that under there?  And what's the funding source for that?  General fund.  It's all transferred from the general fund.  Okay.  Yeah.  Great.  Thank you.  I have more, but anyone's welcome to jump in while I sift through my sticky notes.  Okay.  I have a question, but it'll be quick.  Mr. Gibson, switching over to the airport, I know you're master of multiple categories  here.  How much money do we have in the revenue guarantee fund from DOT grants, et cetera?  Currently, we have $5 million.  We have $500,000 SCASD grant award.  We just recently applied for a new one that would replace our existing $4 million.  We had some dialogue with the Department of Transportation and the FAA on that.  Normally, there is kind of a limit.  You know, you didn't see any grants more than $500,000.  There was one or two that were $750,000, but they recognize this scenario post-pandemic  and what, you know, smaller markets like ourselves are, what we're trying to do in the transportation  industry is to increase the number of !  challenges we have.  And that's something that we've been trying to do for two years for Prospective Airline.  Okay.  Your memory for this stuff is outstanding.  How much do we need to get us to that final hurdle?  I know we have airlines interested, but obviously we want to get over that final hurdle and  realizing that this money isn't necessarily going to be spent until it needs to be spent,  so, but it needs to be held.  Right.  Yeah, to really be competitive in today's market, I think for a revenue guarantee fund,  we should probably be, you know, $1.5 million is where we should land.  So we're about how far away?  Well, it depends if we're successful with that.  with the renewed Department of Transportation grant.  You know, with that, we would be, you know,  $1.15 in cash and then a couple hundred in fee waivers.  So we'd be, you know, several hundred thousand dollars away from the $1.5 mark.  So we're making progress.  We're getting there.  And it's a long game.  We're in it for the long haul, and it's a process.  All right.  Thank you.  Mr. Whitley.  Just one more question related to the pallet shelter  and capital improvements out there.  And do we have any projects identified for at least, like, future funding  just to improve the environment out there and make it a little more livable?  A lot of people talk about the lack of trees being sort of jarring out there,  especially in C and the heat of the summer here.  That and also with the alternate sites, Eden Cohasset.  We don't have anything identified for Eden Cohasset.  I will say, you know, once we get through the remaining two sites,  encampment sites, you know,  the nine-year-old and the nine-year-old,  the 99 bike path and depot park,  our focus is really going to shift to the Eden Cohasset site  because I don't think it's a long-term solution  for either the city supporting that or the residents out there.  And we really want to do more and get aggressive on, you know,  connecting people to resources and things like that at those sites.  Pallet shelter-wise, we've, you know, budget constraints allow.  We've done certain things.  We've purchased some artificial grass that was removed from some sports fields  to not for, you know, a cosmetic component,  but we've done some things to make sure that we're not cutting them in door mat sizes  to assist with cleanliness and things like that out there.  I've heard that request a handful of times on trees.  It'd be great to get some trees out there.  Unfortunately, the ground is really not conducive to that.  It's, you know, there's quite a bit of aggregate base there that was lime treated.  It's, by design, it's like asphalt.  So it'd be difficult to plant trees.  I mean, we could do some, you know, planter boxes and things like that,  but none of that's identified, at least in this budget,  to make any of those cosmetic-type improvements,  just to really try to manage our annual expenses  by reducing the laundry service and the shower service that we're currently enduring.  Yes.  Somebody noted to me that the city would be saving a lot of money on energy costs  for each of the units if there were any shade trees throughout.  It wouldn't be as exposed to the sun.  And I will say part of that Phase 3 of their SST environmental program,  is to really offset the power, or excuse me, the pallet shelters' electrical usage.  So part of adding, you know, additional solar,  it'd be difficult to do it on site,  but we're looking at a program that's allowed for government agencies  to build solar off-site and then offset different meters.  And so that would be, that's one of the items that we're looking at  to offset costs for the pallet shelter.  I think in general, for the goal being expressed for some of the Measure H funds  to address homelessness, I think that improving livability in some of these,  you know, in some of these options that people have would help.  And another question, totally over, somewhere else.  In the community choice.  I have a point of order.  Robert Rosenberg's rules limit individual council people to three minutes,  and you're abusing that.  We're in a budget hearing.  This is.  We're in a council meeting right now.  Right. I'm not aware that there is a hard three-minute rule.  I think there's a motion to call.  Okay.  So we're going to have a question, and then you have to vote on it.  Madam Clerk.  The council's policy is the three minutes.  In the APMP 1010.  Yeah.  And while Mr. Winslow, I certainly understand both of you guys' points,  at the same time, too, that there is time,  I had a time to get answers to questions as well.  I mean, I know you want to have questions answered in the public,  and that makes sense to me in a lot of ways, too.  But at the same time, if we all did what you were doing,  we'd be here for three weeks.  So maybe not three, but a week.  But so I understand the balance.  So just trying to balance that out, too.  Because we do have a hard set of time.  We were supposed to go to closed session at 5,  and I also have three speakers that we need to take.  So if you want to finish with your last question, maybe.  I was going to ask what the reason for the question is.  I think you were talking about the community choice aggregate  having zero funding for this year and what the status of that is.  I'm sorry, zero fund requests?  In the community choice aggregation item,  there was funding about $235,000 last year, $167,000 the year before,  and this year there's zero of us.  We're still in design phase for phase three.  We were hoping to have that done by the budget development timeline,  but the engineering firm we're working with in PG&E,  we just couldn't get there.  So we're currently in the redesign phase  and hope to have that wrapped up soon,  and we'll bring that to council.  It'll be out of budget sequence,  but there may be some financing options as well  where we don't have to ask for additional funding to make phase three happen.  I think the question was on the CCA.  Correct, yes.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I thought it was SST.  I am sorry.  I don't even know this.  Yeah, I thought I heard SST.  I apologize.  Thanks, Mark.  SST is the...  Correct.  There's no additional funding at this moment for the community  for B-Choice Energy.  Community Choice Aggregation effort.  That is in a holding pattern really at the moment due to market conditions.  It's not feasible to launch.  And so due to CPUC requirements,  we would have to...  If we decided to launch,  it's at a minimum year and a half before you're able to  once you get an approved implementation plan.  So B-Choice Energy will likely convene early 2024  to review market conditions,  make a decision from there.  If we decide to launch,  we'll quickly reinitiate an implementation plan  for a late 2025, likely 2026 launch date.  So really there's no budget requirements  this next fiscal year for B-Choice Energy.  Okay, thank you.  All right.  And then if no other questions,  we'll move on to our three speakers.  We actually have two.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Let me pull up...  See, we have two.  We have two.  Okay.  And we're gonna break after that  and then we'll come back for discussion.  Okay.  In case...  .  So was that the clerk's suggestion?  We had placed it on the agenda  in case we as a placeholder for closed session  or for Council to get a break  in between the two meetings.  Actually, it's one meeting,  but to take a break for dinner.  Were we supposed to finish the budget  before we came back to the other meeting?  We left it as one solid running meeting,  so you can continue the discussion if you need to.  So we would just come back at 6  and continue when we're out?  Yeah.  That's fine.  Yeah, okay.  So we have William Monroe.  .  And then followed by Robin McCollum.  Hello.  Thank you, Mr. Mayor,  and Council,  and it's all been pretty well covered.  I was hoping that some of the major H funds  could be used for planters and trees  at the Pallet Shelter.  That's already been brought up and covered,  so I'm good.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Robin McCollum.  .  I'll try to be brief, too,  because it's been pretty well covered.  .  I'd like to see more funding for the tree crew,  for tree maintenance work.  Just driving around town,  you can see that there's lots of signs  that are obscured by tree branches,  and there's trees that have not been pruned for a long time,  and heavy branches that may fall.  This is the kind of thing that a robust,  routine maintenance program would be taking care of,  but we've got a lot of work to do.  We've been short-staffed for too long.  The crew was fired a while ago,  and we just recently started rebuilding it,  and that certainly is welcome, but we need more.  There's a backlog for sure.  And then the public.  As I hear from my contacts in town,  I've planted a lot of trees,  and I'm getting called back to help them  do their formative pruning and so forth,  and I hear from them about landscape areas  along their roads that are not being maintained,  and so forth,  and that when they do call for tree maintenance,  that there's a very long backlog on that.  So I'd like to see from that Measure H funding,  additional funds go to the tree crew.  And just one thing that came up here is that  it's hard to find tree workers.  And that, for one thing,  is very much because of the  huge effort that PG&E is going through.  A mistaken program, frankly,  but they're doing all kinds of vegetation removal  and maintenance and so forth,  and they're paying very high wages  for tree workers they had to reach out of state for  to get enough of.  So I would say that the market  is dictating higher wage,  and that perhaps we ought to consider that  if we want to get some more tree crew people,  that it would be more attractive for them  to come to work for the City of Chico.  Okay, thank you folks very much  for the effort you put in in these meetings.  Thank you.  That is it for speakers.  Thank you to both.  Then we'll come back and pick up with the budget  after closed session and that's it.  Okay, thank you.  Okay.  We're calling the meeting back to order,  because the, oh, hold on.  Okay, we're calling the meeting back to order,  because we've actually started the meeting at 2 o'clock.  So if you're coming,  we are still in budget discussions,  but I will read the announcements again,  just for those of you,  which was most of you who were not here at 2 o'clock  when we read this.  Announcement that item 5.2 regarding the ARHPB amendments  have been continued to a future meeting  at the request of staff in order for them  to continue their discussions with the state.  And then again, speaker card announcement.  As always, anyone wishing to address the council  on any item listed on the agenda must first complete  a speaker card, which can be found at the back of the chamber.  Once completed, please turn the card into the city clerk.  Speakers are taken in the order the cards are received,  and once the first speaker begins their comments,  no additional cards will be accepted on that item.  So we have moved on to item 1.6, budget presentations.  We have completed all of the department budget presentations,  and now we will go to item B,  which is the resolution adopting,  and also council discussion with staff.  So with that, I believe, Mr. Morgan, you had a comment.  Comment and question for the skipper.  So budget meetings are tough.  I think this is one of the quicker ones we've been through.  So thanks, staff, for that and for it being complete.  I was having a conversation in the hallway about what our job is,  as policy makers, is not to necessarily get into every line item  of the 110 pages that we were given,  but to set the guardrails for staff so they know how to operate  and the constraints on which we'd like them to operate in,  moving towards the goals that we think the city should have.  I think we got a presentation on that that was very, very clear.  The forecast, I'm sorry, the budget is really just a forecast.  There will be changes.  There's always changes.  Barbara Martin is always bringing up budget modifications.  I don't think the budget shows everything that we'd like the city to have,  but I also don't think anything is left out.  So, skipper, if you would allow me to ask you a question.  One of the most important things we can do as a policy board is my 11th budget meeting.  In the first two budget meetings I went through, I sat with Mr. Sorensen  when the finance staff wasn't giving all the information that the council should get  and the city manager wasn't.  I was the one that was supposed to get the information that the city manager should get  and the assistant city manager should get and the city attorney should get.  All those people are gone.  So, while we're voting on this budget, what we're saying to Mr. Sorensen  and to all the department directors, and I'm going to say Mr. Gufferson specifically  because he had the most questions, is we believe you understand the constraints of the funding  in front of you and these are the things that you would most like to have  given what the policy of the council is.  So, my question for the skipper is, Mark, given the balance that we have to play,  do you believe that this budget meets the most important needs as best we can?  That's question one.  Yes, but that's all in each of your judgment.  That was a yes or no question, Mark.  My second question.  Are we planning strategically for the future as best we can?  Yes.  I think you'll find many of the items we've discussed tonight demonstrate that,  particularly with regard to facilities.  Okay.  So, given that and knowing that 810 pages I could go through  and I could ask gotcha questions of everybody here, and that's certainly not my intent,  I would move that we adopt this budget and whatever fancy language I'm supposed to use to do that,  Madam Clerk.  I'll second that.  But I did have two questions or comments actually, and some of you weren't, most of you weren't here back then,  but there was a conversation we were having about trees and the amount of tree people available,  and I would just like to remind you that we have a California airport that is making it very, very difficult  for a lot of people to own equipment and operate equipment in State California.  I happen to know one tree company in particular that bought all the trees that were available,  new stuff from out of state, like not new, but new to them, to do a whole bunch of work for Paradise,  and they're not able to use any of that equipment anymore.  They have millions and millions and millions of dollars of equipment sitting there that they can't use  because the California airport says it's not of the right date.  So, while we're complaining about not being able to get stuff, it's not necessarily the City of Chico's problem.  There's a lot of problems that come, that are brought to us that aren't necessarily our problem.  And then the other thing I did find out is if anybody would like to buy a tree in a box,  they're more than welcome to donate.  They can donate it to the Pallet Shelter, and we will take care of the tree and grow the tree.  I learned from Cal Water in our meetings that it costs about $7 a year to water a tree.  So, I think that if anybody wants to donate a tree, then they can donate a tree to the Pallet Shelter.  All right, the schedule.  That's me. I heard a mention of City Council policy, budget policy.  You can see in this year's budget,  for process and timeline, we have it outlined, which is in our budget policy,  that we do outreach in the beginning of the year.  We see community input in order to set some guideposts for our priorities in how this turns out.  This is still in this year's budget, even though this year we didn't do any community outreach.  This year of all years, when we're looking at a $24 million new source of revenue,  we didn't do any, we skipped it this year.  And I don't...  Well, we're...  We're going to be short all across the board,  and we're always going to find we can have asks from different departments.  There are certain priorities that come out.  And when we ran the city support of this campaign for Measure H,  we put it on the ballot,  you find consistent messaging that was used because they knew that that's what would reach voters well.  And it says that infrastructure and roads and public safety are going to be some of the priorities.  And it also mentions housing, and it says addressing homelessness.  And you'll find it in the impartial analysis done by Mr. Ewing in the ballot box.  You'll find it in the proponents' argument,  and you'll find it in all of the literature sent out by the campaign.  And I brought one that I got from home.  I imagine a lot of people got the same.  It has the mayor's face on it,  and it says that Measure H funding would support park and road maintenance, housing, and public safety.  But we're not seeing a dime go to all these priorities.  So I'm concerned that a well-researched citizen who decided to vote in favor of Measure H  would feel defrauded at the actual result that we're getting.  And take me, for example.  As I was running for office, and I endorsed Measure H,  and I supported it, and I campaigned for it,  with the promise that I understood, reading all the literature,  that these funds would be distributed in a way that sits balanced across the priorities identified by the literature.  And that says housing, and that says addressing homelessness.  And as we find, as we walk through the budget in various departments,  that all of this money has been shifted in certain particular directions and hasn't gone towards others.  Now, just based on fidelity to campaign,  I would vote no on this budget.  Because we didn't give even a sliver to these different areas that were identified.  We knew that that's how we would get voters' support to pass Measure H.  And when people warned me against it,  and people who I'm close to who oppose Measure H,  what they said was,  the council won't listen to these priorities.  They're going to change their mind immediately.  And I told them that I didn't think that's what would happen.  And I'm seeing now that I was wrong.  So, I would,  as a bare minimum,  and just to follow our own budget process,  make a substitute motion that we would hold a separate budget hearing  between now and the final adoption,  so that we can solicit public input in a way that's better than a 2 p.m. meeting  that none of the people here, almost none of them, managed to attend.  All right.  I'd actually like to chime in on that.  So,  the substitute motion?  Yeah, well, it has to get a second.  It died for like a second.  Yeah.  So, I will be voting no on the budget,  because I do like to keep true to my campaign promises.  Yeah.  And I have a short comment, too.  So, and it follows along what you said.  I would love that.  I know my friendly amendment, if I make it, isn't going to be accepted.  But I'm going to try to get $250,000  to the airport revenue guarantee fund.  I'd like to see that happen through this budget.  My conversation with the city manager would fit it in there.  It's not money that we'd actually spend until an airline actually came.  But I would need the person making the motion to accept that.  So, you're asking for a friendly amendment to take a quarter million dollars  and put it into the Chico Regional Airport?  Revenue guarantee.  Revenue guarantee.  Mr. Gustafson, can I ask you a question?  How well are your offices dealing with the influx of carrier service  since we changed the name from municipal airport to regional airport?  I think you might be surprised at the answer.  And so, my next, that was rhetorical.  Thank you.  My next question is where would you take that quarter million dollars, Mr. Mayor?  Mr. Sorensen, do you have any ideas on where the money would go?  Where that $250,000 would come from?  Yeah, it would have to be one of the general fund pots.  So, either fund one or fund five.  Yeah.  And the benefit of doing this is that that money is not necessarily utilized.  It's held in a fund at which it remains until future years.  But you still can't spend it for...  Correct.  Going back to my earlier statements where the department directors thought this was the best use of the budget.  I understand that.  So, we're going to take a quarter million dollars from Brendan Ottoboni and we're going to put it over here.  Does that mean you're going to accept the friendly amendment?  I just, I looked over and he was smiling.  And say, we're going to put this here in case someone that doesn't think they can make money here decides to come.  They'll take our tax dollars before they leave.  So, I can't accept it.  I'm happy to push it forward at a later date if you don't want to accept my friendly amendment.  Okay.  It pains me to say no to your friendly amendment given the name.  I can tell.  I do have one other point and I think it's important to, before I call the question here and move on to any other comment,  is this is important to note in terms of Addison's statement is I actually brought up the tax measure in a speech that I gave on the first of 2021  in which I said we needed it for roads, we needed it for public safety,  and meaning fire and police.  And then, and actually that brochure, if you read my quote, it does not say anything about housing.  I did not design the campaign materials because I could not do that for this job.  But in every motion that the council made and every motion that I made and was a part of and voted on, it only said public safety and roads.  So, just point of order.  Yeah.  You guys, I can't.  I know.  You guys are about to have a political discussion.  I know.  On campaigning.  This is not.  We can call the question.  This is not the place for that and you know better.  I know.  But I wanted to do it.  Your quote says maintain our parks and there's no parks budget.  Yes.  Proposed budget.  I'd agree with that, although public safety does do that.  I'm going to call the question.  Okay.  So, it's a motion and a second to approve the preliminary budget through the resolution.  Councilmember Bennett?  Yes.  Councilmember Morgan?  Yes.  Councilmember Tandon?  Yes.  Councilmember Van Overbeek?  I'm sorry.  Can you repeat it?  I didn't hear you clearly and I do have my hearing aids.  This is the adoption of the preliminary proposed budget and then the final budget will come back to you at the next meeting for adoption.  Yes.  Okay.  Councilmember Winslow?  No.  Vice Mayor Reynolds?  Yes.  Mayor Coolidge?  Aye.  Carries 6-1.  Senate 1-5 comment? Out of order. You're like the last person that pays any attention and then you will be quiet. Mr. Sorensen. Congratulations on getting us all through your very first budget, sir.  No.  No.  No. All right. Item 1.7 closed session agenda. We did and we have a report out from Mr. Ume. Thank you, Mayor Coolidge.  direction was given. That concludes my  closed session report.  All right. Thank you very much.  We are not doing  the presentation of the NorCal Mayor's Cup,  so that was going to be moved to a future  meeting. The consent agenda, all  the matters listed on the consent agenda are to be  considered routine in nature,  and therefore can be enacted in one motion.  Do we have any disqualifications or  no votes?  All right.  Seeing none, entertain a motion.  A motion from Vice Mayor  Reynolds, a second from Council Member Tandon.  When you're ready, Madam Clerk.  Okay. Council member Bennett. Yes. Council member Morgan. Yes. Council member Tanden. Yes. Council member Van Overbeek. Yes. Council member Winslow. Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds? Aye. Mayor Coolidge?  Aye. Carries 7-0.  All right. Thank you very much.  We will go to item 2.3,  business from the floor.  No consent agenda, none.  Now business from the floor.  Members of the public may address the council at this time  on any matter not already listed on the  agenda with comments being limited to three minutes  or as determined.  The council cannot take any  action at this meeting on requests  made under this section of the agenda.  How many speakers? We have two.  All right. Three minutes. Okay.  Julie Threatt, followed by James Hutchinson.  Okay.  I'm quiet.  I'm quiet.  I'm quiet.  Hi, everybody.  Julie Threatt, up in District 6.  I'm here to advocate for the vaccine injury.  I took two shots of Moderna. You're reading my batch numbers on my shirt.  I got five eye surgeries.  So I haven't been here. Fifth eye surgery, two weeks out  from my third detached retina.  There's an HR article about the impact of these shots  on eyes. I just talked to a lady in the bathroom.  She's having eye problems.  I'm getting stuff all day long.  We have got to come to grips with the fact that these shots  were poison. They were injected into our kids.  There is a contaminated  pediatric Pfizer lot.  L8095. Butte County gave 895 of those shots  into our little kids' arms.  Somebody needs to start doing an investigation.  And somebody needs to start talking. It's disturbing.  We let Javier Becerra come to Chico last year  on 3-14-2022 and sit in a room at MLO  with pediatricians and Dr. Miller  and Dr. Danette York.  And they came up with a plan and they started rolling out those little vaccine clinics.  I warned you guys about that. They went to the mall.  They went to Sierra Nevada Brewery.  There's a kid dead on the same day of those shots at Sierra Nevada Brewery.  I'm going to leave.  I mean, we can't let Bill Gates. He's been doing this for decades.  Fauci, the same thing.  Here's my VAERS report.  Here's my mom's dead VAERS report. She died from four shots.  Sudden cardiac event. Her heart turned off like a dime.  Four shots of Moderna. Nothing wrong with the woman.  She went to Wyoming on vacation. She died.  I brought here today, and I'm going to give it to  the police sergeant, wherever he is.  You can give it to the clerk.  These are 663  dead people in California.  I printed every single one of these VAERS reports off.  663. I gave 661  to Senator Daly when he was down in Orville.  I gave 662 to Durfee.  And now it's up to 663.  So I'm leaving them all to you.  You guys need to go through these, and you need to start having an investigation.  And I just told Action News now, they better start reporting on this.  We have too many people injured here.  I've got people calling me with miscarriages.  I worked with those nurses at the vaccination clinics.  These Buick College nurses deserve better.  They deserve healing. They deserve treatments.  Ivermectin. You guys got to get on top of this.  I'm tired of going to the county and begging them for help.  So thank you very much for listening.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  And better with the city clerk, Julie.  Julie, with the city clerk.  Yeah, we'll take them and distribute.  First, I'd like to make a suggestion.  You're asking the public about whether or not  they agree with dealing with an SB.  Any bill, not just necessarily the ones that are proposed  that will be discussed tonight.  That you put a link to the legislature,  right to that bill.  It tells you who proposed the bill.  It gives you the history of what's gone through so far.  Both those bills are covered in it  that you didn't cover tonight are there.  And if you have that link in there when you're requesting this,  it gives the public a chance to restore it.  So you can look straight to it and look at a non-partisan source  to what's going on.  Second thing I'd like to ask on this council is you start thinking  outside of the box a little.  Mr. Wenzel so far and actually Mr. Morgan in his own way  are the only people here I see thinking outside of the box.  Tell you the truth because I see a lot of personal gain  in some of these things.  But nevertheless, letting that ride.  What we need to do is start looking at transportation.  We need to start looking at a proposed idea before.  The idea of creating with the airport a rail system,  a light rail system.  Your systems where you don't even have to lay tracks now  because you have the ability from AI to read a tape run along.  And it will follow that tape and if you need some time  in the future to change that, that tape is easily removed  and reset.  That's out of China right now, but it's also going in the Middle East.  These are things we can do that can create, if you move that  to the Kmart area, put a convention center in there.  Why not?  You have an airport right nearby.  You put the track in through there.  You run that track up through the in-low area and up to the new cancer center.  And you would be meeting several demands if you pass it through downtown.  It would not be.  It would not be nearly as disruptive as any other system you have going right now.  It's available.  Technology is there.  Start thinking outside the box a little.  I know next year the chances of getting funding is going to be rough.  When the governor sees $10 billion shortfall, yeah, it's going to be rough to get new projects.  We know that.  But to start considering and start looking at it, it's not too late.  I'd like to see more of this outside of the box that has been brought forward here.  I only ask for the things that are in the box.  I don't want to think about it.  Thank you.  Thank you.  That was our two speakers.  All right.  So, move on to public hearings.  Item 4.1, appeal of the architectural review application 1922, Town Place Suites Hotel.  Before you start, we are going to do announcement of ex parte communications.  Starting on my left, Mr. Morgan.  You have it?  Okay.  Mr. Morgan.  I had a, I think about a 30-second discussion with Jim Stevens yesterday.  It might have been shorter than that, actually, just that we were coming tonight and it was  all on the agenda.  So, Vice Mayor?  I'm driven by the sight and spoke to Mr. Stevens in the past about the product.  No?  No?  All right.  Okay.  Moving on, we will go to the staff.  Welcome.  Thank you, Mr. Mayor, Council, Bruce Zambow, Principal Planner.  I'm going to go to the staff.  This is an appeal of an April 5th architectural review and approval approval of a four-story,  112-room hotel proposed on the northeast quadrant of Bruce Road and Highway 32, or  Deer Creek Highway, bounded by Sierra Sunrise Terrace.  This is the same project that the Council saw back on September 6, 2022, when the Council  reversed the Planning Commission denial and approved the same project for a use permit.  The project that was recently approved, and you gave this project a condition to go to  the architectural review and approval as a condition of approval when you approved the  project this last time on appeal.  They have since gone to the architectural review and approval, or recommended approval,  and then the project that's before you today is stronger in the sense that they've addressed  concerns relative to access, prohibited some access that was requested from the neighbors.  They've improved the look of the building, reduced the visual height of the building,  and then they've added a condition to add some exterior elements to the appearance of it to reduce the appearance of the mass and scale.  With that project, the environmental document remains adequate, and therefore our recommendation is going to remain the same.  The Council has also opposed the approval of the architectural review board and denies this appeal.  That concludes my brief staff report. If you have any questions, I'd be happy to answer them.  Questions?  So, you've just made the statement that the project is better than what was approved last year, correct?  Yes, sir.  Through the architectural review process?  Yes, it has been, in my opinion, yes.  Okay, so I haven't followed it. So, I appreciate your providing us with more information. Thank you.  Other questions? No? Thank you very much.  Okay, so we're going to open the public hearing.  The appellant has, or the applicant has 15 minutes.  Then we have 30 minutes for additional speakers.  Then we have a three-minute rebuttal.  And we will make that one.  So, who do we have speaking for the appellant?  Mr. Stevens.  Greetings. Good evening. Good to see you.  I will be very brief.  I first want to thank you for your previous support and the initial approval.  We listened to what you said.  And I believe that we concur with Bruce.  And I think we brought back a better project.  And other than any other questions, I just ask for your continued support.  All right. Questions?  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right. Speakers?  Okay, we have 10 additional speakers.  And I'll call the first two.  And if you could line up in the middle aisle, that would be great.  So we can get you through.  Austin Barron followed by Lolly DeYoung.  I'll be doing three minutes, please.  Yes.  Hi, Council.  I was hoping to be a little bit later in the queue, but I guess I'm first.  My name is Austin Barron.  I'm an architecture review board member.  I just wanted to briefly kind of describe what we recommended for this project.  Through planning commission and through us, the project had changed greatly.  We asked them to go one step further and add more stone veneer.  We're going to add more concrete.  And kind of add an additional layer of protection for the neighbors for the left turn only out of the western exit and an entrance only out of the eastern entrance to the property.  So, you know, I think we did some good stuff.  And I think this is a good project.  So thank you.  Thank you.  So Lolly DeYoung and Jennifer Truff.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  And if you're next, if you could just line up in the aisle.  Sorry.  No, that's okay.  So, dear Council members, you may not see many people against this meeting tonight.  And I think that's because we're all tired.  We've been at this for four years.  And we don't feel like we've been heard at all.  And we have just given you mountains of evidence.  And 1,300 signatures as to why this hotel is not a good fit.  It's not.  It doesn't belong there.  When we went to the ARB meeting, we had 13 speakers.  Almost every one of them asked for a consideration of three stories.  I think, you know, knowing everything we do, that might be the best we can get.  And we might be happy with that.  But the ARB commission did not ask those questions.  They didn't ask the applicant if that was going to be something that they could do.  Instead, they talked about the stone veneer and, of course, this huge safety issue about the exit and egress or whatever.  Anyway, I don't feel like we were heard at any point in time.  And we have a lot of people that are going to be affected by this.  Our home values will go down.  The seniors' safety will be threatened.  And it's just not a good fit.  And I really wonder why more hotels aren't built on the north side of town.  This may be out of the realm here, but I've lived here 31 years, and not one single hotel has been built on the north side of downtown.  And it seems like we need them there, too.  Instead of this huge mass of hotels on the south side of town.  Anyway, I thank you for your time.  And I also have, last at the ARB, we talked about the visual of the terraces and it being a five-story hotel.  Or not hotel, but assisted living.  And what the difference was.  And I have pictures to show you that because of where it is situated, it doesn't show at all.  And I also have pictures about where, what the hotel would look like.  Can I give them to somebody?  You can leave them with the clerk.  She can pass them through here.  Okay.  Thank you for your time.  Thank you.  Jennifer Treff followed by James Hutchinson.  Good evening.  My name is Jennifer Treff.  I am the property manager for Sierra Sunrise Village, which is the senior community in which the hotel is located.  And I am the property manager for Sierra Sunrise Village, which is the senior community in which the hotel will be adjacent to.  We just wanted to clarify, take a moment to clarify some of the information that was included in the letter that was sent to the council from North Star.  On the first page of the letter, they state that the project site was part of Sierra Sunrise Village.  And that's incorrect.  The site was part of California Park, not ever a part of Sierra Sunrise Village.  The attached deannexation agreement that you received in your letter was from California Park.  But it was not from Sierra Sunrise Village.  They also incorrectly used information from the original California Park CC&Rs that were superseded three years prior to the deannexation of the lot.  And again, would not apply to Sierra Sunrise Terrace as Cal Park did not and does not own Sierra Sunrise Terrace.  It is the Sierra Sunrise Village common area.  All common area within Sierra Sunrise Village is owned and maintained by the membership of Sierra Sunrise Village.  This includes Sierra Sunrise Village.  Which is comprised of 509 units.  Each unit's owner pays their share of maintenance through their assessment.  This includes savings for current and future road maintenance for Sierra Sunrise Terrace.  There is nothing in the attached documentation demonstrating that the property is not required to contribute toward road maintenance.  It does refer to lot owner.  But if you look at the definition in the CC&Rs for Sierra Sunrise Village,  you will see that the definition of a lot is a list of the lots within the association,  and it does not include lot number 59.  It does not mean any arbitrary lot anywhere. When the governing documents describe a lot,  they're describing a lot within the association.  Lot 59 is not a member of the association and would not pay through assessments to pay for road maintenance.  This leads us to the false statement that lot 59 is not required to contribute to road maintenance.  California Civil Code 845 states,  the owner of an easement in the nature of a private right-of-way or a land to which any such easement is attached  shall maintain it in repair.  It goes on to say that  in the absence of an agreement, the cost shall be shared proportionately between...  to use the...  I'm sorry, I'm not reading that correctly.  ...shall be paired proportionately to use made of the easement of each owner,  meaning that they have to pay their proportionate share of the road maintenance.  Lot 59 is required by law to pay their proportional share for which they have an easement.  Sierra Sunrise Village would prefer to have a formal agreement.  All of this further illustrates  the point made in Marsha Birch's letter, which you also received,  about piecemealing and that this is considered...  should have been considered in the overall project approval.  Thank you.  James Hutchinson, followed by Julie Threat.  Previous speaker reinforced something I brought up at a former County Council meeting  when I talked about Colin Powell saying,  if you can't get the little things right, how are you going to get the big things right?  And she brought that up.  I brought that up.  I brought that up.  For me, downstream from this, where Dead Horse slew in his little Chico Creek,  I have a great familiarity of what that water looks like when it comes pouring down there  in the big storm.  I've seen it a number of times.  I've seen the near flooding.  This year alone, I went out and removed two trees from where Dead Horse slew in his little  Chico Creek to keep it from flooding.  The water was backing up.  Edward City wasn't there.  There's people there.  There's people passing it all the time, taking the bridge over Humboldt Road, over Dead Horse  slew.  But nobody saw it.  And I removed both of them.  It hurt.  It's one of the reasons I haven't been here to several meetings.  I'm not suing this city, by the way.  1018, Code Red, Flash Flood Warning from Bruce.  This was on November 29, 2018.  That's Flash Flood Warning.  It went from Canyon Road to the Skyway and was Bruce Road.  That's where the flood warning was.  Fortunately, it didn't wipe anything out.  As you know, 2018 is the symbolic year of the fire, campfire.  We don't know the total impact of that yet.  We don't know what happens if La Nina shows up here next year.  We have no idea.  Even the experts don't even know if La Nina is going to show up again next year, though  they predict it will.  Mr. Hutchinson, if you could keep your comments on the hotel property.  That's on the hotel.  We do where I was pointed out in the arguments against this hotel in terms of the environmental  look, that we have a unique situation where water will be flowing in to Dead Horse slew  from that area.  That is the only drainage, overflow drainage there.  It's going to affect it at all.  As long as that's there, it threatens us.  Also, if you want to talk about what was brought up here, the aesthetic of looking out over  there, from where I live, I lost three views of the mountains and hills now because of  new buildings three stories and higher.  This one will take another view away.  Look up Humboldt Road from Forest Avenue, Highway 32.  Take a look up there.  Take a look from 16th Street.  1661 Force.  Go out and look out.  You see a senior complex, a supposed senior complex that isn't really three stories high,  blocking the view.  There it goes again.  People live there because they liked the area.  You're destroying the area.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Julie Threat followed by Martha Ellington.  Hi, you guys.  Julie Threat, District 6.  I live up there.  I cannot believe it's been this long and you guys are still talking about this.  When I was in here the last time and you guys were talking about this, I was thinking about  the !  No!  No! Nobody's giving them money and they're being sued left and right. Senator Dahl is always trying to raise money for them. But it's going to be a long time before that's there. Fire. Oh, we don't have any proof there's going to be a fire. Well, yeah, that's what they said in Paradise. And 88 people died. There's one way and one way out. I've evacuated four times from there. We had an earthquake alert the other night. I mean, seriously, this is going to go down as one of the biggest debacles.  Go down as one of the biggest debacles.  You know, if it's the architectural review and you're not paying it, I mean, I hope that at least when you're driving up 32 towards my house  and they want to put a monstrosity that looks like Merriam Park, that's not what I want to see.  I would rather it look like, you know, at least the other homes that are kind of melding into the community.  But there is no way a hotel belongs in that little tiny sliver of land.  You're jamming one in there to bow down to the developers, and it's ridiculous.  And you have every member of this community, again, old, young, lived here for generations, kids, families,  I have never seen members of this community come out so loud.  Right before, again, the COVID, I saw 200 seniors packed into that country club.  And I'm like, there's no way this council is going to do this.  But you did.  So I'm hoping this one is different and you guys will make a better decision.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Martha Ellington, followed by Sandy Gillard.  Hi, I'm Martha Ellington.  I'm the president of the California Park Homeowners Association.  Our attorney submitted a letter yesterday in response to the staff report.  She was unable to be here today.  So I'd like to read her additional comments.  The staff report states that the project site has deeded easement access,  but the only reference to it is in the site plan.  The public has never seen any evidence of deeded access to the parcel.  The city made proof of legal access a condition of the conditional use permit,  and reference to a site plan with a line labeled access easement is not sufficient evidence that an easement exists.  Okay.  We have had a chance for a brief review of the letter submitted by North Star Engineering this afternoon.  Much of the information in that letter is completely new,  and no member of the public has had a chance to review it in detail,  nor have any had the opportunity to seek an objective peer review of the information.  Providing essential information about the project a few hours in advance of the final hearing  does not provide for fairness or due process.  It is particularly egregious for the engineering firm to provide a detailed explanation,  of the easements for the parcel,  which the city refused to disclose during the architectural hearing,  and going on to claim that the applicant has no obligation to contribute to roadway maintenance.  Civil Code 845 provides that all users of a shared easement must pay their fair share toward road maintenance.  The applicant's position that they may freely use the roadway while others pay to maintain it is contrary to the law.  As we noted in comments to the architectural board,  the piecemealing of the project resulted in the stormwater impacts being ignored during approval of the conditional use permit,  and during review of the architectural plan.  In defense of reliance on the vaguely described bioswale,  the staff report made reference to guidance from the EPA for use of bioswales.  The EPA states that a swale is not sufficient for drainage of a site larger than one acre.  So, the EPA guidance for this does not apply.  The EPA's decision to make a stormwater impact is not supported for this project.  The stormwater impacts have not been evaluated sufficiently for the city to make any conclusion regarding whether the impacts may be significant.  The piecemealing of the project review also precluded the architectural board from considering a three-story hotel  as a possibility to make the project consistent with the general plan and design guidelines.  The architectural board's discretion was curtailed by the fact that the city had already issued a conditional use permit,  for the architectural review process.  The sensitive habitat areas related to Dead Horse Slough preclude the use of the infill exemption  and the city's refusal to analyze stormwater flows and impacts compounds the error.  The city should grant the appeal and undertake the appropriate environmental review.  And I just want to add that I think it was really disrespectful to the citizens,  all the citizens impacted by this project, to receive this 91-page report from North Star Engineering.  Today at almost 1 p.m.  Sandy Gillard followed by Lori Carr.  And if you could please line up in the middle aisle, please.  Thank you.  What I want to bring up is this project has been piecemealed from the very beginning.  Normally it would be the Planning Commission, then the ARHB, and then the City Council.  And what we got on ours is that,  everything got pushed to the very end.  And I want to read what happened in Tehachapi.  And I'm going to quote our attorney's section talking about the piecemeal of this whole project.  Number B, on page 3 she wrote,  The project review has been improperly piecemealed.  When the city deferred review of the final design of the project to the ARHBP,  it precluded analysis of the whole of the project.  Notably, in approving the CUP,  the city made conclusions regarding the hotel's project's scenic and aesthetic impacts,  and yet it had not yet reviewed the final design.  The city also approved the CUP for a four-story hotel,  effectively precluding any analysis of the project.  The ARHBP also provided a detailed analysis of the mass and size of the building,  and how that relates to the applicable plans and policies.  The ARHBP was prevented from considering a three-story structure,  and this was the result of the improper piecemealing.  And getting back to,  we had an original ARHB back in October,  where there were five to seven committee members.  We got pushed back when all of a sudden they decided,  let's put the ARHB in with the planning commission.  We had three people,  and the one that was chosen from the planning commission  is the only one voted against the project,  Larry Wall.  And so I want to show you, this was actually Tehama,  the city of Tehama,  their three-story townhouse place suite.  I love the quote below, it says,  we are proud to progress the next phase of the development  of townhouse suites in Tehachapi.  If anybody remembers his name, Greg Presley,  he was the first person that came here at Canyon Oaks,  and we have standing room ovation in Canyon Oaks,  there was not one person that was for this project.  And they told Greg, who came from Tennessee,  so guess who Greg is?  Greg is the one that represents this group.  And all of a sudden they have,  they made them do a three-story,  and it says the Tehachapi planning commission  approved the architectural design,  the site plan review,  and negative declaration on the project  at the January 14th meeting.  Thank you.  So they had to do a CIPA and...  Ma'am, your time has expired.  So Lori Carr followed by Valerie Priola.  It's my first time doing this, I'm kind of scared.  I don't know politics, I don't know policies,  but I've lived in the area since 1968,  and I've lived at Sterling Oaks Apartments for 10 years.  My patio abuts, looks over Dead Horse Slough,  and I can tell you, I cannot count how many times  I've almost had to evacuate because of the  flooding creeping up to my apartment.  Anyway, when I first heard about this hotel,  I thought, oh no way, that's crazy.  In that little spot, they would never approve that.  This is a neighborhood, all of us live here,  this isn't, yes, I know it's been designated mixed use,  but that doesn't get permission for runaway building  that's going to adversely impact the neighborhood  as an asset to the community.  Don't want it.  Yesterday, driving home, I looked and I thought,  I won't see any of those trees, any of those trees  when I get there.  And the noise, and the crime, and this is from people  who really don't have a vested interest in how it's going  to affect the community.  They don't live there, we live there.  And so I'm figuring that if I don't say something,  then I get what I ask for.  If I don't speak up and give you my two cents worth  on how it's so foolhardy, it's poor planning,  a lot of places for other hotels.  If Chico needs another hotel, there are other places  where a hotel can go in where people will welcome it  and it will be supported, but not here.  That's not an appropriate place.  It reminds me of cancer, actually.  It really does.  It reminds me of cancer.  First you've got the hotel, then you've got to have  a gas station, then you have to have a restaurant  and maybe a strip mall.  I mean, it's one thing right after another.  It's just the way it happens.  And the next thing you know, all of us who live there  have lost our place to live.  Taxpayers.  Anyway, at the end of the day, these other businesses  that are going to be there, they're going to be there  in the area.  They're not open 24 hours a day.  They close their doors at the end of business day.  So Town Place Suites open 24 hours a day.  And you know what happens.  Crime, of course.  Noise.  I read the report.  No amount of trying to make it pretty is going to take away  the fact that it would just be this giant eyesore  that negatively impacts everyone who lives in that area.  And there's a lot of us.  And we deserve to be heard.  Thank you so much.  Thank you.  Valerie Priola and followed by Robin McCollum.  Hi, I'm Valerie Priola.  I'm the current president of Sierra Sunrise Village.  I don't have anything to add.  I spilled it all out to the city council and to the planning commission.  None of that has changed.  But for the record, Sierra Sunrise Village residents still have a list  of passionate issues that need to be worked through.  None of them can probably be addressed in three minutes.  Not to this board and not to the architectural board.  And so I will spare you going through everything that I've already put forward.  But we do look forward to working through these issues with the applicant  during the upcoming civil appeals.  And I hope that this appeals process.  Thank you.  Robin McCollum is our last speaker.  This will be brief again.  Sorry, but I'm confused as what item I'm here to speak about  the urban forest master management plan.  No, you did.  So could we change my card again, please?  Okay.  So you put in a card.  Yeah.  So it's a report on the urban master, the forest plan.  And then you just came up and you said that you wanted to speak  and you put the card in on the wrong one.  Actually, I saw two versions of the agenda depending on how you access it.  So.  No, I'm just.  So if you don't want to speak on this item, you already know it's on the next.  Alright.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I'm sorry.  He asked and it's a public hearing.  Yep.  So okay.  So now we will have the applicant for three minutes.  for a rebuttal.  If you so seek it.  No?  Okay, applicant waves the time.  We'll close the hearing to the public.  Council discussion.  Motion to vote.  We only have 20 minutes legally to do it.  All right, council discussion.  Entertain a motion.  I'd like to, this is in my district.  I want to make a motion to deny the appeal.  I'm sorry, to approve the appeal.  I'm sorry.  I want to make a motion to deny the appeal.  Deny the appeal or approve the appeal?  The project.  The project is being appealed and I want the project to be approved.  Okay, so you want to deny the appeal.  My question is, will you follow your motion up with, you mentioned this is in your district.  I would like to hear your reasoning.  Yeah, that's a commercial corner.  Thank you.  And it's in the master plan as a commercial corner.  And there will be some other commercial.  Folks, if you can keep it down.  We were quiet during your time to speak.  If it's not a hotel, it will be some other commercial.  It's a commercial use.  And I think that, you know, residential typically isn't built on corners  because there are 30,000 cars that go through that intersection every day.  And the amount of, and so one of the objections was the impact on traffic.  This is an extended stay, hotels I understand it, and the impact on traffic will be nil.  So I think this is a great project.  I commend the developers.  I thank them for their patience and forbearance.  And I'm very happy to be here.  And I apologize to them for being tortured by our citizens.  Okay, folks.  Folks.  Again, we do not cheer or boo or go against any comments in this room, whether you like them or not.  If we don't do that, we clear the room and we have this meeting without you, which I really prefer not to do,  which we've had to do in the past at times.  So people are able to state their opinions.  That's what we're here for.  The First Amendment.  Alright.  So, excuse me.  Okay.  Let's take a 10-minute break.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  The concern is...  Hold on a second.  Do we need to...  So you closed the hearing?  Yes.  Okay.  Yeah.  So just a question.  Okay.  As I understand, the concern is a demonstration of availability for access onto Sierra Sunrise Terrace.  And we pointed out earlier and again in the packets we presented a couple of weeks ago and then again today  that we went back through all the deeds since we've been involved in this property since early 2000s.  I went and found deeds in 2007, 2009, 2013, and then two in 2019 when Continuum actually bought the property.  And all of them have the descriptions in the deeds say Parcel 1, and that's Lot 59, and Parcel 2 is an easements for ingress, egress, pedestrian, and vehicular and public utilities over Lots A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and I, which are lots shown on the Sierra Sunrise Subdivision map, and Parcel I is Sierra Sunrise Terrace.  And that's continuing as far back as we can find the deeds.  So it does have dedicated access.  All right.  Mr. Ewing.  Thank you, Mayor Coolidge.  I would actually ask the planners, either Mr. Ambo or Ms. Murphy, to chat about where this project has been from its inception to planning to architectural view to now.  It's not really a legal question.  It's about as much as it is a process question.  I'd be happy to run through that, Mayor.  Mayor and Council.  The project went for the use permit only went to the Planning Commission to discuss the question of whether or not a hotel should exist.  The basic question, not to get into the look of the thing or anything else.  The fundamental question was whether or not a hotel should exist.  And the Planning Commission did not feel it should.  That decision was appealed to the Council.  Council heard this.  And then they reversed that decision.  And then the Council approved.  The hotel with the condition that it go to the Architectural Review Board.  The Council could have approved it with the architecture at that first appeal.  But you gave it the condition to go to the Architectural Review Board.  The Architectural Review Board recently approved the project.  That has been appealed.  And now it's back before you because their decision is appealable.  Our recommendations have remained the same on both the use permit and the Architectural Review.  Thank you.  So, all right.  Okay.  We have a motion on the floor with no second.  Second.  All right.  We have a motion and a second.  Further discussion?  I'll just say one thing.  I mean, this is for one thought.  I do appreciate many people coming out and speaking on this.  I do not intend to support the appeal.  And there's like a lot of details to this project.  And I followed it somewhat the whole time it's gone on, although not in as much detail.  But we're also looking at a very narrow, very detailed appeal.  And I think it's a very good overview for what this decision can be.  And if we could lower the height of the building, I don't think it would have the desired effect  of addressing all the concerns people brought up.  I think that a lot of those concerns are better addressed than people realize.  And ultimately, this end of town is distinct from the northern stretches where you might  have like no second story, three story buildings for like miles around from anything you can see.  I think southeast Chico is a much better place in town as a result of that.  I think that we're looking at much higher ratios of tax revenue we're getting out of  there for our infrastructure.  I think that more people are going to be able to get the benefit of the beautiful areas  that are over there on that side of town.  And what I would like to see is some of these major concerns that come up with all sorts  of projects like this, the vehicular traffic, the safety issues that come with it, the amount  of the impacts in having people in an area, especially when they're all coming with their  own automobiles.  There's a bus stop on Bruce Road that has no shelter.  It's just a pole right now.  I think those are some of the things that we should look at addressing in order to alleviate  the impacts of development on the people who live near.  So we don't have developments bringing out people against it.  People should be inviting them to new developments so that we can see our city progress.  And I hope that things are not as bad as some of you think that they might be with this,  but I think that there are benefits in it.  And ultimately, we're all going to be able to live.  And that's a nice area of town and will continue to be.  All right.  Perfect.  All right.  We have a motion and a second.  Madam Clerk?  Council Member Bennett?  Yes.  Council Member Morgan?  Yes.  Council Member Tandon?  Yes.  Council Member Van Overbeek?  Yes.  Council Member Winslow?  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds?  Yes.  Mayor Coolidge?  Aye.  Carries 7-0.  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  Moving on to Item 4.  Or, sorry, 5.1, Internal Affairs Committee Recommendation Urban Forest Master Plan.  Mr. Goffs?  Yes.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No. [inaudible]  All right, here we go.  Thank you, Mayor, Vice Mayor.  Appreciate the opportunity to speak to you again tonight.  I'll be quick on this item.  This was the Urban Forest Master Plan item that was dispatched to Internal Affairs.  Internal Affairs met on May 1st and had a robust discussion on it.  I think the meeting was well attended.  The meeting went well.  Lots of discussion.  And we highlighted items, as you see in this document, the action items that support each of the seven goals.  We highlighted the ones that were discussed.  And then per any recommendation from Internal Affairs, we used track changes and sent this document to Council a couple of weeks ago to make sure there was ample time to review.  And I'll let Chair Vandoverbeek maybe add if I'm missing anything.  But thank you.  Staff's suggestion is to adopt the Urban Forest Master Plan with the recommended changes from the Internal Affairs Committee meeting.  Yeah, first I want to thank Public Works, Mr. Bamlett, and you, Mr. Gustafson, for being extremely helpful and constructive in this process.  Internal Affairs meeting, we had, we must have had 20 or 25 people there.  At least.  And so I think we ended up in a good spot.  There are five amendments I would like to make at the appropriate time.  But maybe we should hear from our speakers first.  All right.  Questions from Mr. Gustafson and Mr. Vandoverbeek.  I just would say before the public comes and speaks, I think it's helpful for them to know what's proposed up here.  So we have the Internal Affairs recommendation, but you're saying you want to propose amendments to that.  Well, I had some input after the meeting.  And then also there were some things.  I think we weren't clear.  I mean, there's 121 action items in this, and we discussed maybe 30 of them.  Yeah.  We had great discussion.  I want to thank my fellow members for being so helpful.  Okay.  So I think the five changes are first in 2F, which says enforce tree pruning best management practices.  I would like to change the word enforce to encourage.  2F.  Thank you.  Encourage.  Pre-tree pruning best management practices.  That's the first one.  The second one is 3B, which is plant 500 street trees annually.  I would like to add the words if feasible at the beginning, plant 500 street trees annually.  The one item that was unclear and was left up in the air is 5L, which was to explore the development of a private,  tree ordinance to protect trees on private property not associated with development.  I think that we should strike that.  I am not in favor of increasing regulation for private property owners,  and we don't have a problem with private property owners wantonly assassinating trees in Chico.  So I would like to strike that.  And then 5R and S.  5R is coordinate with stormwater managers.  5S is coordinate with floodplain managers.  And I would like to insert the words city staff to coordinate with stormwater managers to take the burden off developers and city staff to coordinate with floodplain managers.  I think Mr. Gustafson, we've discussed these right.  None of these are a surprise to you.  Correct.  Okay.  So the four of them are minor.  5L is significant.  And but that was left in the air at the internal affairs meeting.  To the left.  Those are my five.  Yeah.  And thanks for bringing this out.  I guess maybe one question on that.  I was pretty satisfied with the outcome of the internal affairs committee meeting.  I will be honest.  I left the meeting here when it was referred there thinking like, oh, my God, and my colleagues about to try to chop up our urban forest master plan and eliminate the future of trees in Chico.  And I was glad that we were able to discuss some of the things and hear some of the opposition.  And then kind of it's like, well, come to some good conclusions.  I thought they were good compromises.  I was happy with the results.  But I felt like it was it was productive.  I'm sad you think we would do that.  No comment.  On 5L, Mr. Gustafson, the private tree ordinance.  Now, I think when you think about a private tree ordinance, people are assuming like your backyard residential area.  But I was thinking more in terms of the large private landowners like Cow Water and PG&E, that those would be the ones who might be abusing.  It's easier for them.  I think it's easier for them to take out some trees.  So I wonder if we do we do we have issues with private property owners, be they utility providers or others taking out trees like wantonly.  And is there a need for a private tree ordinance to protect some of those trees sometimes?  That's a great comment.  We don't typically have problems with our utility partners.  I mean, they have utility easements that they're able to remove trees or prune trees for safety related items.  And they work they work well with us.  Sometimes there's a bit of a problem.  We have a back and forth between urban forest manager Richie Bamlett and those utilities on how far the pruning goes or do you need to remove this tree or that tree?  Can we work to save some canopy?  And they work well with us on that, Adam.  At this point, there's no regulation or ordinance that governs or regulates for that matter private trees.  So we're just basically as it stands now, we regulate city trees with exception of development.  If you're going to develop a 10,000 square foot lot or greater, you're going to have to have a lot of trees.  No matter on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on  Per the California Public Utilities Commission, there's some pretty stringent regulations that they have authority over their utility easements to make sure that they're safe and operable as they desire.  If PG&E tried to remove a bunch of trees in Oroville, it didn't go very well, if you remember.  Well, in the interest of salvaging some of what I think this was the outcome of community input,  I think there's some demonstrated need that it would help for us achieving our goals for forest canopy to not just consider public property,  but at least have some possible mechanism in the future to expand that to at least some areas of private property.  And I wonder if in the interest of salvaging that input and the meaning that's put in there,  if we could have an amendment to this to say, for example, work to protect trees on private property not associated with development without referencing a private tree ordinance.  I don't want any infringement on the rights of private property owners to do what they want to do on their property.  And I haven't talked to anybody who doesn't think trees are a great idea and that they enhance the value of their property.  And they're a great thing to have at this time.  I'm glad you and your friends think so.  So was that an ask for a...  It was an ask, but...  Yeah, we haven't made a motion because we haven't heard public question.  So why don't we...  Can we move on with public testimony?  Unless you have something.  Yeah, that's good.  Okay.  So let's do that.  How many speakers do we have?  We have six.  All right.  Three minutes.  All right.  And again, I'll call the first two.  And if you can go ahead and line up.  Vicki Needoth, followed by Bill Webb.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thanks for listening.  I urge the council to approve the urban forest plan.  Working with business owners and developers to increase planting and maintaining trees helps the city.  It has been proof that businesses that are providing shade have increased sales volume.  Our city's sales tax revenue increases provide benefits for all of Chico.  The plan also...  It's a side money for the care of walnut trees on the city property.  Many of these trees are older than most of us here tonight.  Those trees have been providing shade for all of us for all our lives, but have been underserved for years.  They need the extra care this plan provides.  In the past, I've gotten a permit from the city so that I could personally pay a tree trimming company to do the work on a huge city-owned property.  I was told the city didn't have the money to do the work, and that they were too busy taking care of Goodwill Park.  This grant and plan provides the money needed, and I can instead donate that money to buy more trees for the city to plant where it's needed.  Please pass this.  Bill Webb, followed by Miranda.  Good evening, council.  I'm going to disagree with Addison.  I don't think we're the opposition.  I think we all value trees.  I mean, it adds value to our properties.  I mean, who doesn't like Goodwill Park, right?  So with that, what we do oppose is the added language, or not the added language, the action items in the plan that will add further regulation to development.  I'm going to make it more complex.  I'm going to make it more costly.  When we take a vacant site, whether you're building a retail site...  A retail site, a commercial, or maybe a single-family development, there's rules and regulations we have to follow.  We have a robust tree ordinance that works when it's followed.  When it's enforced by the city and the developer follows the tree ordinance, you will find those parking lots around town, those developments around town that meet our shade canopy, the goal of 40%.  In the draft or in the document, it states that residential across Chico has about a 45% shade canopy.  Okay.  So...  Tom's made his amendments.  I would like you guys to add one to that, and that's 5E.  5E, abolish the language that reads residential shall have...  Let me just read it to you.  Update the standards for new residential development to encourage, that's the new verbiage, a tree planting plan that will lead to 40% canopy cover.  I think that's going to be hard to do, if not impossible, when you're talking about...  single-family development.  When we develop the homes, we sell them now, they're individual private property.  We have no control over what goes on in the backyard.  We have no control over what goes on in the front yard.  Only control we have is the park strip.  I don't think you'll be able to manage that or enforce it.  The rest of this document, with some of the private property rights, would be able to control that, would encourage people to plant trees in their backyard.  But we have no say in that.  So let's do away with 5E.  I think...  Tom's addressed 5R and S.  I would also add U and V, W, whatever other letters in the alphabet there, to that list.  But that's what I have.  We're not opposed to trees, just no more regulation to development.  It's too complex as it is.  The city has to abide by their MS4 permit.  That's their permit with the Department of Water Resources, I think, on a five-year basis.  We have post-construction standards.  If you build a commercial facility, you have to go back annually and fill out an audit report to show that things are working.  Trees are part of that equation, albeit minimal.  If you want to encourage staff to do something good, go back to the state and see if we can get more bang for our dollar by planting trees.  That's it.  Miranda, followed by Susan Tachuti.  Hi.  My name is Miranda Krakowska, and I work for BEC, the Environmental Council.  I have to say that Chico is a city of trees.  The citizens of Chico take pride in this fact.  It only makes sense that the city have an urban forest master plan, a plan that provides a pathway and direction for protecting, maintaining, sustaining, and growing the most precious of resources.  Richie Bamlett, Chico's urban forester, and Eric Gustafson.  I am the urban forester, and I am the urban forester's public works director.  I have done an excellent job preparing a plan for the council, one that, as you know, was sent back to the Internal Affairs Committee for revisions.  There are those who claim this plan will place a financial burden on the budget.  It should be noted that trees planted in Chico are not funded from the general fund, but from grants and developer fees.  There are also those who claim it will bring more.  It is important to note that this plan is a community agreement, and because of the work of city staff, a tremendous amount of community input has informed the draft before you.  Our citizens care deeply about the city's trees, and for good reason.  And there is no question that a majority of Chico residents want our trees protected and want to see more trees in Chico.  This plan has an overriding goal of increasing the canopy overgrowth.  The overall tree value of Chico is between 36-40%, only 4%.  From the surveys done for this plan, 72% view trees as equally important as other city-maintained infrastructure.  97% believe trees contribute to their quality of life.  The general safety plan element goal 5-9's purpose is to protect the community from risks posed by climate change,  and promote public safety through the development of climate adaptation,  adaptation and resiliency to reduce risk associated with climate change. In a warming climate, trees provide shade and cooling.  They hold water and sequester carbon, offsetting the unhealthy effects of climate change.  Trees provide aesthetic value and our urban forest attracts people from all over the world. In the face of a continuing effects of climate change  to  include significant projected increases in intense heat days,  implementation of this plan is the reasonable action to take. Chico citizens voted to approve  Measure H and projections for those funds in the next year range from 22 to 24 million.  And while Chico has needs in terms of road improvement and safety, it would be prudent to divert a portion of funds to the maintenance  and health. Thank you.  Okay, Susan Tichutti followed by Robin McCullen.  Good evening, we all love trees.  That's good news, right?  I read the whole urban forest plan and  one of the things that or the thing that impresses me most is how  thoughtful, detailed,  professional, complete,  anticipating what's going to happen in the future as well as thinking about what we need right now for our trees.  One of the things that impressed me was that  there's often a cry for we need to have native plants, but we also need to know what our climate is like now and what it's going to be in the future.  And the urban forest plan  accommodates all of that, looks at all of that, takes all of that into consideration.  The urban forester should be given whatever support he needs in order to fulfill this plan and I urge you to pass it.  So Robin McCollum followed by Pat Conroy.  No one's on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on  plan it is not it is not basically an overreach or regulation its guidance for  for continuing a successful management of the urban forest trees the the city  has liability for the maintenance of their trees just because they're cited  in the right of way and this this is important to consider that then we  follow through with proper trimming reasonable trimming cycles things like  site distance clearance at the intersection so we don't have accidents  happening because of destruction of view and so on I'm going to skip some parts  of what I had  to  you  said other than to go back a little bit to the the plan was formed with outreach  and inclusion people were invited to come some did not some many did as much  as could be it reflects the the interests of the community at large yet  it is still an adaptive management plan and it will be implemented in you know  individual actions along the way that will have to be approved by the council in  almost all cases if it rises to your interest so I you know I encourage you to pass the plan  it's a foundational structure for the for the city to be efficient now I do have a question for Tom  that came up and I wasn't able to access the the redlined items property I think you said for F regarding  requiring standards  for  for !  on private, where was that?  No.  That was 2F, which I'm going to read it to you.  Yes, please.  Yeah, it says, hang on, let me find it here.  By the way, thanks for your input on all this.  Bear with me here.  Let me, just to save time, Tom, thank you anyway.  Just let me state generally that we should, especially with the city trees,  there really should be no standard except professional ISA-approved trimming standards.  This is based in science.  If you're not working with the science of trees, you're going to be doing more harm than good in the long run.  Those things can, if you want to remove a tree, you can fudge on what the standards are.  But if you're going to try and maintain that thing safely and in good health to serve the community,  you need to uphold ISA standards.  And that is.  That is the practice and understanding of all arborists.  Thank you.  Okay, thank you.  Okay, our last.  Mr. Mayor, can I just respond real quickly?  Let's hold the responses until the end.  It's better not to have banter back and forth during.  Yeah, okay.  Of the comment.  Our last speaker is Pat Conroy.  My name is Pat Conroy.  I'm a local builder.  And we wrote a letter.  The CBI, the Chico Builders Association, has given you a letter.  On items that we still think are a financial burden that I don't think we want to see go and stay in this report.  We think the urban master plan, it puts a huge financial burden on the city of Chico,  as well as place undue restrictions on private homeowners and the development in the building community.  And I wanted to point out to you as someone that worked.  With this tree ordinance for years.  I want everybody to know it's a really good, well-written plan.  I think it's very effective already.  I don't think it needs a lot of tweaking.  I don't think we need to just keep putting more burdens on homeowners.  But it works really well.  I've been working with it for years with a whole bunch of different urban foresters.  And I think it's really effective.  And there's also, I'd like to point out that last time this thing was updated,  there was a huge public outcry from homeowners who were adamant that they did not want the city  telling them what they could or can't do with their trees in their front yard and in their backyard.  There was a lot of letters to the editors.  There's a lot of people at this podium.  People don't want people, the city telling them what to do with their trees.  And there's still some items in here that aren't specific as far as,  is it a requirement for a commercial landowner or a private homeowner?  So it needs to be tweaked a little bit to make sure that what you're trying to do to the commercial landowner,  which is very, it's needed.  It should not apply to a homeowner.  I agree with everybody that said 5E should go away.  5L should go away.  5R through U should go away.  I think 2A should go away.  It says that parking lot shade is inadequate.  Our parking lot shade requirement is 50% of shade coverage in 15 years for a parking lot.  That's adequate.  I don't see how we could do it anymore.  It's maxed.  Somebody's already maxed it.  To add more shade to a parking lot, all the cars are completely shaded.  That's not.  Okay.  Thank you.  All right.  Discussion.  Yeah, go ahead, Mr. Randall.  Yeah, Mr. McCollum, I finally found 2F.  So 2F says now,  enforce tree pruning best management practices on private commercial parking lots  that are a requirement of development.  And the amendment I proposed was to change the word enforce to encourage.  So I don't think anybody that's invested in a tree in a commercial parking lot  is going to want to damage the tree.  They're going to make sure those trees are preserved and thrive.  But I don't like the word enforce.  Should I agree?  No.  No.  Yeah.  That's not engagement with the public.  And he answered the question.  So yeah, we want to hear from you, but we don't want to encourage that back and forth.  All right.  Further discussion.  Okay.  That's all from Council Member Van Overbeek.  Motion.  Thank you.  I would like to say something.  Yeah, absolutely.  Mr. Randall.  So I don't know if this is maybe being older and more mature,  but additional, and I'm going to say,  I'm going to use the additional rules and regulations on private property owners,  I think should be avoided at all costs.  And that's just my personal belief.  It's just government is there.  I think the government, especially Chico, I know, Eric, you've done a great job with this master plan.  And so has Richie.  I think it's great.  It's a great set of guidelines for us to follow.  But when it gets to be on private property, and I'm thinking residential,  that's where I need to shy away from this.  And I have had conversations with Eric about that.  So I'm going to ask that.  Okay.  So, for the following to be struck, 5E, which is a private property issue, 5L,  and 7F was skipped for some reason.  And that goes back to private property as well.  It's the enforcement.  Let me get to it in just a second.  Do you want to make this as a motion?  Yes.  Okay.  Pardon me?  Do you want to make this as a motion?  Because there has not been a motion as of yet.  I will.  Okay.  Okay.  7F is ensure the city's continued funding to create a staff position or on-call contract  for a certified arborist to effectively manage and implement planning policies  on private property including code enforcement, site plan review, and post-installation inspection.  So it all, to me, it all, all three of those wrap up.  So I'm going to ask that, uh, into one particular concern of mine, which is private property.  And I'd like to be, I, I am making a motion that they be struck.  Ready?  All right.  So, so this, so we, so we have that motion.  Do we?  Yeah.  Hang on.  Does someone want to second that?  I'm fine if you don't.  Give me those five L's.  It was 7F.  5E.  So does that include the private property?  Does that include the, the proposed changes?  Pardon me?  Does that include also the proposed changes from Councilmember Van Overbeek?  It does.  Yes.  Okay.  So 2F, 3D, FL, L, 5R, and 5S.  We have the Internal Affairs Committee recommendations.  Then we have the Tom additional recommendation on top.  And now we have the Dale recommendations on top, the Tom on top, the Internal Affairs  Committee recommendations.  That's where we're at?  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  Well, the, the goal of the Urban Forest Master Plan is very clearly laid out.  It's 40% tree canopy.  Um, and then we have the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the,  um, after 2065 it's, it's years out to increase from 36% where we're at to, to 40%.  Um, so when we start to look at these particular actions that are put in place in order to  achieve this goal and we're rolling these back, we're no longer looking at a realistic  goal to meet 40% tree canopy.  We may as well cut the goal out.  We could say it's a plan for 39% tree canopy or 36 or, you know, 36.5.  Maybe that's what we're going to get with all of this.  But, you know, when you look at striking a, a, a, a action that says encourage a tree  plant.  encouraged. That's already, I want to use the word watered down, but it's like compacted the roots  of the plan already. We're just encouraging a tree planning plan and residential developments  that will lead to 40% canopy, what we want overall citywide. Now, it's like quiz on Chico land use,  like look at a zoning map. What's the vast majority of land in Chico? It's single family  residential. So if we're not able to meet 40% on single family residential, what are we left with?  If you also read the plan and you see the input, it's that we lack tree canopy in the commercial  parking lots. There's vast areas we have in like District 6, why it comes out when you  split it up by city council district, that there's less canopy there because these vast parking lots,  they don't have enough shade. And so when we're talking about enforcing our ordinance,  because we've had this ordinance on the books that you get 50% tree cover after 15 years,  and it hasn't always been working because the best practices have not been implemented. And  you can see pictures, you can walk around.  If you're not able to see the tree cover, you can walk around and you can see the tree cover.  If you don't know Chico, you know there are certain parking lots where the trees did not  develop. And there are reasons why that's the case. And there are reasons we can identify  in this plan, some of these actions in here asking us to go and address those issues so that we no  longer like fail to meet the goal that is the intention of the ordinance we've had since the  1980s. Yeah, he made a motion. And I believe you, did we have a second on that? I don't have a  second.  I have a second.  I wasn't finished.  Madam Clerk, may I clarify?  Let Mr. Winslow finish.  Yeah, we're going to restart at 3 o'clock, I guess, at a certain point, right?  We're not.  So we can't maintain this goal and cut away these policies. That's one. I think that taking away  the encouragement to have a tree planting plan that would lead to 40% tree canopy,  that's ridiculous. We're no longer like operating this plan. So another one, 2F,  is from enforced to encourage tree pruning that would be best practices. We're talking about  commercial parking lots here. You can see where the best practices have not been implemented. So  requiring it would just be to follow through the intention of the original ordinance we've had  since the 1980s. Is it adequate to, are we getting enough trees because people love trees,  that we don't require regulations? Or have we done this without regulations? It's obviously false.  If you know Chico, you know that there are some regulations that are not required. So,  there are certain parking lots, there are certain areas that very much lack tree cover,  and there are others that have very good tree cover. And the only factor that distinguishes them  is whether the City of Chico had their tree ordinance in place and whether it was developed  when it was annexed by the City. So when we did not have the regulations, we do not get  the tree canopy that we're looking for. And those areas, those are miserable areas. Nobody  wants to live there. I don't know if you can see it as a financial burden.  Point of order, we're past three minutes. And I have, I have, Mr. Mann, over.  With interruptions, so you can hang out with interruptions.  This is the end of my comment. I think that what is being proposed here is...  No, I'm not interrupting. You are violating our rules and playing to your audience.  So, we're playing to my audience. We're talking about a master plan. We already went through a...  Gentlemen, come on.  Now we're in a hearing. We're discussing more policies. It's too complicated to get...  His original, his original statement was interrupted and he did not have all his three minutes.  Does that mean he gets a whole other three minutes? No, it doesn't. But at the same time,  should we not interrupt him? No, we shouldn't.  No. No. No.  No. No. No.  No. No. No.  No. No. No.  No. No. No.  No. No. No.  we're on a time frame here.  So, yes.  May I please make a substitute motion?  Please.  The reason for the back and forth,  this is bad policy.  We had no problem approving the budget,  but we can't agree,  cannot agree on how to do something  that we already do well.  We have 36% coverage now.  We're actually doing a great job, right?  And I want to see it get better.  And I appreciate the comments  about how wonderful this report is  and all this stuff,  and I think that's absolutely false.  I don't know how many different action items  and how many different pages.  Nobody can follow this.  So we send it to IA.  IA makes some changes.  It comes back.  And then someone that's on IA  makes some more changes,  and somebody else makes some more changes.  There's no way we can vote on this  and have any idea what it looks like.  So any vote for this tonight,  other than sending it back to IA  and saying, make this clean,  is us agreeing.  Too bad policy.  So my motion is to send it back to IA,  work this out,  and bring it back in a form  that we all can support it.  I'll second that.  All right.  We have a substitute motion and a second,  but I'd like to ask our city manager a question.  In terms of timeline  and bringing this back before council,  I was told there wasn't a timeline.  That's an Eric question.  I believe that's the case.  I believe we had an extension on the grant through May.  Correct, through May.  And if we get,  if we get into the state's fiscal year,  then the last portion of this reimbursement cost  is about $50,000.  So that's the kind of the dollar figure  that's on the table for this.  So I'll follow up my motion with,  I would rather give the money back  than adopt that policy.  I know that's not what you're...  I understand.  And I think,  I will add that I,  you know,  we may be looking,  this is just a,  this is just a plan.  It's a master plan.  It's something that,  it's a guidance.  It's going to help us  garner grant funds.  It's going to help us  in the future  to do maintenance-related items  that we're really after.  That was the big intent for us  and a big component for us.  It's not a regulation.  It's just a guidance  that we could look and pick and choose from.  And I,  you know,  looking at some of these items,  7F and 7H,  for example,  you know,  7H is,  we're doing that already  and Shuri City Arborist  is directly involved  in reviewing new developments  and so on and so forth.  That's Richie's job.  So some of these  are just emboldening  what we're doing already.  So I'm just,  I'm just cautioning  that it's not,  as bad as it might look  and I think we might get  a little wrapped up  that it's this new regulation  coming down.  So some of these,  it's not.  It's just an idea.  It's a plan,  a guidance document  that will help us,  you know,  move forward.  But I want everybody  to be comfortable with this.  I thought we had a very good,  very robust,  well-attended  internal affairs meeting.  The committee members  did an excellent job  discussing this  and we had it pretty  well-polished moving forward.  I understand a couple  of additions here and there  and I,  if,  the preference would be  if we could make those additions  and adopt it,  great.  But I want everybody  to be comfortable  with it too.  So I'm sympathetic to that  or I'm sensitive to that as well.  I appreciate that  but I still have the floor.  Is the challenge  when we say  the urban forest master plan  is like when we talk  about the general plan  and whenever we do anything  that has anything to do  with the general plan,  it's like God came down  with his tablets  and handed them to the mayor  and said,  this is how it will be.  And people come and say,  no,  this is the general plan.  We must do this.  It's an ordinance.  It's a this,  it's a that.  As soon as you put  urban forest master plan,  if this doesn't happen,  some of the people  that think this is all  idle,  I love trees  versus I hate trees,  which is ridiculous.  It's not ready.  And if we can get it cleaner  so we can agree on it,  I'm all for it.  There's also a hybrid  and I'll look to Eric  for workability.  That's to approve  the IA version  and then send it back  to IA for further refinement.  Okay,  that'll be my substitute motion.  Okay,  so we have a substitute motion  on the floor  that we need to address  and then now  you're making  another one?  Yes.  Okay.  That's the max  substitute motion.  You can have three.  So his substitute motion  needs a second.  Yes.  So my substitute  motion is  the city manager's  recommendation  to pass this  and send it back  to IA for refit.  Well,  I second that.  Question,  point of clarification.  Staff's recommendation  is to approve  the internal affairs  committee recommendations.  This is an idea  you're throwing out.  It's not necessarily  a recommendation, right?  Yeah.  It's some way  of resolving  the log jam.  Right.  To cross the final box  in the grant,  we need to have  this master plan.  So box checked.  Does that prevent  council from  editing this document  in the future?  No.  Yes,  we'll send it back  to IA.  We'll approve it  and send it back  to IA for refit.  Okay,  then I call the question  on your substitute  to the substitute.  Okay.  If you could procedurally  support another  substitute motion,  I would ask  to just approve  the IA recommendations,  but we can't.  Yeah,  we only have  two substitute motions.  Okay,  so did you get  a second on that?  Yes.  And who was that?  Tom.  No.  Ms. Brando.  Okay.  Just so the audience  can understand  what just happened,  that the substitute motion  is to approve  the recommendations  as proposed.  That's before you  right now.  And to send  the remaining questions  back to IAC  for further discussion.  Is that correct?  Hear, hear.  Hello.  Was it the remaining  questions or the entire document?  Or the whole document.  The whole document  with those other ideas  that were contained  in the prior  or original motion.  Perfect.  Okay.  Council Member Bennett.  Yes.  Council Member Morgan.  Yes.  Council Member Tandon.  Yes.  Council Member Van Overbeek.  Yes.  Council Member Winslow.  No.  Vice Mayor Reynolds.  Yes.  Mayor Coolidge.  Aye.  Carries 6-1.  All right.  Okay.  All right.  5-2.  We actually,  at the beginning of the meeting,  noticed that that was not  going to be discussed right now,  so we move on to item 5.3,  consideration of approval  of supplemental appropriation  budget modification.  Mr. Otto,  the public works director  of engineering.  There he is.  Ready to go.  Yes.  Fire away.  Good evening,  Mayor, Vice Mayor,  and City Council.  Item 5.3 before you tonight  is a supplemental appropriation  to allocate the budget  to $4 million  of the Measure H funds  for roadway maintenance projects.  I wasn't here,  but it's my understanding,  I believe this came forward  March 7th.  For consideration,  there's some council discussion  and direction for staff  to bring it back.  So essentially,  what is different with this  allocation,  supplemental appropriation request,  in lieu of the Amber Grove neighborhood,  we are recommending  a similar slurry seal  in the area,  basically along Park Avenue  between 12th and 20th Streets.  That was already pretty much  designed and ready to go  as part of the Park Avenue  road rehab project,  but due to funding constraints  at that time,  we had pulled it out.  So it was a good option  to utilize this opportunity  to put that in place  of the concerns brought forward.  I'll add that  from a road maintenance standpoint,  based on previous  pavement management program,  we have a lot of  We don't always take  a worse first approach  with roadway maintenance.  Given this funding,  we're in May already,  about to embark  on the construction season.  Slurry seal applications  are the most appropriate.  We can get to them.  It doesn't require any engineering.  And we can advertise that,  package it,  and hopefully get it done  this fall before the winter hits  and the temperatures are adequate  for performing the slurry seal application.  Another component of the supplemental  also is transferring some money  as well.  So we're going to be  from the Lower Park Road Rehab  to the Upper Park Road Rehab  to combine that  with some O&M funds  to get that done  as well this summer.  That concludes my report.  I'm available  for any questions.  All right.  Question?  I have a quick one  if no one else has.  Do it.  Do it quickly.  So Lower Park Road  is still being considered  with grant funds, correct?  It's still being considered  with for next year's project.  That's a more intensive project.  And at this point in time of year,  we want to be able  to get that out.  So the intention is  to utilize the measure H funds  for next year.  Okay.  Perfect.  All right.  Other questions?  Mr. Winslow?  Just some points of clarification.  One is,  if I remember correctly,  we did approve the other projects  besides the Amber Grove neighborhood.  So the other one is  I just now realized  that when you say  Mulberry Street neighborhood,  you don't mean  the named Mulberry neighborhood  which is where Mulberry  turns into Fair Street  on the other side  of East 20th.  It was just Amber Grove.  And that's been the long-term name for it.  And then this area  is in the Southwest Chico neighborhood plan.  But some people live there  and call it Chapman Town  and they're wrong.  I just now realized that.  But I will say,  we have a couple comments to take  before I say anything else.  That was it.  Thanks.  I just realized  that I am not supposed  to be listening to this  because I have a rental on 12th.  So I didn't exit.  All right.  Madam Clerk,  do we have any speakers?  I think we have a few.  None.  Okay.  We're done.  You might want to come back up  just in case.  Just in case.  Okay.  I just got a little bit of,  I mean,  I think that it's great  that we had the discussion  that we had  and we were able to make use  of funds based on values  besides just like city-wide PCI,  what it can look like.  And when it comes to some of the things  that I mentioned  of like new development value,  is there new development going on?  Is this going to support  some like increase  in tax revenue  and are the new people  going to be housed there?  Is there a real need  for that as a result of the spending?  And I,  the Mulberry neighborhood,  when I thought it was that,  I thought there would be more  of that going on.  Well,  this area does have,  probably have more like ADUs  under construction  or some bits than other areas.  When it comes to transportation value,  it being on a grid,  this has a lot more value to people.  I bike through there all the time.  I have friends that live there  and other places  and frequently pass through the area  as opposed to the Ann Arbor Grove neighborhood,  which has a lot of dead-end streets.  And it's,  I think,  unfortunate that we've developed  in such a way.  And I do hope  that they get their slurries  and their things  and they'll be able to seal  at a certain point.  But overall,  I think it's great  that we're at this point  of having this,  shifting these funds  into an area  where there's a lot of,  a lot of lower-income people  and where the streets  are better shared.  And we can approve this.  So I motion to approve  the recommendations.  Mr. Alderweirecht,  hold on one sec.  So,  14th Street?  Correct.  Yes.  So,  do you know  where Topeka's business is?  It's on the other side  of Park Avenue.  I have to speak  to the question  because she's actually  on vacation.  No,  she's on the other side  of Park.  So it should be fine.  Yeah,  it's opposite.  It's on the east side  of Park Avenue.  Oh,  Barber and Apewood.  Yeah.  I just wanted to make sure  Chapman versus Barber.  It could be  within 500 feet.  500 feet.  When in doubt?  When in doubt?  There we go.  All right.  Thank you.  Keeps an odd number.  Yeah.  Mr. Wenzel,  did you make a motion?  Yes.  Second.  Did you second it?  No,  I'll second it.  No.  He did second it.  Okay.  We have a motion and a second.  Let's call the roll.  It's a long day,  Sean.  It's when it started,  right?  Okay.  Council Member Bennett.  Yes.  Council Member Morgan.  Yes.  Council Member Tannen  is disqualified.  Council Member  Morgan is not.  Council Member Van Overbeek.  Yes.  Council Member Winslow.  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds is disqualified.  Mayor Coolidge.  Aye.  Carries five with two recusals.  Yeah.  There we go.  All right.  Bring them back.  Okay.  Next one's yours,  too.  Right?  Yes.  Okay.  Yes.  Next one is yours,  as well.  It is.  There we go.  Yes.  Fire away.  Should go quickly.  Wait for the  They're coming.  They're coming.  All right.  Item 5.4 is another supplemental appropriation.  So, again, having been back now for a month, one thing, one of my first efforts was making  sure I got into our capital funding and updated with where we stand on things, especially  as projects get closer to construction.  So, I've had a couple projects.  Obviously, BID mentioned earlier in the budget presentation with Bruce Road.  Prior to understanding that, I actually found a shortfall in funding to meet the funding  needs for our engineer's estimate of $25.5 million.  So, as a part of that, this request includes transferring $3.5 million from the Notre Dame  Bridge project to Bruce Road to make that fund fully funded previously, if that makes  sense.  And then the intention with removing that funding from the Notre Dame Bridge, which  is within the Merion Park subdivision, is that's our top candidate for the CDBG-DR infrastructure  grant program that we have a $12 million allocation for.  So, by freeing that up, we still intend on building that project just with grant funds.  The other project is the Bikeway 99 Phase 5 project, falling short on funding there.  So, we've had some additional commitments from the City of Toronto.  We've had some additional commitments from CMAC funding, which is a federal fund through  BCAG, as well as coming to the table with additional TDA funds.  So, that'll make that fully funded and be able to put that back out to bid.  And then the last one is a $900,000 transfer from the public infrastructure fund to the  Cohasset Road project.  We've had some additional change orders that were not anticipated and some claims from  the contractor.  So, this will give us adequate funding to close out the project here in the next month  or so.  That concludes my report.  I'm available for any questions.  Questions?  I just have one quick question.  Somebody said that this Bruce Road widening has to be done in order for Merriam Park to  continue to develop on that back piece.  Is that correct or not?  That is not correct.  Okay.  So, that's okay.  Thank you.  Yep.  All right.  Further questions?  Thank you.  Second.  No, no.  Okay.  No public comment.  No, no.  There was none.  So, who was the—who made the motion?  Mr. Morgan.  Thank you.  And the second was?  Topeka?  What's it?  Yes.  Okay.  Okay.  I just—  Councilmember Bennett?  Yes.  Councilmember Morgan?  Yes.  Councilmember Tandon?  Yes.  Councilmember Van Overbeek?  Yes.  Councilmember Winslow?  I would not have approved the funds initially or gone for the grants to widen roads in the  end of town.  I would not have approved the funds initially or gone for the grants to widen roads in the  end of town.  But we're so far along with this now that I'll vote yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds?  Yes.  Mayor Coolidge?  I'm going to say the same thing when it comes to the 99 bike path.  So, aye.  So, is that an aye?  Yes.  Okay.  Thank you.  7-0.  All right.  All right.  Item 5.5, Senate Bill 43 and 363, changes to the California Behavioral Health System.  And we have a report from City Attorney Vince Ewing.  Thank you, Mayor Coolidge.  Mayor Coolidge, members of the Council, at your recent meeting on April 18th of this  year, you asked, pursuant to Councilmember Tandon's request, that I analyze the Senate  Bills 43 and 363.  I've completed that analysis.  I provided to you a written document regarding that analysis and two letters of support from  the City Council for the Mayor's signature.  In brief, the...  Senate Bill 43 changes some of the definitions in that...in the statute, namely the definition  of gravely disabled.  And its proponents believe that it will allow persons working in the behavioral health system  to have more tools available to them to assist persons who suffer from mental illness.  The second Senate Bill, 363, provides for a database that will allow persons who work  in the behavioral...behavioral health system to have more tools available to them to assist  persons who suffer from mental illness.  in the behavioral health system to access...to provide...or to provide information about  available facilities depending on the diagnosis of the person whom they've encountered.  So the person may have dual diagnosis, such as mental illness and drug addiction, or they  may have only drug addiction or other diagnosis types, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder,  and so forth.  So with the letters that you have before you for your consideration, you would be...you  would be supporting the amendments to these...to the sections of the Welfare and Institutions  Code, and that is set forth in the letters, and the amendments would be to the Senate  Bills 43 and 363.  That concludes my report, and I'm available for quick questions only.  Questions?  I always wanted to say that.  Wow.  Does that mean just yes or no?  I've never heard an attorney say that.  Yeah, I don't know if I have a particular question, but I'm going to ask you a question.  I'm going to ask you a question that I could expect you to have the answer to.  When we provided direction to come back with the report, what I was hoping to hear, because  that was the question in my mind, is everybody in Chico...would everybody in Chico who is  unable to find appropriate shelter qualify to be involuntarily detained under this?  And do you have an answer to that?  Yeah, I do.  And no, that's not how assessments would work, even with this...if the bill...if the Welfare  and Institutions Code were amended under Senate Bill 43...  Again, the definition of gravely disabled would be amended and expanded.  The assessment process would be very similar, and that is the behavioral health of professional  social workers and mental health workers, psychiatrists, therapists, as well as sometimes  first contact people, such as law enforcement or other people, would provide...they'd have  an expanded definition of gravely disabled.  So the specter of someone just saying, hey, I'm disabled.  Hey, that person's mentally ill.  You should lock them up.  That's not likely to happen.  I can't predict the future, but I don't see the changing in the definition to allow a  social worker or a mental health professional, psychiatrist, or an MD to somehow flout what's  required by the statute.  They still have to meet the definition of gravely disabled.  What this expanded definition does, practically speaking, is when you have an assessment and  when you have an assessment of a person using the 5150 standard and the Welfare and Institutions  Code, for example, what you have is you consider whether the person is a danger to themselves,  to others, or unable to take care of themselves in such a way that they need to be committed  for a period of time.  This broadened definition would provide more...would broaden the definition of circumstances by  which a person might be involuntarily detained.  Okay.  To assess their situation and try to render aid to them at that time.  So I don't foresee, based on my analysis, the expanded definition creating a system  where people would be involuntarily locked up by either their loved ones or persons just  on the street identifying them as mentally ill.  Right.  It seems like it's not an entirely clear, defined cutoff point as to who would qualify.  And I can imagine a lot of morally confusing cases going on.  That's a great concern of mine that people would be...just lose their personal autonomy  in the interest of society.  We don't want these people here.  And generally, we can say that.  I don't think that's a good path for us to go down.  So my understanding of it is an incredibly high threshold.  Do we have any speakers?  No.  All right.  There is one.  Entertain motion.  Oh, wait.  There is one.  There is one.  James Hutchinson.  All right.  Sorry.  Good to ruin your evening.  Anybody that's looked at that bill recently knows it's currently what's called suspended,  which means it's sitting there waiting to be determined whether or not there's going  to be funding available in the upcoming governor's budget.  We all know they're cutting...they have an increased debt of over $10 billion more that  So there's a chance of this happening...this bill actually happening and being enforced  properly.  Probably null and void.  It won't happen.  But nevertheless, if you want to go ahead with it, what you're pushing here is whether  or not it's to be funded.  It's already general agreement for the Senate has passed it.  The assembly has passed.  They've all said fine.  But it's suspended right now, waiting to find out if the funding's going to be there to  appropriate it for.  And I would like you to consider that.  Okay.  If you're going to do a letter, it should be about whether or not it's going to be  funded.  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right.  Thank you.  Entertain a motion.  I'll make a motion.  Is there a second?  That was your motion.  That was my motion.  Second.  I have a motion and a second.  I'm out of court.  Okay.  Motion is seconded.  I have a motion to authorize the mayor to sign the letter of support.  Council Member Bennett?  Yes.  Council Member Morgan?  Yes.  Council Member Tandon?  Yes.  Council Member Van Overbeek?  Yes.  Council Member Winslow?  No.  Vice Mayor Reynolds?  Yes.  Mayor Coolidge?  Aye.  Carries 7, excuse me, 6-1.  All right.  Item 5.6 amendment to the City of Chico budget, appendices, B-1 and B-3.  Yes, please.  Welcome.  Thank you.  Good evening again, Mayor, Vice Mayor, members of the Council.  Before you tonight is something that I think is really positive news.  We are looking to convert two of our classifications, our caseworker A and our social caseworker  over from contractual services positions to full-time regular positions.  So it's three total positions, two job classifications.  These positions are currently out at the Pallet Shelter and they support the continuity  of care for the people coming into the Pallet Shelter.  So really solidifying their ability to have benefits and representation and everything  that comes with being a full-time regular employee with the City of Chico would be afforded  to these positions.  If we move forward.  I'm going to move them over to full-time regular.  There's approximately 15,000 in ongoing costs per year and I'm happy to answer any questions  that you might have.  All right.  Questions?  Thank you.  Speakers?  None.  Motion.  Move to approve.  Second.  We have a motion from Council Member Winslow, a second from Council Member Hannon.  Second.  Okay.  Council Member Bennett?  Yes.  Council Member Morgan?  Yes.  Council Member Tandon?  Yes.  Council Member Van Overbeek?  No.  Council Member Winslow?  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds?  No.  Mayor Coolidge?  Aye.  Carries 5-2.  All right.  Item 5.7, consideration of renaming the Chico Pallet Shelter.  Good evening, Mayor, Vice Mayor, members of the Council, Jennifer McCarthy, Deputy City  Manager.  I will be brief.  A year ago we opened the emergency non-congregate housing facility and it's been affectionately  known as the Chico Pallet Shelter since that time.  No official name has been in place.  The Jesus Center has put forward a couple of potential names for Council's consideration,  one being Thistle Ranch or Thistle Flat, the other being Genesis.  And tonight the Council is being asked to either consider one of those names, second  option, come up with your own name, or third option, do nothing.  And we will continue to call it the Chico Pallet Shelter.  Happy to answer any questions.  Questions?  So, I mean, the Jesus Center has done so much for us and to make this thing work.  Why don't they just come to us with a request?  I mean, I don't understand why they're asking us to name it.  They should have a name they want.  These are the names that they put forward, the two names they put forward, the Thistle  Flat or Thistle Ranch or Genesis.  Well, those are two names.  And they're asking us to decide.  They should have a name.  Let's see.  Let's get a comment.  Yeah.  Do we have any speakers?  We do.  Let me guess who.  Guess who.  We have two.  Hold on.  Hold on one second.  Oh, James Hutchinson is first, so go ahead.  And then Julie Threed, I don't know if she's still here.  She's not.  She is not.  So we have one.  Go ahead, James.  All right.  We'll do 45 minutes.  Okay.  So, we have two.  I think I can use a whole 45 minutes.  Thank you.  I'm sure.  I'm sure.  It's a lot easier than three minutes, I'll tell you that.  There you go.  No, the Pallet shelter, the Pallet concept starts with a company who forms on the idea  that we can take homeless people to develop emergency shelters that are easily assembled  and used by communities to help people get off the street.  It's an emergency shelter.  But the Pallet.com is a national program.  It is not just Chico.  Okay?  You go to the website.  I'm assuming you've been there, right?  You've looked at it, what they say there.  They lay out their program.  It's similar to what you people are using now, the goals you're setting for.  But it's also, it's an emergency thing.  It's not designed to be a long-term solution to anything, only a short-term transitional  situation.  I think we should let the people who run the Pallet program on a national level.  If you go to there, you can click on Chico and find out what's going on with the Chico  program.  You can look at Sonoma, who set record times of a few weeks getting over 60 shelters put  up and equipped and ready to go.  I mean, amazing little games, right?  But here's the deal.  I think you should include them if you're going to change the name because they're the  ones who set up the program.  They set up the ideas.  They provided you the information.  They provided you with the shelter.  Most of the people that built those shelters were homeless people.  A good portion of their staff were homeless people at one time or another, and they're  working on it.  You should acknowledge them and give them the recognition it is not just the Jesus Center  here.  We're involved in something larger than just little Chico.  So, I think you should include them.  Thank you.  All right.  Thank you very much.  And I have some comments.  No, Sean doesn't want to hear my thoughts, but I need to share my thoughts on this.  You can share your thoughts.  Okay.  But let's have someone else go first.  We have someone else down this way who wants to go first.  Mr. Brennan, you look like you want to say something.  Deputy city manager.  Yes, sir.  I'm going to go first.  The Jesus Center was requested to come forward with some of their recommendations for the  name, correct?  Yes, they came forward with the name.  Okay.  So, they did exactly what they were asked for?  That is correct.  And they did work with the people that live at the shelter as well.  So, it's all done.  Thank you.  So, if I had to pick one of the two, my opinion is I would go with three, technically.  Yeah, if I had to pick one of the two categories of names, then I would go with Genesis, reluctantly.  I don't think that we should be taking religious symbolism and put it into city infrastructure.  Ultimately, though, I would take a name, naming after anybody sitting here, or Bobby Warren, Corey Turner,  or come up with any number of names of people, Amber Bass, that I would name after before Thistle Ranch,  or Thistle Flat.  The reason being that thistle is an invasive species that people seek to eradicate from their areas.  And there's even a local legend that somebody, some say Annie Bidwell, spread thistle,  And there's even a, there's a local legend that somebody, some say Annie Bidwell, spread thistle  and ordered it to be used as a food for the  and ordered it to be used as a food for the  in order to discourage people from traveling around barefoot.  It was part of colonization and enclosing people.  I don't know that that's, you know, in the case of a true story.  It is true that star thistle is, I think, one of the few, I mean, actually, I believe this to be true.  You can pull it out anywhere because it is so undesired that you don't need any kind of permit or anything to get rid of it.  So, would we name the pallet shelter after something invasive that we're seeking to eradicate from our public spaces?  I would hope not, right, guys?  Cool.  So, anything but that is running out.  So, as usual, I am in complete agreement with Council Member Winslow,  and I move that we go with option number three and do nothing  and continue to call the pallet shelter the pallet shelter because that's what it is.  And trying to make it look nicer or dress it up with a name isn't going to change anything.  And the amount of time that staff and we have spent on this already is completely ridiculous.  That's emotional.  So, I would like to ask you to give us a motion.  Yes.  A second.  Okay.  We have a motion and a second.  Council Member Bennett?  No.  Council Member Morgan?  Yes.  Council Member Tandon?  No.  Council Member Van Overbeek?  No.  Council Member Winslow?  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds?  No.  Vice Mayor Koelig?  I just can't believe they're both on the...  I think you guys are all faking voting against...  Oh, no, no.  I would make a motion that we...  Well, Mayor Koelig, I'm sorry.  I didn't hear your vote.  That was a no.  That was a no.  Okay.  So it fails two to five.  Yeah.  Which is surprising at the five and two here.  I would make a motion that we go for the Jesus and His Choice of option number two of the  three that they gave us of Genesis.  I'll say it.  I have a motion.  Can you...  Can you...  Can we make a friendly amendment that we just say that the Jesus Center can pick,  and if they come up with something even better than that, then we'll go with that?  That was where they're suggesting.  They might have a response to the feedback.  What if it's something worse than a missile ranch?  Okay.  Yeah.  That's true.  It could be Blackberry Ranch or something, like another invasive with, you know.  With her?  I'm just saying.  Okay.  So there's a motion and a second for the name of Genesis.  Council Member Bennett.  Yes.  Council Member Morgan.  No.  Council Member Tandon.  Yes.  Council Member Van Overbeek.  Yes.  Council Member Winslow.  No.  Vice Mayor Reynolds.  Aye.  Mayor Coolidge.  No.  What would be his name?  It passes 4-3.  Genesis is hot, John.  I don't know if that's still on the end.  I don't know if that's still on the end.  I just really want to get rid of the word palette,  because I'm sick of people asking me that.  They're asking me if it's built from pallets.  It is something to see.  Yes.  It's completely missing.  All right.  Yeah.  The name of the pallet shelter is now Genesis.  All right.  Items posted after the agenda.  We have 50.  No.  None.  Reports and communications.  City Manager report.  No report.  No report.  Council Member requests.  Mr. Van Overbeek or Mr. Winslow.  Just kidding.  Just kidding.  No report on approval on approval on approval on approval on approval on approval on approval on approval on approval on approval on approval on approval on approval on approval on approval on approval on approval on approval on approval on approval on approval on approval on approval on approval on approval on approval on approval on approval on approval on approval on approval on approval on approval on approval on approval on approval on approval on approval on approval on approval on approval on approval on approval on approval on approval on approval on approval on approval on approval on approval on approval on approval on approval on approval on approval on approval on approval on approval on approval on approval on approval on approval on approval on approval on approval on approval on approval on approval on approval on approval on approval on approval on approval on approval on approval on approval on approval on approval on approval on approval on approval on approval on approval on approval on approval on approval on approval on approval on approval on approval on approval on approval on approval on approval on approval on approval on approval on approval on approval on approval on approval on approval on approval on approval on approval on approval on approval on approval on approval on  Thank you.
