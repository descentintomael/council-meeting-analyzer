 we will call the meeting to order. If we could have a roll call please. commissioner nava? present. commissioner nichols? here. commissioner paiva? absent. commissioner shear? here. commissioner thomas petty? absent. chair willis? present. thank you. okay. Anyone wishing to address the commission on any matter listed on the agenda should first complete a speaker card found at the back of the chamber. Once completed turn in your cards to the clerk and the speakers are taken in the order the cards are received. Once the first speaker begins no additional cards will be! approval of the draft meetings from the meeting of the minutes from the meeting of 5-19-25 that' s all we got from the consent agenda. Motion by commissioner nichols? second? I do. okay.! we have commissioner nava second. commissioner nichols made the motion. commissioner shear? yes. chair willis? yes. motion passes 4-0. okay. Do we have any public comments? Just so you understand you can address pretty much any matter but we cannot take any action at this meeting if it' s deemed appropriate we can agendize it for another meeting. we have no speaker cards. okay. Then we will move on to the regular agenda. A request for a special use permit for adventure outings to hold technical tree climbing courses at children' s park on an ongoing basis. Do we have any speakers? I guess I'll come up to the computer here. that' s fine. just to provide a little background the city of chico has been working on the required insurance that chico state would require for this. That is it' process but a little bit of a chicken and egg situation that we would need an approved permit before it could be finalized. But just to let the commission know that is in process and could easily be put in place depending on how you go this evening. thank you. thank you. is there a way to pass something out to you before we begin? I will give these to the end here. just one inch just as a place holder for some of the history in the program thus far. hi everybody. thank you for the time tonight. I appreciate it. my name is nate farrington. I am the program director for adventure outings at chico state. I have had the pleasure of being in this role since january of 2024. so I will just begin. first of all program alignment. I just wanted to touch on this because I also looked into your mission statement. so adventure outings has recreation and education at its core. we support responsible recreation while promoting personal growth stewardship and community connection. I know that is something that you all stand for as well. so I thought hopefully this collaboration on its foundation would start there. what is technical tree climbing? this slide could be much longer. but I wanted to. oh sorry. thank you. please excuse me I am used to slide decks and google. it is all good. so what is technical tree climbing? you have a magazine that came out this spring in front of you that is from our annual giant sequoia trip. I know that chico proper does not have 300 foot tall trees as far as I am aware. I have not seen any quite yet. but what we do is ascend trees using ropes harnesses and helmets under the supervision of trained instructors. we are doing a lot of research on how to mitigate risk. it is educational and inspiring. my background is also heavily involved in research. I have worked a lot with the lab of ornithology at Cornell. I have worked with bee researchers. I have done plenty of cone collections in my career with Cal Fire and Icelandic seed bank. it is a dual purpose that we try to achieve. we have an academic wing as well as a recreational wing to this. we do not force you to get involved with research which is what we do on the daily. we use tree friendly methods. if I may. everything we do I say is low impact. I do not believe in things being no impact. us just being out in the world has some level of impact. in my hand is something called a cambium saver. this is one of many methods we utilize to help not hurt the tree. we do not want ropes going over branches or through the layer of cambium. that would cause damage. we use devices like this which are really simple. the rope goes internal to this. that way it lays on the branch not causing permanent damage. we use I also have a big shot or a big slingshot which is how we get the ropes up into the tree. without going out there in the field with us it is kind of hard to explain in here. I do not think you want me launching a slingshot in the chambers here. I will relieve you of that. it is pretty cool to watch. it is pretty fun to see. I highly recommend trying it out with us at some point if you are interested. some more photos from some of the trips we have gone on thus far. we have a very lengthy what we call the PPP or the policies practices and procedures manual. this is what guides our entirety of our trips program and tree climbing is a component of that. Shane and Richie and others do have a copy of that on file. my training came from Cornell outdoor education and the tree climbing institute at Cornell. I have been doing this for about 15 years. my colleague at Chico State also is a professional tree climbing instructor. emergency protocols we all have very high level medical certifications. we have permission already to do this and it has been happening on Chico State campus. and in some of our local national forests. and then we also maintain all the equipment. we keep it regular. all the proper PPE we have in stock at Chico State. some of the things I wanted to also address maintaining flexibility in location and scheduling. that is part of the reason I am asking to open up this area of children's playground to climbing. you know when we are doing this one reason I have worked for a lot of different universities and it really bugs me when I see silos all over campus. I am really into collaboration and I don't think any university exists without the town or city it is in. and I don't think the cities do well without cooperation from that university or universities depending. I would like to get rid of any barriers that might exist and work closely with the city. I already work closely with a lot of community partners. Chico Velo, REI, Mountain Sports just to name a few. and it is really important to me to promote them. I think even the proximity to behind the BSS where you are seeing downtown helps people realize that they are not just on this insular campus location without any access to get off of it. so it is important for me to allow them that viewpoint. and more than that it is good logistics. we don't want to go to the city and say this is the same tree the same site every single time. it is not good for the tree it is not good for the soil compaction underneath that said tree. if you want to look outside your chambers I noticed on the way in tonight I don't know if it is due to people walking over and erosion but all the trees out there you can see exposed roots. those are not good for the tree that is either caused by over watering or people walking on it too often or a combination of the two. and we don't want to see anything like that happening to the trees we are interacting with. they are living beings. if you are climbing rocks that is different that is not a living being. so we want to be really careful and we do a lot of training on how to interact with another living being even though it might not seem it as such because it grows on a much slower scale than we do. and then the other part we have been open to the community since our inception we are 40 years old last year. we know if the community is fully aware of that so we are doing better in terms of marketing to let people know we are not just a program for chico state students that is of course a focus of ours we have always been open to the community you can go on trips with us you can rent gear from us you can bring your bike to our bike hub to get worked on that has been the case as long as we have been around this is one more way to let people know you can also interact with these people support materials as Richie said at the beginning liability insurance we will cover all of that that will be fully on the associated students in chico state it is just a catch 22 that we are in my risk management department can't give the correct insurance until we see the permit then we will build it off of that they will figure it out I can be helpful in that process as well I will be able to who are in the risk that falls on the shoulders of chico proper just to be clear about that thank you please any questions I have some of the gear here with me some of our signage we use anything I can show you or any questions I can answer I would love to do so. commissioner nichols I will let you go first second question who who is technically responsible who is the city issuing the permit to the chico state the students your organization who is the responsible part of here understood we are the associated students of csu chico it is one of the auxiliaries so we will be the associated students of chico state and that is who holds the insurance policy that is who will sign the permit second have you done this have we had agreement with you before or is this the first time not that I am aware of certainly not for this because this didn't exist prior to my arrival here so this is really the first time that you issued a permit from the city to do this from chico yes I have worked with other cities and townships across the country but never chico and this is recreational this is not first credit part of curriculum this is held under adventure outing so it is recreational in nature but I again want to also mention the research that we are doing is a research component that is an option and I just bring that up because for example I don't know if the city ever does research in your city trees but if there is any way we could assist with that in the future we would be happy to it would be an opportunity for us and for our students so I would say their primary focus would be recreational there is no current academic curriculum attached to this there is no credit for this in which we are working towards that being an option for like ag students some of the environmental science students in the future on our end nothing would change it would still be me there doing a very similar set up the lens and the dialogue might shift a little bit but the actual logistics of it would remain the same Richie they are going to comply with the city's normal insurance practices or have the required insurance per city policies correct yes and we have already started the process with risk management that is in process risk management this is obviously a risky adventure so risk management knows about this and the city is protected correct thank you Mr. Chairman Mr. Nunn sorry this is for staff too I don't know if I just got one that was accidentally blank and not filled in because the first part is but then nothing is checked yes or no on any of the questions so that is that way because depending on what your decision was tonight we would check all the boxes and fill out the rest of it okay so is there a fee to people to participate and is it because it is included as part of a class we charge a small fee mainly just for staff time and gear wear and tear for example and I guess my other one for staff would be just Richie it looks like you are good with it because I see here you are saying conditional approval but I just want to have a comfort level you answered a lot of what I was going to ask about the stress to the branches and things by demonstrating so thank you but I just want to send you our certified person and all I just want to hear from you your comfort level with it correct my only reservation would be just to put the heritage sweet gum off limits that is as you know situated at children's park it's we believe it might actually be the California champion sweet gum as well so it's yeah we have a few champion trees the southern magnolia bedwell mansion is unofficially the largest magnolia in California so this sweet gum is of similar status so we would want to make sure that there's no climbing on that tree because as Nate pointed out the cambium savers don't eliminate potential damage but they reduce the risk of damage being done so we would want to make sure that the sweet gum just has nobody is climbing it it just wouldn't be I don't think the optics would be good to have heritage tree being climbed but for the rest of the trees if there was some kind of rotation of the trees so no one tree was continually being climbed you know that's something that we can monitor and get feedback from Nate and do our own assessments just to check that damage is not being done and something that I didn't mention in my list of suggested conditions is that there could also be perhaps a 12 month term which I know the commission has granted for similar permits in the past so just to do a conditional for 12 months and then reassess after that after we've all got a better idea of what it actually looks like thank you that's it for me I don't really have any questions just looks like a relatively small size relatively few number of outings I was curious as to why these trees in this location and I think you explained that well so with the liability insurance I think it sounds like a good program thank you so much I've got questions I was talking to Richie today and there's something like 2000 trees on campus this is a campus activity directed at the university students why aren't you doing it on campus oh we are why do you need children's park then um it's partially what I covered before with the town and gown relationship I think it's really important not to create those barriers and to help people branch out in the community in which we live and to one end it's part of that otherwise you know we have the same issues on campus I don't want to be at the same tree all the time I have gone around and figured out which trees are climbable and part of that isn't just the structure of the tree or the health of the tree but part of that is the location because we don't need to be dropping on people down below potentially and as you know the campus can get pretty busy especially during the semesters so those are some of the logistical issues I'm challenged with but yeah I also want to work with the city I think it's a really cool pathway that we can not only start this recreationally with the educational components that we already do but then possibly move forward like people that go to Chico State often times stay here they often times work in different places I got my wife so I understand that sure but you know we have a riparian forest from way up there to way down there and my concern is I raised two rambunctious boys and a daughter who loved to have tea parties 20 feet up in a walnut tree I'm concerned that kids are going to be watching you oh that's cool let's try that and kids are going to be getting hurt I just feel it's the wrong place to be doing this okay I mean unfortunately people seeing something will have no ability to stop them from trying it themselves and you can certainly point to YouTube, social media what have you but with what we do the fact that it's helmeted, harnessed, roped I mean I was also 20, 30, 40 feet up in trees often times and I remember having tea parties myself as a kid I get it I know that you can fall from height and that's a big deal I'm also on search and rescue so I've responded to that kind of thing before it's nothing that I take lightly but I want to avoid that kind of slippery slope you know we have a ton of risk mitigation in our program a ton of professionalism we have really clear signage that always goes up no matter what tree we're in and I think those those help eliminate that other component of just going and trying to do it a lot of the trees we climb you can't simply climb hand over hand you can't reach branches from the ground even with jumping and it would only be climbable by rope so I think they would find themselves limited in the scope of what they could do just seeing somebody else doing it well why can't you accomplish the same goals by inviting the community onto the campus? we do well but I mean I just feel and I haven't seen anything here tonight that changes my mind that this is the wrong place to be doing this okay I mean I'm not sure how to respond to that I want to you know you started this off with it's focused on Chico State students again we are open to the community and always have been so we do reach out to the community for example we were just at REI's grand opening for three days straight letting the community know that we exist how you can interact with us there should be a card in your hand right now that is a community based card to let people know that they can also come onto campus rent from us go on trips with us what have you I'm an alum I get this magazine in the mail so I appreciate what you are doing I just with all the arboreal resources on the campus if you are worried about crowds there is how many trees are there between Warner and the railroad track at the south end of the fields? I think it is there is just all these resources on campus you could invite people to come from the community if you want community involvement talk to this guy over here he has tons of community involvement you live behind me? yeah we do it is just the wrong in my opinion it is the wrong place and I am trying to figure out why you have to come to children's park to do this when there is all the resources on campus and it is not a closed campus or anything you can invite people can come on campus I go to events on campus all the time sure but why aren't you doing it on campus? well we are doing it on campus this already exists on campus well then why do you need children's park? ok I will yield for a moment Commissioner Notto I just as a parent I will speak as a parent and as a person who does project management I appreciate it my primary concern first was the tree safety is it going to have integrity after you guys use it I actually appreciate when kids do see other things because I think it expands our minds with respect they see things all the time like we had people in the buckets on our street doing things and I think it makes you think oh I kind of like that as a kid you look to those adults to see I could see myself doing something like that and they see the safety equipment I actually like that they will see that people are having a care and that is the proper way to do it because I feel like we all need to have a responsibility to role model and I actually appreciate that town and gown piece because that is something I have spoken about myself both at council meetings and public comment and here on the dais to say how important that relationship is and somewhat of it eroded after the quads stopped happening and all of that I think any way we can stack hands is a positive as long as all the I's are dotted T's are crossed and everything it sounds like you are a very educated person in the area and I certainly appreciate your work on the search and rescue thank you I hear you but I also think that parents are hopefully there with their kids and would be speaking to the safety feature like oh that' s great and when you are old enough we can sign you up for something just giving you a perspective talk to another parent appreciated and if I also could add been with five universities but also was a middle school science teacher which had this tree climbing program in the bay area and then back in upstate New York I worked primarily with 8 to 14 year olds so I am not trying to wipe away your concern by any means most of my career at least half of it has been spent with youth and it' s not something I take lightly so it is something that not only do I want to work with again but giving them the option to do it in a more risk mitigated fashion using ropes and helmets and harnesses as opposed to just going hand over hand and potentially falling or not being able to get down safely we are trying to prevent that kind of thing from happening by doing this and if I could just also admit my ignorance part of the reason for children's park I am in here I have been here about a year and a half I am really new to the area I am still learning a lot about the area I didn' t realize that that was a separate property I thought that was a continuation outside the BSS of Chico State and then only until I actually saw the sweet gum tree that was mentioned earlier did I start to think like I have never seen any plaques like this on Chico State trees I might not be on our territory anymore looking into it I found out it was city property so part of it is proximal to the fact that it' s right behind the Chico building as well yeah the new building I did my freshman classes my freshman chemistry class and my chemistry labs in the old one was it on the same site I got here when they were under construction you didn' t blow it up no a couple questions Commissioner Nichols Mr. Bamblin and Mr. Farrington seeing sort of where this is going are there other places in the park that this would be workable that was not at Cape Reagers in children' s park or Cape Reagers well it' s something that Mr. Farrington could speak to personally I wondered if the the Ewok village would have been a good location because we have probably the tallest redwood trees that we have they' re still babies compared to what you' ve probably climbed in the true wilderness but there' s coniferous trees there I don' t know if that' s the type of tree you' re looking for it sounds like you' re looking for broadleaf trees yeah deciduous is preferred of course we break that more climbing giant sequoias but that' s a much different beast and we have climbed redwoods I try to stay away from conifers for a number of reasons whorls versus actual structured limbs being a main one and the fact that it' s a little bit easier to mitigate damage on a deciduous than it would be onto some conifers redwood trees even like scraping your foot against it you can start to see abrasion happen pretty quickly and you know a couple of times a year you wouldn' t really notice much but if it were to be continued over years I would be afraid of what that might do to those trees Mr. Wills if the permit precluded the use of the children' s playground could you support it if the motion did preclude well it' s children' s park children' s park I mean yeah yeah that' s my only concern because I think it' s the wrong location if that was excluded well that' s what he' s seeking a permit for is to do this tree climbing in children' s park yeah I understand that but it doesn' t look like that' s going to pass so I was wondering whether we could find a compromise that would work with Mr. Farrington no I mean I think it' s a great program I think it' s in the wrong place and that' s that' s my opinion okay I will follow up when are you looking to start then I' m sorry if I missed that whenever you would all be willing to allow us to okay we' re not under any kind of time crunch here like I said and to Mr. Wills' point we do have this program already occurring our next major trip will be in late September to Whitaker' s Forest we have an agreement with UC Berkeley that' s bordering Kings Canyon National Park and that' s a private research forest that they own because of course UC Berkeley owns giant sequoias so but yeah we' ll have that in September that' s all I have to say next shift shift shift shift shift shift go back to this and bring it back when we have the full commission because as we were discussing earlier it' s going to require all of us to agree and my opinion is it' s a good program in the wrong place. can we get a point of order on the assumption shane about it having to be unanimous of those present? it' s a majority vote. exactly. I just wanted to make sure we were following the right protocol thank you. do we have any other questions? do you think this could pass with three votes? I' m not saying that because there hasn' t been any polling but I wanted to make sure. I apologize. there' s no way I can say that without a motion and a second and a vote I can' t predict. but three or four votes if there were a motion would approve that motion? does anybody have any more questions for the gentleman? then I' m going to declare the hearing closed. I' ll move a conditional approval of the use permit for one year subject to the meeting of the city' s insurance requirements. subject to the conditions yes I second that. it' s been regularly moved and seconded that we grant the conditional use permit for a year. commissioner nichols and a second by commissioner nalva. that was commissioner shear. I' m sorry that' s why I need to look at you. commissioner nalva? aye. and chair willis? no. motion passes three one. good luck. moving on. Presentation of sierra nevada conservancy wildfire and forest resilience grant program. Eli godsell. just a little bit of background commissioners while he is getting this presentation on the board. Why this is being brought forward tonight is the big chico creek ecological reserve and they are in the grant process and if you have a letter of support from the city of chico that' s what I' m seeking here is your authorization for me to draft that letter of support just for clarity. we' re not approving this we' re just authorizing a letter of support. it' s a government grant that they are applying for. thank you. For those of you on the commission I have not met my ecological reserve. I manage the 8,000 acres above upper bidwell park. It goes from forest ranch over to 4.5 miles of big chico creek. You can see it here on this map. This bottom section here is bidwell park and then this top above bidwell park and all the way over to the chico airport is the big chico creek ecological reserves. Obviously we were highly impacted by the park fire. This is the anniversary of last week. The first day ran through our expansion. Chocowheel of dick no nah which is this portion here. The second day it jumped big chico creek as we all know and ran up canyon at high severity. Especially on musty buck ridge which follows from the north rim trail you continue going up that' s all musty buck ridge. That was part of the high severity especially as it moved out of the accumulated the landscape but also burnt back 30 plus years of brush and other accumulated fuels up there. To give an idea of what this landscape has looked like historically is that fire regimes in this area of the mediterranean climate in the american west is every five to seven years we would have fire coming through and not having fire on that ridge for 30 years. Before that 100 years has caused We focused on our sediment projects first and then our second major iteration was looking at the opportunities within the park fire footprint that the fire presented itself. This project was designed with the tribe the butte county fire safe council the butte county rcd the city of chico and the chico state ecological reserves we all came together with chico fire as well as cal fire butte unit and said what area when the park fire is the biggest opportunity for future community protection and to scale the vegetation work prescribed and cultural fire we need in our canyon to start to bring this back to a fire adapted regime. This project was identified this is a fuel break that goes up above co-asset it' s currently the funding we' re asking for from sierra nevada conservancy and the The project is a project that takes it from the spi land which is right along co-asset we have from there all the way down to the ecological reserve already funded in partnership with cal fire and another snc project and the application would bring it the second half of the ecological reserve all the way down the north rim trail and have it tie in at easter cross parking lot. working on the spring burns around horseshoe lake each year for the community protection. This would anchor into that catcher's mitt which we do in the spring. This reduction project would be removing any remaining brush and regrowth as I don' t know how many of you have seen but there' s brush out there taller than me since the fire and then maintaining that with each year partnering with chico fire but to If a fire or when a fire starts within the big chico creek drainage we have a good chance of catching it as well as in the fall being able to partner with the city of chico parks department and others to be able to scale prescribed cultural fire in the park to be able to meet ecological goals at a larger scale than we' re currently doing. That' s the project in a nutshell re still in the pre application phase. The nevada conservancy came out last week and visited the site. It sounds very optimistic. The next stage for us is we' d be asked to submit a full application and with that we' d like to be able to include a letter from the city of chico parks department as well. Some of the details is in the packet you got so I won' t go into all of it but I' m happy to answer any questions around the project and the! thank you. Mr. Goodsoe along your red line how much of that area actually burned during the park fire? not all of it. 100 percent. 100 percent? except for the last little bit where it comes down to easter cross. Pretty much where the start was which is right around where this house is all of the rest of the park burned. so why do you have to clear a burn path in an area that already burned? right now to do work on musty buck a year and a half ago it was costing nearly $8,000 an acre for the amount of fuel and vegetation that was up there. There is vegetation growing back we already have goats on portions of the project and we have already been reducing with fuels but like I said there is bay laurel and manzanita that is starting to sprout. The bay laurel and the buck is already this tall. you want to clear the stuff that is regrowing? yes we are taking an opportunity to be able to clear a much needed fuel break at more like $2,000 an acre compared to $8,000 an acre and then try to maintain that into the future. the maintenance is with fire? the maintenance is with fire. that is the goal of this project there is a little bit of herbicide on some of the big chico creek portion we will be doing that research on. looking at the efficacy of herbicide versus prescribed fire versus goats. the majority of it is going to be with fire. we already have city of chico fire department getting engaged and excited about this project we will get a lot of support from them and cal fire. a lot of that has been from our partnerships of burning down in upper bidwell park by horseshoe lake for the last number of years. is this prop 4 funds? this would be prop 4 funds through syrian nevada conservancy and this project is we are utilizing the governor' s order for the sequa exemption on this project this is a unique one for us as well but it' s really nice because it goes multiple property owners for one large project and syrian nevada conservancy and california natural resource agency both want to fund projects that are used in that process. and then if we can get a little I' m assuming you' re seeking letters of support for all the property owners including the private landowners? the only private landowners this is all funded already through a cal fire vmp. it' s spi here which they' re already going to get us a letter and match and then the brown ranch it touches 100 feet and we' ve got a good relationship with that ranch and we' re getting a letter from those private landowners as well. it sounds great I' m really interested in the post fire recovery on the landscape that' s happening in communities as well you mentioned the sediment maintenance and I know there was a big push to do that before the winter and I' ve never seen such sediment came down like still came down and I think it really affected our winter storms too and pushed a lot more water down into the valley that might have been held up in the foothills I' m curious what ongoing efforts there are for sediment management? one of the things we captured a lot of water in the valley and we captured almost 70,000 cubic feet in the first two rains so it' s like we did something that was unprecedented in the state of California we got Army Corps of Engineers permits emergency permits to protect our roads even though we' re protecting the creek because that' s the only way we could get the permits before the rains we crowd funded and got $300,000 of community support to do it because no grants were fast enough to turn around to be able to do the work we contracted with three different states and we were able to permits and we got the resources and still it' s like we captured 70,000 cubic feet but millions of cubic feet came down right so it' s we' re working with some of our grad students and at the state level to really talk about we know what the next disaster is after these high intensity fires why don' t we have the permitting streamline and funding streamline in the state of California to address those issues so we' re using this as a win but also a good example of this is the California' s land base is burned we' re in the time of mega fires we know these things are going to happen how do we do projects and create playbooks that we can scale across the American West and we also believe this fuel break is that too is taking advantage of the opportunity that comes with fire even though it' s a disaster if we just turn our heads more disasters come and we see that in Concow is a good example that every 7 years big fires run through there and it burns everything and people are like okay no more fires going to come through but a fire could move through the ecological reserve tomorrow there' s enough fuel on the ground and grasses that we don' t get a season off in the foothills. thank you. the letter you' re requesting is just for the city property? yes. thank you. it' s actually the city is representing the university property isn' t it? we' re asking the parks commission and we' re working with shane staff a letter of support for the portion within bidwell park and we' re going to be the lead on the grant as well and we' re also getting letters from all the partners I named including the tribe. move authorization for staff to draft and submit a letter of support. I' ll do a second. I declare the hearing closed if that needs to be done. shift shift shift shift! next shift shift! thank you. our weight lifting exercise? yes sir. councillor van overbeek is very big into this. What do we have t have the technical expertise to do. is it appropriate we do this tonight or you want to go through the effort when you have a full commission? this is informational at this point to talk about what the plan is. This is in its infancy. What I' m looking for from the commission at this point is to comprehensive plan. If there' s something in that plan that jumps out at you and you feel this is completely outdated or this needs to be changed communicate that to me. I' ll take those communications and start agendizing different parts of the master management plan that we need to start talking about that. Through that process we can also start looking at coming up with a 20 year plan of projects and I' ll bring the things that are in so we' re not duplicating efforts. My goal tonight was to bring this forward to the commission per council direction and get the ball rolling. gives a homework assignment. exactly. that doesn' t require any action does it at this point? it does not. do you mind if I? not at all. my one thing about this and I' m fine I read this thing cover to cover when I came on board. For me I know we have two kind of big things coming up. We have a revisit to whether they want to keep the south side mitigating traffic where it' s closed on the weekends and the holidays to vehicular traffic or maybe even consider closing it all the way that was the last time we had a they gave it a six month I want to say timeline. Finish the repaving which is done but then see how things go and revisit and then we' ve got the south side conversation where that' s coming back up for discussion on August 19 for council. Some of it to me is those kind of major pieces play a part in what we might say is a section of interest that maybe needs to be changed. s a good point. s a good point. That' s a good point and that six months is coming up in about mid-September. Also in the master management plan there' s talk about the traffic on south park drive and peterson drive and the way the signage that was just placed on peterson drive the signage appears to where vehicle traffic is still one way to the west however bicycle traffic is either way If memory serves the master management is one way for all vehicles including bikes. These are the little things we' re going to have to look at. Just a little bit of a preview we have a bench donation policy in there that was supposed to be reviewed every five years and it hasn' t been reviewed for well over a decade. That policy needs some serious revamping that' other guys for us to talk about more to come on that. with all due respect you can put signs every 10 feet and the bicycles are going to do what they damn well please. it was really interesting because we had this extensive discussion about traffic accidents with automobile and pedestrian and the other thing we had to look at was the traffic! I saw that this morning myself. let' s move on parks division report. before we lose what are you expecting us to do specifically we' re going to go through this page by page we' re all supposed to make notes on what we want to see change what' s the objective for me? the objective for you at this point is to pull out sections or just go through the master become familiar with it and then I would assume there' s going to be some aspect in there that' s going to catch your interest and you' ll communicate that with me and say hey I saw this section and it seems very outdated maybe this is something we should talk about. this directive is not very specific. I think as we start this conversation and go through the conversation it' s going to become more clear on s going to be. at this point we have this document that' s quite old and we need to start pulling it apart and see what we need to update. when you discuss this process are we going to have a series of workshops or are you going to come to a meeting and say anybody has any suggestions? I' m making it up as I go. I understand that. some direction of things to focus on and when I have those focal points I can come to the commission and say these are the points that have been brought up and this is something we should look at for the next update for the master management plan. I think that' s what I' m interpreting the goal of this process. some future meeting it' will be an agenda item commissioners give me your communicate with him issues that we think we have. as individuals? as individuals and then he will distill that and then presumably bring some recommendations to the commission. am I correct? you' re absolutely correct. do we need to get these to you by? last week. this is going to be an ongoing process. s no hard deadline right now. I think the council directed just wanted us to start that process and start the conversations. since I read it I' ve got one question that can' t wait any longer. since this is a contemporary issue on page 344 it says consider renaming south park drive. where does that come from? I' m sorry I didn' t hear the first. I don' since it' s a contemporary issue that caught me as odd. those are the little thing that I was referring to that are going to jump out. consider renaming south park drive now would be the time. way finding is a big part of this process as well. I was going to suggest to your question which I think is a good one for me from an overall out into like a flow based thing so with what we know is coming up it might be good if you were to say well here's a recommended flow so like we have wayfinding we have roads we have vegetation slash trees and we have facilities right we have aging facilities there's lighting so maybe what we do is attack them in the order where you wouldn't be reworking because you know what I mean you lead with one thing which leads you to the next and so to me again if you're going to be renaming stuff you wouldn't want to be recommending let's update our wayfinding and here's what we wanted to say and where we want it to go and then later into it we're chunking out something totally different that overhauls all of that so to me logically some of that stuff like wayfinding actually comes after some other decisions that could be made. I think it would be great if you could potentially be out there when you trend what the comments and feedback are just a thought. pieces of this that I don' t know this is high level inspirational kind of stuff I would like to know in the city' s capital improvement project are there specific projects called for in this plan that are in the cip two is the city made efforts to remove all grain water from going into chico creek three is the shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift plan that was part of that. That is now in place. that was developed and published and adopted by the city? yes. what about capital improvements are park projects in your cip? I will bring those to the commission this is the capital project that we have in place and where we are in those processes for example the caper acres fence replacement project we are hopefully on target to have that completed by late fall early winter this year. That would be an example of that. The caper acres renovation project is a capital improvement project that is ongoing. thank you. cool. okay. I guess the next is item 6. item 6 park division report. thank you chair willis. wow. since we have met last time a lot has happened. a lot. most recently peterson drive was reopened on the 25th to public use in vehicle pedestrian and bicycle traffic. we have been working with the I biked peterson drive on Saturday and it is incredible. it is nice and smooth. if I was braver I might get on a long board. I think skyler was talking about getting on a long board. it is beautiful. very excited about that. they were done a couple weeks ahead of schedule and I think the public really appreciated that. beginning of the swim season at our initial cleaning of sycamore pool. california department of fish and wildlife asked us to delay that cleaning until after the spring run of the chinook salmon which is that season is over by june 15. during that time of that request they took a look at our permit or lsa permit and discovered that the permit had been long lapsed so they asked us to stop doing the cleaning of the pool until we were able to obtain the lsa or lake bed stream alteration permit. typically those take quite a while. it was a lot of research of very old documents and putting together pieces of the puzzle and california department of fish and wildlife was very helpful in expediting that permit. we now have that permit and are able to get back in the pool and do the cleaning. we have removed over 2100 cubic yards of sediment from the pool over the course of three days during the initial cleaning a couple weeks ago and we have done one follow-up cleaning since then. differences in the permit and this is something that is in the master management plan that mentions we start sycamore pool and we will be able to get back that is going to be changed in accordance to this permit to after june 15 to coincide with the salmon migration. that was a hurdle that we were happy to get past and along with that there were some instances in big chico creek of some the pool and it was due to an e coli stream strand that is pretty toxic of 0157. That' s what they tested positive for we don' t know for sure if it came from big chico creek yet or not so we have been working very closely with butte county public health who has come out and taken different samples of sediment water from various with them from big chico creek from sycamore pool to around the nature center to five mile to alligator hole and those are actually been those samples were sent to the cdc for analysis and we should get those samples back in the next couple of weeks. Until then we are still continuing under no swim advisory in the state of california daily. Those daily levels have been low as far as the e coli is concerned but we' re really concerned about this 0157 and trying to track down the origin to that. I will give you updates as I receive them on test results. A lot of cover in here so bear with me. Next exciting thing happen on upper park road and mobilization is slated to start the iron canyon fish ladder project. The first part of that project is getting the equipment in place which is in order to do that there will have to be some improvements to upper park road and some culverts put in and once that' s done we can move forward to the next phase of getting the cranes up there. If everything remains on schedule August 20 is when that will start moving forward and as a result of that we' re going to start implementing closures of upper park road to the public bikers pedestrians vehicles because of that heavy traffic or heavy equipment moving around on there. Most likely working out details on that most likely will be closed during the week and open on Saturdays. we will hold our questions until the end or ask them when you' re on topic. go ahead and ask. when season was that starting August 20 or is that starting later in the fall when swim season is done? it' s slated to start on August 20. road closures on weekdays will begin toward the end of August. that' s the tentative yes. . thank you. I want to ask a question about the type of testing done. I know that back in the day there was one method of testing then the city of chico with some recommendations by the state at a point in time elevated their testing protocol a little bit and changed some things up. do you know if that process now includes use of I believe it was the quanta trays that were recommended being a part of things or is that not something that' s being done? t know. I don' t know. I know at this point they' re testing for the actual e coli the general group of e coli. the city of chico normally when we do our normal testing what protocol do you know what' s involved in that process and is it at a level that we believe could catch the vast majority of things or are we going more other specific types of tests you can do. I know we weren' t doing all of it at one point. I know they started doing a little more so it could catch different levels. just curious. that' s a great question. probably the easiest way I could describe it is by using my hands as well. in a big circle you have total coliform and within that circle is a smaller circle of fecal coliform and then within that is an even smaller circle of e coli. e coli is inside of the fecal coliform and inside of total coliform. when you sample for total coliform you' re getting this huge range, big numbers and typically that sample is performed on fairly clean water, drinking water for the most part. through directives from the state water resources control board directives in the early 2000' s for recreational water uses. they came out with a testing kind of protocol number for e coli itself. so as obviously as testing capabilities improve over the decades we' re able to test for e coli now with local laboratories. a third party lab does the sampling and testing for the city of chico. e coli has been the number that indicator pathogen that we' ve been using for quite some time now. just to go a little further with it the state cdc has the capability of testing the sediment and this water for a specific strain of e coli. thank you. are we still doing weekly tests how often? daily. information on those test results when they' re available? the test results from the cdc yes. i suspect we' ll probably get them through the media before you have a chance to do that? i suspect the same thing. are people swimming in the pool? i spent some time around the one mile area saturday late morning and there was not a person in the pool. are we allowing people into the pool until we clear this e coli thing or do we test daily? how do we protect people there? the advisory is there. we' ve done as well as public health we' ve put out quite a few media alerts. the daily test results are being updated on our website on almost every other day basis. just trying to get the information out to the public is a challenge. out to the public as much as possible. if a parent wants to put their kid in the pool they can at their risk? at their risk. lifeguard services are suspended? they are. that' s never stopped anybody before. this is true. one more. i did forget i wanted to ask because i' ve seen it asked and no one has said anything about do we know? people were asking and saying then people are going to think it' s probably okay and do it versus just no swimming. at this point we don' t know that a 157 strain came from big chico creek. our daily testing and our protocols we' re still within the range of being in advisory. re in the average range. re right there. there hasn' t been an elevated test results over time to get us to the level of absolutely stay out of the creek. we' re going on the guidelines that butte county public health has advised us to. at this point we' re still in that advisory period. there is a level of infection the public health department would ban people from meeting the creek? yes. you enforce this how? we haven' t had that occur. that obviously is the issue. you can ban it all you want. if people want to be dumb enough to do it how are you going to prevent them? you going to put armed guards out there? machine gun towers? it' s more public education more signage we could do things like caution tape all around sycamore pool there' s different things we could do if it came to that point and hopefully we won' t. when we move on I' m sure you still have more of a report? we' re getting there. a little bit of an update on transfers of parks to card that discussion is ongoing. in march city council directed staff to work on gathering cost information and other information about the feasibility of transferring select parks to card. we' ve provided costs, estimates to card, the cost of transportation, the card board has been discussing and the dialogue has been going back and forth. there hasn' t been any big leaps in that so we' re still in that discussion phase and as I receive more information I' ll share that with the commission. other than that, throughout the re filling stuff up around the horse arena and middle park it' s looking fantastic up there once they' re done with that area they' ll move back over into the lindow channel to finish the final grazing for the defensible space lindow channel grant. finally just heads up coming up in september is the 38th annual bidwell park in chico creek cleanup which is an we have a great turn out for that. what' s the date on that? it is september 20. saturday september 20. registration can happen at the butte environmental council website. my truck and trailer will be available. fantastic thank you once again for your time. thank you for that. thank you for that. I will take a moment to talk about the caper acres and I believe it' s the wrought iron fence you were alluding to that you' re hoping for completion by fall or whatever. does that include then the installation of the things that the kids were working on on the fence or does that just mean the fence itself will be there? that will include the installation of that artwork. great. I' m very excited about that. I' it' s probably a tall order timeline but I would like to have it done by winter. then the legacy leaves part of it is that just like a later phase then because that has way more community back and forth to solicit who' s interested in the purchasing and how it would all work and cost? that is a later phase. thank you. I' m not sure where rotary is in that m not remembering how much they were able to raise at their shindig but that would be interesting to know too did they hit their target is more needed? it was very successful from what I heard but I don' t have any specifics. I have a question about that as well. the chico state students are designing or doing the concrete work for the foundation for the fence and when is that all started to or slated to begin? that was the original idea. I think it was the original idea. we were going to do that concrete foundation. we found that going that route was going to be very time consuming and very expensive. we were getting really ambitious into the weeds with that. the benefit to that versus everything else that would have come it just didn' t pencil out. we have nixed that concrete curb and we' re going to do the rod. that should be once we get all our requests for proposals out should come in and the installation should happen rather quickly. I believe there' s discussion on the fence being built by butte college students too. has that also not proven to be? that' s not. unfortunately. the question, do people be allowed to park along south park drive? I got asked that question and I wasn' t clear from the report what the answer was. I would have to have notes in front of me to answer that question. I' m not the only one that' s not clear. that' s not a closed issue either. that' s coming up in the middle of august? yes. there' s one of the yes votes as asked for reconsideration. that' s what I understand. okay. we don' t know. okay. anything else for shane? okay. moving on to 6.2, street tree division report. mr. bamlett. thank you chair willis. since the last time we' ve met at the commission meetings we' ve been able to do a tremendous amount of tree pruning and removals. as you all know peterson memorial way is now complete. but one of the operations that took place was pruning of all the trees along peterson memorial way. there was just under 500 trees were pruned. so it was a tremendous operation. and it really does make a difference to the tree canopy. I know most people don' t look up. they' re now looking down at the beautiful road. but it does make me look up as well. and I can really see the great work that the tree trimming contractors did on that. so we' re very happy for that. we' ll probably try and put it on a three or four year pruning cycle just to help keep that maintenance to the standard that it' s currently at. currently the contractors are now working on south campus. obviously with the summer recess now is a good time to get the bulk of the work done. s no students around. it' s a ghost town pretty much. so they' re working all of the what we call the chico streets. chesnut, ivy, cherry orange. thank you. and also removals which are within that south campus area. as well as that we' ve completed almost 100 removals large trees around town. and that work is ongoing as well. our backup contractor from bakersfield. they' re currently in town. and they' re working through a number of tree removals. and they get just so you know they get ground the stumps get ground out as well. and back filled with plantable good soil. so that now forms the basis of our upcoming fall program for tree planting. so we' ll get those tree locations planted with new trees. so that' s exciting as well. also recently we just completed pruning of west eaton road. so all the neighbors that have backyards backing onto west eaton have now you know we' ve now been able to reduce a lot of the long branches that were growing into people's backyards. so we' ve had a lot of calls from residents that are wanting to see that work completed. and then recently we also finished pruning peterson park. the perimeter of that park which is managed by card. but the outer perimeter trees are in the city ownership. so we were very happy to get those trees pruned. a lot of this focus has been on london plain trees. and one of the downsides of that type of species is that the trees tend to drop limbs in the summer. and we have had a tremendous amount of what we call summer limb drop. even trees that we've pruned have still dropped limbs the very next day. so it' s a little frustrating to see that. but you know we' re hoping that the amount of limb drop will reduce. because we've you know taken a lot of the weight off the end of the branches. it makes them less likely to drop to break. but they do still break unfortunately. upcoming work we are looking to prune the large trees along the southern boundary of well the northern boundary of bidwell park which is adjacent to vallonbroza. so that's that's coming up. and obviously we'll need to schedule with the road works but south park drive is on the radar as well. because that was last pruned. and we're hoping that we can get some of that work done. i want to say five or six years ago. so we would like to give the trees that overgrow south park drive give them another prune as well. so a lot of tree work happening and upcoming on the horizon. on some days recently we've had you know seven tree crews working on the same day in the park. so it gets quite busy. but it's exciting to see all of that work getting done. so i think we're looking to so i'd be happy to take any questions that commissioners might have. okay. i thought i was going for shane's follow up. ranger update anything? sorry i always mean to ask that. so at this point i haven't seen a recruitment for the third ranger. i'm not sure when that's going to come forth. i don't think it's going to come i think it's on the horizon at this point. i think director gustafson has been speaking with chief aldridge and some of the upper echelon over at pd to see if we can move that along a little bit. okay. anybody else got anything? then we will all gather here on august 25th at 6 p.m. meeting is adjourned. thank you. shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift
