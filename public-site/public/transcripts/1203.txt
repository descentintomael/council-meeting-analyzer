 Thank you.  All right, are we out here?  All right, call to order our regularly  city-scheduled council meeting.  First of all, we'll have our invocation  by Pastor Brian Myers.  Well, Happy New Year, City Council.  It's going to be a great year, staff.  We just pray.  Father, we thank you so much for this new year.  And Lord, we thank you for 2024.  But my prayer, Lord, is for 2025,  there would be a year filled with, Lord, just gratitude  for the opportunity that we have  to live in this city,  to work together towards good work.  And God, I thank you for the leadership  that you've put in place.  God, I pray you just anoint them  with wisdom and knowledge and understanding.  I pray for unity in this chamber, God.  I pray that we all collectively would understand  that, Lord, we all strive to make this place home  and a place that would be a blessing  to those who come here.  I also pray, Lord, for the wisdom needed by the council,  also for the words that are shared.  God, give us wisdom in what to say  and also what not to say.  But, Lord, may everything we say be for the good of all.  God, we are just grateful for this city.  God, bless everyone on not just staff,  but also all the workers and the volunteers of this city.

I'm going to call the first two names and if you could line up in the middle aisle that  would be great.  The first two speakers are Mark Mears followed by Yamael Acqua.  Good evening.  I have a short, friendly, nonsectarian prayer for the new year.  As we enter a new year with a reconstructed City Council, may we all be blessed with a  more humble and gentle spirit of tolerance for one another in the midst of our often  divergent attitudes, beliefs, and opinions.  It has been widely said that as human beings, at our core, as our essential nature, we are  all one.  Now, I know this often seems unbelievable.  Abstract or naive.  But is it true that every one of us yearns to be happy, wishes to feel safe, and wants  to be healthy and free?  Is there anyone among us who does not truly appreciate being treated with respect and  kindness?  Are there any of us that don't recoil at being negatively judged?  Don't we all want to be given the benefit of the doubt?  When we are trying to do our best?  So today, amidst the undeniable challenges facing our planet and humanity, may we as  one strive to sincerely and authentically wish each other happiness, safety, health,  respect and kindness in our lives.  Over the upcoming months and years, while we will most assuredly disagree on a myriad  array of things.  May we as one ardently commit to advocating for our positions with respect and kindness  for all involved.  Finally, may we indeed remember that the golden rule of simply treating other people  as we would hope they would treat us is far from being just an ancient platitude, but  rather the most easily understood, practical, and sacred understanding of life.  Thank you and Happy New Year.  Thank you.  Yama Akwa followed by Nicole Nava.  All right.  I'm here to advocate for just some historical education to be done amongst the local populace,  particularly in regards to the Bidwell Mansion that has recently burned down.  Apparently, there's a lot of funding.  People seeking to effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively .  . . .    .  .   effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively ! ! ! ! ! !  the  people who were involved in the  war of extermination against the  california native americans  including myself should not be  erected or rebuilt or celebrated  in any way. My family is from  the pomo nation in what'  s now so-called sonoma county  occupied sonoma county and  chamoru from guam which is an  occupied u.S. territory where we  have no voting rights and no  representatives. Between 1850  and 1860 90% of all california  indigenous people were murdered  right? We lost our lives.  California became a state and in  1850 john bidwell wrote an act  called the act for government of  protection government or  federal government. And in 1850  the act for government and  protection of indians which in  fact legalized our indentured  servitude and allowed slavery of  indigenous people. You know, and  like I said between 1850 and  1860 90% of us were killed. Not  just through this act but this  act was in conjunction and was  signed into law by the california  american california and the  california. The american colony  now california. It was signed in  by peter burnett you guys' first  governor of california ever who  declared that in his own words  that a war of extermination will  continue to be waged between the  races until the indian race  becomes extinct must be expected.  And then california proceeded to  spend 1.5 million dollars at 25  cents a scalp, $5 a pound a  hundred dollars a head to  indian hunters to kill us. Right  so there's the state sanctioned  genocide. There's the state  sanctioned slavery. And then  there's so you've got john  sutter right who was involved in  the gold rush genocide this is  john bidwell's boss. John  sutter being a notorious slaver  of native children and rapist of  native girls. Between the gold  state of california.  90% of us were killed in the  actual reparations.  don'  t rebuild.  nicole nava followed by  nancy park.  good evening council.  I will look at my notes a little  bit here because I'  m not feeling my best.  I also wanted to make a couple  comments on the bidwell mansion  and the arson and impacts.  But first I wanted at the outset  to extend my huge thanks to all  the entities and individuals  involved in the investigation,  follow through, fighting the  fire, all of that.  It was pretty amazing.  The couple of points I want to  make about equipment.  I had asked prior to the mansion  burning down if we can get  cameras at children's playground  because there was a lot of  graffiti and I felt like ramping  up of anti-semitic rhetoric and  other things that were found in  the jewish community when they  walked to the hillel through  there have to pass by and it is  very difficult for them.  There has been graffiti and  damage done around their building  as well.  I think it would be prudent with  what has happened now to do an  assessment of our important  icons in this community and  landmarks and see if we can get  them back to the people that  we have shored things up to the  extent necessary.  The other thing, license plate  readers.  That was a hot topic here at one  point.  I was very supportive of that for  our police department, law  enforcement entities.  If anyone saw the press conference  it played a huge role in  identifying the vehicle so they  could find who did this amongst  other evidence.  serious crimes to be able to do  that.  I think it is important come  budget time to be reflective of  how helpful that was.  And other tools that they may  need such as drones, et cetera,  to keep the community safe.  What else?  Inclusion in the group that does  discuss future plans.  I am thankful that the machu  pter involved and also Chico  state, fine.  I think there should also be  other community members at large  plugged into that group.  So just as you all do that.  Really quickly on the  homelessness topic, switching  gears.  I don't think it is okay to have  all our eggs in the basket of  waiting for the judge to render  decision forever and ever and  ever.  We can and should be progressing  on enforcing litter, smoking  entries, dogs unrestrained just  as we would other people where  those are rules as well.  It is in the settlement agreement  that you can.  I think staff should be directed  to have their staff take a look  at that and handle it immediately.  Let's make our community look  beautiful and be safe.  We have a new bike path area  that will be opening up.  All of that we need to regroup.  that will be the first person  who did the wonderful prayer.  Thank you.  nancy park followed by  charlotte perrine.  hi.  With the new city council I  hope we will have more public  discussion about more issues.  I think there are lots of good  ideas floating around on and  outside the council.  I think this council has a real  address some of chico's problems.  I would like to mention two items  of concern to me.  First, regarding homelessness,  I ask that this council agendize  and seriously consider the  establishment of designated  well-managed campgrounds.  Charles with hewn and the north  state shelter team have made a  well thought out proposal and  we have the opportunity to have  many fewer people camping in our  parks and greenways.  It has worked in other cities.  The second item I want to mention  just briefly is about the concept  of how chico will grow in infill  development.  It is a big subject so I will  give just one example.  The chico nut company property  is for sale.  It is huge and it is bordered by  the esplanade and oleander and  by lindow channel.  It is located on the east  10th avenue.  What an opportunity for a mixed  use of housing and small  businesses.  It is centrally located and the  esplanade is one of the easiest  places to get on the b line bus.  Of course the city doesn't  control who buys the property  but it can be sure the zoning  and permitting process allows  for affordable housing and small  business spaces right here in  the center of town.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Charlotte perrine followed by  Cynthia perrine.  Hello.  As a student at chico high school  biking is one of my main modes of  transportation to and from school.  I also have various classmates and  friends where biking is their only  available form of transportation to  and from school.  The presence of piles of leaves and  cars in the bike lane causes me and  my friends to have to swerve into the  car a few months ago.  My close friend was struck by a  car on west sac when he had to  swerve into the bike lane out of  the bike lane to avoid a parked  car.  He wasn't badly hurt and he was  able to continue on to school but  we were very worried about him.  I want to know what the city is  doing to address this dangerous  issue.  Thank you.  I'm a proud mom.  As a chico resident who also  commutes by bicycle my bicycle  commute is approximately six miles  from my home to my work.  I have many choices of pathways  which include transportation from  8th avenue to 11th orlindo through  on the bike path that's adjacent to  the railroad tracks.  I've been I've had a few incidents  lately where it hasn't been safe  because of dogs off leash.  And I've been in a lot of  trouble with my bike and it's  not so much the people but the  dogs swerve in front of the bikes  and it makes it unsafe.  I've been changing my route  recently so I want to make the  city council aware of the value  of the informal easement between  8th and 11th that goes between  the vanilla orchard and the  graves family property.  And as we go forward with the  next city plan I really want to  make sure that that is maintained  very carefully and cautiously.  to be doing with a lot of neighborhood input.  And so I also just want to reiterate  what Charlotte said about the bike lane  because today I had to swerve on  8th avenue and I had actually a  Cal fire truck almost hit me.  So it's not just residents of the  city of Chico it's the workers who  are being put into unsafe situations  because bikes are having to go into  the street.  So thank you very much for listening.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Good evening everybody.  My name is Jeff hill.  I'm a local business owner lifetime  Butte county residents.  Four years ago my wife Lisa and I  made the very difficult decision to  cash in our retirements and purchase  hula's Chinese barbecue one of the  most iconic restaurants in Chico.  And saving it from being another  casualty of the covid pandemic.  Well the restaurant business is  already one of the most difficult  industries to become and stay  profitable in doing this my wife  and I paid the city of Chico  thousands of tax dollars kept a  well established building occupied  and employed over 45 people.  My purpose here tonight is to  thank you for your support and  I would like to ask each of you  to educate myself my wife and  several other commercial property  owners business owners affected  citizens as to why our city sewer  charges are unsustainably high  and ever changing.  I was of the understanding that  in 2022 there would be a 15%  increase voted on and adopted by  the council.  Yesterday I was informed by  David Ken sewer official at the  city of Chico the 15% rate was  miscommunicated to the public and  was meant only for residential  accounts not commercial accounts.  Which the residential accounts  have proven to be inaccurate  also several non-business owning  residents have reported to us a  75 to 100% increase in the  increase through July even though  in July of 2023 when the city  started collecting their own sewer  fees rather than building through  Cal water as commercial rates  remain ungoverned and able to  rise by 200 and even 300%.  We are asking that the citizens  are given correct information to  the rates and due process and  rates are so out of control by  their water bill fresh water bill  remains virtually the same. My  wife and I have now spent  countless hours and spoke to  many city officials and have not  really received clear  explanation yet. One of your  council members explained in the  news media while bills are  excruciating to pay they have  looked into the item and are  city's rules that are accurate  and nothing will change. We'  putting the board on public  notice that this is an impasse  and we will not accept this as a  resolution. I do want you to  know we will be asking the city  now as a collective unit of tax  paying citizens to open the  books and give us an honest  evaluation of our city sewer  rates. During our investigation  we found.  that'  s time Jeff thank you.  Mr. Kupfselstern can you.  see you next week.  we will see you next week.  can I have the rest of her  time.  what'  s that?  can I have the rest of her  time.  unfortunately not right now.  I apologize. I know that we  communicated over this over the  holiday and I know is there a  frequently asked question on the  sewer rates because we spent  hours up here talking about this  and I know it is very confusing  is there somewhere that people  have not been able to get that  information.  I know that staff has met  directly with hula and you  responded to me on that and I  think some other council members  asked questions on it as well.  there is on our website there  is information on the sewer  billing process for both for  residential and commercial and I  think the big change is that you  know that both on residential and  commercial went to a volumetric  rate structure and also utl 360  our billing contractor that does  all the billing for us now  there is also information on  their website and on the bill that  folks receive.  I know staff has been in touch  with the owners of hula on  several occasions.  Engineering staff and myself have  looked at it and I believe we  have a meeting scheduled with  them on Thursday to further  review their bill and to see  what is going on and make sure  their calculation is correct.  so far it appears to be correct  but we will continue to audit it  and look at it and see what we  can do.  thank you so much.  I appreciate that.  all right.  we have no public hearings today.  regular agenda.  the biannual recruitment for  applications interested in serving  on the city commissions.  Ms.  Thank you mayor Reynolds and  council.  it is an extreme privilege of  mine to get to be the person who  does the recruitment every two  years for interested citizens  who want to help our community  and serve on a border commission.  the biannual recruitment  obviously happens every two years  and it happens in the years that  we have an election and so we  have to be prepared for that.  we conducted our first recruitment  October 1st.  it ended 30 days later.  we still needed additional  applications so we extended it  for another 30 days.  the council is in receipt of all  of those applications.  every applicant has to meet the  criteria and that is being a  registered voter in the city of  Chico.  that is part of our charter.  that is part of it is stated in  all of the sections related to  our boards and commissions in  the Chico municipal code as  well.  while there is no formal action  for tonight's meeting what we  are really doing is just  allowing and inviting the  applicants to come up.  they will each have three  minutes.  many of them have applied for  more than one commission which  we are very grateful.  in the past we have had upwards  to 80 to 100 applicants and we  used to have to have separate  meetings to interview or allow  them to come in and meet and  greet with the council.  however, it has diminished  especially after COVID.  so we are very grateful to the  commission.  we have 35 applicants.  many of them whom have actually  applied for more than one  commission.  so again I am grateful for it.  they are interested in serving  whether you appoint them to the  planning commission or the  climate action commission.  in addition they have indicated  the preference, their order.  so if they want to be on the  planning commission first then  they are going to indicate that  that is all contained in the  information that you have in  your agenda packet that you will  get to review for the next  couple of weeks.  there is the planning commission  and the planning commission.  the process for the appointments  follows a little bit of a  different venue for airport  commission versus our other four  commissions.  we have seven members on our  arts commission, bidwell park and  playground, climate action  commission and planning  commission.  on the airport commission we  only have five members.  so in order to appoint an  airport commissioner we do that  using a balloting process and  I will explain that when we have  our next meeting.  however, council quite a few  years ago actually implemented a  nomination process and those  terms of office coincide with  council.  so for instance in November we  had an election for four  districts, four council members  and all four of our seven  member commissions each have  four terms, four year terms  positions that are going to be  up and considered.  so they run concurrently with  the newly elected council members  terms.  and then in two years we will  have three members come up.  but in the meantime, so what  does that mean and what does  that look like for our  applicants?  the council is encouraged to  listen to all of the applicants.  remember that attendance at this  meeting is not a requirement for  appointment.  we've had several emails come in  from interested citizens who  have applied and indicated that  because of their schedule they  couldn't make tonight's meeting.  but what we do is we ask the  four newly elected commissioner  or excuse me council members to  please fill out a nomination form  that would be turned in by  Tuesday, November, excuse me I am  way off, not November please,  actually January 21st and we'll  consolidate that all.  the individual nominations takes  place of the, it's in place of  balloting.  we used to take hours and hours  to get to the individual  nominations.  we had to get to the  majority vote on one commissioner.  so this way you get to vet them,  you get to talk to the applicants,  you've been provided with a list  of email addresses and you can  reach out to them.  we had to redact all their  personal information off those  applications.  so if you need their phone  numbers just contact my office  and we'll get that to you so you  can do your due diligence and  talk to them.  so what I'd like to do now is  just turn it over to the audience  and the, we actually asked and  we have I believe 16 here who  would like to speak on behalf of  that and then I'll ask because  some may not have filled out a  card, might ask if there are  other applicants in the audience  but just if you are an applicant  who's applied for more than one  board please address your  comments on all the commissions  that you've applied for and  expressing your interest to  serve.  so do you have any questions  about the board? . . . . . . . . . . . .    Everyone filled out a speaker card, so I won't really know.  But I think that they'll address whether or not they're applying and what commission they're applying for.  Because I think we had some people supporting different vacancies.  So I just want to see if we were differentiating.  I actually did have one question, just a quick process question.  If there was a vacancy, such as on Climate Action Commission where I used to serve,  how do we handle filling that vacancy that's out of its usual sequence?  So the policy that we have, and thank you for asking that question.  I should have brought it up.  Yep, so the Airport Commission is not part of the nomination process, and vacancies are not as well.  So when we have a vacancy, which we do on the Climate Action Commission,  so we're going to get four new members plus one additional member for a two-year term.  And so in regards to vacancies, it's a collective, it's a balloting process,  and everyone gets to vote on it to a point.  So what I'd like to do is, once I receive all the nominations in,  and bring that forward to the council at the night of that meeting on the 28th,  we will actually have a ballot that has all the remaining applicants on there  that you can choose someone to serve a two-year term.  Great, thank you.  You're welcome.  Any other questions?  Any other questions?  No?  Okay.  All right, I'll call the first two speakers up.  And again, if you could go ahead and line up in the middle aisle, that would be great.  We have Larry Wall, followed by Tracy Vincent.  Tracy?  Mayor Reynolds, council members, staff, just to be, for clarity,  I want to say that I am applying for reappointment to the Planning Commission,  and that's the only thing I'm going after.  But tonight I'd like to do something a little bit different,  and that is to reconcile, to recognize the unsung,  heroes of the planning process, the planning staff.  They deserve a thank you because they generally work out in the background  and don't get the recognition they rightfully deserve.  On behalf of the current Planning Commission,  I want to take this opportunity to recognize and thank the Planning Department staff  for their heroic and hard work, perseverance, and diligent attention to detail  in preparing reports and agendas, [inaudible]  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively .  effectively  The price of housing in this community is $492,000.  That's a little high.  We need more housing to help stabilize it or bring it down, hopefully.  The other thing is the general plan coming up.  I look forward to seeing that and working on that with fellow commissioners.  So the planning staff are the ones that make the complex understandable for the rest of us.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Let me get back to Tracy Vincent, followed by Megan Thomas-Petty.  Thank you.  Madam Mayor, Council Members, I'm Tracy Vincent.  I have applied for the Planning Commission, and I don't know how long or how fast I can talk.  So I think I will tell you why I think I might be qualified for it,  and that will in turn probably explain why I would like to be on the Planning Commission.  So I was born and raised here in Chico.  I joined the military and just retired two years ago after 37 years of service.  My family has been in this community,  and this county since before we were even a state.  We are landowners, we are farmers, we are commercial property owners,  and I'm also a small business owner here in town.  So I believe that while I don't have a technical degree in planning,  I do have a practical degree, both with my military career, my travel,  the work I've done in the military.  I've done a lot of work with emergency management,  working with cities in the civilian sector, both in Southern California, Virginia, Norfolk.  I've worked in the military in Cuba, emergency planning.  So we've had to, it's like I know the big picture,  and I have a great appreciation for the community and the history.  Our initial piece of property, which is now known as Mission Ranch,  was actually purchased from the Bidwell family.  So I've seen a lot of change in my short period of time,  and I've heard a lot of change from my family going back four generations.  So I'm open to change, but I also respect the history,  and I respect our community, and I do care about it.  And there are a lot of things that I think are wonderful about our community,  and there's some things that I think need some help.  I have spent the past eight years of my career working on what's called HRO,  going into hospitals and facilities and trying to get them to maintain a quality of excellence.  I think that our town is close and has all the tools to become an HRO and to have everything,  but I think we really need to work on our community,  and I think that our community is a place where we can really have a lot of communication  and kind of bring everybody back together.  But part of me having a greater understanding of that is being a part of the process.  So that just is my outside look coming back in and living here for two years.  So this is my way of actually getting down to the nitty-gritty  as being a part of the process and being a part of what's happening in my city.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Megan Thomas-Petty, followed by Frank Willis.  Good evening, City Council members and staff,  and congratulations to the newly elected members.  I am Megan Thomas-Petty.  I'm currently the chairperson of the Bidwell Park and Playground Commission.  I've served a full four-year term, vice chair for two years,  and chairperson for the last two.  I respectfully request the privilege to serve another term on the commission.  During my tenure, I attended the Bidwell Park and Playground Commission,  and I attended 30 of our 31 meetings, missing only one for my son's sporting event.  Serving on this commission is a privilege and a commitment,  which I do not take lightly.  It is important to appoint commissioners who understand this commitment  and are dedicated to it.  If commissioners fail to regularly attend meetings,  we risk not having a quorum, which leads to meeting cancellation  and frustrates our purpose.  During my term, I was asked by Chico's Urban Forest,  and I was asked by the urban forest manager, Richie Bamlett,  to be a member of the Urban Forest Master Plan Working Group.  Being a part of this group was an honor and great fun,  and I'm extremely proud of the document that we created.  For those City Council members who have not had a plan to look at it,  the Urban Forest Master Plan is encyclopedic in its knowledge  of the current status of our city trees.  The Master Plan will help guide decisions concerning our urban forest over the next 40 years.  It has helped us to build a strong and sustainable urban forest system,  and it will help us to manage the city's trees today,  and will help ensure their health and longevity for future generations.  I'm very proud that I was a part of that process.  I've spoken with a couple of Council members separately at length over the past few months  about ways to improve communication between the Park Commission and the Council.  At times, what is discussed and voted upon at our Park Commission meetings  does not make its way to Council,  including guest presentations, items, and other activities.  We have also had a number of meetings where Council members have moved and voted upon complaints,  criticisms, concerns, and information from members of the public.  If these citizen advisory boards are to work,  the imperative items from our meetings must make their way to City Council.  I'm excited to implement some of the ideas that I've come up with to solve this problem.  For an optimal Commission, it's important to have Commission members who serve multiple terms,  because we know about long-term park and playground plans and projects,  and also know of long-term problems relating to our parks and playgrounds that have yet to be solved.  Repeat Commissioners also understand the procedures and policies within which the Commission must work,  and it's important to have persons on the Commissions who have established relationships with the City staff.  It will be imperative to have repeat Commissioners for the Commission to function at a high level,  since it is important to know your past to understand your present.  Thank you for the opportunity to speak with you.  Thank you for your consideration.  And thank you for your service to our community.  Thank you.  Frank Willis, followed by J.C. Kraut.  The paperwork says Frank, but as I pointed out to Councilor O'Brien earlier,  I've always been known as Larry when I had to put my full name.  I echo Megan's remarks about continuity on the planning,  on the Bidwell Park and Playground Commission.  I served for two years, really enjoyed it.  I think I did a really good job at the risk of blowing my own horn.  I have no political agenda.  I'm a registered declined estate.  I look at issues.  I look at the issues that are facing the park.  I've stayed current with the issues facing the park,  because I have probably as good a tenants record at the Bidwell Park Playground Commission.  I've been in the Bidwell Park Playground Commission meetings as some of the councilors,  because I've been, in the last two years since I was last on the commission,  I've attended virtually every meeting.  When I was a commissioner, I was very hands-on.  I'm retired.  I have lots of time.  When issues would be before the commission to change things in the park,  such as the gate at the equestrian center,  I was out there walking the property.  And commenting to the commission and sharing with the commission my findings  about how or whether it would even be affected.  I spent a lot of time with Richie Bamlett doing various projects through the city.  I represented the park commission on the centennial of the golf course.  If reappointed, I certainly will be a hands-on active commissioner again.  Thank you.  I think my background, I've been in this town for, well, since 1955.  So I have some background.  Been in the park for all those years.  I want to get back.  I want to serve.  I want to help solve the problems of the park.  I've stayed current with them.  And I would be honored if you would reappoint me to serve.  Thank you.  Thank you.  J.C. Krauth,  followed by Martin Nichols.  Good evening, mayor and council.  J.C. Krauth, I have applied for both planning commission and the bidwell park and playground commission.  A little about myself.  My wife and I moved back to Chico about three years ago.  After living here for some time, we had to leave and, you know, chase careers  and do things that just weren't available for us to do in Chico at the time.  So now being able to come back, you know, I welcome the opportunity to serve on one of these commissions.  Where I lived previously down in the city of Tracy, I served for about eight years on three different commissions,  on the transportation commission, on the planning commission, and was the vice chair of the parks and community services commission.  What I like about serving, you know, just in a quick nutshell, is the public participation in the process.  You know, you have seven counselors, you have seven commissioners, you have, you know, a few boards and commissions in a city.  And you have the responsibility to, you know, advocate and be the voice for the other 90 or 100,000 people that live in town.  And that's a big responsibility.  And that's what I always took seriously, you know, being on all those commissions is, you know, diving into what's going on.  Whether it was, you know, a new development that the planning commission was looking at.  You know, having all those maps.  Spread across my kitchen table.  And looking at, you know, what exactly was going on.  And reading all the EIRs and everything.  And just diving in and understanding.  And meeting with staff.  And meeting with, you know, residents and other concerned parties.  It's just, that is what I really enjoyed, was the public participation part of it.  And that's, I really welcome the opportunity to serve on either of these commissions.  And bring my experience from serving in another jurisdiction.  But also just my life experience.  My education.  My employment.  My background.  I just think I would be a great fit.  And I would welcome the opportunity.  And if any of the counselors want to reach out and have a conversation, be happy to do that.  Answer questions.  Or do whatever I can.  So, appreciate your time.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Martin Nichols followed by Ryan Sharp.  Good evening.  And congratulations to the new and returning council members.  My name is Martin Nichols.  I'm just completing a term as your airport commissioner.  I've served there for six years.  Two years as the vice chair.  And the last two years as the chairman of that.  I am also currently a member of the chief of police's policing community advisory board.  I offer you a career in local government.  I spent over 43 years as a county administrative officer, including Butte County.  And a city manager.  I also ran a number of local regional agencies dealing with telecommunication and technology issues.  For a while I was the registered lobbyist for Contra Costa County in Sacramento.  So I have a deep understanding of local government's issues.  I figure I've probably been to a thousand of these meetings in the last 40 years.  Both as staff and as participants.  So I have a deep understanding of parliamentary processes, the Brown Act disclosure laws,  how to get business done in a public setting, how to work out agreements with other members of the body to get things done.  I'm playing for both the planning commission and the city council.  And the parks commission.  Previously served on the paradise planning commission.  Which I was their chairman up there until we moved out of town.  We actually moved before the fire.  We were lucky.  I would appreciate your consideration for these appointments.  And I wanted to be brevett, brief here to respect your time.  And if you have any questions, I would be happy to answer them.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Ryan sharp followed by Joanna brooks.  Good evening, Mayor Reynolds, members of the council.  It's an honor to speak to you tonight.  My name is Ryan Sharp.  I own a home on West 11th Avenue.  I'm seeking appointment to both the Planning Commission and the Climate Action Commission.  For background, I grew up in the first-league bulldozer,  almond orchards that were comprised of Sacramento's growing suburban fringe back in the 1980s and 90s.  After high school, I went on to a 15-year career as an IT manager.  And I spent my time volunteering with the Sacramento Bicycle Office and Sacramento Bicycle Kitchen for about 10 years.  Doing that work was very rewarding.  It helped me learn that I appreciated helping people improve their transportation options personally  and then also helping municipalities improve their transportation networks.  That gave me the bug for transportation planning as a whole,  and I was happy to move on to a new career about 10 years ago in transportation planning and environmental planning.  Since then, I have written and helped write EIRs for the Hike the Rail project,  as well as work with...  with Fleet and Business Planning for the...  for Caltrans at the...  um...  Passage Rail Program.  Finally, during all that time, I also went back to school at Sac State,  got my Master's of Science in Urban Development,  which is a unique blend at Sac State of the MBA in Real Estate program,  as well as the Public Policy program,  giving me a unique insight into both...  about how both worlds speak.  I applied to these commissions because I know Chico will have to live for generations with the land use decisions we make,  and I know he's going to be doing it today.  And so those decisions need to be made as...  as informed and as well as possible.  It requires us to ask questions about...  about the...  about housing and transportation.  Will people be able to bike and walk?  Will they be car-dependent?  Is the community going to have a business case for a transit line now or in the future?  How...  How much will the units we're building going to cost?  Who are they building... being built for?  How will those units have...  What effect will those units have on the housing market as a whole as well?  We've got...  No...  No...  No...  No...  No product is done in a vacuum.  It's important to know...  to know the environment around them.  Also, there are long-term costs.  We need to look at the maintenance of...  of these new projects too.  As we build out new...  new linear miles of roadway and power and gas infrastructure and water and sewer,  the state...  the state will be paying for that for years to come,  and we need to make sure that the developments we have can...  can sustain that growth as well as the city as a whole.  I...  I...  I kind of see the state of Chico now as a state...  a city that's kind of growing both by choice and by a...  by circumstance.  We are the regional city.  We...  We're happy to tell that at...  at...  at...  at our Christmas time.  And inviting people to come here and shop.  That also means that we're...  we're high on attention for everybody...  everybody in the area.  We saw this at the campfires especially when...  when...  when most of Paradise came down here and...  and increased our population by 20% over a few days.  And we...  And since our...  we had a difficult housing situation before that.  It's important to know that we can...  that center that people need.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you. Joanna Brooks  followed by Grace Hopengarner.  Good evening, Council Members.  I'm excited to submit  my applications both to the Art Commission  and the Climate Action Commission.  I have extensive  experience working in the community  as well as at Chico State.  I serve on the Campus  Sustainability Committee at Chico State  and I've been involved in  various community  organizations. So I won't spend  a lot of time going over that. That information  is in my application, but  I look forward to being considered  to help support the great work that you do  in the community. Thank you.  Thank you. Grace Hopengarner  followed by Austin Barron.  Good evening, Members of City Council. My name is  Grace Hopengarner. Sorry about the pronunciation.  That's okay. Sorry.  Sorry.  No, that's okay.  Thank you for the opportunity to speak today regarding  my applications for the Climate, Airport, and Arts Commissions.  Chico is an incredibly beautiful town and while I was not born here, I feel fortunate  to find myself in a place like this. I am extremely passionate about fostering climate  sustainable practices and enhancing our local economy. As I mentioned, Chico is beautiful  and it needs to remain beautiful regardless of what growth takes place here. My background  in physics from UC Davis along with my ongoing master's degree in analytics, okay, I'm going .  . . . . . .  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem .  .  . . . . . . . .   .  work remotely as a data analyst for a healthcare technology consulting firm where I have developed  strong communication and technical programming skills. I believe that being involved in local  politics is essential for driving meaningful change in our everyday lives, and I would be honored  to be able to count myself as somebody who contributes to that change. Thank you for  considering my application, and I look forward to the possibility of contributing to our community  through these commissions. Thank you. Austin Barron, followed by Markita Goodman.  Good evening, Council. My name is Austin Barron. I'm a local commercial real estate broker,  a former architecture review board member, and a student of both Title 19, the general plan,  and even the airport land use commission. I use it almost every day in my real estate practice,  so I found myself in the position of being able to help and  support the community. I'm a former architecture review board member, and I'm a student of both  Title 19, the general plan, and I'm a student of both Title 19, the general plan, and I'm a student  fortunate enough to have a mentor of mine, George Bellin, pull me in about five years ago,  six years ago, and say I should apply for the architecture review board and use that knowledge  for good. So I served on that commission for four years. I'm applying today just for the  planning commission. I've been involved in multiple projects in the area on the real estate  and consulting side of things, and I feel like I would add a hands-on experience to that. I'm a  part of the city's  I think it really should be based on demand. We should build to suit our population, whether that  be commercial, residential, multifamily, high density, low density. We need to listen to the  citizens of Chicago, and we need to listen to the citizens of Chicago, and we need to listen to  the citizens of Chicago, the demand, the statistics, the facts, and really dive into these projects.  I know a lot of folks have their own agendas, and I think we need to take each project  individually, dissect it, and decide at that point if this is right for the city of Chico,  the citizens of Chico. So I want to thank you for your time today and for considering me for  this appointment. Thank you. Markita Goodman, followed by Anna Alexander.  Good evening, Mayor Reynolds and council members. Thank you so much for considering all of our  applications for these appointments, and thank you for giving us this time to share a little bit  more about ourselves. Most of my qualifications and all of that sort of information is all in my  application that you guys will take a look at. I just wanted to come today and see everyone's faces,  show my face, and just...  express my excitement about the potential opportunity to be able to serve on the Arts  Commission. As an artist myself, and as an artist who really became an artist here in Chico,  and has been given many opportunities to express myself here, it's really important to me that  those opportunities continue. It's important to me that they grow even bigger and that they're  recognized here. As a person who's lived here for a long time, I've been able to see a lot of  different places. The art scene here in Chico is very, very special. It is well beyond what you  typically see in a town of this size. The beauty of this city, the way that this city honors that  beauty, and the art here is just really exceptional. And I would be honored to serve on the  Commission to be able to keep that going. Thank you. Thank you. Anna Alexander, followed by  Dustin.  Good evening, Council Members, and thank you for hearing me out this evening. My name is Anna  Alexander, and I've applied to join on the Climate Action Commission. I'm an environmental historian,  and I research and write about fire hazards in urban settings. And I also teach courses about  the history of sustainability. Last semester, as I was preparing my final lecture for my history of  sustainability class, I was imploring my students to go out into the world and to do a lot of  research. And I realized I was not practicing what I preach. So I'm here today. I've applied for this  commission so that I can, you know, do what I'm telling my students to do. At my university, I've  served on every sustainability committee we have available, including the Climate Action Plan  Implementation Task Force, where I help to monitor the progress of our carbon neutrality goals. And  I'd like to bring that to the table. I'm going to start with you, Anna. Thank you. Thank you.  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  sustainability. Since moving back to Chico less than a year ago, I've become deeply involved in  our local historic preservation initiatives, driven by my belief that sustainability and  preservation go hand in hand. There's a saying among preservationists that the greenest building  is the one that's already standing. And conserving existing structures not only reduces our carbon  footprint, but it fosters community connections and helps to connect everyone to our shared past.  In the past year, I co-founded the Save the El Rey nonprofit. I became a member of the Beautiful  and Historic Chico Coalition, and I listed my own home very recently on the Chico's Historic  Resources Inventory. These initiatives bridge climate action and community engagement by  building awareness for preservation and adaptive reuse. I'm eager to practice what I preach to my  students and use my skills and experience to help on the ground.  podem  podem  podem !  podem  podem !

As the chair of the Butte County Film Commission, I'm working to bring film  productions to our region, highlighting Chico's unique charm and bolstering the local economy  through the arts. Beyond film, I'm deeply committed to preserving Chico's cultural heritage.  I work with Save the El Rey, focused on revitalizing the historic theater,  making it a thriving space for the arts and community gatherings. In the years since moving  to Chico, my wife and I have worked to get our home, the Enloe Mansion, onto the city's historic  registry. Additionally, I work with Metric Cosmetics, a local arts and media company,  creating multimedia content supporting local nonprofits such as Chat and the Jesus Center.  I believe the arts are vital to fostering a vibrant, connected community, and so with my  experience in performance production, preservation, and advocacy, I'm eager to contribute to the Arts  Commission work enriching Chico's cultural landscape.  The arts are not just a cultural cornerstone, but also a powerful driver of business development  and economic vitality. I'm eager to collaborate with local artists, organizations, businesses to  amplify the arts role and strengthen our community and economy. Thank you for considering my  application. Thank you. Lindsay Pullen, followed by Ken Rensink.  Good evening, Mayor and Council Members. My name is Lindsay Pullen, and I'm honored to  serve as the Director of the Chico Film Commission. I'm honored to serve as the Director of the  Chico Film Commission. I'm honored to serve as the Director of the Chico Film Commission. I have served  as a planning commissioner for the City of Chico since 2021. I stand before you to express my  sincere interest in being reappointed to the role again and to share why I am uniquely qualified to  continue serving our community in this capacity. Over the past several years, I've had the privilege  of helping guide the growth and development of Chico, ensuring that projects align with  Council's desires, our city values, and the vision for future, balancing progress with  preservation. I bring over 15 years of professional effectively effectively effectively  experience in construction management where I managed complex projects across the country  before returning home to Chico. My academic credentials further  enhanced my ability to approach challenges holistically and  with the city's long-term initiatives in mind.  As a planning commissioner, I work diligently to align our decisions  with the general plan while considering the social, economic, and environmental  impacts of every proposal. From reviewing zoning amendments  to addressing housing needs, I approach every issue with an open mind  guided by my commitment to the community's best interest.  My current role at Consolus Development has given me the comprehensive understanding  of sustainable development and community engagement, particularly  through my work at Merriam Park. Additionally, my time as chair  of the Architectural Review and Historic Preservation Board has deepened my appreciation  for preserving Chico's historical character while supporting  its evolution as a thriving community.  Beyond my professional qualifications, I am deeply committed to Chico. Whether teaching at Chico State,  serving on various boards, or engaging with the community, I am driven by a passion for our city's success.  Serving on Architectural Review and Historic Preservation  Boards since 2019 has further allowed me to help maintain Chico's unique character.  In this role, I evaluated proposals to ensure that they balance the needs of modern development  with the preservation of Chico's historical and architectural character.  This work has been a great experience for me. I am grateful to the board for their support.  This work strengthened my ability to navigate complex decisions that respect our city's past while planning for its future.  Beyond this role, I am a proud member of the Chico History Museum and the Chico Heritage Association.  The Chico Heritage Association in particular played a pivotal role in creating the City of Chico's  historic resource inventory, a cornerstone document that guides preservation decisions  and informs elements of the City's general plan and municipal code.  This work aligns closely with my commitment to protecting Chico's historical heritage.  This work is a great example of the Chico's historical landmarks.  Reappointing me to the Planning Commission would allow me to continue leveraging my expertise, leadership, and passion for Chico to support its growth in a thoughtful, inclusive, and strategic manner.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Ken Renzing followed by Jared Geiser.  Good evening, Council.  Good evening, Council.  Thank you for your time.  My name is Ken Renzing.  I've applied for a position on the Planning Commission.  A couple of you I've either served with previously on the Planning Commission or run against you for a City Council position.  So you know me and I've been around for a while.  In my first term, we approved the Chico General Plan 2030, sent it to Council for approval.  It was a very good plan.  I spent a lot of time working on that, working on the planning.  I've been a member of it.  And, you know, it kind of leads to this point of why do people want to serve on the Planning Commission?  Well, we've heard a number of reasons tonight, various things that people are interested in.  For me, I'm really interested in what could we do to make Chico a better community for all of us.  And I just want to help us make decisions the majorities of us can agree with.  And by way of example,  recently, you know, we had the citizens of Chico.  They needed to organize hundreds of people, spend hundreds of hours, thousands of dollars,  to get a referendum on the ballot against the Valley's Edge project,  which was then voted down by a solid majority.  It wasn't .50% plus one.  It was a solid majority of the citizens said that Valley's Edge did not meet Chico's goals.  But then we have, from a number of people's perspective,  a general plan that that project did seem to meet a vast majority of the goals.  So it seems we have a disconnect between the general plan and the community's desires.  And I think it's done a difference to all of us.  You know, the citizens are not getting the types of outcomes that they're wanting to see  in terms of the growth of Chico.  And it's not fair for developers or financiers to come and say,  here's a project and be told, hey, it meets all the parameters of the general plan of Title 19.  Go get them.  The city council approves it.  It's just that they're going to have it voted down by the citizenry.  So I would like to help solve those types of problems.  The planning commission is scheduled to meet about 20 times a year.  Twice a month.  I believe in the last two years they met about three or four times last year.  Met maybe six or seven times the year before.  And so we've already got the meeting time scheduled with the facilities, the staff.  The staff that we've had for years with the Chico City is just phenomenal.  Great staff to work with.  I'd like to suggest that let's get a jump on the 2030 general plan.  We don't need to wait until 2029  to begin to look at revising this.  And I think that we need to create a plan  the majority of the Chicoans can agree with  and avoid this type of community strife.  Thank you.  My experience and perspective could help us get there.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Jared Geiser.  Good evening, council and staff and everyone else watching at home and watching in here.  My name is Jared Geiser and I want to serve on a commission as a lifelong Chico resident.  I would like to use my skills and knowledge and experience to make a positive impact through public service on a commission.  My skills, knowledge and experience relate to the climate, which is why the Climate Action Commission is my top commission of choice.  I'm also a certified naturalist and love Bidwell Park so, so much.  Love the landscape there.  Love the ability for people to be able to get out of the urban area, stretch their arms and soak up the beauty of that park.  And I'm very committed to its protection, its continued position in our community.  So I did list the Parks Commission as a second choice.  And I also, another thing I have experience and knowledge in is planning.  I was a conservation planner for two years after college  and have a degree in geography and planning from Chico State.  So that is my third choice would be planning commission.  But really I want to be on the Climate Action Commission.  So that's what I'll talk about with you all today.  And so in my education at Chico State studying geography and planning,  I got an in-depth education on the earth and climate change and even local climate impacts  as well as greenhouse gas emission reduction strategies.  My professional experience as a conservation planner gave me greenhouse gas emission  accounting experience as well and experience planning for greenhouse gas emission reductions.  I also have extensive community engagement experience from working with nonprofits for several years.  And so I would, yeah, love the opportunity to serve on the Climate Action Commission,  serve the community and help support the Climate Action Plan that the city has adopted  as well as advise council on Climate Action Plan goals and accept public input, right?  Relating to climate action and also foster awareness and participation in the city's climate action efforts.  So yeah, I would love to serve and use my climate expertise to help the city of Chico reach our goals  and ensure a future here for all of us that would like to live in a climate stable world.  So thank you all so much.  I'd be happy to answer any questions.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Those were the speaker cards that were turned in from the applicants.  I would just like to thank you all for your time.  And I would just like to ask if there are any other applicants who did not fill out  a card but would like to address the council on their applications.  Okay.  I don't see any.  So that would conclude that portion of it.  And again, there's no action required tonight.  If the council could just go through the applications and then get your nomination forms into me,  the four council members that have the individual nominations, I'll bring you back a ballot  for the Airport Commission and to fill that climate action form.  So we'll have a three-day commission vacancy.  So you would have five new people on the climate action.  Any other questions?  And I just want to thank all the citizens who are here.  It's great when we have people who are interested in serving and giving up of their time to help our community.  So I do appreciate every single application.  I know it was everyone who applied for more than one commission had to complete an additional supplemental.  So thank you for your patience in that whole process.  Yeah, definitely.  I would like to follow that up with, you know, unfortunately there's only so many positions to fill and encourage everybody that if for whatever reason you're not chosen this time around, please do when it comes back in two years, apply again.  We can only fill so many positions and continue to stay involved in our amazing community.  So 5.2 would be confirmation of appointments to council member committees and other agencies and organizations.  I...  I think it's attached here.  Every...  I don't know if anybody has any questions or if we want to take speakers for...  Do we have any speakers on this, Madam Council?  We do.  We have one, Ryan Sharp.  Okay.  Well, let's take the speaker first and then we can have council discussion.  Okay.  Are you guys good?  Do you need a break or power through?  Thank you again, Council.  I understand that Council Member Goldstein is a...  is a Transfusion Planner Council...  Caltrans.  As a senior Council member for Caltrans, not myself, I want to highly recommend that we...  that if she's interested, that she be considered for the...  to represent Chico on the...  Sorry, the Council...  BCAG.  It's...  Chico has a unique opportunity now to have a Caltrans insider who can help Marshall Resources for both...  from both agencies.  We're...  We work together to kind of...  to elevate Chico and the county's profile with a very important state agency.  Thank you.  Thank you.  And that's all that we have for speakers.  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right.  And then I think we got a phone call today or a concern and about possibly Mr. Van Oberbeck doing PBID.  Is there a...  Mr. Lamb, is there a conflict with you doing PBID?  No, I don't have a problem with PBID.  Okay.  But I do have some concerns that the appointments to Internal Affairs and Finance are a good fit.  And I think it's a good fit with the skill sets of the council members.  So this is a city with a budget of $200 million.  And in my case, you know, I've decades of experience in large operating budgets and large financial transactions that I don't think anybody else on this council has.  And Internal Affairs is the wrong place for me to be.  All right.  Thank you.  the council.  along those lines I had some  mild dissatisfaction with the  appointments I looked at them I  think we ought to utilize the  special experience we have  among people in the council and  make sure we have dedicated  representatives for the seats  we have limited in many cases  just one representative for one  of those is the example council  member gave having all the  experience as ceo is an asset if  transportation and if he is  wish to serve on finance I think  that'  s appropriate. Another  council member Goldstein as the  public speaker mentioned she is  a transportation planner and takes  public transit is very familiar  with the system and both for the  minutiae of operating a good  system and for the long-term  planning I think we should be  utilizing her as a resource for  a representative there it is a  lot of work to advocate and she  only gets one representative on  these.  The third one is the vine of  groundwater !  effectively effectively  effectively effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  council member holly as the  vina gsa rep  i'll second that  all right we have a motion in a second okay all right and that was to approve the mayor's  appointments with switching out of council member uh excuse me vice mayor bennett would  move to iac and council member van overbeck would chair the finance committee um council  member goldstein would attend and be our representative for bcag and then for vina gsa  have a dedicated rep and that would be council member holly is that already staffed by staff i  think the vina gsa and so what you're asking for is no it also has council members okay all right  i would make a  substitute motion on that okay just a second let's see i would motion that we move um goldstein  to the or sorry goldstein to the alternate on sorry no holly's already on there as the alternate  that um i would stay the chair of the bennett would stay the chair of the finance committee  he's been doing that for two years now and he's been doing it very well what oh sorry three years  now i've been doing it very well um then  move van overbeck to the finance committee and to leave the rest of the commissions the way they are  okay so it was moved council member holly to uh it would leave vina gsa as is move van overbeck to  the um finance committee and leave bennett as the chair of that  and then who would be coming off a finance committee uh it would be holly coming okay  thank you  okay  substitute motion is there a second for that  second  okay  all right and then was there one change with council member goldstein  was or no that was a okay all right okay actually you know what i would add  to have goldstein be the alternate for bcag okay the alternate for bcag  okay council member goldstein no council member holly no council member o'brien yes council member  van overbeck no council member winslow no vice mayor bennett yes mayor reynolds yes it fails  three four and then we go back to the  original motion let me get there and that was um council member winslow seconded by goldstein i  believe is that correct okay yes um and that was to confirm the mayor's appointments with council  member van overbeck becoming the chair of the finance committee council member bennett being  moved to iac with council member goldstein going to bcag as a representative and to  uh put council member holly as the vina gsa um member is that correct  okay all right so let me do the vote there council member goldstein aye council member holly yes  council member o'brien no council member van overbeck yes council member winslow yes vice  mayor bennett no mayor reynolds no  it carries four three and then one thing that i would like to ask is that um just if we're going  to keep the committee meetings at the same time i believe it's the first monday of um the month  for iac at one o'clock and finance committee is the fourth the fourth wednesday at 8 30.  will those times still work for the finance committee  and iac that way we can get them scheduled and alert the public that they're going to stay on  the same days what we did for last time is we left them at those original times and then when they  meet for the first time they decide because iac ended up moving to like the first monday of the  month or something like that okay so we'll keep them for the next round of this next month and  then we'll go from there okay thank you thank you all right reports and communications the  following reports and communications and items of the committee meetings at the same time iac  and the council members are provided for the council members information no action can be  taken on items under this section unless council agrees to include
