 Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Beautiful. Please stand and join me in the Pledge of Allegiance. Salute. What do we do to justify the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands for one nation, one god, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all? All right. Madam Clerk, you do roll, please. Okay. Council Member Bennett. Here. Council Member Morgan. Here. Council Member Tandon. Here. Council Member Van Overbeck. Here. Council Member Winslow. Here. Vice Mayor Reynolds. Here. Mayor Coolidge. Present. All right. Welcome, everybody. Thanks for being here tonight. We'll start with a closed session announcement from City Attorney John Lamb. Thank you, Mayor of City Council. Earlier this evening, the City Council recessed in closed session. All council members were present during closed session. On item 2.1, Conference with Labor Negotiators, Councilwoman Tandon did recuse herself from the SEIU bargaining group discussion. Thank you. She was present for all other bargaining group discussions. For 2.1, the Council was provided an update. Direction was provided. No final action was taken. For items 2.2, City Council was briefed. Direction was provided. No final action was taken. That concludes my report. All right. Thank you very much. Speaker, Card Announcement, anybody wishing to address the Council, there's cards at the back of the room. Turn them into the clerk. To my left, to your right. And you need to, once completed, that your cards are taken. In the order they are received for each individual item. And then once the first speaker begins on that particular item, no additional cards will be taken. So we are going to start with a proclamation for Holocaust Remembrance Day. And I believe I have a couple of the synagogues here in town. Three of them. Come join me at the podium. We appreciate that. Yeah. I'm trying to get over the rope without falling. All right. How are you this evening? I'm doing well. Good, good. So why don't we have you guys each introduce yourselves and say which thing you represent. My name is Lauren Huberman. I'm the president of Shiloh Ha'Ara. I'm Rabbi Nisrael Kort, the congregation of Israel. Rabbi Nenad Sidbal, and I'm from the . All right. We have the same proclamation for each of you, but we're happy to do this for Holocaust Remembrance Day. So whereas the Holocaust, which resulted in the murder of nearly 6 million Jews, 1.5 million of who were children, comprising one-third of the Jewish people, in addition to the killing of missions of members of other nationalities, minorities, and other targeted groups and individuals, will forever be a warning to all the people of the dangers of hatred, bigotry, racism, and prejudice. Whereas the city of Chico affirms celebrating our nation's history. Our Jewish citizens and recognizes this remembrance of the Holocaust as a key component in the prevention of further acts of genocide and ignoring the historical facts of those terrible events increases the risk that they will be repeated. Now, therefore, be it resolved that I, Andrew Kulijmir, the city of Chico, on behalf of the city council, do hereby proclaim January 27, 2024, as Holocaust Remembrance Day in the city of Chico. Invite our citizens to pause and remember the victims and survivors of the Holocaust to learn from its minstreligity and to identify and oppose all expressions of anti-Semitism. And with that, I would actually like to pause and have a brief moment of silence. All right, thank you so much for being here today. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. All right, so we will move on to a presentation from Butte County Opioid Settlement Overview with Scott Kenley, director of Butte County Behavioral Health. There he is. All right, take it away, Scott. Good evening, Mayor Kulij, members of the council, Scott Kenley, director for Butte County Behavioral Health. I think there's been a little bit of confusion about my presentation today. It's being put forth as informational only. However, there was a request for an action item at the end, but given that it's not been agendized, this will be an overview that has that request in it, and if you want to take action in the future, I'm happy to come back. But thank you for having me here. I was last here a couple years ago, and we were talking about homeless and mental health, and a lot of things have happened with Butte County since that last meeting I had with you. Senate Bill 43 passed, redefining grave disability for individuals with mental illness. Proposition one is going to the ballots in March to vote for everyone about the Mental Health Services Act and housing. Care Court is coming this December to Butte County, and our mobile crisis teams have gone 24 hours a day, seven days a week as of December 31st. But today, I want to focus on Butte County Opioid Settlement presentation, which is something that counties and cities elected to enter into as a nationwide settlement to resolve opioid litigation brought on by the state to the states and local political subdivisions against the three largest pharmaceutical distributors and against the manufacturer Janssen Pharmaceuticals and its parent company, Johnson & Johnson. The settlement resulted in a payout of distributors of up to $26 billion to counties and cities over the next 18 years. This opioid settlement funding is overseen by the Department of Healthcare Services, and if you opt into this project, you are required to have extensive data collection and reporting requirements. It's my understanding that the City of Chico is one of the recipients of this award, as well as the City of Oroville and the county. So, a little bit about it. The state requires 50% of all the funds spent on the opioid settlement project to be spent on something called high impact areas, and I'll be getting into what those look like. The remaining funds can be also spent on high impact areas or in other abatement categories developed by the state. High abatement impact areas include substance use disorder facilities within the behavioral health continuum of care, meaning you could be funding existing substance use treatment services that are currently in place and expanding them. You could also add new or expanding substance use treatment services that aren't necessarily attached to the county, but you might want to see in the county. You can also fund communities of color and vulnerable populations that are disproportionately impacted by substance use disorders. You could also fund diversion of people with substance use disorders from the criminal justice system and helping them get into treatment. And lastly, one of the other high impact strategies is interventions for the prevention of drug addiction in vulnerable youth. And again, 50% of all your opioid settlement money has to go to one of these five or a number of these five impact areas. The remaining 50% is discretionary, and counties or cities can choose four abatement strategies, which are listed in front of you, which include naloxone or Narcan, the overdose drug that we're all familiar with, medication assisted treatment, which is a form of treating someone with an addiction to help them with cravings and withdrawals. Folks, you can focus on pregnant and postpartum women. You can expand the treatment of neonatal abstinence syndrome. You can expand warm handoff programs and recovery services, or you can focus on the treatment of incarcerated populations. You could also fund prevention programs. You could expand service programs or fund evidence-based collection and research, analyzing the effectiveness of state abatement strategies. So as for the county, the Board of Supervisors elected three projects after looking at all of those issues. The largest of the three was a sobering center to be located in Chico. That is a high impact or high abatement project. It's one of the mandatory projects. The other two were falling in the secondary category, which would be jail-based medication assisted therapy. The sheriff would like to have medications offered to inmates who come in who have addiction issues to get them on treatment so that they can successfully discharge out of the jail in treatment and on medications so that when they leave, they don't relapse and die right away and they can have a chance to resume a normal life. The third one public health chose was monitoring overdose detection methods. It's a mapping application program. Basically it's a long word of saying they have a software program that tracks outbreaks. There's a fentanyl outbreak or an opioid outbreak somewhere. The software tracks it somewhere, anywhere in Butte County based on law enforcement responses or EMS responses so that we can rally services and supports to the different areas that have overdoses. So the sobering center is really why I'm here today. A little bit about a sobering center. It's a 24-hour day, seven-day a week, fully staffed program where people go, they are high, they are drunk, they are encountered in the community by 911, law enforcement officers, emergency medical technicians are walking on the street. You can see they are sometimes they are under the influence. Law enforcement has historically cited individuals like that or incarcerated individuals like that or in more extreme cases sent them to the emergency room to get medically detoxed. Taking someone who is a serial inegbriate or addict to the jail is a long process. It's not necessarily getting you the outcomes you want, but the person oftentimes ends up back on the street and doesn't get the treatment that they need. A sobering center is an alternative for law enforcement to engage an individual and if they are willing and willing to go, take them to the sobering center and get a drop off within 10 minutes. It's not a long trip to Oroville. It's a 10 minute drive to the location here in Chico, 10 minute check-in process and law enforcement's back on the street catching bad guys, which is what their job is. So the county really wanted to see a sobering center and so we went out to RFP, which is called a request for proposal. Horizon Treatment Services, which is an entity down in the Bay Area which has a number of sobering centers, was the successful respondent for this program. The challenge is the annual cost to operate a 24 hour, 7 day a week sobering center that can serve up to 14 individuals at a time is $2 million a year. The sticker shock is a little high for us because as far as our board went, we allocated $965,000. We had never done one before. There were only 10 sobering centers in California and they were multi-million dollar programs and we were looking for a scaled down version. If you take six people a day and they all have Medi-Cal and they go to the sobering center and we can bill for that, it's about $328,000 and change in revenue per year. If all 14 people go to that sobering center with Medi-Cal, it's a much larger number. So we have a very conservative estimate on what the numbers are. And the reason we picked six people was I spoke to Chico PD, Chico State law enforcement, Orville PD, Paradise PD, and Gridley PD and we looked at all the arrest records for the last two years and on average there were six people a day that went to jail for being under the influence. They said absolutely guaranteed these people would be appropriate for a sobering center. We know a lot of law enforcement encounters don't end up with people going to jail. Sometimes they are cited, sometimes they are not arrested. There's a lot more people out there that have addiction issues that are just not going to be engaged, particularly in the homeless population. So the remaining unfunded amount for our sobering center is $706,500 give or take if we increase the funding for Medi-Cal revenue and billing. So the request that I was bringing to you today was to request a partner on the sobering center with the opioid funding that you have as well as our plan to reach out to Orville City Council as well. I'm ready to begin discussions with them because they have an opioid allocation. And I think that's a great point. But they are the same type of program. But they are the same type of program. But they are the same type of program. But they are the same type of program. But they are the same type of program. But they are the same type of program. But they are the same type of program. But they are the same type of program. But they are the same type of program. But they are the same type of program. But they are the same type of program. But they are the same type of program. But they are the same type of program. But they are the same type of program. But they are the same type of program. But they are the same type of program. But they are the same type of program. But they are the same type of program. is. We wanted law enforcement to stay on the streets. In Chico, it's a pretty easy drive for our law enforcement to go to the sobering center. It will be located at 560 Cohasset, right next to our crisis services. So law enforcement is used to coming in and dropping people off on 5150s. They could also come in and drop people off who need to be treated for their addiction issues. Ridley, Paradise, not so much. That's a long drive for them. It's a little easier for them to go to the jail than perhaps come down to Chico and enter into sobering center. So part of this program includes transportation. This provider will arrange for transportation to go out to Ridley, Paradise, or Oroville and pick up individuals that law enforcement has encountered or EMS has encountered that are willing to get help and drive them to the sobering center to connect them, allowing law enforcement to remain on the streets and to continue to serve and see bad guys and not necessarily deal with drunks and alcoholics and addicts. So what my request to you tonight was going to be was to to consider using what looks like you have unspent opioid settlement funding in the amount of about $119,000 a year that you could put towards the sobering center to continue to add resources to our community to serve people with addictions that are not getting help right now. The piece I did forget to or neglect to tell you is part of the sobering center experience is someone gets taken to the center. They can stay up to 24 hours in that facility. It's unlocked, but they are having that as an alternative. They are sobered up. There are shower facilities, there's food, there's laundry facilities cleaned up, and then our drug and alcohol counselors come on site and literally meet with those people during that very small window of motivation where they might go, I'm kind of tired of being arrested or maybe I'm ready for some change. If that person's available and ready to get help, we walk them 100 yards down the hallway into our drug and alcohol services where we can start them on medication for their addiction and drug and alcohol counseling. So seeing people on the streets, citing them, having them cajoled and told, go to behavioral health and you have an appointment in two or three days, they never show up. Their addiction takes back hold. They start using their own drugs again and they never get help. But if they're brought into a sobering center and as soon as they sober up and they're coherent enough to understand what's going on and we can connect them, we have a much better chance of getting the cycle of addiction broken. So thank you for hearing my prep proposal for informational questions. I'll see you in the next session. If you have any questions or comments, please ask. All right. Questions? I have a quick question for you. Do you have a hard deadline on this of when you need to know from us? I would tend to agendize this for a future conversation. But is this... So we have the horizon selected as the provider. We told them that we would like to have our funding in place in the next month. The goal is to have the sobering center up and open by July 1st. So the ideal would be within the next 30 days that we secure the funding. We're not going to have the funding in alternative places. Year today, I'm going to the CCP meeting tomorrow. I'm trying to get on the schedule for next month as well. And so there's no hard deadline. That's it. That's... Awesome. Well, I can't thank you enough for bringing us this information. And I, for one, would be super excited to ask us later in the meeting to agendize this and hopefully we can contribute our opioid funds towards that. But that's just me not speaking for the entire Council. And if the Council chooses not to support the sobering center... I'm hoping today that you heard there's other resource options that you can contribute towards to help with drug and alcohol addiction in the county, regardless of what direction you go. I have a question for our city manager. Were you planning on bringing this to the regular agenda at some point? Yes. Currently, last I looked, we had about $342,000 in opioid settlement funds. We're trying to get a better understanding of what that looks like on an annual basis. But yeah, we can bring that back in the next month or so. All right. So we don't need a Council request per second. All right, Mr. Kennelly. Thank you very much. Appreciate your time. Any further questions from Council? Thank you. Thank you. All right. From here, we'll move on to the consent agenda. All matters listed on consent agenda are considered routine in nature and can therefore be enacted in one motion. Please note that the December 5th minutes were amended on item 2.1. Do we have any speakers? We do not. Okay. Any Council disqualifications or no votes on the consent agenda? All right. Seeing none, entertain a motion. Move to approve. Second. Motion and second. Madam Clerk, are you ready? Okay. Council Member Bennett? Yes. Council Member Morgan? Yes. Council Member Tandon? Yes. Council Member Van Overbeek? Yes. Council Member Winslow? Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds? Aye. Mayor Kulich? Aye. Carries 7-0. All right. Public comment? Members of the public may address the Council at this time on any matter not already listed on the agenda and within the jurisdiction's authority. The Council cannot take any action at this meeting on request made under this section of the agenda. How many speakers? We have four. Four. Three minutes, please. Okay. And I'll call the first two names. And if you could line up in the middle aisle. Julie Threatt followed by Nicole Nava. Good evening, Council. Thanks for coming. Thanks for having me this evening. A couple things. I wanted to recognize one of your organizations that's based here in Chico. It's called 530 Food Rescue. It's part of the Community Action Agency of Butte County. Every week I get to go rescue food. So every Thursday morning I go to Panera Bread, get whatever's left over, and take it out to Chico State to their pantry. And in the afternoon I go to Mondo's, pick up what they have left over, and take it to the Boys and Girls Club. What I found this week is I had two extra rescues that just popped up. And you get a little app on your phone called 530 Food Rescue. And so these ones allow me to go pick up food. I picked up food from Anlow Hospital and take it out to one of the community housing improvement project, low-income facilities. There was one on—it's a Creekside place on Notre Dame. And then I went up to one on Esplanade. So you get out in the community. You get to actually say, hey, look at all this housing that we offer that you don't always hear about in the community. I wanted to recognize that. Number two, I wanted to recognize your skating rink. My youngest granddaughter, last Friday she got to go out there skating for the first time. So yeah, I really think this is an important opportunity. All five grandkids loved it. So I'm going to cry. I got the cabana. Okay, now on to more important business. So you guys are being sued for this Cal Park Hotel debacle up in my territory. So again, it's one of those things where bad decisions just keep getting worse and worse. And now we're on the hook for a lot of legal money. And that's going to be going to court here in February. So we'll be following that. And lastly, 2024, a lot of you are up for reelection. And I want to encourage you to think about joining an organization called Politicians Against the Shot. So there's 84 of us that are running across the country, six of us in California that are fighting these vaccines and wanting them halted immediately. Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo just joined the group, as did Assemblyman Massey, Marjorie Taylor Greene, and Senator Ron Johnson. So please take a look at that opportunity. Let me know if you want to join me and Dr. Mary Talley Bowden in getting an opportunity to just really take care of one of these debacles and make sure that we don't take money from Big Pharma as our contributions. Thank you. Thank you. Nicole Nava, followed by Bill Monroe. Thank you and good evening. A few quick things. It would be great to have the deck that Scott Kennelly shared. That was nice. I don't know if it's up there. And I'm enthused about that topic as well. I think it would be so important. I'd want to know, like, are those other cities kicking in as well? Because I think he said 14 beds. That won't go far. Other thing, funding sources and city proposed improvements. There's been so much in the news of so many things. Things that are up for possibilities for Chico. The downtown kind of a rehab. Everything happening down the Esplanade. Improvements over the freeway, et cetera, et cetera. Housing projects and all of that. A lot of people get head up and worried because, you know, roadways are a big thing. So you see that online and there's a lot of misconceptions about, well, is this taking away from funds that would go to do our roads? We have to do roads first. I'm wondering if the city could perhaps proactively post something on your social media sites. To kind of make sure that we always name if there is a funding source associated with it. Sometimes the papers don't always include it. Sometimes it does. And I think it would help people. And we could go ahead and share those from various platforms because it might help calm down some of the noise and misinformation and then focus on really what you're proposing. And does it make sense for Chico so people can kind of weigh things with their critical thinking skills and think what do we want our city to look like? Which also brings me to the next question. Which is, are the Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese such as like, well, this should happen in a special planning area. Just so everyone knows, that is a designated special planning area. So I think it's really important that you're factual when you share things. It's one thing to disagree, but it's another thing to share misinformation about it. So I hope we can all do better and stretch and grow and think about ways we can be positive in the community getting things done. So to that note, I'll close on the safe space thing. I wasn't here last time. I'm it's still a mess in front of the 7-Eleven or it was as of a little bit. I mean, it's worse. It's wrapped all the way. And now it's on the private property all across the front. And so I actually agree with Councilman Addison Winslow about downtown businesses that have violations. Everyone should be treated the same. And so people need to work on addressing those things. And that would include that area. But I would also say, OK, those of you business owners who have work to do out there, let's work on that together. Because I agree people shouldn't be called out specifically. So thank you for your time tonight. Thank you. Bill Monroe, followed by Eli Sabi. Hi. Thank you so much for this opportunity. This is a very democratic thing. And I love the fact that you're able to come and express yourself before the dice. And I just can't resist coming to speak up here, even when I don't have a whole lot. But I'll tell you, back after the Paradise Fire, there were. I think it was before the council several times, the concept of having. I know this is coming up later about parking on the street. But about allowing folks to sleep in their cars on public lots. And I wonder if that's a possibility to take up. It's certainly warmer and drier inside your car than it is in a. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A..... pretty much that's true Addison they do when they're not riding their bike so I think it would be a it'd be good there are public parking lots like the place where you park over by 99 to commute that could be like open from like 9 at night until 8 in the morning or something like that 7 in the morning for people to park their car and sleep overnight no why not maybe the the best biggest expense would be to have maybe to put up a porta potty or something but anyway that's that's my idea I'm also a public health nurse and I love vaccines thank you thank you our last speaker is Eli Sabi hey I just want to take a moment I know that we all have thoughts and they're not all good ones so I like to take a moment and I know that we all have thoughts and they're not all good ones so I like to take a moment and I know that we all have thoughts and they're not all good ones so I like to just pause now regardless of what you see when you look at me I'm not an idiot I have you know degrees in political science communications women's studies Asian Studies American Studies Media Studies I've worked in public service juvenile Departments I've worked in homeless shelters I've worked in corporate America and yeah with all this indoctrination and schooling I can't understand the the a couple things about this city that I graduated from Chico High in. And I don't have dance charts. I don't have elaborate presentations. I don't have bullet points. And I don't have handouts. And I don't have samples. It's just me and God. And simply put, I got to say, your lips are far from your heart. There is scripture under there. When you say you're a city for your people, and yet you value money, you effectively shut down all porta-potties, all restrooms, all outlets. Even those people that have ankle bracelets can't even charge and meet your requirements. You've taken away water and hoses and spigots. You pay electricians to go to residential houses that are on public streets to cut off homeless people. Well, we value people. Yet you have, thank you, grant money, free charging for Tesla, in your city hall parking lot. Your lips are far from your heart. Maybe. I mean, something to consider, please. In addition to that, it's my understanding that landscaping for the city of Chico is often contracted out to a large or small contractor in Yuba City. Maybe think about your priorities. Are you employing your city people to do your work? you can't serve God and mammon. Not that you need to serve God, but here's the thing about your lips and your heart. You sit here and you pray. You sit here and you say, we ask for a moment of silence. And then you go out and you just kick homeless people across the city. Anyway, just some things to think about. And then I just, I guess I'll leave you with one last thing. Yes. Oh, maybe it's the house that's not the problem. It's not that they don't have walls. They'll be the same. A lot of people would look just the same as they do on the street. If you pull a wall around them, they haven't learned some things. But maybe it's the value we place on families and people that are causing our problems. And a nation, a family can survive without a nation, but a nation or a city cannot survive without a solid family. I yield my time. God bless. Thank you. All right. We'll move on to public hearings. Item 4.1, hearing regarding proposed development agreement between City of Chico and Casino Chico. And I believe we have a report from Kelly Murphy, Senior Planner. And then we'll do ex parte communications and open the public hearing and have speakers. Thank you. Good evening, everyone. I'm Kelly Murphy, Senior Planner. I'll be providing a brief verbal presentation on the proposed Casino Chico development agreement herein referenced as DA 2301, as some of you may recall, approximately one year ago in January of last year, the Chico City Council approved an ordinance amending Title 19 of the Chico Municipal Code to allow a card room land use in the downtown North Zoning District subject to an approved use permit. The applicant and owner of the Casino Chico card room, John Scott, has since obtained use permit approval to relocate his existing seven-table card room from its current shared premises, on East Avenue, to the commercial office building at 325 Broadway Street in downtown Chico. As part of the project, the applicant volunteered an annual contribution to the City of Chico equivalent to 5% of gross receipts generated from card game participation fees for the benefit of the downtown area. The City Attorney's Office determined that a development agreement, or DA, is the most appropriate mechanism to facilitate this proposal, and therefore a condition of approval will be issued. The proposal was placed on the use permit issued for the project. The proposed DA does not grant Casino Chico any deviations from the City's applicable development standards. The primary purpose of the proposed DA is to facilitate the development of an approved project and preserve the effectiveness of Use Permit 2209 by satisfying a required condition of approval. No public comments have been received on this item in advance of this meeting, and the project has previously been determined exempt from further environmental review. So, with that, the Community Development Director and Planning Commission recommend that the City Council introduce the following ordinance as shown on Attachment A by reading of its title only. That concludes the report from staff. I can take any questions, or I'd be happy to turn it over to our applicant. All right. Questions? Yes. Mr. Brennan? I've read, I scanned the document, and I didn't read it closely enough, and I just had a thought. Is that 5% going to be targeted at downtown Chico, or is it a 5% going into the general fund someplace else? The latter. It would go into the general fund. Okay. Thank you. All right. Further questions? I was going to ask the applicant, but I'll ask the planner. Of that 5%, it came to my attention recently that some of the cannabis dispensaries that we gave licenses to, it said, oh, we're going to do this benevolent thing and give money back to the City, but they're actually charging the customers, and it's like, it doesn't say City of Chico tax, but it's pretty obnoxious. Can we make sure that the card room doesn't do that? Sure. I think we could confirm that with our applicant. Do you understand the spirit of the question, John? I completely understand. You can't talk, but thank you. Not yet at least. That's not happening. Not yet at least. We'll give you, we'll give you. So further questions? All right. Thank you very much. Thank you. Madam Clerk, can you refresh our memory as we go? I think it's just a little bit of a surprise as to how this has to go for a public hearing. So typically you would hear from the applicant first. Mr. Scott has indicated that he can answer questions if you have any. So he would go first, and then we have one other speaker, and that's Julie Three. Typically you give the applicant 15 minutes and you give everyone else three. All right. And ex parte communications which you can do now as well, if we have any. Anyone? No, none. Okay. All right, Mr. Scott, floor is yours for 15 minutes or fewer if you so desire. I won't need 15 minutes. Thank you. It's nice to see all of you again and all of you and all of you. I appreciate that an entire community and all its representatives have worked very, very hard for a project that I've been working on for about 35 years. And in particular, Kelly Murphy, where'd you go, Kelly? There you are, who has just been a godsend in the amount of work she's done to put this together. I'm amazed that we're this far and I'm standing here today. Sean, I like what you brought up, making sure that I don't pass on that 5% to my customers. That would really stink. And my customers would be the first. The first ones to let me know. It would be loud. That's not going to happen. I've lived in Chico since May 1978. There's been a few changes since then, particularly with my hairline. But this is my community. This is where I've spent my life and this is where I'll spend the rest of my life. And so anything that can benefit the community automatically benefits myself. And my. Family. It's a win-win. Beyond that, this has been discussed over and over and over again. And so we're just here now with the mechanism that allows me to donate some money back to this community that's given me such a wonderful life. So I don't have a whole lot more to add to that, but I'm certainly available for any questions or jokes or anything else that one might like to participate in. We have questions. I have a question slash comment. Rhetorical question. We have a lot of guests in the room tonight that maybe haven't heard this before. But I get a lot of times like, oh, my gosh, there's going to be people hanging around all out front smoking. And people are getting arrested at the casino all the time. And it's going to be horrible and it's going to be awful and all those things. Can you speak to some of your how things are going currently at your current location and what you expect to happen at your new location? Well, I can tell you that we opened up at our current location on October 18, 2018. Since that time, there has been zero request from our side for law enforcement. Now, we are located in somebody else's establishment, which is Quackers Bar and Grill. I don't own Quackers. I don't own the bar. And there's probably been two or three or four incidents where law enforcement. Has it had to come over behavior from those on the other side? In other words, not the card room side, but the side where people drink and they misbehave from time to time. We have, you know, being in the gaming business, we're required by the state to basically have everything on film. Short of you being in the bathroom. If you come to Quackers restaurant, we've got you on film. You know. If you come to the card room, we have you on film. So we've been able to assist law enforcement on more than one occasion with digging up video to help them solve problems that have nothing to do with the card room. Bringing that, you know, extrapolating that to downtown. We want to be not just a good neighbor. We want to be a great neighbor. We're going to have we have three sides. You know, one side of our building is attached to another building. But the other. Three sides is the sidewalk. It's a parking lot. It's behind the building. We're going to have cameras on all three sides, plus everything on the interior. And if there is ever a problem outside and I'm not referring to our business, but if there's ever a problem outside, we want law enforcement to come to us quick as possible because we're going to have video. Right. If we can if we can help. That's awesome. But as far as, you know, what card players do. They don't cause problems. You know, occasionally somebody gets grumpy when they lose. You know, that's human nature. So you might hear a unique combination of four letter words, you know, as they leave. But beyond that, we're just people that like to play poker. I hope that wasn't too much information. No, that's perfect. Thank you for answering. OK. All right. Mr. Van over there. Mr. Scott, I appreciate your confidence and investment in downtown. Question for you. You is how long has it been since you started this process to be downtown? Yes. Nineteen ninety one. No, no. I mean, this latest iteration, not not not when you were. Well, we could go with twenty fourteen when I had kind of a failed event with the city council at that time. And then we could go with twenty. Nineteen shortly after we opened at Quackers and I began to communicate with various leaders within the city that I thought this would be a good idea. But this has gone on for me, you know, forever. It seems like I'm I'm having a hard time for three or four years would be without a question. OK. And I have one more thing, and this is directed to the chief. Chief, I just like to get your confirmation that you have not had law enforcement problems related to card playing and Mr. Scott's current location. We don't have anything associated directly with Mr. Scott's business. It's just with the the address there and particularly mainly comes from the bar area. Right. You know, but I can't say without certainty. Or with certainty that. The people that we contact in the parking lot haven't at some point visited in his establishment. I just know that we don't get calls from his. What I'm trying to get at is Mr. Scott's characterization of the law enforcement involvement in his business. The way he characterized that you would agree with. Absolutely. OK. Great. Thank you. I have no more. All right. Further questions. Perth comment. Mr. Scott. I'm good. All right. Thank you very much. Thank you. And you'll have rebuttal time if you want it. Sorry. You'll have rebuttal time after the speaker. No problem. Thank you. So we do have two speakers. Julie three followed by Lee and pal. All right. Three minutes. Thank you very much. And I don't have an issue with the establishment. In fact, I like to play cards. So and maybe if we could add sports betting or horse racing, that'd be great. Anyway, I'm thinking more about the money and planting a seed on what to use with the five percent. So we're always hearing about the libraries. They're not open. Right. I mean, everywhere I go, the county meetings and here at this one, too. So last month, the county entertained a consultant to talk about a statewide or countywide parcel tax measure and then a sales tax. And that was particularly for library protection. So Biggs, Chico, Durham, Gridley, Orville, Paradise and mobile libraries. So seven libraries. The estimated one point seven million they would need for all seven. So if I do the math, it's a couple hundred thousand dollars if we were to use this money to keep open the Chico libraries for a lot longer. So I wanted to plant that seed. This isn't going to go forward, this parcel tax, but they are going to try to put a one percent sales tax on the on the county in November. I think that has a high probability of failure, given what we're all kind of experiencing. So, again, just planting a seed on what to use the five percent for, for our libraries. Thank you. Thank you. Our last speaker is Leanne Powell. Leanne? Leanne? Leanne? Leanne? Leanne? Leanne? Hi, my name is Leanne Powell, and I own a business down on 3rd Street. I'm not opposed to your business as a card room and playing cards. However, I did receive a notice in the mail saying that they wanted to also lift the ban on the ordinance on bringing in more alcohol to this establishment. And so I wanted to know if it's okay if I address that. Okay. So I am very concerned about the possibility of opening up another bar downtown Chico. Actually, that's a different item on the agenda. We should wait until that item is called. Yeah, sorry. So do you want me to just wait and go on the next one? Wait and go on that one, yes. Okay, thanks. But if you have anything further to say about the card room, you're welcome to. All right. Okay. That is it for speakers. All right. Mr. Scott, you waive your rebuttal to end. I waive my rebuttal. Rebuttal time. I waive my question. All right. Council Member Tannen. So it talks about here that the 5% of the gross receipts generated from the card room are specifically for the benefit of the downtown area. So if it's going to the general fund, is it going to be dedicatedly spent on the downtown? Because this is what it says here in our report. Thank you. That would be up to you all. During the budget process, how you want to allocate those funds. Okay. I just wanted the clarification because it was said that it would go to the general fund, but here it states that it will be for the benefit of the downtown area. Mr. Vick, it can go to the general fund and then be determined by you to go to the benefit of the downtown. Okay. So it's not necessarily that it will go to the downtown area at this point unless we say that. No. I think it's your prerogative and I'll work with the city manager to ensure that there's some form, but it could be, that's a pretty broad benefit. And my understanding is it's something in the neighborhood of $100,000 a year estimated, but I'll let Mr. Scott clarify if he has a different number. All right. Thank you. Okay. Okay. Further discussion. I can read it. The clerk can read the wording if the person making it. Second. Go ahead. All right. Okay. There is a motion and a second to introduce the following ordinance by reading of title only. Ordinance of the City Council of the City of Chico approving development agreement 23-01 between the City of Chico and the Casino Chico, Cardroom, Scott. Council Member Bennett. Yes. Council Member Morgan. Yes. Council Member Tandon. Yes. Council Member Van Overbeck. Yes. Council Member Winslow. Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds. Yes. Mayor Coolidge. Aye. Carries 7-0. Congratulations, Mr. Scott. All right. Item 4.2, Code Amendment 23-01, Proposed Ordinance of the Leading Chief of Municipal Code Section 19.44.040, Downtown North. District. Special Standards. Mr. Mayor, I need to recuse myself on this one. All right. I have a financial interest in a bar restaurant downtown. Okay. So we'll wait for Mr. Van Overbeck to leave the room, and then we will continue. And we have Associate Planner Molly Marcus. Marcus. Mark Cusin. Marcuson. There we go. I was right at the first. Good evening. Mayor, Vice Mayor, and Council. At its September 2023 meeting, Council directed staff to proceed with the Code Amendment to delete Chico Municipal Code Section 1944-040, Downtown North Special District Standards. CMC Section 1944-040 limits the establishment of new alcohol beverage establishments or bars in the Downtown Zoning District. The City of downtown will not be able to use the code. Deleting 1944-040 from the Municipal Code will remove the restriction on new bars in the Downtown area, allowing the City to rely on existing regulatory mechanisms to approve and condition new bars on a case-by-case basis. Any new bar in the Downtown area requires determination of public convenience or necessity, which gives Council the ability to approve or deny such requests. Further, the City's existing alcohol beverage establishment zoning review process, which is required for all businesses which sell alcohol, affords the ability to incorporate City-recommended conditions on the ABC license. Planner Molly Marcus. Vice Chair Birx. Vice Chair Birx. Vice Chair Birx. Vice Chair Birx. Vice Chair Birx. Vice Chair Birx. Vice Chair Birx. Vice Chair Birx. Vice Chair Birx. Vice Chair Birx. Vice Chair Birx. Vice Chair Birx. Vice Chair Birx. Vice Chair Birx. Vice Chair Birx. no type 48 licenses available for sale in Boone County. While there is potential for a new license, a new type 48 license to become available via a lottery system, this would only happen after a sufficient increase in population or change in ABC regulations. Additionally, a type 48 can be obtained if one were to come for sale, a bar were to sell their existing license, but it typically happens at a premium cost and it's rare. It was determined that the proposed action is consistent with the number of land use and economic development goals and policies. Additionally, the proposed amendment would not result in an increased development beyond that was analyzed in the final environmental impact report prepared and certified for the Chico 2030 general plan. At its November 16, 2023 meeting, the Planning Commission voted 4-1, 2-0. 2. Recommending that the City Council adopt an ordinance to amend Title 19 to remove the restriction on bars downtown. The Commission also requested that Council consider the testimony of downtown stakeholders who contended that the proposed amendment only benefits potential new operators and that additional code amendments should be made to assist existing operators of bars in downtown. For example, loosening the restrictions in Chico Municipal Code section 1976-200 to allow bars to serve alcohol later than 12 a.m. on weekends on graduation weekend and Labor Day weekend. This is something that could be addressed in the next round of Title 19 updates. So with that being said, the Planning Commission and Community Development Director recommend the City Council hold a public hearing on the proposed code amendment and adopt the following ordinance by reading of its title. And then I'll just go ahead and go through the and I am happy to answer any questions. All right, questions? Doesn't look like it. All right, so we'll open the public hearing. Do we have any speakers? We do. We have six. All right. Before we do that, too, if you were here early on for a presentation and you're hesitating to leave because you don't want to be here, go ahead. Yeah. You're more than welcome to go, so we understand that. Not you, Mr. Martin. Thank you guys for coming. All right, we will take a break after this, however. But thank you so much for coming. So, yeah, if you don't mind doing it in a quiet way, we appreciate that, but we do appreciate everybody coming. So just thought we kind of had that sentiment. So, anyway, moving on. We have six speakers, yes? Three minutes each? Maybe five. Okay. Depends. So, yes, I'll call the first two names, and if you can line up in the middle aisle, Josh Marks, followed by Karen Williams, please. All right. Good evening. I own two restaurant bars downtown currently. There is no shortage of places to get a drink in downtown. There is, however. There is a shortage of people who come downtown to frequent the drinking establishments. It's slow. There's no place you go. There's a line. There's no place you can't get a table. There's no place you have to wait at the bar. And business is down as a whole. Adding more bars will not fix this problem. You're more likely to put us out of business than to approve our sales. The other side is this. You could create a race to the bottom where everyone is lowering their drink prices to promote cheap drinks and to entice customers to choose their bar over another, which is bad for everyone, the city, and the businesses. Furthermore, the current restrictions on the license need to be amended and reevaluated, forcing us to close early on days such as Grad Weekend and Labor Day weekend. It's just not good showing up our city. We should be promoting business, not shutting it down. I don't believe the proposed amendment to Title 19 is the best interest of downtown and its occupants. Thank you. Karen Williams, followed by Leanne Powell. Good evening. Good evening. First, I'd like to give a quick shout-out to the police. I had reason to come into contact with some of your officers last Friday night, and they were extremely respectful. They were rapid on the scene, and they were able to, they're diligent in their work. They were able to apprehend the suspect and arrest him, and so I thank you. I wish I could tell you their names. I only remember one of them was Will Robinson because of the lost in space. Which brings me to why I'm here today because I represent Lost in Chico. We have two liquor licenses, a 47. We are very much opposed to the amendment of Title 19. A lot of what our business is based on is our liquor license, and by amending it, you open it up, and it potentially devalues us. Not only that, but as previously mentioned by Josh, the restrictions on the days that were our revenue-generating days, that's really, you know, we just are fighting to the nail to stay open. I graduated in 94, and I know that the city, from Chico State, and I know the city and the police and the university have done so much to squash that party school, you know, reputation, and I applaud you for that. It's things like Title 19. So why do you want to go back on something as solid as what it is? We actually, because we own two liquor licenses, we have the ability to make one available if we were able to operate our two businesses. And one roof under one liquor license. So there could be one made available. Opening it up to additional liquor licenses is not the key. Binge drinking is sure to follow. We already deal with a lot of unwelcome things on our street fronts, a lot of fights. We've had a great reputation, limited penalties against us or infractions. And so I just want to say that. Chico needs a lot of help in downtown, but having more bars is not the answer. Thank you. Thank you. Leanne Powell, followed by Will Brady. Okay. I'm on 3rd Street underneath the Crazy Horse Saloon. And I am very concerned about opening up another bar in downtown Chico. Okay. This morning I got online and I just Googled how many bars do we have downtown Chico. And if I counted it correctly, I came up with 32 bars and restaurants that serve alcohol. And I just don't feel like we need one more. I feel like opening up that ordinance and taking that ordinance and lifting it, how many more bars are you going to let come into the downtown area? I also wanted to ask you, have any of you guys actually been downtown on a Saturday morning? Are you Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese we have to rinse down with bleach water, or we get to call the ambassadors who get to come out with kitty litter and sweep it up. If you vote to lift the ordinance on the bars in our downtown, how many more are going to move in? I understand that the city is going to make 5% off of the gross receipts generated from the casino downtown, but my question for you is this. Do we really need more bars downtown, Chico? And number two, how legal is it to buy your votes with a 5% annual contribution at the detriment to the city of downtown Chico? Thank you. Thank you. Will Brady, followed by Sebastian Temenel. Hello, Ralph. How you doing? I'm here to encourage you to reconsider at least the type 48 aspect of this ordinance. It seems to me... Hold on a second. It seems to me that there's... We keep doing this thing to... It's not about the businesses that are in downtown Chico. It's getting more businesses into downtown Chico. That shouldn't so much be the goal if it's all in one... Talking about one revenue stream of restaurants. We have a lack of breadth as it exists right now. There aren't enough different types of businesses downtown. That stems from this one thing. That's one of the landlord's bone of being able to find someone who can put in a 48, which I promise you is 65% cheaper than building a restaurant. 47s cost money because you have to put a hood fan in, and you have to build a kitchen, and all this other crap that I had to do four times because, you know, you don't make a path for landlords to find one person to put in a third of the money, and you end up with... I mean, you're just going to... But honestly, they have no overhead compared to the 47s. The one revenue stream the 47s still have is their bar. You are going to put them into direct competition with people who don't have to pay cooks. They don't have to pay dishwashers. They don't have to pay any of this stuff. We have enough bars in downtown as it is. I can imagine this being a great way to put somebody out of business. But as it stands right now, maybe consider landlords encouraging them to lower their rent rent so other kinds of businesses can afford to come back to the downtown. I think we've lost 80% of our hair salons. We're living in this myth of never-ending 6% raises on your rent every year. Landlords need to join the reality that the commercial real estate market is in big trouble and it can't be bore on the back of the existing, what remains of our only really thriving business downtown, which is the restaurant industry. There's no reason to kill off the people who have been with you through the whole COVID and all the rigmaroles that we've been through as SITLA and all this other stuff. We've been with you guys. We bore the brunt. Everyone thinks we're the bad guy anyway, but for Christ's sakes, can we maybe just once take a pause, maybe approve more 47, see if we've got a million dollar investors to come downtown, not $300,000 people are going to come in. Pick off three or four restaurants. One bar can pick off three or four restaurants. If you take away their profit potential, there's no reason to be here anymore. With that, I'll leave you. Thank you. Our last speaker is Sebastian. I was born and raised in Chico, on the Banshee, B Street, and Argus with my partners. All have been operating downtown for at least eight years and up to 17 years. We have two 47s and a 48. I'm just speaking on behalf of all those establishments. I think a good spot to start is, what problem is this solving? I think the end goal is having a thriving downtown community is nearly universally agreed upon. It is a means to which we achieve the goal of prosperous downtown that warrants discussion. I disagree with opening up more Type 48s. It is, at this time, the solution to vagrancies, lower foot traffic, and dilapidated building issues that plague us. I would like to see solutions to these problems and then revisit the discussion about expanding liquor licenses in downtown, as it has been currently stated to be oversaturated. As a restaurant owner, I'm well aware of the statistics about failing restaurants, 60% fail in the first year. My suggestion to how these problems would be to learn from our history and take note of what is working in areas that are not suffering like downtown Chico. Simple metrics, targets of measurable improvements need to be set and achieved. It starts by figuring out exactly where we are and getting after homelessness, infrastructure, and foot traffic. I'd like to see a set target for building occupancy in downtown. If zoning for certain types of previously precluded occupancies need to be approved, I'd start there. People take care of their homes and do not tolerate their homes being vandalized, littered upon, and soiled by vagrants. Get more residential, approve incentive programs for non-retail business. Bring events to bring consumers to the existing businesses in downtown. I can't think of any event in downtown that would be so beneficial to my business by measurable means in the last 10 years other than the market on Thursday. We love the type of events that pack the streets and help pay the bills. Let's have walk-around events that benefit the current brick-and-mortar establishments. It shows that, like Laxon, Elray, Senator, bring people out. Infrastructure downtown needs improvement. Clean the sidewalks, much better lighting, better parking, more free parking, better transportation to and from downtown. Set a metric to improve the quality of life for all of us. I'd like to see a set target for reducing the number of mentally ill and homeless downtown. Make downtown Chico a spot where parents and family want to bring their kids to get Chico State's enrollment back up. Everyone wins. We're curious as to how these licenses will be regulated in terms of restrictions. We all currently have restrictions with our licenses, and in light of this discussion, it'll feel dated. It's stated that the barrier to entry was being able to get a license, but would this allow a license from anywhere in the county to simply move in? We paid a cost for our licenses over the last year. We fought to open our businesses downtown with a goal of giving something great to the city. We have a concern that allowing just anyone in will start a race to the bottom for all of us that are struggling and doing our best to already make downtown what it once was. It can be done. Our other downtowns thrive. That's the end of it. Thanks. All right. Thank you very much. That's it for the public hearing? Yes. I'm going to close the public hearing, and then discussion by council. Hey, I have a question just for confirmation. Brandon or Kirsten. Type 48, that's the purely liquor license, that's what we're talking about alleviating the ban downtown on. We don't restrict any other forms of liquor licenses, do we? Or alcohol licenses, I should say. No, there can be a new restaurant established downtown. They can pursue a license. Okay, thank you. All right. Further questions? It's not a question. I think I'm looking for a little bit more explanation for myself, but and for the benefit. Because obviously I hear what the downtown business owners are saying. The last thing I want to do is hurt anybody. I also understand that we've... We are encouraging a new business to come downtown, and we've figured out a way to make that work. Not a lot of people gamble and don't have a cocktail in their hand. So if we have a new business coming down, and if they're going to have a cocktail, I also know that they have a lot of people coming down. Hopefully they're going to be shopping, eating, you know, going different places. It's all during the day, during the night, you know, it's all hours. The difference between the 47 and 48... Can you just give an explanation on that and explain where we're going and where this could go by opening it up and address the... What's been addressed here tonight? The Casino Chico wouldn't be having a bar license. They're going to have food associated with theirs, so they'll be pursuing a license that is associated with food. It's not the 48 or the 47. The 47 is beer only and the 48 is... No, no, that's wrong. 41 and 42 are beer only. Yeah, so a type 47 is liquor, beer, wine associated with the restaurant. I believe it's the same with a type 41. And then I think it's a 40 and a 48 are like bar, tavern. So back to Addison's earlier question, this would apply to, say, like a beer garden wanted to open up and just sell beer. That would be a different license type than a type 48. But they wouldn't... They wouldn't have that food component. I believe that's a type 40. But there is a separation. There are places that serve only alcohol and don't have to have the food component. So we'll just make English and not use 47s and 48s. And then there's places where there's food associated with it. So my understanding was the casino will have food associated with it, and that's their license. So they're not benefiting per se from this action. There could be other uses. There's other uses that would benefit. And that was my understanding of council's intention was to create greater opportunities for businesses to establish in the downtown, thus reducing this prohibition on bars only. Okay. Council Member Morgan, you had a... I'm just going to open it up. First, I have a statement. I'm shocked we're not hearing from the Chamber of Commerce. Not really. I'm a little surprised that we're not hearing from the DCBA. I'm going to go with a no. Okay. I'm going to open it in motion. That's not a motion. No is not a motion. Yeah, thank you. Thank you, Edison, for being the voice of wisdom. I'm getting tired of it now. I'll elaborate a little bit. Council Member Winslow, go ahead. We had some of this conversation some months ago when this came up. And it's... In my mind, it's not... It's not a question of are people going to drink alcohol or not, are people going to binge drink or not, but it's where is it going to happen under what sort of environment. And I think that downtown provides the best place for people to be doing something like that. Surely, when... If we do not have the opportunity, because there's a line out the door to one bar with a liquor license, to go to a convenience store and buy yourself some alcohol and go drink in an alley. And... I don't think that we're really mitigating those effects at all. Like, that is the culture around here. People are going to do it. What we have in downtown, it's a centralized location where we have public safety personnel that can be in the area. We can... And we have transportation options. Downtown is actually the only place in the city of Chico you can open a bar of any sort and not be required to provide a parking lot so people don't drive home as much. And I think that's probably the largest public safety issue we have associated with alcohol. So... What the planning staff has told us is that because we are oversaturated in the county, we don't expect that there's going to be a large influx of the downtown. It's not... It's not going to have much... All that much of an impact. Um... Just overnight. If businesses are successful in downtown, then we will start to see more come in. And I think that's really the key is that we'll find out, um, can downtown support more bars? And if that's true, then... Then more will establish there and the city won't be standing in the way of it. But... And I think under those conditions, we would all be safer and the effects of alcohol in our community are going to be more controlled and a better place. All right. Further comment? I can't say your point is right. Uh... At least to the respect that... You know, the best place that someone can drink is obviously not a, you know, basement of an apartment or a... You know, a party with zero regulations or rules or compliances or a bartender at least seeing how much people are given. So, I know factually speaking, uh, from the statistics I looked at this when I was on a previous council, it was... People are open. They're always generally safer drinking at bars than they are at private residences and private parties. That aside, um, I'm a little bit concerned about the aspects of this and how they would harm our existing businesses. I don't necessarily agree with everything our existing businesses said, especially in terms of the restaurants. Every time I try to get into a restaurant, I have a really hard time. Uh, on a Friday or Saturday or Thursday night in downtown. But that aside, um, I'm not sure what we're really looking at doing here in the route forward. Mr. V? I just want to add one point. Um, the goal of council's initial direction was to allow council to be the gatekeeper. And so, that is what will occur. Uh, because it's an oversaturated area, if someone wants to pursue the license, they can't just buy it and get it. They have to come to the city council because there's a requirement for a public convenience or necessity determination. Now again, I will be honest. It might be a little frustrating for someone to go through all that process, that transparency, and feel like there should be some level of predictability. And then the council, I don't want to say you're whimsical, but suddenly say, ah, you don't want to allow that. So that would be a concern that I would acknowledge. But the goal of the action initially was to amend a section of the code that was a remnant piece from the 1990s when there were more significant concerns related to alcohol-related incidences in the downtown. And as opposed to appending to it, we said there's an opportunity just to get rid of it, which would open the gate, but that there are still, as Molly pointed out, things in place to put guardrails or also to say yes or no because it's an oversaturated area. So I just want to remind you the genesis of how we got here was council wanted to have the ability to kind of allow or not allow additional new uses that might be just a bar. So I just wanted to give you additional background. And along those lines, have we lost, do you feel like we've lost particular opportunities in downtown because of the current restrictions or this restriction? I'm sure we have, but a lot of people, you know, are kicking the tires and looking for ideas. And sometimes we have on many occasions as planners receive the call and just say, oh, there's just a prohibition on new street bars. And so a lot of the places you see downtown that people think are in fact bars are not bars, they're restaurants. That then honestly morph a little bit later in the night and turn into a bar. But they do have a responsibility to ABC to have a certain percentage of gross sales that are for food. And they serve some pretty darn good food as well. So they are different as opposed to those bars where there's not that requirement like Duffy's, The Wild, of course, others. All right. I guess my last question would be to amend the St. Patrick's Day. So if we're going to have a St. Patrick's Day, Caesars, Chavez, Memorial Day, Labor Day, Graduation Weekend, that would be another action that would need to come back at a council member request at another time? Yeah, that's to be separate but understood contextually. I mean, if we're saying that there's no problem anymore, then we should make it no problem anymore for everything, not just if we're going to open it up, we should correct that as well. Yeah, the last attachment to the staff report has, again, some regulations that were developed by council. And I think around the 2015. Yeah. 2015, 16 period when, again, there was continued concerns about the impacts of alcohol. And it's, again, it has requirements and some concern nights like St. Patrick's, Caesars, Chavez Day. And so some of those, yeah, we're happy to look at those if that's council's direction to remove some of the prohibitions on those hours. That would be a separate action. But I understand why it's coming. I get that. I just wanted to make sure I understood the way that we would need to bring that back up. So thank you. All right. I would like to hear from our chief, Aldridge. What does he feel about it? If it goes away, will that create any extra issues for the line movement if we have more bars? Boy, that's a subjective question. I think that history has shown that we have issues with bars, period. When it's going to happen? You just never know. So when you increase the number of bars, you increase the likelihood of behavior that's going to create problems for us. Has it kind of gotten a little bit better in the recent history? Yes, I will agree with that. And you have enough staff to deal with that elevated calls in the downtown? We'll always take more. But right now, I believe we're staffed on the weekends, primarily the weekends where we have those issues. We are starting a fourth patrol team on the weekends here in March. So that increased staffing will go through close to bar closing time. So yes. Thank you. All right. Further comment, discussion? I think maybe many of the people up here are too young to remember. But in the 1920s, we had this experience with prohibition, which a lot of this conversation, I will note, is the legacy of that. It's kind of a uniquely American thing to be discussing all these conditions on where and how and what sort and with how much food can we serve alcohol. I really don't think it serves us much. And I think maybe things have changed in the last 20 years that people just aren't as rowdy and so we don't have to worry about it anymore. But in any case, I think we are in a place where we should get to that. And I think we are in a place where we should get out of the way for the kind of establishments that people want to find in our downtown. So I will make a motion to adopt the ordinance of the City Council of the City of Chico amending Title 19 of the Chico Municipal Code to delete Section 19.44.040, Downtown North District Special Standards. I'll second it. So I have a question before we move to the vote. So. Okay. As soon as Mr. Veague comes back. Mr. Veague. Question for you. So just a reiteration here. Each one of these individually would have to come through council to be approved, correct? Yes, establishment of a new bar in the downtown. Okay. It won't come as a use permit as much as it will come as a determination of you making a determination that there's a public convenience or necessity associated with the establishment. Okay. Of this liquor license. Okay. Would they come through the Planning Commission first or directly? Yes. Straight to you. Straight to you. From the PD. Okay. From the PD. Could I ask a follow up on that, John? I'll take service 48. I think just the 48 because, yes, they're the special one. Again, you know, you have like gas station. At the height of the concern before these new regulations came out, businesses would sell alcohol, there was a gas station that wanted to sell beer and it got quite controversial in here. So I think that's a good point. And there was like, wait a minute, that doesn't create a fair playing field for all the other gas stations in town. Same kind of goes for restaurants. So it's a little bit different than how the bar is at a heightened level. So not that I could ever make a great mac and cheese, but if I thought I could run a bar and beat Will's Mac and Cheese, I can open that kind of, which I never could. You can open a restaurant. Oh, that's calling somebody out personally. Sorry, I'm not supposed to. But it is amazing, mac and cheese. Or wings. I can't compete with the wings at Bell. Okay. If I wanted to do that, that's not coming before council. But if I want to open the Crazy Horse type thing or Duffy's type thing with just food and all I got is some chips on the counter, that's what would have to come before council. Correct. Okay. And let's maybe, Molly starts. I just want to make sure I understand exactly what we're running. No, yes. So type 42 and type 48 are bars, taverns that aren't associated with food. That would be what becomes the bar. Okay. And then the bar is coming to you through the PCN. Type 47s, there's some kind of regulations we have with ABC where we don't require them to get a PCN even though it is oversaturated. But it has that food component and ABC has made an exception with PD to not make every restaurant go through a PCN. So we wouldn't be changing that at all? Nope. That stays the same. Okay. So the only thing that changes is the... Is the... Would allow bar, but if in fact we do, they have to come through us. Yes. Okay. So the other... I just want to say ahead of time, I really, really hate the idea of this council or any council deciding who gets to be winners and losers in general. And that's my... And that's what we're... Yeah. So that's what I'm... I believe it also would require any type 21s coming through would have to get a PCN. That would be like a liquor store if we have one that wanted to open in the DTA area. So those would require a PCN also. Okay. Any comment? Sure. And a substitute motion? Sure. I heard from council and staff a lot of, I think, I think, I think. I don't think that... I don't think you're ready to pass this. So my substitute motion would go back to my prior motion, which was vote no or bring this back when people can stop saying, I think, I think, I think. And we know, we know, we know. Otherwise... I'll say that's a substitute. Otherwise this is bad policy. Here. Here. Here. All right. So let's not do... You guys have had your time. We're doing our time. So we try to keep public comment to a minimum during non-public times, public comment times. So we have a substitute motion. Madam Clerk, go ahead and take your role. Okay. And that was a motion to actually bring this item back once we know all the details associated with this type of an action. Council Member Bennett? Yes. Council Member Morgan? Yes. Council Member Tandon? Yes. Council Member Van Overbeck is disqualified. Council Member Winslow? No. Vice Mayor Reynolds? Yes. Mayor Coolidge? Yes. Carries 5-1 with one recusal. All right. So I would say... Ms. Brett, hold on. Yeah. I'm going to have further comment. I'm going to have a comment on the item. So I just want to make sure that staff will bring this back to us at some point. That was the action. Yeah. What... Well, while we're on it then, what questions were outstanding? Because I didn't... I felt like I understood what we were doing. I think there were some council members with questions relating to... I'm not going to speak for them. But I had some questions at least relating to the exactness of what would be brought back to us, how it would be done, and, you know, a process for doing that that actually would be fair and coherent. So I think maybe our staff and Mr. Sorensen could probably direct this obviously to bring it back to us with a little more clarification. Well, we do PCNs on occasion. And they are simply an up or down. Either council finds the necessary. And the need for the public convenience. Or they don't. And that's... It's not any more detailed than that, unfortunately. So it does put council in the position of saying yea or nay to an individual application. With no other structure or need for findings or need for objectivity. So I don't know that we could provide much more detail other than perhaps dig up one or two past examples so that you could see what they look like. I think that may be worthwhile. By your time, I will just note that I don't like the idea of the city council being the arbiter of who gets to have a business downtown either. And I did complain about that last time we talked about this. We'll be more consistent on that. Thank you. Thank you. All right. I would appreciate when that comes back. The explanation of the different type of licenses. Because there was some confusion there too. After you read the different licenses, you will be more confused. I am well aware. You and I have been through this before as council members. And everything old is new again. All right. Council member Tannen. You know, we talk here in the staff report. We do talk about alcoholic beverage establishment zoning verification. And that's something that we are very concerned about. We have not yet finished the process, the вроде process. I would like to know more about what the process is to? So the verification process? Yeah, zoning verification. Alcoholic beverage establishment zoning verification? We can do that as well, but that's, um, before ABC, we'll sign off on an, on an ABC license for an applicant, um, they must engage the City's Planning Department to determine if the use at that location, not the location, not the location, not the location, not the is first allowed, and then we also coordinate with the PD, police department, to ensure that our standard conditions are applied to their ABC license. All right. So we'll see you back on our future agenda with a little more information. All right. With that, we're going to take a short break. We're going to reconvene if everybody can have a seat. All right, folks. Check, check, check, check, check. Is my mic on? There we go. All right. Hello, hello. There we go. All right. We're back. If everybody could have a seat, please. All right. Move on to the regular agenda, item 5.1, consideration of a timeline for fiscal year 2024 budget. And our presenter is Administrative Services Director Barbara Martin. Fire away. Thank you. Good evening, Mayor, Vice President, and all of our Vice Mayor, members of the Council. Thank you for your time this evening. The item before you is requesting direction in terms of what the City Council would like to see for presentations of our annual budget for the 24-25 fiscal year. The process of budget production has already started for this next fiscal year. It starts with city department heads and their departments looking at priorities and assessing priorities that roll over from the last fiscal year, priorities that have come up through Council meetings, through committee meetings, through individual meetings, and et cetera throughout this time period, and what they deem as priorities that would go into the next fiscal year. From that, meetings are put together with finance, and with the departments, and with the city manager to determine and discuss those priorities. And from there, the city manager puts together his recommendations that go into the final budget process. product, taking into consideration funding considerations, et cetera. From there, per our Muni code, a resolution adopting a preliminary budget must come before you in the month immediately preceding the start of the fiscal year, so in June. So our end goal is to have something before you by the first meeting in June to accomplish that. When I started with the city, back when time began, we had an all-day budget session, much like we've done for the preceding two fiscal years, where all the departments present their requests and what has been put into the recommended budget, and from there, approval is hopefully received. And then in the preceding couple years before that, we had a different format where we spread those. We had those presentations over three evening council meetings, had a couple departments present at a time. Discussions were had during those periods, and then still that first meeting in June would be the kind of end goal of when the final adoption would occur. We are open to what your pleasure is in that regard, but we would like some direction, because like I said, the process has started, and we've got a timeline that needs to be assessed from there, and I can take any questions about it. All right. Questions, and we'll have a discussion after we have speakers. Do we have speakers? No. Okay. So let's take speakers. No speakers. All right. So Ms. Martin, as I understand it, the options are you could cycle departments through in a single day. We go through the whole thing, or we break it up a couple of departments for each council meeting. How many departments are there that would report? One, two, three, four. We usually do it over three meetings, two major departments per meeting, and then kind of a final that's administrative services, city manager, etc., where generally are smaller requests than your police department, fire department, public works, etc. Yeah. My personal feeling, and the way this used to happen in the private sector when we had an annual budget process, was that in order to get your head in budget mode, you would take a day and really immerse yourself so you could focus on it. The problem would be— Yeah. And so, you know, I think that's what we're doing at council meetings is there's so many other things going on, you never know how many people are going to speak from the floor. And so, I think it's important—two things are important. One is just not being rushed, but secondly, that the council has a chance to have some input, whereas the last cycle that we went through, you know, we were presented with a budget at—basically when it was all done, and—which made it very, very difficult to— Yeah. —to get it done. But the Japanese government is Japanese government. Japanese government is Japanese government. Japanese government is Japanese government. Japanese government is Japanese government. Japanese government is Japanese government. Japanese government is Japanese government. Japanese government is Japanese government. Japanese government is Japanese government. Japanese government is Japanese government. Japanese government is Japanese government. Japanese government is Japanese government. Japanese government is Japanese government. Japanese government is Japanese government. Japanese government is Japanese government. to you the less reliable information we have for you. We have a lot of revenue items and things that just aren't available and not good estimates until May. Sounds like May is probably the early May is the right time to do it. Yeah. And when we have in the past had these multiple presentations, the actual final document is not available until that first meeting in June. It's just a matter of process and everything that goes into it. It's just we can't get everything into that document until final. So you get kind of these draft numbers along the way until that final meeting. Thank you. Yeah. So I would second that. It's not a motion, but I think one day to cover it would be preferable to cutting it up into pieces and then trying to figure out all the pieces, how they fit together. I have the utmost confidence in you and your staff. If some of the numbers are a little loose, that's fine. We'll make a final decision eventually. All right. Council Member Morgan. I think. Okay. Council Member Winslow. Yeah. I know that we're talking about how the budget comes before the city council right now, but I just wanted to ask, is the community workshop still part of our budget process? It was in our budget, but as I understand it, just fell through the cracks and didn't happen this last year. Well, during COVID, we didn't have the workshops for those reasons. In the past, those community workshops have been attended by possible. Two citizens and then one media representative. So they haven't been super successful or well attended. One thing that we were thinking about doing this year to accomplish that and to have some input is to possibly have it at a finance committee meeting where we can have kind of a budget overview. You think 7 a.m. is going to get people out? Just because it was a, it's an already established time. I don't know that that will actually bring any more attendance, but that's, it's a hard thing to do because we don't have a lot of people who are engaged in that process in the past. One of the pieces of having the presentations over time is that it is an evening meeting that people are used to going to. Are you suggesting that media representatives are not citizens? No, but the purpose there was not to represent the citizens. I'm just, that was an attempt at humor. Ms. Mori. It's not a requirement actually. Yeah. Ms. Mori. My comments. An all-day budget meeting would be the longest day of your entire life. And then if it turns into a council meeting after that, it can get really, really ugly. Really ugly. So I'm not finished. Yeah. Okay. On top of that, I understand the desire for all the numbers well ahead of time. At some point you have to trust the staff to do what they're going to do. The most dangerous thing that can happen, to your point, Addison, and to yours, Mr. Van Overbeck, is you get the public or even the council involved in line item changes, you'll be here forever. And that is not quite the point. So you have to be careful that that doesn't happen. It's not going to happen, the Finance Committee, though, I guarantee that. So all-day budget meetings are a nightmare. And I've seen a very tired, just let's say council member, call Chief Kirk Trostle, Captain Kirk during that meeting. So with the amount of exhaustion that took place. So I'd prefer it broke up over a couple of meetings. I know we may not actually have the numbers. I think staff is hearing some desire from council to actually participate a little heavier in some of those decisions. But, well, participate a little heavier, in some of the finite aspects that you say we should ignore. But I think there is a desire, at least I have a desire to look more closely at individual items. So. So how do we resolve this? Do we vote between an all-day meeting or breaking it up? Well, I mean, I think we can come to a consensus. What did we do last year, Mark? I don't think that's possible. We did it over an afternoon. And when we did them all-day sessions back in the day, they weren't all-day budget. They were like the morning was budget and then we would have hearings for housing or something like that in the afternoon. So they have never taken the whole day. The reason for the afternoon was to kind of make it more consolidated and also so that you weren't here until, you know, 24 hours kind of a thing. Well, in 2013, we had a 13 and a half hour. Well, that was an extreme. That's right. Yeah. Yeah. But you said that was a marathon. Sometimes they're followed by council meetings, which also probably isn't the best idea. Right. The other thing to consider though, and I appreciate that your desire to get into the weeds a little bit. I appreciate that. But I just want to remind that council's purview is policy level and at the fund level, department level. So line items aren't even provided to you in the budget. So I just wanted to point that out that if you're getting to those weeds, I'm always happy to go over the budget and what is in there beforehand. So schedule a meeting with me, talk to me or talk to city manager or whoever. But the actual session, it's kind of intended to be a 30,000 view for that reason. Vice Mayor. I was just going to say, I believe last year we did this in one day because I remember talking about pie for three separate meetings, you know, four years ago or whatever it was, five years ago. And I, you know, I was just thinking, you know, I was just, I think it's great. We should have pie again because that's a great tradition and a great memory. But I don't remember this being a long drug out day. I think we were here for three or four hours. We got everything done all at once and then we went home and it was brought back. And I think that was efficient and it got it done. But I don't remember this being 10 or 12 hour meetings. I don't think that the, at least I'm not interested in getting involved in line items. But I, but all the time, I'm not interested in getting involved in line items. I think ultimately the budget is the expression of policy. And so I think the council needs to be involved at least the next level down below the top lines with just the policy priorities of the council are being reflected in the budget. That's my goal in having some more council involvement that we have, not to make your life miserable. Thank you. Thank you. I'd share that sentiment. To a certain extent I think that's important. You know I don't think we need to be in the weeds, but we need to see the field. So he used a really bad analogy that keeps going. How do you want to resolve this? I don't know. Someone can certainly make a motion. I'll make one and do it over, I don't know. I'd like to make a motion that we do it in one meeting. Okay. And I'd like to get a second. Okay. on that? Not followed by a council meeting, no. Yeah, I was going to say that was going to be my friendly amendment offer. Not on a council meeting. Not followed by a council meeting. Right. Sounds good. I think that would be ideal. I think doing the two back-to-back is... So you're looking at say approximately four hours on a week day or in an evening or on a Saturday? I think it should be on a Saturday because some people have jobs. Yeah. I'm fine with the day. Day of the week. I like it, yeah. And it can be evening. It can be afternoon. Yeah. Yeah. Say again. Okay. So. It's only four hours I'm fine doing on a council night. Do it four hours, take a dinner break, and come in and get business done. We don't have to give up another day. I'm good with whatever. Just tell me when I'll be there. Oh. Thanks. So we would need some specifics. I heard many different... Well, we have a motion technically. So the motion, Tom, do you want to expand? We have a motion and a second. Whether it happens at a council meeting or it happens as an event separate from a council meeting is really... My motion is that it all happen at once. At one time. And we can decide whether it happens at a council meeting or not later. I can make a call on that. Do we... Madam Clerk, do we need to tell you whether we want it to happen at a council meeting or not? Well, I mean, it sounds like you really want a workshop where you can dive... Do a deep dive into the budget and provide direction. So you can set up workshops and it is a regular meeting, or is an adjourned regular meeting. However, it's just set aside for one specific topic. And we do the... When we do the review of the budget. I would recommend that. If you do it at a council meeting, then, you know, there would be consent. There would be all the other items. And that's entirely up to you. If you want to roll right into it, that's what we've done in the past. We've had a budget work session in the afternoon. And then we rolled into at 6 o'clock our regular meeting. Okay. So we could append the budget work session to a council meeting or do it at some other time. That's what we did last year. Okay. So the motion is that we have a dedicated block of time to review the budget. And that's separate from whether it happens prior to a council meeting or at some other time. Okay. Okay. I would prefer it not at a council date on Tuesdays. It's separate. Separate issue. Okay. All right. Okay. So who seconded your motion? And he's not agreeable to. Okay. So he's agreeable. I'm fine. All right. So he's agreeable to the change. The second. It's one meeting during the week to discuss the whole budget. It can be a four-hour slot. It can be before a regular council meeting or it can be on a separate day. Is that correct? Exactly. Okay. Thank you. All right. Council member Bennett. Yes. Council member Morgan. No. Council member Tandon. Aye. Council member Van Overbeck. Yes. Council member Winslow. Yes. Vice mayor Reynolds. Yes. Mayor Coolidge. No. Okay. It carries 4-3. Carries 4-3? Carries 4-3. Okay. All right. So we have a motion to approve the budget. Thank you. Okay. There we go. Okay. So that's how we'll do it. Do you need anything further? All right. So. Very clear. Very consensus. All right. Let's move on to item 5.2, consideration of approval of supplemental appropriation budget modification. A report from public works director of engineering, Mr. Brennan-Ottawa. Yes. Good evening, mayor, vice mayor, city council members. I don't know if you can hear me. Do not touch the ground. So, in the budget, item 5.2, is a request for supplemental appropriation budget modification to add budgeted dollars in the three new sewer-related capital projects. With the adoption of the new sewer rates last year, that increased funding for capital replacement of the existing sewer lines. So, two of the projects are related to the 2024 project that we anticipate on getting out. We've coordinated with our operations and maintenance department on identifying some critical areas that are near failure, so we're going to prioritize those for 2024. That would be some areas and alleys off of Olive between 3rd and 8th Street, as well as a segment between Olive and Pine between 3rd and 4th Streets. 2025, the allocation would be for starting design for downtown sewer line replacements. And then the third project is a recycled water feasibility study looking at our water pollution control plant and identifying opportunities to reuse water right now that gets discharged into the Sacramento River, looking at water recharge or potential reuse options that could monetize that or create other opportunities in the future. So I want to be prepared for those opportunities. That concludes my report. I'm available for any questions. All right, questions? Speakers? We do not have any questions. All right, entertain a motion. Do I approve? Second. Motion and second. Madam Clerk, when you're ready. Councilmember Bennet? Yes. Councilmember Morgan? Yes. Councilmember Tandon? Yes. Councilmember Van Overbeck? Yes. Councilmember Winslow? Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds? Aye. Mayor Coolidge? Aye. Carries 7-0. All right, thank you very much, Mr. Aduboni. Item 5.3, discussion regarding city's eligibility for HCD's pro-housing designation program and the I believe Mr. V is here to speak. Let me just pull up a very brief PowerPoint. Okay, thank you. Good evening, Mayor and Council. So just by way of background, Council requested that staff review the California Department of Housing and Community Development's pro-housing designation program and that we analyze Chico's eligibility based on HCD's current application as well as policies and programs the city has in place now or will have after actions and programs that are identified in the city's housing element have been implemented. As a reminder, after a long period, HCD did certify the city's housing element back in last November. Council emphasized the Japanese government's Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese!! The pro-housing designation program was launched by the state in July 2021 to create incentives for jurisdictions that are compliant with their housing element requirements and also that have enacted pro-housing policies and programs. Jurisdictions that receive the pro-housing designation receive incentives in the form of additional points or other preferences in scoring of applications for competitive housing and infrastructure funding programs that are offered by the state. As of September of last year, 30 California jurisdictions had achieved the pro-housing designation, and there were 16 jurisdictions that were pending application revision. I want to highlight pending application revision because that tells me that this is not a simple exercise, but certainly an involved effort. So in anticipation of Council's discussion, planning and housing staff reviewed the pro-housing designation application and performed a tentative survey. The pro-housing designation application is a self-score based on current city policies as well as programs that we intend to implement from the housing element. The conclusion of the exercise is that it is likely that the city can achieve the pro-housing designation. However, given the city's recent experience with HCD related to housing element update review process, coupled with what I consider ambiguous language in the pro-housing designation application, I would suggest it's extremely difficult, if not impossible, to determine eligibility until we, in fact, engage. If you look in your staff report, this is just an excerpted section, but this is the application and the exercise that we went through. All six or seven pages are in your staff report. Just wanted to show you the exercise that we went through. Receiving HCD's pro-housing designation will, I believe, require significant staff time and resources. As previously noted, staff is currently drafting numerous residential readiness code amendments in alignment with the goals outlined in the housing element. Thank you. The amendments will be considered by council later this spring. I believe staff's highest priority is working to implement the dozens of actions and programs outlined in the housing element. These efforts are time-sensitive state requirements. If a majority of the council desires, though, it is my hope that following adoption of those amendments, that later this summer, staff could come back with a resolution that would allow us to submit a pro-housing designation program application to HCD. I'm available with any questions. All right, questions? Mr. Feig, thank you. We should occasionally let someone else go first. No offense. Who would you like to go first? Your colleague is also trying to give attention, aren't you? So, it sounds to me like you would prefer not to go back to HCD in the near future and spend another two years trying to get something passed through them. Is that it? Somewhat accurate? I believe this is different than getting a housing element adopted. I'm just, I guess you're reading a little bit between the lines. I don't see the initial great, amazing benefits associated with receiving the designation, although I did have staff that went to housing conferences, and they did say the writing is on the wall that this ultimately will become a requirement to get these extra points to help benefit your designation. Or your, the grant funds you pursue. And it wouldn't just be for housing and planning. There are some transportation-related grants that it might also support. I guess my point is I don't think it has to be immediately pursued. I would like to have us pursue those things in the housing element that are state requirements, mandates, things that we've committed to as a council and a community. And then come back to you when we can take a deep breath and do it properly and have that engagement. The, I actually went to, I went to a meeting with a board member. I went to, the first time this came around, I went through the, all the requirements and a lot of verbiage. It was a lot of verbiage in there. And I saw nothing about any kind of amount set aside as far as you're gaining points to achieve grants, but there wasn't any money that I could see was set aside for those grants. And considering the state of the California in the budget crisis, is there money in there already? Or is this a future? Both. There are programs that we are currently could pursue. There are our standard funding that we received from them and it might help our scores. So I guess, yes, as recently as last year, city manager Sorenson determined that city of Reading is pursuing a pro housing designation. They're a sister city. They must see benefits. So again, it's becoming more the norm. About a year ago when we were first looking into it, it was, you know, it was a lot of money. It was a lot of money. But they are now in the same boat. But they are now in the same boat. But they are now in the same boat. But they are now in the same boat. But they are now in the same boat. But they are now in the same boat. But they are now in the same boat. But they are now in the same boat. But they are now in the same boat. But they are now in the same boat. But they are now in the same boat. But they are now in the same boat. But they are now in the same boat. But they are now in the same boat. But they are now in the same boat. But they are now in the same boat. But they are now in the same boat. But they are now in the same boat. night, as I understand it. When do we need to make a decision to pursue this or not? To save you from having me come back, you could say yes, come back this summer after you've gotten through this first major plug of code amendments at a time when there's a little gold time in the Planning and Housing Department, and we'd be happy to come back with that resolution. Again, I believe the writing is on the wall that this may benefit us, and it's an exercise. Again, my interactions with HCD have been very difficult, so maybe it's just a little too soon still, but I think this summer we'll be ready to engage again. Okay, so six months or so. Sounds fair. All right. Mr. Winslow. Yeah, there's a couple things I just wanted to bring up, and I regret that I had somebody who would come in and offer some kind of background working with HCD in the program, but they couldn't make it. Just a couple things I think it's important to know before we move forward is, one is that the pro-housing program is established under emergency regulations, and HCD is in the process of formulating that into something more permanent, which makes it a possibility that the application changes, and given that a lot of cities have gotten in, they could raise the bar. So it might be advantageous to submit it before then. That's just one consideration. The other is that if we submit an application, we have two years to follow through with the code updates before they will accept the application, given that it's in our housing element, we're going to do it, we're on that path. And then the other is that they have over-the-counter technical assistance available, which is all to say that I would just like to consider that without rushing or diverting a lot of staff time from the necessary code updates for the housing element right now, we could still submit some questions for technical assistance so that in June we don't come back and still lack the information, which right now we could have resolved by then. So on that time frame, we'd be able to submit a resolution and know whether we need to submit more code updates in order to acquire the designation. That's all. Thanks. All right. Anyone else? All right. Thank you very much. How many speakers? Two. All right. Three minutes. Mike Egbert, followed by Katie Thoma. Council Vice Mayor, Mayor. My name is Mike Egbert. I'm the CEO of the City of the Chico Chamber of Commerce. Over the past five years, the scarcity of available housing has posed a significant challenge for our Chamber members in both recruiting and retaining employees. The inadequate housing supply has fueled an alarming surge in housing prices in Chico. The pro-housing designation, while we recognize its potential endpoints may suit Chico, we firmly believe that handled responsibly, the designation of the housing designation could help dismantle some of the barriers hindering diverse housing production. We also understand the pro-housing designation is just the beginning, but it represents an initial positive step. So addressing Chico's housing shortage requires a collective shift away from the not-in-my-backyard mentality. And that seems to consistently impede housing projects locally. The Chamber is eager to engage in a conversation that the Council decides to pursue to ensure the! Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council the Chico Builders Association. I say this every time I come up here. Chico desperately needs housing, all housing. The demand continues to outpace the supply. Based on our research and the discussion with city staff, the pro-housing designation may be a feather in the cap for the city, but its value reducing the cost of housing is at best questionable. For example, the grant funding sources do have a transit requirement that Chico will never meet because we are a rural community and will never reach the threshold of every 10 minutes. And there's no sense of how much implementing the designation would cost. And as I say, no pun intended on that. The adopted housing element includes a number of actions and programs as the city is committed to develop and implement that are indeed pro-housing. These actions and programs will be developed and implemented in multiple phases. Taking a couple of years to accomplish because it will require municipal code changes. These changes will result in public hearings, giving the general public ample opportunity to weigh in. CBA respectfully suggests city staff time would be better spent developing the special planning areas as identified in the 2030 general plan so there's actually available land to build housing on. If the council, if the council chooses to pursue a pro-housing designation, CBA would like to be involved in the discussion. Thank you. Ms. She was our last speaker. Mr. All right. Further discussion, entertain a motion. Mr. Wentz. Mr. I'll start off. Just, I introduced this topic and I think it goes along with a lot of things that I believe that we should be doing as policymakers. I understand there can be a little, some burden on the community development department to do it. But there's two reasons. One is that the ranch really can provide critical infrastructure, which will have a dramatic effect upon our ability to pursue our goals and become a more equitable and sustainable city in the future. Some of these don't require transit requirements or they actually help us achieve that. For example, like passenger rail grants are included in this and we're pursuing passenger rail here. And I think this is something that could help us bridge the gap to make that happen, which can have dramatic effects for a particular development of the special planning area where we're considering, you know, putting in a passenger rail station. We also received from HCD the largest ever infill infrastructure grant, which we're using to widen Bruce Road. Secondly, this application presents us with an array of policy options to support, in general, the construction of housing in Chico and help us alleviate our shortage. And that is, I will admit, that was kind of my other intention with bringing this forward is that it does open up the opportunity for us to have discussions on more policy changes. And this application includes a lot of things that we don't do that we could do that whether it makes a difference between us getting the designation or not, it would advance our ability to meet our housing needs. So I would like to see the council have a discussion, invite members of the public, the organizations who have been more present tonight to look at all the options that we have for policies in this application. But moreover, I would like to see us make some progress in submitting the application. And as I said, I think that's a big part of the process. I mentioned that HCD has over-the-counter technical assistance. Just in the little exercise that the planning department did for us, we can see that there's a lot of questions, some ambiguity we have about the definitions there. And I think it would be worthwhile to not just direct community development to come back with a resolution to submit an application in June, but also in the meantime to seek technical assistance to try to clear up some of these ambiguities. As I said, I would secondly also like that the council pursue, in our area, policies, and discussions of whether we should pursue adopting any of these other options that are given to us there, but only if there's the support from other council members to look into some of these reforms we could potentially pass. All right. Anyone else? I can support some sort of conversation starting and something happening. But if looking at this report that was given to us, I mean, one of the first things that we would have to eliminate is single-family zoning. And we can have four ADUs on a lot. And I think there's a lot in here that the citizens of Chico need to understand exactly what we are doing and what we're giving up and what we're, what's going to need to do to understand this. So if we want to, I don't know, send it to IA or have some workshops or something, I clearly hear Mr. Veek saying that they've got a lot of work to do to tie up the pro-housing or, sorry, the housing element that we just did. And the last thing I want to do is pile more on you. I do know that you can walk and chew gum at the same time, though. And if there's some questions that you have, I'm sure that you will send it off to technical assistance and bring us back those questions. But I'm not ready to, you know, jump into this wholeheartedly until you say that you and your staff have the time and are ready to do it. Contemplating and considering all those options that are shown in the application, that, in fact, was the process we went through. I think that's a great point. But the Japanese government is Japanese government. But Japanese government is Japanese government. Japanese government is Japanese government. Japanese government is Japanese government.

Makes sense. Questions? Speakers? All right. Entertain a motion. Move to approve. When you're ready. Council Member Bennett? Yes. Council Member Morgan? Yes. Council Member Tandon? Yes. Council Member Van Overbeck? Yes. Council Member Winslow? Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds? Yes. Mayor Coolidge? Aye. Carries 7-0. All right. Item 5.5, consideration of Vice Mayor Reynolds' request for discussion regarding mobile home parks. So we... Go ahead. We had some very, passionate, lovely mobile home park residents come and talk to us who were having an exorbitant increase in their rents. And we came to a temporary relief on that. However, I thought it was worth at least coming back and having a conversation and seeing if there was anything that the city could or should do. And I'll leave it up to, you know, input from... from others to see, you know, where you want to go and what we want to do. We can... I know that they went from about a 30% increase to a 10% increase. I know that it's only happening at one particular park where this is happening. It's a very vulnerable group that is there. Most of them are on fixed incomes. While these are called mobile homes, they're not actually mobile. You, you know, it's almost impossible if... It's literally impossible to move them, either because of age or cost or whatever. And, you know, just get up and, you know, go to the next park if you... your rent's become... So I understand the issue. I'm not sure that the city getting involved in it is necessarily the best solution at this point. But I think it's definitely worthy of conversation for us to have and at least hear it out. All right. Any questions? Of staff or otherwise? I mean, since this is... the request is are there ordinances that could be enacted that would assist that community? Does somebody... Can somebody answer that? Mayor... Mayor of City Council, yes. There are ordinances throughout the state. There are various cities that have mobile home rent stabilization ordinances. And for the most part, they're very similar in nature. The structure is very simple. What... The things that they do do is they set and regulate the amount of rent that can be charged, the amount... the interval in which it can be increased, and also the amount per increase. And that's kind of where the doubles are in the details. Those... Those percentages and those amounts are usually very localized and very dependent on the community and for the councils to consider. Various cities will have it based on 50% of CPI increase. Some cities will have CPI plus three. So there's a lot of room there and a lot of discretion for cities to consider. But yeah, there are ordinances and if that's something the council is interested in, we can bring that back. Do we have state-mandated regulations on mobile homes because I don't know we have rent control by the state for the houses? There is no state-mandated mobile home rent stabilization. During COVID, they did do non-mobile home rent control. However, not for mobile homes. There has been some special legislation that has come into effect that, you know, impacts certain jurisdictions where a mobile home park may straddle two cities and they have special legislation for those for rent control. But otherwise, for mobile home parks that are exclusive to one jurisdiction, it's left up to the cities to enact or not enact. Thanks. All right. Any other questions? What kind of limitations do we have in terms of what we can pass? You mentioned rent control and I think it's worthy kind of distinction that we have rent stabilization statewide on certain people in multifamily houses. And, yeah, can you speak to that? I mean, you mentioned what some other cities do, but are there some limitations to what we can do? Sure. I mean, the legal restriction is that the city needs to ensure that there is a fair and reasonable return on the mobile home park owner's investment. So, again, that's a very important subjective type of analysis that's done and every city determines what's considered reasonable and fair pretty much. So, for the most part, though, all throughout the state, most ordinances have very similar structures and one thing I didn't mention earlier is that there is a process usually for property owners to petition cities to say we need to make special extraordinary improvements, capital improvements, and they can petition the city to authorize greater increases to cover those specific capital improvements. So, there's a process there that the mobile home park owners could utilize and ask and petition for greater increases. That is within the municipal ordinances or that's state law required? No, none of this is mandated in state law other than what I mentioned regarding the fair and reasonable return. That's a constitutional issue. That typically if you don't provide that then it's considered a taking, a regulatory taking. And so, therefore, you have to build that flexibility in the ordinance to circumvent that infirmity for constitutional issues. So, from a state law standpoint, there's no requirement, but this is the structure that you see throughout the state in which cities that do adopt rent stabilization ordinances. Thank you very much. All right. Speakers? Yes, we have seven. Three minutes. Okay. I'll call the first two, Janet Olson and followed by Bill Webster. First, I want to say thank you for having us and thank you all for your service. And, again, I am a senior in a senior mobile home park, and I know that it's not just seniors that we're talking about, but I just want you guys to consider the fact that the park that I live in, which is not the same park that these folks live in, and I live in the county, so it's a little different, but in our park, we have over probably 225 spaces. And before I moved there, I didn't realize that probably right now, at least 40% of those people that live in the park that have lived there for 40 years. So when they moved in, of course, it was a whole different ballgame, their space rent and the whole nine yards, but they're on a fixed income, and their fixed income does not go up, it goes up maybe, you know, 3%, but they started out at a very low fixed income, so it doesn't, it's not up to what the, when the park raises your park rent 20%, these people can't do it. So I think that for people, for the city to consider a stabilization ordinance for mobile home parks, it would really be a good thing, because I think a lot of these people, I know in our park, probably right now, we have four homes that are vacated, the people couldn't live there any longer because they couldn't pay the rent, and for one reason or another, sometimes they got sick, sometimes they just couldn't pay the rent. So those people moved out, and what happens is, the park ends, ends up owning the mobile home, and then they sell it. It's just not a fair process. It's just not. And it's happening all over, and I think that if anybody realized it, those communities that we live in are exactly that. They're really tight-knit communities. They're wonderful people. It's a really great life, and everybody there understands that it's a business, and everybody knows that you have to, you know, those people have to pay for different things. But like in my park, for instance, they put in a solar system or whatever, and then told us it was to our benefit. It's not to our benefit. We have nothing to, nothing, it's running their lights on the streets, it's running the things for the clubhouse and this and that. And, you know, they're like telling us, we're going to raise your rent for this or that, because we've improved it, we put in this big solar system, which has nothing to do with us at all. It's a nice thing, but it's just, it's so, it's just not transparent at all. And there's no transparency when it comes to how they're going to raise their rent. We've asked them a bunch of times. So a stabilization ordinance would help all seniors. Most seniors don't speak up either. You notice that, I mean, we have some old people in my park, I'm just telling you. And they can't come here, they can't come here and talk. So we're here to talk for them, and we appreciate your time. Thanks. Thank you. Bill Webster, followed by Kathy Lodge. Thank you, Mayor and Vice Mayor of the City Council. I'm here to represent one of the parks here in Chico. My mom is a long-time resident of that park of 48 years. She's on a fixed income. She about went through the roof when she really received a letter about how much the rent was going to increase. To me, it's not fair to the senior community in these parks that increases the rent as much as they did or were trying to do. It's happening throughout the state. I read an article in Petaluma area that there's three parks down there going through the same thing right now. They're asking the city for help. I heard up in Washington, there are some parks that were bought by corporations that they're going through the same thing. We want to have some type of stability for these people. I help my mom as much as I can with her home. That was the way that my parents decided to live. They bought it brand new 48 years ago. My dad has passed on. I am the son that helps her with that. So any type of repairs, I'm there to help. If she had to hire a contractor and stuff, she couldn't live there. So I'm asking the city council to take consideration of some type of rent stability. Thank you. Thank you. Kathy followed by Dave Donnan. Hi. I'm Kathy and this morning my neighbor Connie Rogers called me and she wanted to speak to all of you. She's my neighbor. She's 22 years old and this is what she had me write down. So I'm sharing this for her. My name is constant Roger. You can call me Connie. I'm 92 years young and wanted to attend the meeting tonight but don't go out at night and can't stand for long periods of time. I lived in Cohasset with my husband and raised six children. When he passed away I stayed as long as I could taking care of our property and animals. When I was 86 I decided it was too much for me alone and I purchased a home in Pleasant Valley Mobile Estates. I chose this mobile home park because it was a fun place to live in. I'm a homeowner and I affordable, close to shopping, easy to drive and a safe place to live. When I moved here six years ago my space rent was $375. We had small increases annually and that was fine. I don't mind a small increase every year as the park owner needs to pay his bills too but what is happening now is totally unfair. We are all scared and feel we are not important. No one listens to us because we don't use social media, cell phones and we don't go out after dark. I decided to speak up because I'm worried about my neighbors. We are on fixed incomes, we have health issues and I don't know where these rent increases will end or where we will go if they continue. Please help us council members. We want to remain independent and live our lives in peace. Also I wanted to mention I recently passed my driver's license test on the first attempt. Thank you. Thank you. Dave Donnan followed by Julie Threat. Thank you Mr. Mayor and Council. I'm going to read off a few things here. There are a few things that I want to say. There are 19 mobile home parks in Chico with over 2,000 spaces. 50% of those people are single women. 25% are couples and 25% are single men. Most of the men like myself are veterans. It is dispersed with people that have disabilities. We have people that are almost blind. We have people in wheelchairs and a lot of other issues. Somebody brought it up. Mobile homes, if they are older than 10 years old, they can't be able to get out of the car. They can't be moved in this county. There are no other places. None of the mobile home parks have spaces available. Even if you wanted to move it, it would be financially not feasible to be able to do that. Normally, you have to give some of these people a credit. They stayed through this whole thing. Half of them are asleep. And it is past their bedtime. But they think it is that important to sit through the council meeting. Some of them have never been to a city council meeting before. I have sat through some of those 13-hour budget sessions before. I would hate to have them have to go through that before. Also, spaces as a realtor for the last 25 years, with space rents when they go up, what ends up happening is the prices of the mobile homes go down. We have sold two in the last five months. There are six still available. As Janet said, some of them are just staying in the car. Some of them are staying empty. And people are just moving out because they can't afford it any longer. I wanted to let you know, though, with the increase since this company has taken over, they have gone up 10%, 10%, and thanks to you, went from 30% to 10%. That is still $1.1 million a year of income coming in. And they told you they spent $200,000. I checked with HCD, and I am hoping that part of that element that is in the housing element takes into consideration mobile home parks for seniors. There is a certain housing element. I was on the sustainability committee and the climate action committee, and that is an element in that document. But if they invested $200,000, and they are not up to code, I checked with HCD, there is no permit pulled, and it is called, they are supposed to go through HCD because all mobile home parks go through HCD. But they are supposed to come to the city and pull the permits after they fill out an application. That has not happened. And what ends up happening is the improvements that they did are not even ADA accessible. We can't even know. They spent all this money, but we can't even get people on a wheelchair to get into there. And I am losing time quickly. We would just hope that there would be more discussion on this, and the city council at least entertain this ordinance idea and come to a fair. We are not asking them to go out of business. We are just asking them to be fair. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. Let's keep no applause, please. Don't applaud or boo in this chamber. Thank you. Julie 3 followed by Ed. I wasn't sure if you said my name. Yeah. So, yeah, again, I have been at the county twice last year, and there were a lot of residents that came from both Chico and other parts of the county to complain to the county as well. They are talking about slum lords. I mean, these little ladies were talking about, because these property owners live in the Bay Area, or they live down in L.A., and then they leave some horrible property manager that I'm talking, there was some crazy bullying going on. It was awful. And they were scared to speak out. And so Brad Stevens brought in a legal report a year ago. And then Shelby Boston actually did a whole huge, contacted a lot of the mobile park residents. And she had, are they veterans? What's their ages? Do they have kids? And they were serious complaints. And, you know, unfortunately, everybody keeps kicking the can to somebody else. I mean, Todd Kimmelschuh kicked it back to Sal Lindano, who's apparently part of the homeowners people. And it was like, there's just something seriously wrong. And when I looked online at the Mobile Home Parks Owners Association, what it says here is that there's 91 cities and 10 counties in the state of California that have some form of mobile home park space rent stabilization ordinance. And what it does say in here is that many mobile homeowners rent the land that the home occupies. For a homeowner, this is not the best situation to be in, especially in a park. This is a park that is owned by a predatory company. Typically under the predatory owner business model, as space rents increase above fair market value, your mobile home will depreciate in value. The general rule of thumb is that for every $10 per month space rent increase, you lose $1,000 in mobile home equity. And it went on here. It's got every single one of these 91 cities. So for a city that has, let's say, 2,000, you know, the average is looking at like a cap of 75% CPI. So they'll do a CPI increase, like 50%, 65%. And then do 5% cap, 8% max. So 10% is outrageous. So something needs to be done. I personally think it should be a county issue. I mean, I'm running on housing security and homeowner protection. And, you know, most of the mobile homes, unfortunately, burned up up in Paradise. But they're having problems all over the county. So I just, you guys can lead the charge and set the model. But something needs to be done. It's just outrageous. Thank you for your time. Thank you. It's Ed Tights, followed by Salo Lindano. Hello, City Council, co-workers. Thank you. Wow. Friend of mine at the park, you know, he's just tired of that corporation crap. Excuse me, language. Just tired of corporations. Just not caring. And he said that he's looking at his numbers for his Social Security. That in five years, his rent is going to be. More than Social Security is getting. So right now he's praying for the Lord to take him and to be with his wife. And, you know, to see that man just glory years, golden years. He doesn't have them anymore. You know, back in the day before this corporation took over independent owner, 1% a year, maybe 2%, maybe nothing, you know, because he cared. He loved it. He loved that part. And he's gone. And then the corporations come over. And they don't care. They don't know us. They're in Florida, I think. And they got, I don't know, what is it, 70 other parks that they own? How can they be this cruel? How can they be this mean? That bottom dollar, that's all they care about. And we, as residents, care about each other. And I hope that the council will understand that. It is humans being humans to each other. And maybe that rent stabilization can happen. I hope it can happen. Just for my friend who is probably it's not going to happen in a year to come or two years. And like I said, he's hoping to open to be gone because he can't afford it. He's got medications. He's got PG&E. And that's going to go up again. So my heart goes out to him. And my heart goes out to you. Council, please listen. Please take it to heart. Because maybe someday your mom or dad will be there. Or you'll be there. We can't get extra jobs anymore. We got an 82-year-old friend of mine in the park has to work part-time in order to make the rent increase. Who wants to do that when you're 82? You want to enjoy life. You want to go out and see your grandkids and play with them and take them somewhere. Good stuff. Thank you. Thank you. Our last speaker is Sala Landano. Hello, Council. I work for the Western Manufactured Housing Communities Association, WMA. And we're the association that works with mobile home park owners throughout California. We do training, education, advocacy, whatever they need. I got involved in this situation a few months ago when I heard about what happened with a new owner coming in. A legacy came in from out of state. Unaware whatsoever of just sort of the norm in rent increases, not just here in the area, but in California in general. And I heard about this situation on a Friday. And I was able to get the owner on the phone by the end of the day. That's not an owner who is a corporate landlord who hates the residents and just wants to squeeze every buck out of the park and then sell it or something like that. The city of Chico is blessed with park owners that really care about their community. They're excellent stewards of their communities. And they have maintained their communities, the infrastructure very well compared to some of the parks that even in the county, you could compare them. Chico is blessed with some really good infrastructure. And most importantly, owners that really care about keeping that infrastructure and the safety of their residents as a priority. So first and foremost, I just want to clarify that. Rent stabilization is just a fancy word for rent control. It's not anything any different. It's essentially once everybody realized that rent control was destroying every community that has ever been enacted in, then the advocates decided that maybe we should change that word to something else. It's rent control. It's price control. It's exactly what has been tried in every extreme radical municipality in the world and has failed miserably. And in some of the cases that are right here in California, I think somebody earlier mentioned the situation in Petaluma. We don't want to get to a situation like Petaluma. The situation like Petaluma became the way that it is with park owners and the city and the residents having a terrible relationship with each other and being at war with each other because the city decided that park owners were not going to be able to keep up with inflation at all. They lowered the ability of park owners to keep up with inflation. They lowered the ability of park owners to keep up with inflation on insurance, on water. So park owners were left to a point of saying, we're either going to have to close our parks or we're going to have to sue the city because this is unsustainable. We don't want to do that here in Chico. We don't want the park owners that have actually cared about this community and are watching this right now, they're all tuned in to see how this council reacts to this. Because the tone that I've heard from those park owners is that they're actually looking for any possible expansion opportunity in Chico. But that goes away immediately once this council is terminated. And that's when we start discussing rent control. They're not going to invest, they're not going to double down on a community that goes and makes the same mistakes that every community in California. So I'm here to answer any questions you guys may have. All right. So. Discussion? Ms. Windsor. Go ahead. All right. You like to start, Mr. Van Over? You sure it's okay? Yeah. Yeah. Why not? So what's happened is we've had over the last 20, 50 years, this bias against mobile home parks. And so the city's made it very difficult to develop new mobile home parks. So we have a constriction in supply of mobile home sites. I mean, we have no. We have no So we have a short-term problem in that we have some. I don't like rent control, by the way, and it doesn't typically work. I mean, it's the same. It's the same time. We have a short-term problem with some people who are being hurt by these rent increases. But we have a longer-term structural problem in that we don't have enough sites for mobile homes. And so there's all this talk about affordable housing that goes on. You know, right now you can go down and buy a double-wide, very nice double-wide. And you can buy a double-wide for $55,000, $60,000. But until we have enough supply of sites to put these things on, they're not going to be affordable. So there's a short-term issue and there's a longer-term issue. Just a minute. All right. You ready? Mr. Winslow, you want to wait? All right. I'll wait. Go ahead, Dan. This is very complicated. It's a complex problem with many moving pieces. We've got an ownership in Florida, I believe, making some decisions. Perhaps they weren't the right decisions at that time. But the direction this was going has been curtailed, at least temporarily. So I have a great deal of empathy. I have a great deal of concern about the folks in, I'm going to be specific with Pleasant Valley. I'm going to be specific with Pleasant Valley. I'm going to be specific with the people who are going to be moving mobile estates. I met with you a long time ago now, seems like a long time ago. And at least for the short-term, things are in a better place. I also know Mr. Londano very well. I respect you very much. And you have given some additional information relative to this situation. So I'm not going to go anywhere. I think we need to listen, to learn. And perhaps come up with some kind of resolution that will be of benefit to both parties, both the ownership as well as the residents. So that's my comment right now. And I'm in a learning mode, I will say. So I need more information. Thank you. Mr. Wentzler. My grandmother in Pleasant Valley Mobile Estates was in a very bad place after the last 10% rent increase. So now they've temporarily offered to lower it to another 10% rent increase, the third. But they are Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese The difference between rent control and rent stabilization is that rent control will set caps for rents that they cannot exceed. Rent stabilization prevents the increases from happening all at once. It requires that they happen gradually over time. This is a very limited thing that we're doing. It really doesn't solve the problem overall because fixed incomes are never going to increase at the extent to which landlords can increase the rent. They are in just a tough situation, really. It's a particularly strained situation, and we can speak of it differently from all the rentals in the city of Chico, where also gouging occurs and also tenants are exploited and also landlords can get windfall profits and never have to answer to anybody for it. But here, the mobile home park owners, they have an incentive in a certain way to make things difficult for tenants because when they leave, they're able to purchase the properties for less. As we heard, the more they raise the rent, the less the equity is for the homeowners there. And the tenants are in a particularly difficult situation because they've invested in living here in a way that when you enter into an apartment, you don't. You've put money, you've put life savings. My dad and my uncles and my aunts, they pulled money together to buy a mobile home for my grandma so she could live there with us. And immediately we're faced with an issue of did we make a very poor investment and are we going to be just out for that? And I would hope that that wouldn't happen. So I'm glad that this has come before us. I'm glad that we've been able to do this. I'm glad that we've been able to take seriously the issues that are being faced by so many people within the city of Chico, particularly the vulnerable populations and mobile home parks. And I think that we should take action, given the opportunity that we have, and look for an ordinance that would allow us to limit rent increases in mobile home parks to a fair and reasonable return. And I also think that the petition process, including that in the ordinance, so that if there are significant capital investments required by the park owners, that they are able to get compensation for that. So they can make those. We don't end up seeing a degradation of the overall condition of mobile home parks. That's my position. All right. I just want to add a couple of things. We are dealing with things like Prop 13. So when you have somebody that owns a mobile home park for 25, 30, 40 years, they never have a tax basis change. And then a new evil corporation or a new person that lives in Chico that buys the company, buys it, they have a new tax base. And then they have a new tax base of which they're paying their taxes on. So there's an automatic increase in there. If money went into solar that is paying for the PG&E that is running the lights in the park or heating the pool or the room, we all know our PG&E just went up, what, 30 or 40 percent. If the solar is offsetting that, I would say that there's an opportunity that your space rent hopefully maybe only went up 2 or 3 or 4 percent instead of the 10 or 20 percent. I don't know. I'm just ‑‑ and I'm not looking at these people's books. I don't know anybody that's in this. I'm just saying there is a lot to this. And I don't think we should be short‑sighted to assume why people are making money and what they're doing. I do know other communities have been sued by not allowing somebody to make a fair profit. So while I want to do anything that we can and everything that we can to take care of a vulnerable community, I also don't want to create another problem and end us up in another lawsuit. So along those lines, we might need more discussion on the issue, but I think IA is a great place to have more discussion. I don't know that my fellow council members on IA would want to discuss this more, but I think that would make sense. So I'm going to make a motion to send this to IA to have some further discussion with staff and possibly get some public comment and then see what they want to do with it and bring it back to council. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I'm fine with that. As the chairman of IA, although I feel like we're kicking the can down the road here. I mean this is a tough situation. We all hate, except for Mr. Winslow, grant control. We got a bunch of people here that are hurting. And so we're trying to figure out how to do that. And I think we're stuck. And so maybe kicking it to IA is fine and I'm happy to do that. Is that a second? Yes. Okay. A motion and a second. Second. Council Member Bimmett? Yes. Council Member Morgan? No. Council Member Tandon? Yes. Council Member Van Overbeck? Yes. Council Member Winslow? Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds? Sure. Mayor Coolidge? Aye. Carries 6-1. All right. Moving on to item 5.6, consideration of Mayor Coolidge's request for the approval of the new Cal Water. I think everybody saw the information I wrote up on this. Basically, it was along the lines of what we had and what we've done in terms of phases. And we're now in our third phase of the energy savings program that the city has enacted. I figured it was time to move forward. Cal Water. Folks, if you could keep it quiet on the way out, please. So if we can move forward something similar. Cal Water has a similar program. They could come to council and make a presentation and we could move forward from there. And possibly couple that with a recommendation from the city so we can actually enact on it and not just have a presentation. So, that's the goal. Questions? I feel bad. I feel like I didn't hear a lot of that. Yeah. People were leaving. Okay. So Cal Water has a water savings program. Right. And it's a program for cities. For statewide or all, you know. Yes. For the variety of cities that they do business. So, just like PG&E is doing our program to save money on electrical power, invite Cal Water in, hear about their program, and see if it's worthwhile for the city to move through. Is that a motion? Well, it was my... Oh, we have to take that. Yeah. Yeah. It's my original motion. So, I have to present to council. So, I'm going to move forward. All right. So, do we have speakers? No. Okay. No speakers. So, entertain a motion. Or discussion. Motion to approve Mayor Coolidge's recommendation. I'll second. I think any movement towards savings water is good. It's very simple. So, I think this conversation or discussion... Presentation, excuse me, from Cal Water would be beneficial. I think it's a no-brainer, just like the electrical stuff that makes it more efficient. It makes sense. Yeah. Energy saving sources. So, you have a motion and a second? I do. Fire away. Council Member Bennett? Yes. Council Member Morgan? Yes. Council Member Tandon? Yes. Council Member Van Overbeek is absent. Council Member Winslow? Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds? Aye. Mayor Coolidge? Aye. Carries 6-0 with one absent. All right. Okay. So, item 5.7. Consideration of... And my request, this is my other request, regarding parking of... And I just love to X out the word large. Trucks, boats, and RVs on city streets. That was probably me misspeaking when I was a little tired. So, I wrote this one up as well. The idea behind this is to primarily move the length of time that a vehicle can stay on a road, which is a week, move it down to 72 hours, which is pretty much what is known throughout the state of California. Most cities and municipalities throughout the state do the 72 hours. I think that would benefit us. And then some opportunity for the council to have discussions about furthering that. And there are cities that require boats and RVs to be stored behind fences rather than in driveways or on city streets. So... Questions? Are you seriously proposing that every person that has a boat in their driveway has to put it behind a fence? I'm not seriously proposing that. I'm saying we have the discussion because there are actually a lot of cities who have that ordinance. Like, even Fresno has that ordinance. You have to put it behind a fence. I would like to hear what the state... But the primary... The primary reason behind this is to limit the... To change the restriction of how long a boat or RV can be on a city street from one week down to 72 hours. Is that correct, Mr. City Manager? That's the current... Yeah. And most cities and municipalities are 72 hours. Yeah. So... Do we have some plans about it? Some? Some. It's not that many? Yeah, I don't know the number. I don't know the number. I've had lots of campaigns. I mean... That's the reason why I'm doing it. Like, you know Chapman Barber neighborhood, there is no driveway. So that's kind of as difficult when you don't even have a dedicated driveway to Parkstown. So we have some older neighborhoods that do not have dedicated driveways or fences or things like that. So I think this could be great for your neighborhoods where you have dedicated driveways and garages, but there are a lot of older neighborhoods that don't have dedicated driveways. neighborhoods in our city that don't have garage or anything at all to store. What if they can't park for 72 hours? How can they park for a week? It's the same problem. Yeah. It is. I understand that. So they can't park there anyway. Well, they can't park there. They can't park for a week right now, and if, you know, if they are renting it or bringing it over, they can park out there for a week, and maybe want to go back on Monday and then Friday again, and then return it. I'm just making a scenario up because they're not... Yeah, you missed me. I'd like to get the opinion of the city manager on this. Yeah, and that point is true. You could theoretically just move the vehicle, and you would at least temporarily delay any sort of code enforcement action, but I think it's important to point out how code enforcement typically addresses these kinds of issues. It's complaint-driven, and it's usually after a vehicle is sat somewhere for weeks, months, or sometimes longer than that, and then code enforcement would go out, and as it sits in...as it exists in the city of Chico, put a seven-day notice on the vehicle, wait for the seven days, or whatever the number of hours is equivalent to that, to pass before it becomes eligible to tow. So by going to 72 hours, we speed up that enforcement process, but I think it's important to point out that it's not just a matter of weeks. It's a matter of weeks. It's a matter of weeks. And I think it's important to point out that in all likelihood, that vehicle has already been there for weeks or months. So I don't know if that answered your question. Yeah. So the goal behind it was just to come even with the California, you know, equivalent, which is in the vehicle code, so Chico can comply with that, like, well, be in tune with that, like most other cities are, which would allow people who are facing the problem, when they complain, to actually get the problem solved sooner rather than later. That part...may I speak? Yes, please. I just want to call... You can, too. The part about the time frame, I'm thinking about that, and you made a good point. The part about going onto somebody's property and saying, you can't have that boat or that trailer parked in your driveway, I can't. I can't do that. I just...that's just...that's too far. There'd be...I think there'd be a massive outcry from the public with something like that. So part of what you say, I'm kind of thinking about, maybe that's okay, but the other parts, I can't support it this time. Makes sense. Mr. Morgan. I only ask because I think this is a solution looking for a problem, which is something this Council continues to do. That if somebody makes a motion to do this, that could be... Code enforcement comes in during this discussion and gives us some feedback on how staffed they are and how realistic they are. And is this going to make any notable change in anything? I suspect the answer is going to be no, because I already asked. But I'd like you guys to hear from code enforcement, not just from me. Mr. Wood. I had to think about this one a lot. You know, my initial response was like, you know, is this about people, like, sleeping in their cars and we're like, we're going to hunt them all down? And I'm like, well, no, people sleep in their cars. They like to move around anyway. So it doesn't really impact that. You know what I would think maybe would be a better idea that would have a similar effect is some cities require that they do street sweeping and they make it so people have to move their vehicles when they do street sweeping. And that way we get cleaner streets and people have to move their big vehicles or other things parked there. And I think that's a better way to go. I mean, this does... I mean, it's a good question. I think it does imply that we staff up the court adequately so they can carry that out. But maybe we make people move. We don't even show up in the street sweep because we're understaffed. That's fine too. And it has the effect that you're looking for, I think. Just my thought. So I don't know why we're making this complicated. As I understand what the mayor wants to do is to make our code consistent with the 72-hour rule that the state has, which I think we have to do anyway. So why don't we... We don't have to. We don't have to. Okay. But we definitely could. Yeah. And the city manager supports it. So why don't we just do it and move on? Why don't we take it... I think I would like to hear from the court on the movement as well to see if they have staffing to go ahead and... Well, they're not going to have any more staff as a result. And they don't have to enforce it in 72 hours. It just gives them the ability to do it. We are coming into budget time. Well, we are coming into budget. Mr. Lamb, you're the one who's going to do it. Oh, yeah. I just wanted to chime in on whether you could go down to 72 or exceed 72. The state law is a minimum. So you couldn't do 48 hours, but you could allow more hours. Okay. So, was that a motion? Yes. Wait. Do we have public comment? Sorry. No. Okay. If that was a motion, what was the motion? I don't know. I'll change it to... The motion is to not allow the parking of RVs or boats or trucks over, I think it's 10,000 pounds gross vehicle weight on city streets for more than 72 hours. Yeah. Would it be better just as vehicles? Well, currently in the city code, it just says vehicle. So a vehicle is all... Vehicle of any kind. Okay. Of any... All kinds of things. All kinds of things. Boats, cars, et cetera, et cetera. All right. So... Shopping cart. Debbie, can you... So it's... You can't park on a city street. You can park any vehicle on a city street for more than 72 hours. Okay. Thank you. All right. Yes. I would still like to hear from code enforcement though, just to see what they have to say. I would like to make a substitute motion. Okay. Just a second. Thank you, sir. Did he get a... I apologize, but was there a second to that? No, but I'll second it. Okay. Just a second. No, I'm seconding the first motion. Okay. Well, we didn't wait for the first motion to get a second, but that's okay. I'm ready for the substitute. All right. I'll second it. He hasn't given the substitute motion. All right. Thank you for your confidence. I appreciate it. Thank you. I'll second it. The substitute motion would be that we hear from code enforcement, gain their input on this, and then we can move forward or not. All right. Take the substitute motion first. Just a second. Councilmember Bennet? Yes. Councilmember Morgan? Yes. Councilmember Tandon? Yes. Councilmember Van Overbeck? No. Councilmember Winslow? Okay. Vice Mayor Reynolds? Sure. Mayor Coolidge? No. It carries 5-2. All right. Okay. So moving on, what do we have left? Items after the posting of the agenda? None. Reports and communications, following reports and communication items are provided for Council's information. No action can be taken on items under this section of the Council. Under this section of the agenda unless Council agrees to include it on subsequent agenda. 6.1 City Manager's report? No report. All right. 6.2 Councilmember request pursuant to APMP 1010. Councilmembers may verbally request an item be agendized at future meeting after stating what the item would be. Majority vote of the Council is needed in order for staff to agendize. Anyone? I got one. All right. Vice Mayor? Actually this is a question I'm not sure it needs to be agendized but I do. I just want to, I would like to see if we can put our $118,000 or $119,000 towards the sobering center. Do you need us to put that as an agenda item or are you just going to bring it back? No. No. We can do that. We already plan to do that. As I mentioned we were just waiting to get some, hopefully get some answer to our question as to what our annual revenue is because at this point we have not seen anything that sets that in concrete. So we don't want to set up a situation where we're over committing. Absolutely. Gotcha. Okay. Just wanted to ensure. I thought that's what I heard. Thank you. We heard, it was part of the planning Commission recommendation on the item I heard earlier about requests from bar owners they wanted to forward to us for consideration about lifting the ban on selling alcohol after midnight on some particular days. I'd like to make a motion that we discuss that, that lifting the ban on selling alcohol after midnight on certain days, I think it's Labor Day, graduate week, I don't know when it is. Yeah, I would just say, revisit the limitations on the sale, hours in the sale of alcohol or something. We know what you mean. So moved. Yeah. I'll second that. All right, motion on the second. Although I'm trying to remember, is that in the Muni code or is that a? Yeah. It's under the business of sell alcohol. Okay. Tonight. It's under our code section in Title 19, businesses for sell alcohol. Ironically, I didn't hear anybody mentioned it tonight, but that shouldn't deviate you from your motion, but. All right. There was two or three people that mentioned it tonight. They mentioned it again tonight? Yeah, but I thought that while we're addressing this. Okay, guys, sorry. So let's not deviate from the motion here. Did you get the motion, Madam Clerk? I did. Okay, we have a second. Yes. When you're ready. Council Member Bennett? Yes. Council Member Morgan? Yes. Council Member Tandon? Yes. Council Member Van Overbeek? Yes. Council Member Winslow? Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds? Aye. Mayor Coolidge? Aye. Carries 7-0. Kevin Warren. All right. Let's see if someone else has one first, though. I think Mr. Morgan, did you have one? No. No, I didn't. I know. So, Mr. Van Overbeek. The, if anybody saw the front page of the Sunday's evening, it was about the accumulation of sediment in the Lindo Channel where it splits off at five miles. That is the most important flood control structure we have in Chico. If that fails, basically everything around Big Chico Creek, including the downtown floods, I mean, depending on how big an event we have, we have these, I'm old enough to remember the flood of 55 and the 97, they were frighteningly large events. It turns out that after the Lindo Channel was engineered and constructed in 1965, I believe it was finished, it was maintained for about 20 years and then the maintenance stopped. So what happens every year is in high water events, that debris rocks get pushed downstream and they built up right where it splits. The Lindo Channel starts and splits off Big Chico Creek at five mile. Right now it's estimated that there is seven or eight feet of debris, so the bottom of that channel is seven or eight feet higher than as it was designed and it's also become narrower because of the encroachment of foliage from the sides. It's supposed to be 140 feet wide. So it's an estimate, nobody knows exactly, there's an estimate of, okay. So, let's look at the, let's look at the, let's look at the, let's look at the Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese and report in the near future on where we are in preparing. So you just have to have the item for discussion. So just, yeah. Right. So I'd like to put it on the agenda. You wanna agendize the discussion about the... I don't understand the motion issue. Agendize a discussion about the diversion dam. Okay, we had a second? It's a diversion. We're second. Okay, I do have the second. Council Member Bennett? Yes. Council Member Morgan? Yes. Council Member Tandon, I'm sorry. Yes. Council Member Van Overbeek? Yes. Council Member Winslow? Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds? Yes. Mayor Coolidge? Sure. Carries 7-0. All right, I believe Mr. Winslow has another one as well. I do wanna preface this, but not for a long time or anything. Somebody reached out to me recently, concerned that the lighting in their entrance to the bike path was, there was not lighting really, and that that was a safety issue that they perceived. They talked to their neighbors, they considered petitioning the city, and they're not even in my district, for some reason they reached out to me to ask how they should proceed with that. And this is something that I brought up the first day on council. I like to think we've had a long year of team building and such, so I think I'll shoot it again. I saw I'd like to make a motion to discuss lighting, crime prevention through environmental design on Chico's bike paths. I'll second. Okay, thank you, Sean. Thank you, okay. All right, motion and second. Madam Clerk, when you're ready. Council Member Bennett? Yes. Council Member Morgan? Yes. Council Member Tandon? Yes. Council Member Van Overbeek? Yes. Council Member Winslow? Yes. Council Member Wiesmaier-Reynolds? Aye. Mayor Coolidge? Sure. Carries 7-0. All right, so. Order please, order. All right, we'll move on to, I'm keeping your pen, 6.3 Sunshine Draft MOU, and then move to adjourn. Thank you very much. Thank you.! Thank you.
