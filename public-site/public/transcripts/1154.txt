 Thank you.  Same, right?  Close enough.  That's Christ, but that's okay.  Ah, Christ.  Thank you very much.  Would you bow your heads as we open in prayer?  Dear wise and loving Father, first let me say thank you on behalf of all who are gathered  here today.  Thank you for your many and abundant blessings.  Thank you for life itself, the measure of health we need to fulfill our callings, for  sustenance, and for friendship.  Thank you for the ability to be involved in useful work and for the honor of being and  bearing appropriate responsibilities.  Thanks as well for all the freedom to embrace you or the freedom to reject you.  Thank you for loving us even so, from the boundless and gracious nature.  We come to you tonight asking for your blessing and help as we're gathered together.  I'm asking tonight that you would graciously grant all here wisdom to govern, a sense of  welfare and true needs of our people, a keen thirst for justice and righteousness, for  guidance in the matters at hand, and ask that you would clearly show us how to conduct our  work with a spirit of joy and enthusiasm.  Please give us an assurance of what we would please you, and we ask you tonight that we  would do things that would benefit those of our great city, Chico.  It's in your blessed name we pray.  Amen.  Thank you very much.  All right.  Please stand and join me in the Pledge of Allegiance.  I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for  which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.  All right.  Madam Clerk, can you take the roll, please?  Council Member Bennett?  Here.  Council Member Morgan?  Here.  Council Member Tandon?  Here.  Council Member Van Overbeck?  Here.  Council Member Winslow?  Here.  Vice Mayor Reynolds?  Here.  Mayor Coolidge?  Present.  All right.  Speaker Card Announcement.  Anyone wishing to address the Council on any matters listed on the agenda must first complete  a Speaker Card.  They're found at the back of the chamber.  Turn them in here to the Clerk.  My left, your right.  And once we begin an item, no additional cards will be taken.  I do want to say, and we do usually say this, so we don't clap, we don't boo, we don't hiss,  we don't snap in this chamber.  We don't want anyone to feel like they don't have the right to speak.  So people are speaking, remain silent.  When they finish, remain silent.  Move on to the next speaker.  Everybody gets their fair chance to speak.  So we appreciate that.  If you have signs, hold them up in the back of the room, not in front of somebody else.  So, all right.  And with that, we will move on to our February.  20th, 24, 24 closed session announcement from city attorney John Lamb.  Mr. Mayor, we're not going to report currently just because we have two items for closed session  that still need to be held after the meeting.  Sounds good.  So we will report after the meeting because we're going to go back into closed session.  All right.  Consent agenda.  All matters listed on the consent are considered routine in nature and therefore can be enacted  in one motion.  Do we have any council disqualifications?  All right.  Seeing none.  Any speakers on consent?  We have none.  We're going to take a motion.  Move to approve.  Second.  Motion from Council Member Morgan.  A second from Vice Mayor Reynolds.  Madam Clerk, when you're ready.  Okay.  Council Member Bennett.  Yes.  Council Member Morgan.  Yes.  Council Member Tandon.  Yes.  Council Member Van Overbeck.  Yes.  Council Member Winslow.  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds.  Aye.  Mayor Coolidge.  Aye.  Carry 7-0.  All right.  Public comments.  Members of the public may address the council.  At this time, on any matter not already listed on the agenda and within the jurisdiction's  authority, the council cannot take any action at this meeting on requests made under this  section of the agenda.  How many speakers?  We have five.  All right.  Three minutes.  Okay.  And I'm going to call the first two names.  And if you can line up in that middle aisle.  Curtis Anderson, followed by Rob Berry.  Thank you.  No. !  Sorry.  I live on the riverbed lane adjacent to the Lindo Channel.  And I used to live in a safe and secure neighbourhood, but no more.  This area, the Lindo Channel, is one of the first areas in the forest for illegal camping.  But unfortunately, since that time, many people have moved back in and camps are continuing.  Because of these camps, I don't feel safe.  My neighbours don't feel safe.  We've had to deal with break-ins, with graffiti, with human waste, with dogs not on leashes,  all kinds of things that normally come with these types of camps.  One camp behind Mission Ranch has been there continuously since October of 2023.  I have called several times, numerous times, to the non-emergency police number reporting  this camp.  Many months went by.  Finally, in November 20th of 2023, the police came to the camp.  The camp was cleaned by the city.  A crew of two people came with hazmat suits and cleaned it all up.  Next day, I walked my dog by there, and there was another camp there less than 24 hours later.  So I called the police number again, reported it, they said, oh did you clean it up?  And I said, yeah, it holds back.  And that has been there continuously to this day.  So on February 11th, I sent an email to the City Council using the link on the webpage.  My name is Nick Amogou.  documenting my concerns with a bunch of pictures.  I didn't receive a response to that email.  Today I called Public Works and asked what the deal was  with enforcement and the channel.  They informed me that as of right now,  they are not enforcing illegal encampments  until they get feedback from the federal judge, I guess,  which was news to me.  So I'm here tonight to request the following three items.  Three things be done.  Number one, please enforce the illegal camping rules  in the areas that have already been enforced.  Number two, please have somebody regularly patrol those areas  so that when people move back in,  they can be asked to leave again.  And number three, if there's a specific reason  why these camps aren't currently being enforced,  could you please let me know?  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you, Barry, followed by Sasha, Anya.  Good evening.  Today my topic is transparency in government.  As some of you probably know,  I've been in correspondence with your city attorney's office  over a number of public records requests.  And the object of this exercise is to try to determine  specifically exactly where the boundaries are between  the public's right to know and your rights to confidentiality.  This specifically involves the Warner case.  That case, since its inception,  has been conducted almost exclusively confidentiality wise,  both in terms of closed session,  and also in terms of the release of public documents.  So I'm just here to encourage you to please continue  in good faith and candor,  and to continue to support these informal discussions.  If I detect that I'm being slow rolled or obstructed,  then we have to go to a more formal process.  And trust me, nobody wants to do that.  So I'm hoping that we can have a dialogue  and establish exactly what it is that you think  the limiting principles are of your right to confidentiality  in both closed session and public records.  And we'll take it from there.  Thank you very much.  Thank you, Sasha, Anya, followed by Julie Three.  Thank you.  I just wanted to say thank you for your service.  Everybody out there doing their jobs, thank you.  Um...  Now that we're further down the road  from our COVID experience,  we all have a little bit more understanding  and there's a lot less panic and pressure.  I just wanted to mention that there exists  an international alliance of over 17,000 physicians  and medical scientists that have signed  the following declaration.  And I won't read all of it, but I'll read some of it.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  we declare physicians should never be blocked from providing any necessary medical treatment.  The fact that we have this many doctors this upset about these vaccines  and that the jurisdictions or municipalities got behind all of this pretty much lockstep  with very little to support them doing so is extremely worrisome.  And I hope we never revisit that kind of rubber stamping of pharma rubber stamping  that the public just do what they're told and not be able to make their own decisions.  Anyway, I'll let my time go. Thank you.  Thank you. Julie Threatt followed by Julia Kenner.  Yeah, good evening, Julie Threatt.  District six and I am here to advocate for the vaccine injured me being one of them by this deadly COVID shot.  As Sasha mentioned, there is a politicians against the shot campaign pledge.  It's called Americans for Health Freedom dot org.  I'm here to ask each one of you to sign it.  There's over two hundred and fifty eight of us that have signed it.  There's one hundred and twenty six candidates like myself that have signed it.  One hundred and thirty two elected officials, including city council members and school board members.  Dr. Mary Talley Bowden is the one that started this campaign.  And it's on Twitter.  Her face is right now.  And Surgeon General Joseph Latipo of Florida has signed it.  There's thirty nine states that have publicly stated that the COVID shots must be pulled off the market immediately  and are pledging not to take donations from big pharma.  And again, over 17000 physicians are standing behind us.  The states with the most elected representatives are Texas with 28, New Hampshire with 25 and Kentucky with 11 states  with the most candidates running for office that want these shots stopped is Texas with 49.  California's got 10.  I was the first one to sign it.  The two electeds in California that have signed it are Sue Frost from the Sacramento County Supervisors.  Colton Weeks, a San Francisco Republican County Central Committeeman.  The eight candidates that have signed for it.  Me running for Butte County Board of Supervisors District five.  Michael Oxford running for Assembly District 17.  Yvette Corkeen, San Francisco Republican Central Committee.  Steve Wozniak, US House California five.  Chief Kibbs, US House California two.  Chris Colum, US House California two.  Denise Aguiar, a San Francisco Republican Central Committee.  Assembly for District 13.  And Michelle Morgan, Central Committee for the GOP in Orange County.  Also notable people that have signed on to this are Senator Ron Johnson from Wisconsin.  Representative Thomas Massey from Kentucky.  Representative Margie Taylor Greene from Georgia.  And Representative Eric Stevenson from US House North Carolina.  And again, a couple city council members.  You know, again, three years ago, three years ago this month, I took that second shot of Moderna at the Enloe U County Public Health Clinic.  And I got brain fog, which is microangiopathy on my brain scan.  Tinnitus, and I've had five emergency eye surgeries.  Three detached retinas and two cataracts.  I literally was out there at one of those mass vaccination clinics, witnessing a Chico State track athlete fall to the floor in a seizure.  My mom's died of four shots.  The shirt I'm wearing is in honor of Trista Martin, a beautiful 18-year-old who died after her Pfizer injection.  And this shirt says, We will not be silenced.  I urge each one of you, as elected officials in my city, to please sign off an Americans for Health Freedom.org pledge.  Thank you.  And we just, yeah, we can't go down this path again.  Thank you for listening.  Thank you.  Our last speaker is Julia Kenner.  Hello, I'm Julia Kenner, and I wanted to speak to you about housing.  So in particular about special planning areas, and in particular with that, the Bellmure area.  And I live actually in that part of town, and it's in the county currently.  Mayor, ma'am, so your discussion actually falls later.  It is actually not about that.  It is about the general area.  Okay, so you wanted to.  By name.  I did.  Yeah.  How can it not be about it?  Yeah, it might be more appropriate under the other comments.  Mr. City Attorney, what do you think?  I heard the subdivision's name.  I would recommend that we just take it during the public hearing.  That's not the subdivision's name.  That's the special planning area.  Excuse me.  Yeah.  But I think it is two different ways.  Mayor, do you want to see where she goes with this discussion?  Okay, great.  Sorry.  Okay, so I live on that side of town, and my concern with all the special planning areas is where they're located.  Okay.  And.  I love the idea of planning for the future.  And that area, because it is zoned through the county BLDR, it is one acre minimums right now.  And there is a lot of development going in there.  And that is prime area for housing for Chico.  And the spec homes that are going in are almost a million dollars each.  They are approximately an acre each.  And it does not provide the housing for Chico that we need.  It is located near prime services.  There are two grocery stores.  There are coffee shops.  There are gas station.  There are hardware stores.  It's near Highway 32.  It is near Highway 99.  And there are very, I think it's probably the nearest out of any of the special planning areas we have for the most services.  So I would love to see in there.  I would like to see the city work with the county to create much denser housing instead of one per acre.  That it would either be more like 2 to 7 per acre to create more homes for Chico's.  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right.  Thank you.  Okay.  So we are moving on to public hearings.  Item 4.1 the Orchard Creek Estates Project.  Let me.  Before we start.  And we get our report from Mr. Solle.  So there's some guidelines for this hearing.  First off we're going to report ex parte communications.  So each council member we can start with Mr. Bennett and work our way left.  Yeah.  Ex parte communications.  Speaker, Jake Morley is speaking on behalf of the.  I have had conversations with Mr. Tatro as well as Mr. Morley.  Mr. Morley.  And I have had several conversations with Mr. Tatro.  And I have had several conversations with staff regarding the project.  All right.  Ms. Randover.  I as well had a conversation with Mr. Tatro and staff on this.  All right.  I was not able to meet with anybody but they did reach out to me.  I did have a conversation with Mr. Tatro and his staff.  The planning commissioner told me the night of the first meeting on it about it.  And the next day I spoke to Mr. Tatro about it.  I spoke with Mr. Tatro in a joint meeting with Vice Mayor Reynolds.  No discussion with staff.  Some discussion with Tony Scott and my planning commissioner.  All right.  Thank you everyone.  Appreciate that.  So how this goes is staff reports 15 minutes.  Council discussion or questions 10 minutes.  Then we open the public hearing.  Total public hearing is 50 minutes long.  Not a minute more.  The applicant will.  And the public hearing is 50 minutes long.  I will say the public hearing has 15 of those minutes.  Additional speakers meaning the public at whole share 30 minutes.  Which so if we get 20 speakers we will make it so you can fall within that timeframe.  Then the applicant gets a three-minute rebuttal if we so deemed to grant it.  And then we close the hearing and then we have a discussion motion and vote which should not take 20 minutes or longer as determined by the council.  So we will start upon that pathway with the staff report from Mr. Sali.  You get a whopping 15 minutes.  Thank you, Mayor Kilich.  And good evening, council members.  This project is located on the southeast corner of Nord Avenue and Hinshaw Avenue in West Tico.  The entitlements requested by the applicant include a general plan amendment and rezone that affect 20 acres.  A subdivision that affects 15 acres.  And to accommodate those, to process those applications, we have a subcommittee that is going to be in charge of the subcommittee.  And we will be preparing an initial study and mitigated negative declaration, which I will call an MND, to satisfy the requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act.  This project site is located within the special planning area for the Bellmuir SPA 4 located in West Tico.  It is one of five special planning areas located in the city.  And that means there is a group of policies that go along with it that say to comprehensively plan the area, bring it all in as one.  And build it out in a cohesive manner where people can understand what the build out is going to look like ahead of time.  Zooming in on this special planning area, we have additional details in appendix C of the general plan that speaks a little bit more about what would be expected out there.  And this one was a late addition to the general plan, so there wasn't much thought given to this conceptual land use diagram.  It basically says we think it's mostly going to be low density residential with maybe some sort of residential development.  And then there's a small scale agricultural remaining, thinking that maybe some people wouldn't want to sell or convert to a non-agricultural use.  And those could remain and we would figure out how to keep them all intact moving forward with a special planning effort.  The green, secondary open space, SOS stands for secondary open space.  The yellow, LDR stands for low density residential, which in the city means two to seven units per acre.  The bottom half of the slide is the  bottom half of this same picture in the appendix C of the general plan shows the aerial photograph as it looked in 2009.  And it shows also that the project is only adjacent, or the special planning area only abuts the green line on the north end against Bell Road and Muir Avenue.  The project site in yellow here is actually a thousand feet away from the green line and a thousand feet away from the nearest zoned, agriculturally zoned property.  The county, as mentioned earlier, is a little bit more than a hundred feet away from the green line.  And it does have this whole special planning areas zone for very low density residential.  And that's a viable zoning in the county.  And what that means is developers can show up out there and get approved for one acre minimum lot sizes.  So the ten acre parcels are going out with ten large lot subdivisions.  And this graphic here shows how there's been several of them over the past ten or fifteen years out in that area.  And just to depict it a different way,  we see holes being created in what could be the special planning area that could provide some density where those orchards are  and could potentially lead to some infrastructural connections, maybe some roadways that go east-west in this area.  But with these other subdivisions in the county happening, it's becoming impossible to realize any sort of vision like that.  And that's really where staff's position lands on this whole question of whether or not this project should be omitted,  or not be implemented.  and brought out of the special planning area or kept in it while the rest of the special planning area develops pursuant to county regulations.  So moving on from the special planning area component to the zoning.  The city has the site zoned SBA, special planning area.  It's waiting for that special plan to come along and specific plan to come along and zone it a different way.  But instead, the applicant proposes to zone the two subdivision parcels R1, that's shown in yellow,  and the other subdivision parcels R2, that's shown in yellow.  Masonic Hall comes along for the ride.  They would be zoned PQ, which means they get to just stay where they are, keep doing what they're doing.  That zoning would be appropriate for them to just continue their service uses, their community service uses.  And the revision, so the applicant's proposal would be to revise Appendix C to omit the properties from the special planning area  and leave the rest of it the way the general plan has it.  Talking a little bit more about the subdivision, it used to be orchards.  I think most of those are either removed or in the process of being removed right now.  There's a couple houses out there that would be retained with the subdivision,  notably the complex at the corner of Nord and Hinshaw would be retained.  The subdivision have a street network that looks like this, a couple of streets and a long cul-de-sac that reaches back toward East Avenue.  And that is shown more in yellow.  I'll give you a little bit more detail on this slide here.  The project went to the Planning Commission, and I'll mention a little bit about how that review went.  But some of the issues brought up involve the fact that this long cul-de-sac that reaches back toward East Avenue  would have a back-on-lot condition, which means the houses would front a new street within the subdivision  and their backyards would back up to East Avenue or Nord Avenue.  And that means there would be rear yard fences along there.  And that was a question at the Planning Commission.  We didn't have this graphic that I'm about to show you,  but we have since clarified that where it's shown in blue here and you have that back-on condition,  we would have this six-foot tall, board-on-board, solid fencing with a decorative cap on top of it.  And that's what would be constructed along those rear back-on conditions.  There's also questions about the level of improvements out there.  I'm not going to stand here and tell you that Nord Avenue is a street that can,  can accommodate a lot of traffic or anything like that.  But this project would be required to, from the center line of the street over on their side,  improve it to city street standards, which would be 20-foot paved.  That's a travel lane and a parking lane.  Separated sidewalk, curb gutter and sidewalk with street trees and the parkway strip.  The existing contiguous sidewalk on East Avenue would remain.  That wouldn't be changed by the project.  But this is what it would be look, look, this is what it would look like along Nord and Hinshaw.  There was some confusion over the trees.  The tree study was done in two efforts.  So if somebody only found the first effort, then they would have rightfully seen that some of the trees were missing  because it was done in a second effort as well.  The initial study did address all of the tree removal.  And the subdivision map shows which trees would be retained in and around the existing residences  where they don't have X's on them.  That's where the trees would be kept.  About 350 of the 370 trees would be removed by the project.  And there are conditions recommended to adhere to the city's tree removal, tree preservation regulations,  which require the developer to mitigate for the diameter that's been removed.  So even though that occurred in the county before annexation, we're carrying that condition through to the subdivision map.  And then in addition to those tree conditions, we have conditions for the environmental mitigations  that came out of that process for nesting birds, cultural resources, tribal monitors, and hazardous resources.  As I mentioned, the Planning Commission held a public hearing on January 18th and talked about many things.  They heard a lot from the public.  You're going to hear a lot from the public tonight.  We have a very interested and engaged public on this project.  They're concerned about increased traffic, the tree removal, some of the subdivision improvements that I mentioned,  and everything on this slide.  I won't read them all to you.  But I'll note that there were identified by the Masonic Hall,  the potential that the new neighbors could complain about the activities that would continue to happen there.  And so they continue to work out some conditions with the Masonic Hall.  And there's a memo that was distributed this afternoon, and if not, there's a printed copy of it,  where the developers have asked for two conditions to be added.  One for a stucco fence to be created between the Masonic Hall and the subdivision,  and the other one for a deed notification.  Okay.  So, the deed notification.  Kind of like the right to farm notice that we have on the other conditions.  This would be a right to allow the Masonic Hall to continue operating as they have been for many years,  doing sometimes outdoor events that may generate noise.  And, you know, you need to know that as a neighbor that that's to be expected if they're your neighbor and you're buying there.  The Planning Commission ultimately recommended that the City Council deny the project,  that the City Council not adopt the mitigated negative declaration,  not approve the general plan amendment and not approve the subdivision.  So we forwarded that recommendation to you under appendix attachment G of your packets tonight.  Staff is maintaining its recommendation for approval of the project.  For the reasons that we cited earlier, we see that the potential to get urban level densities out in the special planning area  are eroding away over the years as this county keeps approving subdivisions out there.  So we are supporting the project.  And that concludes my presentation.  I'll answer any questions.  All right.  Questions?  Let's start with Mr. Morgan.  Okay.  I've got two.  When you were talking about the sidewalk and the setback, what is on the, and you had the map.  You don't have to bring it back up.  What is the setback for landscaping from the sidewalk to that fence you showed?  There's no required setback.  We'd have to ask the developer to specify what they want.  I don't have a cross-section detail for that.  Usually two feet is fine.  Okay.  So you can ask them that question.  It can be two to ten feet is often.  Okay.  And if you can go to the last slide.  And say a little more slowly why staff recommends city council's approval because the county,  the term you used, it sounded like allowing more urbanization of rural areas,  which I think is probably what the people don't necessarily want.  So can you explain that?  Has the city's, I'm sorry,  has the county's allowing more of that anyway?  The staff's position is that we would rather see urban level, city level densities,  at least in this project, if not, yeah, at least for this project,  because the other option is to force the developer to try to master plan this area,  and they don't have the appetite to do that.  You can't acquire enough property in this area to master plan it to make it worth the headache anymore.  So I'm going to paraphrase, and please correct me if I'm wrong.  Allow more urbanization.  Allow them to do kind of what they're talking about or nothing's going to happen.  Potentially.  Well, we could maybe 15 units, 15 county.  Which doesn't help with housing and all the other issues.  It does not help what we need.  Thank you.  All right.  Mr. Bennett.  Senior planner, have you had any conversations with the applicant regarding a stucco fence on the blue line from the corner?  You're aware it goes down.  It goes from East Avenue on around on Nord.  I seem to remember something being said about that.  I asked for clarification because he told me he wanted to do it for the Masons.  And he said, no, he wants to do the wooden fence for that exterior condition.  The Mason's Masonic Hall fence is especially for the noise.  OK.  That's why he's asked for two different types.  I'm going to ask you an awkward question.  It is.  It appears from the conversations I have had with staff as well as other individuals that the special planning area was somewhat of a last minute addition to the general plan.  It seems to me after all of the explanations in the conversations I've had with you and others, would you recommend and or would you support the elimination of the S.P.A.  and allow the development of the area without the added complication and the complex issues that seem to be arising due to the S.P.A. designation?  What would you how do you feel about that?  Separate from this question for this project?  Yes.  We should take a look at it.  OK.  It has a significant uphill battle for the city to realize its goals and policies.  And it seems like it's going to happen again and again and again with any kind of development other than the county standards of one house per one acre.  Thank you.  All right.  Mr. Winslow.  So the idea of having comprehensive planning in the special planning area is to be able to efficiently extend urban services, make sure that they're paid for and also include other kind of amenities and community character that people are looking at.  So if we take this out of here and granted it's the southernmost portion of it, to what extent does approving the subdivision compromise any future of comprehensive planning for the rest of the development of the area?  I mean, it doesn't foreclose the possibility, but it gets a little bit harder.  But it's already very difficult.  I guess if you imagine there were a comprehensive plan done with more property owners involved, would it look different from this in certain respects?  Sure.  Yes.  This part of the sub this part of the special planning area probably wouldn't look much different at all.  We would try to get things in other parts of the planning area like those road connections.  It would be very difficult at this point.  There's just no good place to put road connections anymore.  Thank you.  All right.  Colleague Smyer.  So to follow in that direction, you talk about comprehensive planning and making this last time I checked, if I'm not mistaken, it's somewhere between 97 and 100 owners out there that would have to come together to make a comprehensive plan, correct?  At least.  There's 250 parcels.  I'd imagine there's over 200 owners.  And we can't get seven people to agree on that?  We can't get seven people to agree on anything in any one day.  But that's a whole other.  Subdivision standards.  So is this if an SPA change was done in the future, is there anything that's being done in this subdivision that is not done in the rest of the subdivisions that are done in Chico that it would be that much different for if this wasn't that it would make it comprehensive and complete as we go forward in the future?  No.  We might.  This project might inherit like some street lighting standards or something like that.  So they're doing inherently what they do in all other subdivisions.  I understand every single subdivision has minor differences.  But in general, they're following what we require for a subdivision in the city because this would be in the city if it's annexed in, correct?  That's correct.  Okay.  Typical.  Thank you.  Council Member Tandon.  I know you did talk about the funding.  This part there.  This part there.  This part there.  This part there.  This part there.  special planning area, there would be parks. There's no park maintenance district, meaning  that if there were a park developed in a comprehensive plan just north of here, then they wouldn't  be, could we re-go back and then assess them to help support that park?  Well, there will be a park. Where the PQ is right up the street here will be a five-acre  park. Card plans to build that park in the next couple of years. So there will be a park  nearby. Folks, thank you. Let's, again, not.  It was news to me, too. All right.  Is there any concerns regarding this extra long cul-de-sac that we have, which is, I  think, 700 square foot instead of 300, which is usually happens?  500 feet is the usual standard for the maximum length of a cul-de-sac. And that's really  kind of laying over from the days where you didn't have so much sprinklers on all the  buildings. And now we have sprinklers on all the buildings so that.  Assuages a lot of concern about a long cul-de-sac where everybody would have to get out of it.  So, no, we don't have any concerns over the long cul-de-sac.  Just curious on that. Did fire department, is there any comments we have from the chief  on that? From the safety perspective?  I have not weighed in or my fire marshal hasn't weighed in, but I would like to because I  do have some concerns when you have a long cul-de-sac like that, being able to get in  and out.  I think it's problematic.  But that would be weighed down the line. Is that correct?  What's that?  Would the would we get the would we get the do the fire chief get to weigh in on the cul-de-sac or  maybe we need to put an extra fire hydrant in the middle of it or whatever needs to be done?  I'm just curious to address the safety of that. So I'm not sure I'm just working off the comments that I've received.  I see from the fire department that they had no comments or concerns with the long cul-de-sac.  Sure. Thank you.  I'm interested how you remedy that, but I think obviously that will need to be looked at.  Was there any thoughts or discussions about a traffic like it at Gwinnon East because of this project?  No.  I lived on the corner there. It's an extreme for a long time.  I've lived on the corner there for a long time.  I've lived on this side of this side before my current home and it's an extremely dangerous intersection.  I just have concerns about the additional traffic going through there.  I think there's long-term plans for a signal there, but I don't think this is-  I don't think so.  Yeah.  It's the site of a lot of accidents.  All right.  This was curious about that.  All right.  Any further questions?  Thank you very much.  All righty.  So we will open the public hearing.  All right.  Applicant gets 15 minutes.  Okay, and I understand that's Jake Marley.  All right, Jake, welcome.  Hi, good evening.  The floor is yours.  Let's set a timer first.  Yeah, I hope not to take 15 minutes.  I've had a lot of people say that, and then we had to set a timer.  I've got it.  All right.  Jake, good evening.  Mike did a fantastic job presenting the project.  I'm going to be thanking him for his time and energy  and getting us here tonight.  So he really kind of cut down on a lot of what I was going to say.  So as discussed, there's about 90 to 100 different property owners  out there in the SPA, and the SPA area is actually requesting  this type of development.  The general plan specifically says that due to the rural nature  of the area, planning efforts will focus on single-family  residential development where opportunities exist.  The general plan also states that planning in the Bailiwick area  includes strategic provisions.  The general plan also states that planning in the Bailiwick area  includes strategic provisions of infrastructure, development road,  and storm drain that will also allow opportunity  for single-family residential development  on larger undeveloped parcels within the general plan.  Our request is exactly that.  That yellow map that was shown earlier is low-density residential,  and that's what we're asking to do,  low-density residential with city infrastructure.  Also noted by staff is that development is occurring out there.  We estimate about 102 acres, which represents about 40%  of the development potential of that site.  If those 102 acres were to develop at the same intensity  that we are looking at doing, that's a total loss of about 388 units  of holding capacity in the SPA.  We believe the findings can be made tonight,  as outlined in your staff report.  There are pages of general plan policies and action items all tied  to land use, housing, circulation, community design,  open space, and economic and general plan elements.  One that I would like to highlight specifically  that speaks to the importance of the development potential  of the SPA.  It speaks pretty much to this project.  It states land use 1.3, says maintain balanced growth  by encouraging infill development where city services are in place  and allow expansion into the SPA.  So by amending the general plan tonight,  you are actually supporting the general plan in the SPA  by allowing low-density development to occur.  Just to go over some of the talking points that were brought up,  the fence along this north is going to be two feet held back  from the sidewalk with landscaping and shredders within there.  The Masonic fence will be held back six inches,  so it's technically the individual property owners.  It won't be Masonic's responsibility to maintain that.  Pipes sizing, particularly in Norton Henshaw, will be oversized  to allow any or accommodate future development  if that happens in the area.  And we are also planning a 12-foot access, emergency access  at the end of the cul-de-sac that will be fully paved.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Any questions?  So there's not a maintenance district?  It would be an abiding assessment district with, I believe, kind of standard.  And I believe you had a question about going back.  I usually believe that means you have to set those things up in advance.  I'm not particular about the nuances of those things,  but if language was included about parks and then what came online,  that has to be done initially before the place is occupied by residents.  Questions?  Thank you.  I have a question.  Jake, what did you say the setback was for landscaping?  Along Henshaw, we're going to have the seven-foot planar strip, five-foot sidewalk,  and then two-foot setback before the fence is installed.  So two feet from the sidewalk to the fence?  Correct, with shrubs in there.  How many feet from the road to the fence?  Two, five, 14.  And I don't know if that includes curb...  Okay, go back to the two feet from the sidewalk to the fence?  Two feet from the back of the sidewalk to the fence.  Okay.  So the...  Where did I get the seven-foot number when I was sitting in the office?  That's the planar strip.  So it would be a row of trees or whatever the urban forest service requests there,  and that's seven-foot wide.  So that would be where?  Along the street or right next to the street right way or end of street,  end of back of curb.  It's weird that I'm confused, isn't it?  So two feet sidewalk, planar strip, road, between the road and the sidewalk.  Yeah.  So coming from the road, so you're having...  Thank you.  That's...  Your road is seven foot.  That's right.  Planar strip, two more feet.  Okay.  All right.  Mr. Winslow?  There's a bus stop out in front of the development, that's correct, on West East Avenue?  I believe so.  I don't know how far.  I think it's right in front.  I think it's like on the other side of the cul-de-sac.  There is a little pedestrian connection, you know, the cul-de-sac into there?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That was a good recommendation.  Yeah.  Staff recommended we incorporate it.  It'll be 12 feet wide.  Very good.  Have you considered any improvements to the bus stop?  No.  I think there was a comment from BCAG or somebody in there that suggested it's considered.  All right.  Further questions?  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  All right.  How many speakers?  We have 21.  21.  So clerk's suggestion on what we do in terms of time, because obviously we have 30 minutes  for public comment.  Should we just do a minute?  Because we cannot do a minute and a half, unfortunately.  Right.  It would either be a minute or two minutes.  It would be up to the council.  All right.  We saw them figure it out, that minute and a half thing.  No.  It's...  I don't...  I don't think I can do that.  All right.  Let's do two minutes and just, if you can, if your comments mimic someone else's comments,  comments. Certainly say my comments mimic someone else's comments. Thanks so much. Yield your time.  All right. So we'll do two minutes, please. Okay. Thank you. And if you could please go ahead,  when you hear your name, go ahead to the middle aisle. That would be great. And it would save  some time. Doris Schell, followed by Christine Graff.  I live probably, Chris and I live as close to this development as anybody. I have a young orchard.  I'm, well, it's supposed to be a 300-foot setback. I'm 142 feet.  And I do have some...  I have some concerns about this. The Planning Commission, as you know, denied this. Some of their reasons.  There's no park. The roads are too narrow. These are going to be a lot of houses, probably kids.  There's no safety in riding bikes. There's just nothing for kids to be able to do out there.  The roads are, Nord is, Hinshaw is 18 feet. Nord is 17 feet. Rodeo is 17 feet.  And they may improve the roads in front of this, but you still have unsafe roads out there.  So far as I'm concerned, you're putting the cart before the horse.  The park has been planned forever. It hasn't happened. That would have been nice if that was done.  The one acre parcels that we worked for many years ago have been abided by.  This is the only person that's come along and not followed the rules.  The houses that are being built out there are very nice.  I look at the rating for this construction company. There are two stars.  I hope they build halfway decent houses out there.  I do have concerns about that narrow cul-de-sac for fire trucks.  The thing is that they come out, they build the houses. You may approve it.  You go to your house. The builder goes to his house.  He leaves us with this mess that's going to be left out there.  I think that's too many houses.  You said that you can't get possibly 200 people together to make this better.  Well, let me tell you, I have a great acumen on the one acre parcels.  And it can't happen.  Has anybody ever talked to the Balmier area lady to even find out what we want?  I think that's important that we get our word out there.  I don't know that we're really against this.  We're against 74 houses. There's too many houses.  There's no development for this.  We have orchards, and they're going to be compromised because of this.  Thank you.  Christine Graff, followed by David Serenium.  Hi.  My concerns, well, they're not concerns, but they're something that I'd like to bring to your attention.  In this area right now, they're building on the corner of East Avenue, West East Avenue, Cusick.  They're putting low-income apartments in there.  I don't know how many, but quite a few.  And then on the Esplanade, kind of across from Farm Star Pizza, there's another 38 to 39 low-rent housing going in there.  And then on Highway 32, just after you go over the bridge.  Highway 32, there's a big piece of land in there that was just bought by Epic Homes.  And he's the one that built million-dollar homes further down on North Avenue, and they're not selling as fast as he thought they were.  So he bought that acreage over there to put in more low-income housing or townhouses or whatever.  So I'm feeling like our area, those are projects that are already in.  Yeah.  And I'm feeling that our area is, we have a lot of infill coming on right now.  Do we need to have this high density there when it's right in farming country?  I'm right across the street from it.  I'm farming.  I'm spraying.  I'm doing things that people are not going to like.  So it's not going to benefit me.  And I'm thinking the added traffic because of all of these.  I think the other projects that are going around us are really going to impact East Avenue more because it is a main artery.  That's all.  Thank you.  Thank you.  David Siriam, followed by Tammy Solano.  My name is David Siriani.  I live on North Avenue, and I've been there for 30 years.  I am actually overwhelmed by how many people are involved in this.  Thank you.  My position is when you talk about development, you talk about houses, square footage, how far from the road.  I can talk about neighborhoods and homes.  We don't talk about houses.  We talk about the homes we're living in all along North Avenue, Rodeo, Henshaw.  And we've been living there for years.  I've been there for 30 years.  Most other people have been there for more than that.  And we basically are again.  It's that whatever they're trying to do now, because it just seems like it's been contaminated already.  What we consider is a neighborhood.  It's not just a bunch of houses and square footage.  It's also people.  We've had families there.  We've had kids there.  We know how it works the way it is now.  And when I see how it's been, the trees have been ripped out, and it looks like it's already going to happen.  I'm just surprised.  I'm just thinking what a bad idea this is.  And I can't do anything to stop it.  But I just want to tell you there's a human quality to this.  And I'm part of that for living there for 30 years.  We've managed to work with the agricultural people that have had walnuts and almonds.  And that's changed.  We've gotten along with people.  We are neighbors.  We help each other.  We work for each other.  And I'm hoping that whenever this performance is going to happen, we're going to be able to do it.  And I'm sure that the proposal is we'll be defeating it.  I'm amazed at how many smart people there are in this room.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Tammy Solano followed by Jaycee Crew.  Thank you.  The general and special plan for this area was created after years of studies, input from experts, and the community.  It took into consideration the unique, unique needs of the community.  And the public's  qualities and challenges of this area should ignore the carefully crafted general plan and now to just approve the annexation and rezoning would be responsible.  And this was evidenced by the planning commission already rejecting this proposal.  There is a reason it is zoned as it already is.  The area cannot accommodate this level of new housing and traffic.  Plus you cannot consider this project in a bubble.  I would like to say that the public's decision to not use the zoning as the general plan would be the most appropriate decision.  As already spoken, there is an apartment complex going in on the corner.  There are housing developments down on Gwynn, Rodeo, and Nord.  If you add in all of that increased housing and traffic, plus this project alone will be adding over 150 cars.  The roads cannot handle this traffic.  The residents already there can't even get onto East Avenue.  Henshaw is busy.  If you try to turn left off of East Avenue, not only will you be able to get to East Avenue, but you will also be able to get to the  West Avenue.  There are more than, I would say on a small car, three cars cannot get stuck in that left turn lane before they are backed up and blocking a railroad crossing.  There is no way to fix that.  And yet we are trying to consider adding over 150 cars to our area.  This is like trying to force a square pig into a round hole.  It just doesn't work out there.  As we heard, there are other areas to make this happen.  I also believe that it is a fallacy that it is an all or nothing.  The developer has said that the development of the new housing complex is not going to be a good idea.  The developer bought this property knowing it was zoned for one acre housing.  If it is denied, there is still an option to build houses just at the density that it is created for.  Thank you.  Thank you.  JC Crew followed by Carl Hinker.  Good evening, Mayor and Council.  I stand here this evening in opposition of this project.  This is a rural area on the outskirts of our city.  That will be forever changed if this development is approved.  The applicant's request for variances of the general plan and the Bellmere Special Planning Area should be included that this project is being proposed in the wrong location.  This area is not conducive to these 70 plus houses coming in.  If any of you have come out there and visited the area, and I appreciate the Mayor's comments, who used to live in the area about the traffic, you will see that this subdivision does not fit.  While the adjacent residences are in the county, has anybody taken into account the effect on them?  I realize they are not city residents, they are not your constituents, but what is going to happen to those people and the quality of life and their property and their agriculture out there?  The development is not set up for success.  The roadways are essentially dilapidated country lanes.  On the way here tonight, we are dodging puddles, potholes, either about a lane and a half wide.  They are not streets that are going to be built.  They are not streets that are equipped for all this added traffic.  As part of the Bell SPA, there is wording in there talking about upgrading infrastructure like streets.  That is not going to happen with this project.  We are going to do a half street.  We are going to improve only half of it.  That is not going to make that much of a difference at the end of the day.  The other concern during this approval process was the Planning Commission.  There were two recent meetings where this development was discussed.  The second being where the public was effectively silenced when some commissioners were not present.  The third was when the commissioners were hellbent on their way to recreate history.  The ability and the right of the public to participate in public meetings is paramount to ensuring that all voices are heard, not just those of you that are on the dais.  I urge you to take a look at that process in the Planning Commission and see if changes need to be made.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Carl Hinker followed by Carrie Tetreault.  Thank you for hearing this tonight.  I am a member of the Public Health Commission.  My name is Gregory Treait. There's been a lot of crying for buildup not out. This is the perfect opportunity for us to do that in-field project that Chico's crying for. Affordable housing is almost non-existent in Chico.  My name is Gregory Treait.  My name is Gregory Treait. Affordable housing is almost non-existent in Chico. And this property is consistent with the neighborhood. There's commercial property, apartment complexes, and small lots right in the immediate area where this property is located.  he is located. The average home price in Chico in January was $483,000. There's currently 40 houses,  42 houses on the market in Chico that are less than $500,000. The size of these lots and the  potential for the size of houses that are going in on this property will be 70 houses less than  $500,000. So that significantly increases our lower end housing supply that is desperately needed in Chico.  You know, there's just, it seems like all the opposition that to any subdivision in Chico  boils down to, I don't want them to my neighborhood. I would, I like it. I'm not in  immediate area of that neighborhood, but when I moved to Chico, I lived in the county.  I live on a street that's very unsafe for kids to drive, ride their bicycles. There's no sidewalks.  And I'm in the city of Chico and it was annexed into the city of Chico from the county with no  planning whatsoever as to how that property would be developed. There's a couple of infill projects  around me that put in some sidewalks and eventually we'll have to all cough up the money it's going to  take to  complete the sidewalks.  Thank you. Carrie Tetro followed by Holly Hack.  Hi everybody, I'm Carrie. A lot of what I wanted to say statistically, Carl just hit on about our  lack of affordability and availability of housing in Chico. One thing that I find surprising is how  many are over a half a million dollars. One thing that Chuck does do is he builds houses that are  under a half a million dollars. And I personally strongly believe that our housing is going to be  under a half a million dollars. This is part of the reason we've built houses. This part of the reason  we've built houses. This part of the reason we've built houses. This part of the reason we've built  houses. This part of the reason we've built houses. This part of the reason we've built houses. This part  of the reason we've built houses. This part of the reason we've built houses. This part of the reason  and within just six days, he received an overwhelming response,  eight offers to be precise.  Because there was only one house in that neighborhood,  eight qualified buyers, there was a bidding war.  The buyer bid the home up from $625 to a staggering $680.  Here's the kicker.  There was only one house available, but eight eager buyers.  The scarcity of homes on the market are driving prices sky high.  If there were eight homes and eight buyers,  there would be no need for a bidding war and, therefore, a lower price.  He goes over some housing stats on the MLS with Carl Hiddon,  but basically we need more houses.  By increasing supply, we can bring stability to the market  and curb those skyrocketing prices.  Otherwise, we will end up like San Francisco,  where even the most dilapidated old home will sell for over a million dollars.  We can't let that be us.  Please allow developers to take risks and build much-needed housing  for a community that desperately needs it.  Thank you for your time.  Thank you.  Holly Hack, followed by Stephen Kuzmowski.  Hello.  My name is Holly.  I'm a real estate agent representing both buyers and sellers  in the Chico and surrounding areas.  I stand before you today to advocate for a cause that's not only market critical,  but also urgent for our beloved city of Chico,  the support for our housing development known as Orchard Creek Estates.  As many of you are well aware, our community is and has been  for many years facing a dire housing crisis,  one that demands immediate action.  Currently, as others have spoken of stats,  currently, as of this morning,  there was 108 homes on the market in Chico.  Of those homes, only 27 of those homes are single-family homes below 460,000  and expected to accommodate our growing population of over 103 residents.  Chico is a vibrant city known for beauty, its community spirit, and its welcoming atmosphere.  However, this very appeal has led to a steady influx of new residents over the years,  putting immense pressure on our housing market,  not to mention our neighbors in Paradise,  many that are still looking for housing due to the tremendous loss of Paradise Residence,  and the  residential structure.  The results?  Skyrocketing rents, dwindling availability, and growing population of individuals, families  struggling to find affordable housing.  But today, we have an opportunity to make a difference.  The proposed Orchard Creek Estates housing development offers a viable solution to our  housing challenges.  By adding this much-needed neighborhood to our community, we not only preserve the character  and charm of our neighborhoods, but also create more affordable options.  Thank you.  For our residents, Orchard Creek Estates housing fosters a sense of a community.  It promotes a healthy lifestyle, being close proximity to multiple services, encourages  social interaction among the neighborhood with its well-planned parcel map, and enhances  overall well-being of a multitude of homebuyers in the market, many looking for their first  home to settle down groups.  Moreover, supporting this development aligns with our city's long-term goals of sustainable  growth and equitable housing.  Thank you.  Thank you, Stephen.  Because now, we have a question from the audience.  I will pass the question to Tim Henske, followed by Tim Thompson.  The Chico Planning Commission has repeatedly lamented the random haphazard developments  that have resulted in disconnected communities, duplicative infrastructure, and general lack  of foresight in recent housing developments across the Chico.  To piecemeal the Bellmere Special Planning Area to individual one-off developments furthers  this narrative.  One has to ask, how do we address the need to expand the housing space in the area?  Two, what is the purpose of an unplanned special planning area?  What we know we need is more affordable, proximate housing in Chico, housing where people have  multi-modal access to shopping, retail, schools, entertainment.  The Bellmere SPA has much of the world, and due to the general time goals, will provide  ample opportunities to meet its low density, high price point growth goals.  Those goals are not limited to the general planning area, but they are also limited to  the community.  The East Street frontage of the Bellmere SPA is the best-seeded land in the entirety of  the BMSPA for this purpose.  Proximate access to bus lines, bikeways, reasonably closed retail, and the new commuter  rail service require a new look at the best use of this proposed Orchard Creek subdivision.  Thank you.  Instead of filling this prime parcel with spacious, mid- to high-income homes, much  larger lots proposed than immediately adjacent across East Avenue, which those homes are  currently valued on Zillow at between $350 to $450.  These are much bigger lots, much bigger homes, which will have a much higher price point.  I highly encourage revisiting the Orchard Creek subdivision.  This part of the part part part part part part part part part part part part part part  part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part  part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part  part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part  part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part  and the Orchard Creek Estates presentation  to the Planning Commission.  And as a resident, it's really been an eye opening process  to me because I've seen the lack of planning  that the planning staff requires to put in a community.  There's been no real traffic study.  There's been no real study on the infrastructure  as far as water consumption, the waste lifting situation.  And it's just really, it seems like we're going about this  reactively instead of proactively.  And it would be appreciated, I think,  by the residents of the neighborhood.  I've been there for 15 years at Eagle Heights,  which is a subdivision that backs  the proposed development.  I'm not against development.  I'm just against the density.  I think going to RS 20, where you're doing more  like two units per acre, especially on ground  that's so agriculturally viable to have a small orchard,  to have a garden and contribute to the community's  farmers markets still, it's just a lot better way to go.  The safety that's not being looked at with the denial  or the  not looking at the traffic study is,  you know, let's do things the right way.  Let's not just piecemeal things.  Let's not just do hodgepodge,  but let's really put in the time to do the studies  to make sure that what's going in place  is going to be successful instead of something  that's going to put our residents at risk.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Kevin Gallant, followed by Steven James.  Hello.  I'm Kevin Gallant,  I'm sure everybody's put a lot of effort.  It sounds like I'm from Sacramento, by the way.  Born and raised in Chico.  I've seen a lot of projects in my lifetime start.  There's a lot of money that's involved with it  and everybody starts rolling real estate agents  and everybody looking at that profit.  Your developments look like they're three to five years out  in my opinion.  Developments aren't really good enough.  I think it's a good investment.  So the five acres that I own on Hinshaw has almonds on it.  It has had almonds on it for 70 years, is in my family.  It's a small, and as you know, if you're familiar  with orchards and almonds in the crops,  sometimes the market's down, sometimes it's up.  It's been down for a couple of years now.  The development, and I heard a lady talk about her orchard.  She had a young orchard.  She said, there's spraying involved.  There's dust involved.  There's water involved.  There's tractors and things like that.  I'd like to, if someone could help me find the blueprint  so I can actually see where the plant is  or an area I can go.  My five acres I do with leaves right next to where  Epic Homes wants to build.  I've been in contact with them already.  My fear is if I don't sell or amnesty,  and if people, once they live there,  if they're four or five years out,  the spraying, the smell, the lawsuits  that come towards me, I want to know  if the city council would be on my side when that happens.  So we've all seen the urban sprawl,  and we've all seen the encroachment on properties.  So I just wanted to see if I could get a map to see exactly  where this is.  And that's Project Skinny.  That's time.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Stephen James, followed by Tim Cooper.  I don't know if there's a James in the house,  but I'm a Jones.  Steve Jones.  I lived adjacent to the proposed development for 25 years.  I attended the Planning Commission meeting.  I thought they gave it a thorough looking.  And I support their five-year book.  And I would hope you would too,  to deny the development moving ahead.  I always had good luck communicating with city workers,  treating people, repeating people.  Always had good results from the city.  But for some reason, this process,  I've written two letters to the city staff,  whoever it went to in planning.  And I've never received a response back  to either of my letters.  My wife did talk to one of the people in planning  because our computers couldn't communicate  on the second letter.  And they got that worked out.  But this whole process, there just doesn't seem  to be enough dialogue going back and forth  between the property owners out in the area.  I agree with a lot of the other concerns about traffic,  street problems, no lights.  The area is a lot of work.  It could come in a community corridor  through that whole area.  And you gotta really watch what you're doing  when you're driving out there.  People run stops constantly.  And I think there needs to be more discussion  with the people that are gonna have to live  with this development.  Thank you.  Thank you, Tim Cooper, followed by Josh Shelton.  Hi, my name is Tim Cooper.  I'm currently a branch manager in California, California.  I live in Chico.  I've been managing this place for 24 years.  I've been managing this place for 24 years  and have the pleasure of putting several thousands  of homeowners into homes here in our community.  Over the last several years, we've seen a significant surge  in home prices while local median income has not kept pace.  A large part of the home increases are attributed  to huge demand from buyers formerly getting 2% and 3% interest rates.  However, the new dilemma today is home buyers facing major supply  and demand issues due to lack of inventory resulting  in multiple offer situations and getting priced out  to people who may not be able to afford their home.  to the highest bidder.  This project is proposing 74 units  at a 450,000 price point or lower,  which is exactly what our local real estate industry needs  to strike a balance for homeowners  seeking affordable housing.  These units would meet the needs for entry level,  first time home buyers, move up buyers  and downsizing buyer population.  As mentioned, Chico has a housing shortage  and restoring the balances of the inventory  must come from new construction,  creativity from the city council and planning commissions.  For example, traditionally when one sells a home,  they are temporarily adding inventory,  but typically they are purchasing home as well,  creating a net neutral impact to the inventory.  Per local MLS, there are currently 123 houses on the home  on the multiple listing service.  This additional 74 proposed units  would add a 60% increase to our existing inventory.  Of the 123,000, of the 123,000,  homes available 41%, 41 units are under 450,000.  These 74 units will land at a price point  we desperately need in our Chico area.  Oftentimes affordable housing is seen as low income,  but most of these buyers would be 90,000  or $100,000 candidates, so it wouldn't be like low income  drains on your particular community.  So, thank you.  Thank you.  Josh Shelton, followed by David Miller.  Yeah, so I'm coming here today as a resident of Muir Avenue.  I've been there for four years now.  I love it.  I do have great respect for the passion  and the perspective of everybody here.  My son rides his bike three to four times a week  to the tower mark right from Muir down road,  and he's not gonna stop doing that.  I support this project from a contractor's perspective also,  no skin in the game, but I do think we need it bad out there.  And East Avenue is East Avenue.  I get those concerns.  I avoid it like the plague as it is right now.  There's a lot of filtrations, Bell, Cusick.  I hit Muir 32.  I choose Eaton on Raptor the freeway often.  And I will look forward to, even if it's a small piece,  the road improvements, because yeah, those roads,  they're county roads, they're narrow.  But I mean, I'm not gonna be in favor of that.  I'm gonna be in favor of my son.  Hopefully he makes community friends  if the development moves forward out there.  So in short, I do think we need it,  economic perspective, constructive perspective.  And I think where it's positioned,  everything's gonna have its inconveniences.  Everyone's gonna have their fears.  Like I said, I do respect,  this is a stone's throw from my front yard.  And I get everyone's perspective,  but I do feel like that this project,  there's a lot of benefits that to be looked at  too.  So I would be like to voice my support  for the passing of it.  Thank you.  Thank you.  David Miller, followed by Robin McCollum.  Yeah, hi.  Got a few notes here.  Anyway, you know, when you're driving around town,  you see these signs that says city limits.  I think that's really what it's all about,  city limits, because I live in a county,  I probably shouldn't even be here.  But since you're trying to incorporate that,  it's about city limits to me, you know?  And that's one of the things I've come up with.  So, and then additionally, like,  you know all these people coming from Oroville, Paradise,  and Chico going all the way through East Avenue,  West East Avenue to go to 32,  to go to Oroville and I-5 and all that stuff.  Well, they never did put the Eaton Road,  we're gonna punch Eaton Road through to Meridian Road.  They never did that.  So that's what it's all about.  You got all this traffic.  And you got the apartments down in Koosik going in.  You got this thing over here.  You got million dollar homes on the north end of North Avenue  that are going in, they're already going in.  So all of this stuff, and you got railroad tracks  and tanker trucks are gonna back up on this.  They have to stop, and buses have to stop there.  There's a real quagmire right there.  And that was another note.  And then, what was the other one?  Yeah, that, and then,  yeah, that, basically, I think there's one more point.  Yeah, just delays at the tracks, the turn lanes, all of that.  And, you know, affordable, I don't see where all this is affordable housing.  I don't even see it.  And the more housing you offer and the more people come,  if that place over there doesn't have housing,  less people will come for housing.  There'll be less people coming for that.  In my opinion.  It may sound funny, but some people will.  That's how I feel.  Thank you.  Robin McCollum, followed by Ben Reed.  Good evening, councillors and staff.  I'm here to talk about something that's incidental to the project as a whole,  and that is the removal of the heritage trees on the corner of North and Henshaw.  We don't want that to happen again.  So when we have a project being reviewed,  it needs to be clear to the developer that it's not supposed to be removing resources  before the plan is complete,  before they, in the case of trees, the urban forester has a chance to,  you know, make his recommendations to the planning staff and so forth.  And the microphone's in the podium, so you have to,  it's not that microphone, it's actually built in.  So if you turn around and talk to them, we will not hear you.  I'm sorry, but.  Neither will the folks at home.  So just the note.  So I think that point's clear enough.  And we want the, when we're cooperating with the county,  when they're the second agency,  let's hope that they have in mind city standards and, you know,  looking forward that they'll put a lot of effort into it.  And I think that's a little effort they did.  The encroachment permit, the tree removal permit that was granted by the county  evidently had no ground truthing.  No one visited the site, in which case they might have recognized, should have.  I'm amazed that their tree foreman did not recognize the value of those trees.  Make some comment, maybe kick it back to his superiors and then to our planning staff.  So we need to have,  we need to have,  the developer needs to know ahead that it's going to be held to those standards.  And then we need to give more consideration to the value of these heritage trees.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Ben Reed, followed by Austin Barron.  I was in high school in early 1980 when my dad brought me to the first meeting on the Bell near area at the Grange Hall.  It was similarly well attended, similarly spirited.  The county staff and the city both came together.  They both had presentations.  It leaked later that someone on the county staff labeled the Bell near area as the minefield.  Because it is.  Because of that, what came out of that meeting,  and that contentious, that spirited meeting,  was that Bell near needs to be handled as a unique piece.  It has been handled as a unique piece for over 40 years.  People have reasonable expectation to have it continue to be handled as a unique piece.  And all of its unique issues handled as a whole.  My grandfather was a dairy farmer in Minnesota.  And he told me you can't ride two horses at the same time.  You can't have a general plan that you use as a justification for some developments,  and then have a general plan that you violate because it's convenient for you for other developments.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Austin Barron, followed by Bill Hack.  Good afternoon.  I'm Austin Barron, local real estate broker, former architecture review board member.  I think it's pretty clear we need home ownership housing in our city.  According to recent state numbers, we are short 3.5 million owned housing units across the state.  Having over 70 affordable housing units would definitely help.  Maybe not as much as Valley's Edge,  but it's another step towards a stable market.  Traffic concerns I understand, but my best example would be Amber Grove,  which has three exits onto a street without stop lights,  and they don't have any glaring issues.  The failure of the Bellmere SBA is evident.  The county beat us to development out there.  And hopefully this will be the first step towards dismantling that SBA and annexing the area.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Bill Hack, followed by Dan Hill.  Thank you all very much.  And again, thank you for being here tonight to support the citizens of Chico.  I'm here.  I own a residential property within 500 feet of this project.  I actually support this project as it is.  I would actually support higher density housing because I know there's a need for lower income housing.  Chico used to be a community where we had a lot of housing.  We would entice all these people to come to Chico State.  They'd have these great ideas and love Chico and want to stay.  And they would start their families here.  That's just not happening these days because there isn't the affordable housing that there used to be.  There's not the allure that used to have in Chico.  And there's a lot of economic reasons why that occurs, but it is the fact.  I understand the not wanting to change, the liking the status quo,  but that's not something that usually happens, especially in this situation.  We can either keep going forward as we are,  where the county is going up and allowing the one acre units, one acre houses, million dollar houses,  and we're not touching our low income needs, our lower income needs, our moderate income needs.  Or we can do what we've done in the past and plan.  And our esteemed planners do a fantastic job with the City of Chico.  I like seeing projects that are built to our standards, not to the county standards.  I think it's imperative to have improved roads in the area.  Granted, it's not going to be on both sides,  but it is a step in the right direction.  And as we look at it, I've heard people say that the density is just too much for this area.  And as I look at the map that was provided in there,  it looks essentially the same as the ones that are due west,  and actually less dense as the ones that are directly south of Telford.  Now, I understand as you go further north and west, we're going to a more rural area,  but this is contiguous to these partials and it's the exact same density.  Thank you for your time.  Thank you.  Dan Hill, followed by Bill Monroe.  My name is Dan Hill.  I'm the president of the Chico Masonic Family Center Board of Directors.  And when we first saw this project come up, we were really concerned  because we didn't want to run into the airport effect where an airport is built,  been there for 50 years, housing developments come in and move in closed,  people object to the noise,  and the airport has to close.  And the airport has to move.  Well, the Masonic Center has been there since 1994.  Anyway, our concern is with noise, noise from the tenants coming into our activities  and vice versa going to them.  And so we have asked and been in negotiations, if you want to say that,  or talks with the developer and with the city on the type of wall that would go in there.  The developer wants to put in a wooden wall.  Well, that wouldn't be satisfactory,  because it would be easy to put gates into,  come back and forth into our property,  and be unwarranted trespass.  Whereas if we had a solid wall and we asked for a block wall,  that wouldn't happen because people couldn't cut holes in it, whatever.  But we came to a compromise on that,  and we're looking at a stucco wall that would be the entire 1,000 feet of the property.  We have lots on two sides of us, north side and the west side.  And so with that number of blocks we're concerned,  we have been concerned about a problem with noise from us and from them.  Anyway, if that can be mitigated,  and I've included it in a letter here that I submitted to the City Council,  I think we'll be fine.  The center itself, if the guidelines come through with that,  will have no problem with the development,  that development or another one,  depending on what happens with the City Council here tonight.  So that's what we have to say.  We're in favor of the wall.  We're in favor of a development.  But we do need to have a wall there that protects us.  And we also need to be sure that we're still there 50 years from now.  And that was the concerns of the Masonic Center.  Thank you.  Thank you.  And our last speaker is Bill Monroe.  Hello, Council.  Thank you.  And thank you to the Masonic Center.  You are an early voter assistance center opening on the 24th.  I'm sorry.  I could list a bunch of things that we do,  but one of the things is you are a voting center.  Yes.  Yes.  They are great.  And I actually volunteered out there for voting.  Also, I don't have a whole lot of stuff in this debate and whatnot.  But one thing is that I really don't like almond orchards or walnut orchards.  The other big development that's going to be voted on soon came out with a big mailer  with a picture of almond orchards. with a picture of almond orchards in bloom. These are under threat. So what? If each almond takes a gallon and a half to produce  And there we have almond orchards.  And there we have almond orchards. and all that is exported to China, sending our water to China, we need less orchards, more crops appropriate to our area. And as I recall from volunteering at Masonic Hall and other events out at the Grange,  that's all, this property is currently all orchards or old orchards.  And in the life cycle of an orchard, they will routinely remove all the trees and plant new trees.  So the removal of those trees is not that big of a deal.  Heritage trees are a different story, and I'm in total agreement with the gentleman who spoke to that issue.  I assume that those would be valley oaks he was referring to.  And so some looking out has to take place that trees of significance need to be saved in this thing.  But I'm in support of this development.  It's a kind of development that we need more of an infill in Chico rather than spreading out over the lava cap.  Thank you.  Thank you.  And he's our last speaker.  All right.  Thank you, everybody.  We appreciate your time.  Appreciate you being here and your concern as well.  And appreciate everybody doing that smoothly.  So I will offer the applicant three minutes, which they can refuse if they so choose.  No.  Okay.  Wow.  Look in there.  All right.  So with that, we will close the hearing to the public and then entertain discussion motion and a vote by council.  So council members, as you see fit.  Anyone accept it?  No, just kidding.  Addison, go ahead.  Yeah.  I do have a little some comments and I'll end with that motion.  And I think it might be in a way I could upset the maximum number of people in the room, but I think for good reason.  So that the concept of the Bellmere special planning area is failing is something that we should have realized and taken action on a long time ago.  It's been 13 years since the general plan was adopted about and we're no closer to master planning that area.  It's clear to me that the sort of development we anticipated in that special planning area is roughly.  What we see here.  But I'm concerned that it may foreclose the possibility we ever have comprehensive planning out there and we may never be able to sustainably extend city services to housing and the rest of the special planning area.  Nor plan or pay for parks, nor develop an intentional community design.  If comprehensive planning among the property owners is impossible, then this is about the best we're going to get and we should definitely approve the project.  But at this moment right now, I think we as policymakers would do better justice to the intention and planning of this area.  If we table approval.  The project and held a discussion invited a final attempt to spur master planning or decide to abolish the special planning area as a whole.  I'll add that at the moment we find out that those talks are going nowhere like we found in the past that I would say we pick back up approval.  And if this proposal were to come back to me with more housing near to that bus stop, as I would say to anybody anywhere, you have my sympathy and my blessing.  I think that maybe saying that is the is the best kind of leadership that we could provide.  To spur a productive conversation on how to build sustainable in the bell mirror area.  And closer to what the desire of the current residents are.  We don't have unlimited land right behind bus stops.  We can't keep putting down streets into lands that won't pay for themselves.  We're asked to amend the general plan.  And that means this whole project does not have to be entirely low density residential.  So emotionally.  I would like to propose this.  That we.  So we table approval.  This project.  Direct staff.  To engage with property owners.  About master planning.  planning and that the council agendize our own discussion on the future of the belmere special  planning area all right we have a motion do we have a second all right motion fails for lack of  a second i do need to mention that i received a note from the fire chief and we'll let him  make this at this time i should have done this immediately following the discussion go ahead  chief thank you mayor i want to take a minute or a moment to make a correction to my earlier  statement as i was uh received confirmation that one of my prevention staff had evaluated the um  the plan in consultation with operation staff to determine it met all the code requirements  and i trust my staff's expertise and assessment in this manner so my apologies for the confusion  thank you  all right thank you for that uh further discussion additional motions  mr mayor  so the idea of so there are 100 to 200 property owners in the belmere special planning area so  the idea that we're ever going to have any sort of planned development for the area is  is never going to happen uh and to me this whole thing is very simple  we either  you know  this property has high density similar density properties on the east side and on the south side  so it so build adding this extra 20 acres and 70 houses does not in any way change the  the character of the surrounding area i go up and down east avenue at least twice a day and  drive right by the project so we either lose the opportunity to build out 70 houses or we either  we either lose the opportunity to build out 70 houses or we either  we end up with more one acre one million dollar houses and maybe by the time you have you put in streets you get 14 or 15 of them so uh you know this is in fill it's affordable uh i think it's uh it's obvious that we should approve the uh the changes  necessary amendments to the general plan and uh i'd like to make a motion to that effect  all right  all right  all right  Do we have a second?  I'm not necessarily opposed to the motion, but I have a couple questions for staff.  Okay.  All right.  Well, do we have a second?  I'm sorry, do you have a question?  You guys have been throwing out motions pretty fast.  Yeah.  I didn't get a chance to ask staff any questions, so I appreciate the expediency, but...  Yeah.  The discussion side.  More me than anyone.  So, all right.  So, motion.  Votes for lack of a second.  Okay.  Mr. Morgan.  So, my question for staff would be, assuming this moves ahead, what can we do to that SBA  for the future to maintain the rural nature of that area?  I'm not super excited about the density, except that I look and see that if it's annexed,  they can go up to seven.  I talked to the applicant about lowering it down closer to what the average is.  It doesn't change the project.  It doesn't change the project very much.  If he threw 10 houses out, it still wouldn't look the same way for the most part.  But if we start in the area that the applicant's talking about and we start moving, what do  we do to require maybe a quarter acre density, the light at Gwen, the landscape buffer, so  we're not...  A number of the speakers talked about piecemealing this all together.  I think Council Member Overbeck makes a really good point, and I appreciate that you drive  by every day.  But I've lived in District 1 since I was five.  I grew up on the corner of Cusick and East Avenue.  So rode my bike around there, delivered the enterprise record there.  That's why they endorse me all the time, by the way.  Something's going to go there.  This is as good a plan as any.  I am less concerned with this applicant and what he wants to do there and more concerned  with how do we make sure we maintain the ruralness and don't create this urban downtown area.  I know it's not going to happen.  But...  Stop it.  Do you poll the SPA?  I guess this is a question for Brendan.  What do we do about further mitigation if we approve this?  So I think maintaining the character of the area will happen just given the ownership.  You know this to some is a drastic change in the existing condition.  But if you get past the notion that this subdivision comes online, it's not like... there may be  some me-to's.  But I don't think we're going to see the entire Bellmere area just build up with two to seven units per acre for some of the reasons that were shared tonight.  And there are going to be owners that want to retain their five acres, their two acres, their one acre.  So I don't think this is going to just tip and open the floodgate to answer that question.  I appreciate your answer, except that other developers are already looking at those properties.  And whether they own them or not, they control them.  I was going to say there will be others that will want to come in and do something similar.  And again, the question is, do we want them to go through the same involved process of having themselves to amend the general plan and do the rezone?  Or do we remove this SPA designation?  We shared some information about this special planning area is nothing like any of the other special planning areas.  It's not a greenfield.  There's not single ownership.  It doesn't have the mix of uses.  It doesn't have all the other promises.  It's not the same as the other plans.  It's not the same as the other plans.  It's not the same as the other plans.  But again, it was also a complicated area in that somebody had mentioned that meeting back in the 1990s.  I've heard about it a little bit different.  It wasn't just about minefields.  It was planners were sent out with pitchforks and torches.  So it is an interesting area with a long history.  And during the general plan update process, there wasn't a lot of interest by individuals who own property out there.  To see.  If there weren't a lot of interest there. The fact that people are building out in the county is inconsistent with that thought. So as we suggested, we could come back and have a little bit better discussion with more information, but you did have some good figures, some good maps, and we already seen what has transpired as Council Member Winslow said, we've kind of watched it happening piecemeal, but when you look at it in totality,  there's maybe some opportunities lost for the density but then you have a  roomful of people that aren't really looking for density either so I don't  have a perfect answer removing the SPA would allow people to at least extend  developers to work with people who are willing sellers and develop within our  zoning and maybe council would decide if we looked at it a little bit more  closely that we could feather the zoning out towards Bell and Muir maybe it  doesn't have to be all our one maybe um half acre or quarter acre is more  appropriate so that's been that and that is my question how do we protect that in  the future so so we don't do this and then the next person says okay I'm doing  seven or six or five and maybe that's out of the purview of this discussion  but but as we heard we just didn't articulate as well again as we heard  from a lot of the  speakers that they're concerned not only about what's happening here and right  against East Avenue it's hard to argue it doesn't fit but as we get closer and  closer to Bell we get some closer to a number of houses that are in one acre  lots how do we I hate to use this word how do we keep it from becoming sprawl  certainly nobody wants the apartment complex that is at East Avenue in Cusick  know the people there now don't want it but we don't want that back there so how  do we protect that we all are you are you saying  just the discussion protects against that but I think the people in the  audience would say no it doesn't there's disagreement I would suggest  that part one probably is appropriate all the way to bellemere has a urban  plan who wants to make the best use of the land that we have available to us  knowing the difficulty there's going through another general plan update  process comprehensive when you start talking about green lines and going up  the foothills and going north and south so the best highest use of land and  And again, there might be people in this room that think that means multifamily, but I think R1 is the appropriate density in this area.  But I'm the community development director, your council.  We have a general plan that right now envisions R1.  It's building out at significantly lower densities than that right now.  This proposal, on its own merits, is adjacent to the city, has densities near it that are consistent with what they're proposing.  And I can hear the desire for us to come back and dig into this a little bit more to maybe discuss some of those nuances.  So final question, and this is between you and the skipper.  So if there's a desire to discuss those nuances moving forward after tonight for the future, is that a council member request to review that SBA again?  Do we completely separate that from what we're doing now?  Is that a second?  I second.  I see it as two separate items.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Thank you.  So we can't make that motion under this item, correct?  I think you could.  I mean, that's kind of in the spirit of what you're considering.  You're definitely considering how the general plan relates to this particular product or this particular project.  And also to your point about density moving further into Bellmere, we saw the map of the areas that have already developed at one acres.  And I...  It's hard to imagine how it's going to pencil for somebody to drag urban utilities past those.  So I think it becomes pretty self-limiting.  Yeah.  Mr. Lamb, would you concur?  Yeah, I agree.  Or you can roll it out into the motion that the council considers.  So we could do that tonight as well as a single or a secondary motion?  Okay.  All right.  Thank you.  I just want to hit the...  I heard my colleague had a comment about...  That's what I just tried.  I said, but the difference is we're not sending staff out to go talk to 100 owners to try to do something.  We're asking staff to come back with something because sending them out to talk to 100 owners to try to come up with a plan when we know we can't get 100 people to agree on the color blue.  My big concerns on this moving forward as Mr. Gallant, I think he left, was the smell and the spraying and the wall.  And I promise you even that wall will not stop the sound from going over.  So the last thing I want is another graduate because we were promised, you know, when the apartments went in next to the graduate, everything was going to be fine there.  And guess what's gone and guess what's not.  So that was a major concern to me being a person who uses the Masonic Hall and has been there since I was a little girl.  That was very important to me.  So I'm glad that we're taking care of that.  It's hard being up here when a conversation started in 1980 and we're being asked as policymakers, you know, 30 plus.  40, gosh, I'm aging myself, 40 years later to go off of and understand the conversations that happened back then.  And your grandfather was a lot nicer than mine.  My grandfather actually said, you said, have two horses and one not horse to ride your horses on.  So I completely agree with what you're saying.  And it is a landmine and it is a very difficult one.  But what I don't think that we need right there is 15 more septic tanks.  And 15 more wells.  And that's just not what was envisioned for that area.  We have a sphere.  Where the sphere stops, I don't know.  Where it begins, I'm going to go based upon the people that went before us.  So if I was going to make it with motion, it would be something to the effect of approve what we have here with the condition that we have the staff bring back something for us in the future to review this SPA.  And ensure the future growth of that area.  That it be.  Contiguous.  I don't know what word you want to use.  But orderly.  In an orderly fashion.  That would be mine.  Is that a motion?  Yeah.  If Vice Mayor Reynolds and Council Member Van Overbeck could put their two motions into one.  Well, I think.  I would support it.  I think the Vice Mayor added the element of, and I agree with that, that you want to make the SPA go away.  Is that what you're saying?  No, to bring it back for discussion.  I second her motion.  Did you make a motion?  I second it.  Can I just confirm that it's subject to the revised conditions you received tonight that included the Masonic Hall wall and things like that?  Yes.  Okay.  Thank you.  And did you understand and get the setbacks on the fence?  Did we figure that out?  Are we good?  Yes.  We're not going to have LA?  At the end of the day, I had to set back from the sidewalk, not to set back from the road.  And that was my misunderstanding.  I had a misunderstanding of Mr. Morley.  And he.  Thank you.  Two clarifications.  It's not blue.  It's purple.  And you didn't get the endorsement from the enterprise record because you delivered the paper.  I'm pretty sure.  All right.  You mean they like me?  I don't know.  Maybe.  All right.  Do we have further discussion before we.  Mr. Bennett.  I would just like to.  I'm going to ask Mr. Sully for any comments or corrections with what I'm about to say.  But I would like to make a friendly motion to the motion on the floor.  Thank you.  I would like to see as a way of working with the neighbors, those that are concerned about the development directly across the street,  that the stucco wall that is being built around the Masonic Hall be extended down north on East Avenue from the Masonic Hall property.  Around the corner down to the first new street in the subdivision.  Make it a solid wall to perhaps ease the frustration by the neighbors who are across the street.  And then the second concern is the illumination from the lights in this new subdivision.  And I would like to make those, I believe, 15 feet maximum, if that's correct.  And I would like to make those, I believe, 15 feet maximum, if that's correct.  Come on up, Mr. Sully.  Of the types that are on, actually on Manzanita, which are down lights, these folks have had a very dark night sky for many, many years.  I would like to, in the greatest extent possible and in a reasonable manner, keep that lighting level low and not be offensive to those that live.  And I would like to, in the greatest extent possible and in a reasonable manner, keep that lighting level low and not be offensive to those that live.  And I think the lighting makes a huge difference.  A new subdivision with normal street lights at 30 feet is a real imposition, a huge imposition.  So I'd like to try and mitigate that.  So those are my two requests.  So just to clarify, the city has three standard heights for street lights, 30 feet, 24 feet, 18 feet.  18 feet. Thank you.  And which one would exactly get used where in the subdivision?  I defer to Public Works on the actual execution of that.  I'm looking at a maximum of 18 feet with a very well-designed down light from that pole, similar to what's on Manzanita.  So depending on the location, it could be different heights.  So typically that occurs at the improvement plan.  Once approvals are made at the planning level, then subdivision improvement plans are prepared and submitted.  So we evaluate that.  There's also wattage requirements that can.  Determine how much light is coming out.  And so, yeah, we definitely evaluate that through photometrics at that application phase.  Can I make a suggestion?  I don't think we want to be in the.  Mr.  Hold on.  I'm not even sure we can do that.  Exactly.  Can we add conditions to the property as we move forward in an individual motion?  You can.  You can add conditions provided there's a nexus.  To the effect you're trying to address.  All right.  So can I?  Yeah, go ahead.  Okay.  I don't think we're in the business of designing specific types of types or placement of walls or lighting.  I get your concern.  But I guess I think the relationship we have with the staff and the staff as with the developer,  I think we make our wishes known to the staff that that will manifest itself and what happens in the development without complicating.  We'll see what happens with the motion.  All right.  So it sounds like Mr.  Bennett that we have disagreement on terms of your friendly amendment being accepted by both the person who well, at least the person who's seconded the motion.  Is that correct?  Mr.  Van over back.  That's correct.  All right.  So friendly amendment not so accepted.  Unfortunately, I would just add that I absolutely agree with your two assessments.  My only concern is, is a.  we're not planners and I don't know how high lights should be and  B having been a homeowner for years and years and having to replace my fence many times  as expensive as I can't even imagine trying to replace a brick wall or a  stucco wall by  several different owners at different times in different places and I don't think that  And then you would have to get into an HOA that would take care of all that  I don't even know how that would work  So I think we would be opening up Pandora's box if we started putting walls  as back pieces of walls. That's my initial but again, I'm not a  developer or land person so I would leave that to staff  All right, so original motion second stands. Madam Clerk  Further comment? Just a little thing that it's been a little while now  But council member Van Overbeck and originally making the motion to approve the project  said it but I agree with practically all of it and I also agree with the assessment that it's very unlikely that  all these property owners can get together and do a comprehensive plan in the way that was hoped for in the general  plan  But I do think that that suggests that what we're taking the action we're taking this motion is in effect abolishing the SBA  We're setting ourselves up to do that in the future without actually deliberately having that discussion  And that's the only reason I'd vote against this approval  The motion did include it coming back for discussion  Yeah, I mean we approve this and then come back to discussion  So we already amended the special planning and then we're gonna come back on it  But I feel like it makes you want to do a before B instead of B before A  Depending on how you phrase it. Yeah. Yeah  I don't want to I don't want to preclude the possibilities  We could have if we were to table approval where this project could even be approved by working more in tandem  with all the other property owners as was intended.  I gave it to you to say hey  Further comment?  When you're ready.

I put this on because, although it's not obviously the greatest time of year to do it,  with water falling all over the city to amounts that we don't necessarily need,  but just like we have in the past looked at our energy savings programs, which I was a big proponent of,  I think it's apt that we look at possibly doing a water saving program.  Like I said, a more apt discussion for July or August, but I think certainly is worth a discussion.  We have a presentation, so come on down.  And we'll get you fired up on the computer there and you guys can  go through the whole thing. We appreciate you being here tonight.  All right, well I appreciate the opportunity.  Come and speak about our conservation programs. My name is Evan Markey.  I'm the district manager for Cal Water here in Chico.  And I also have with me. Where do you go? Anthony Myer right here. He is our conservation coordinator for Northern California.  So I'm going to do a few introduction slides and then hand it over to Anthony.  Let's see here.  If we could  figure  out  how  to  navigate  this  All  right  So  just  a  little  bit  about  us  Cal  Water  in  the  Chico  District  we  serve  over  2  million  people  throughout  the  state  State  throughout  the  just shy of a half a million service connections.  Here in Chico, we're at about 110,000 people  through over 30,000 service connections.  And we take water supply planning very seriously.  And that's why we're very happy to be here  and talk about our conservation programs.  Because as you'll see in the next slide,  they have been very impactful here in Chico.  And I really do want to thank our community  because we have made significant strides  in lowering our demand here in Chico over the last 20 years.  You can see on this graph,  this is gallons per capita per day.  So that's pretty much how much the average person uses  in gallons per day.  And we've cut that from about 310 gallons per day  down to 164 over the last 20 or so years.  What that means overall or for overall production,  in 2004, we were at about 30,  just over 30,000 acre feet per year.  And for some of those who were following SGMA,  that's roughly 12, 13% of the total drought  of the sub basin here.  We've cut that down  to just over 20,000,  mostly through our conservation program.  So that's over a 30% decrease in the total usage  with a 25% population increase over that same amount of time.  So these programs are really impactful, really effective.  And I will turn it over to Anthony  so he can kind of go into some of the specifics on those.  Thank you, Evan.  And good evening, Mayor, Vice Mayor,  and members of the Council.  So firstly,  I appreciate the opportunity to come and start.  What I agree with you is a very valuable conversation  on how Cal Water and the city might be able to work together  to help meet obviously important to the city,  which would be cost savings.  And then for us as a water supplier,  would be conservation and water savings as well.  Luckily, unfortunately for the two of us,  those two things do tend to go hand in hand.  So I think there's a lot of opportunity there.  As you can see in this slide,  we take very seriously the partnerships that we're able to do  with our municipal partners.  They tend to go a long ways,  especially when you consider the footprint that a city has  with regard to property and the amount of water  that typically gets used by a local government entity.  So one of the biggest things  that we put a lot of priority into  is to make sure that everybody in our service areas  have all the tools in their toolbox  to meet their conservation goals  and also try to bring down the cost of their water bills.  One of the biggest ways that we do that,  is by maintaining a very robust series  of conservation programs, rebate programs  that we make available for residential customers  and also for commercial customers.  So we do the obvious things like rebating  on high efficient clothes washers, toilets,  things of that sort.  But we typically do, especially in a drought,  but not so much when we're not in a drought,  we put a lot of emphasis on outdoor programs.  One of the reasons that we do that  is because a lot of people aren't aware,  but in the great state of California,  anywhere between 60 and 70% of domestic water use  is actually applied towards outdoors.  So landscape, irrigation, things of that sort.  And the highest percentage of that  is actually applied towards grass,  believe it or not, keeping grass green.  So we put a lot of emphasis on landscape conversions  and turf conversion programs  and pretty much anything outside,  we like to put a lot of emphasis and a lot of energy in  and with also funding behind.  So for our commercial customers,  we have a little bigger gauntlet of programs  that are available.  Kind of highlighting some of the outdoor programs,  probably the most recent one  that we've had a lot of engagement with  is our lawn to garden program.  Basically what this program looks like  is we're kind of asking our customers  and property owners to take kind of a good hard second look  at those large areas of turf  and determine if they're just there for an aesthetic purpose  or are they serving some kind of a functional purpose.  And if they're just aesthetic, is there a possibility  that maybe we could look into converting those over  to drought tolerant landscape.  10 years ago when you used to see  a lot of turf buyback programs  where a water agency would give a rebate  or an incentive of a dollar a square foot  to just tear out your grass,  kind of in the wake of that,  what we saw was a lot of scorched earth,  non aesthetically pleasing properties.  In some cases, people would throw some cactuses in there,  but for the most part, there was no real aftermath  of how we were gonna keep that landscape aesthetically  pleasing as well as, as we were doing.  So we're saving water through those.  Fast forward to 2024, we incentivize those programs now  by requiring that that landscape is converted  and using native plants that are native  to the state of California.  One thing with that is that because they're native  to the state of California,  they rely solely on what the natural environment provides.  So not only do we have a list of 3,000,  almost 4,000 at this point,  absolutely beautiful native plants  that can go back in the place of the grass,  but because they're native to the state,  once they get established,  you can pretty much turn off the water to them altogether  because they thrive in just what  the natural environment provides.  And I'll give some examples of sort of  kind of what that looks like.  In addition, in the last couple of years,  we rolled out what we called  our Customized Incentive Program.  What that basically looks like is that  if we can identify a cost savings and a water savings  that maybe doesn't fall directly into the cookie cutter  of one of our existing rebate programs,  if we can put a price point on that  and we can identify how that might be able to save water,  it could be a new piece of equipment being provided,  it could be a new practice,  it could be replacing outdated machinery,  things of that sort.  So if we can kind of identify something like that,  this program allows us to kind of color outside the lines,  if you will, and kind of custom tailor  something around that specifically.  So it gives us a little more wiggle room with our programs.  One of the most popular things that we rolled out,  probably about a year and a half ago,  is our Smart Landscape Tuna Program.  And I wanted to highlight this because this is,  obviously this is available to any city-owned properties.  What this program looks like is we have partnered  with Waterwise Consulting,  which is a large consulting firm and landscape contractor  that has a statewide reach.  Anybody in our service areas can sign up for this program.  Once they sign up for it,  we will actually schedule an appointment  to where that contractor is going to come out  to that home or business or property.  They're gonna meet with the landowner  or the property owner.  And they're gonna perform a very detailed audit  of the existing irrigation system there at the facility  or at that site.  They're gonna be looking for things like breaks in lines,  leaks, could be outdated equipment.  Anything that's kind of making that system not run  at its most efficient capacity.  Then they're gonna create and draft a report,  along with all the recommendations of how that  could be brought up to its most impactful state.  And instead of just giving this big giant honeydew list  over to the customer of things that they could do,  they actually give us the list and we review it.  As long as all those recommendations are within the scope  of the program, which 99.9% of the time it is,  we will actually approve it.  And then we authorize a second visit  where that consultant will come out to the property.  And they're gonna perform all of those replacements,  installations, upgrades completely free  to the property owner.  They actually do all the work.  They send us the bill.  We pick up the entire tab.  So as you can imagine, it's become a very popular tool.  It's become a very popular program  since we first rolled it out.  And why do we do this?  We do this because we recognize the impact  of maximizing outdoor water use and efficiency.  So we're really behind this program.  I think this is something we could definitely have  a discussion about maybe some possible city-owned properties  that we could get involved in this program as well.  So just to kind of give you an idea of how active Chico  has been with our conservation programs,  this is kind of a highlight of 2023.  I manage most of these programs up and down the state,  and I can tell you hands down that the residents  of the city of Chico by far are the most engaging  with all of our conservation programs.  Last year alone, just here in Chico,  residents took out over 126,000 square feet of lawns  and converted those to drought tolerant landscaping  and native gardens, which is an unmatched number  throughout the state, throughout all of our districts.  In addition to that, 217 people,  installed weather-based smart irrigation controllers,  44 toilets were upgraded, 59 clothes washers were upgraded  to EPA WaterSense standards, and 196 Chico residents  participated in our Smart Landscape Tuning Program.  So really good numbers to give you an idea  of what that actually looks like in savings.  Just based off of 2023's engagement,  we estimate that the annual savings for every year  will be approximately 17 million gallons of water saved.  And over a lifetime, that'll equate to about 100,  almost 168 million gallons.  Retroactively, if you look back at program engagement  in Chico since 2011, we estimate that to accrue  about 1.4 billion gallons of water savings.  So these are big numbers, they speak for themselves,  so it's obvious that we can safely say these programs work.  So how can we tie that over to working  with the city of Chico?  I just wanna highlight a couple of the,  I don't know if you can see this, but I can see a lot of the,  typical, probably more common projects  that we work with other cities that are impactful,  probably the most as far as cost savings.  One of them being median and parkway projects.  So in many cases, we'll work with the city,  the planning department, or with public works or parks,  and we will identify large areas of maybe turf  that's maybe non-functional, it's not providing anything  other than an aesthetic purpose.  And if we can identify those areas,  we will incentivize taking that turf out  and converting it over to native landscaping.  We incentivize that with a rebate,  anywhere from a dollar to $5 a square foot.  In most cases, it's generally around $3 a square foot  is what we do as a rebate to incentivize that.  And we work closely with the planning department  to assess these areas.  It's not limited to just medians and parkways.  To give you an example of what we did recently  with the city of Livermore,  is we looked at a lot of their parks, and we assessed maybe,  and we assessed maybe,  a lot of areas that are not used  for recreational purposes,  but the kind of the outer lying areas,  converting those to just drought tolerant landscape,  could be picnic areas, things like that.  Grass that doesn't need to be there  and doesn't need to be watered.  And obviously when you remove the turf too,  not only is there a cost savings with regard to the water  to keep that grass green,  there's a cost savings with the maintenance aspect  of it too, because you don't have to mow it anymore.  So there's a lot of layers to it.  It's not limited to medians and parks and parkways.  We do work with a lot of cities  to look at local government facilities.  So city halls, local government building,  could be public works offices, things like that.  We take out large sections of grass  as you can see in the picture here.  And yes, grass is beautiful.  We love to look at green grass,  but you can see the alternative landscape  is equally beautiful.  And as I mentioned, it's low maintenance,  and once it gets established,  you can basically cut the water off almost completely.  Just another example of, this is a city hall area  that we did in Livermore recently.  So one of the other things that I wanted to highlight,  and I'm sure the Chief could probably attest to this,  is that fire departments up and down the state  have a massive requirement of amount of water  that they are required to flow.  This is, it's not by choice, it's an absolute necessity.  So there's many layers to it,  but I think the easiest way to summarize it would be  to say that for task book training,  for academies that have to take place,  there's required engine and pump testing.  Every one of those firefighters  has to maintain their certification.  There's a state requirement of how much water  has to be flowed, how many hours  they have to train every year.  There's also state requirements on the amount of water  that has to be flowed to keep those engines certified  and those pumps certified and keep those engines in service  so that they can respond to emergencies.  So it is kind of a necessary evil, if you will.  But in most cases, those practices, training practices  in academies look something sort of like the picture  to the right, with the exception of some districts  will have a small, I don't know what Chico has,  like a small draft pit sometimes,  where it'll recirculate a little bit of water.  But for the most part, it looks like this.  There's a bunch of guys running a whole bunch of water  for several hours to meet those state requirements.  The downside of that is all that water,  they're usually shooting it at some kind of a target.  It could be a fake building, it could be a car.  But all that water's ending up on the ground  and it's ultimately just running off  into the storm drain system.  So we've been looking at, is there new technologies  out there available to where we can minimize that water loss  and we can maybe either capture it or reuse it somehow.  One of the things that we found recently  that we're very excited about getting behind  is called DRAFS units.  DRAFS stands for direct recirculation apparatus.  DRAFS stands for direct recirculation apparatus,  firefighter training and sustainability unit.  As far as I know, that is the longest acronym  in the water conservation industry.  But what does this basically do?  Despite its cool appearance,  no, you can't order street tacos out of it,  but it does something I would say is equally as cool.  Basically, this becomes the new target  for all of those trainings, for all those academies.  It opens up and it has a baffle in the back of it.  In the bottom of this unit,  which you can see,  it's a portable, it's a trailerable unit,  so it can be transported anywhere.  There is a basin of about 1,500 gallons of water  that fills up.  This basically becomes the new target.  So as they're doing their trainings,  they open the back of this unit up  and you can have as many as three different hoses  firing into a baffle in the back of the unit.  It hooks up through an engine truck.  So it's basically creating a perpetual loop of water now  using that same 1,500 gallons of water in a closed loop.  It's got some heat sinking technology.  And it's because water running in a circle  tends to typically heat up,  so it cools that water down.  So you can, now you can technically,  you can run these trainings for all day long,  back to back to back with that same 1,500 gallons of water  instead of what I would say is an average  of 150 to 200,000 gallons of water  you could see on a single training day.  So massive improvement, massive water savings  that could be with this amazing piece of technology.  More recently, in the picture on the right,  you can see the newer units have been installed.  They're installed with a baffle on the top.  So as they're performing ladder training exercises,  they can be shooting into the back of it  and they can also be shooting into the top  of this unit simultaneously.  There are also some really cool additives to that  with regard to the training value to it  that a lot of fire departments,  once they finally get to see these in action,  they get very excited about.  There's valves and manifolds and gauges  that can be used to simulate different types of scenarios  when actually fighting fires.  So firefighters tend to  give a lot of value to that as well.  To date, like I said,  we've really gotten behind this piece of technology.  We have managed to get five of these units  into the hands of four different fire departments,  LA County, Ventura County,  and most recently the City of Visalia  and the City of Stockton.  We estimated based off of the pumping numbers  and task book training logs from these four departments  that these five units alone are gonna save  about 37 million gallons.  That's about 30 million gallons of water every single year.  And that's just with five units alone.  So we're really looking into trying to see  if we can get these into the hands  of more and more fire departments  in the districts in which we provide water to.  So something we're very excited about  and I just wanted to highlight.  That's pretty much it for me.  I think Evan and I would be more than happy  to take any questions that you might have.  All right.  Questions?  I have a couple.  No? No.  Okay.  So in terms of having a program,  I know we've talked about this  and Evan, you and I did too.  In terms of having you guys come in  and assess the city's water usage  and I know that the funding is working through  on your side of things to go back at that,  but how do we get in line?  What do you need from us to get in line for that?  I would say I could give you an example  or speak to what most other cities typically will do.  Usually it entails the formation of a system,  a small committee in which we would be active in  and involved in.  It depends on which route the city would like to go  as far as what types of programs to embrace  and then involving in that committee  the representatives that would be most apt  to serve on that committee.  So if we were looking at turf conversion parks projects,  we'd probably have some people from parks involved,  planning, maybe public works,  depending on if it was something  that the city wanted to do in-house versus going to,  to a competitive bidding process and going out to bid for.  And then obviously if we were to look at the drafts  and this type of a scenario,  having some representatives from the fire department  on that small committee as well  would be probably the first step  in kind of continuing that conversation.  Okay.  Mr. City Manager, what are your thoughts  on terms of working through something like that?  Yeah, I envision us working with,  I would say public works O&M and then fire,  I think is R2,  and then I think that's a good way to go.  All right.  Madam Clerk, do we have any comments?  All right.  Anyone else discussion?  Well, I will second Mr. Guff's  and taking on another chore, the city of Chico.  I think that's an excellent idea and I will second that.  Thank you.  I'll happy to make that motion then.  With a guaranteed second.  Yeah, I think it just makes sense for the,  for the city and Eric's not busy at all.  So now we all know that.  So, all right.  Do we need anything further?  Any discussion further?  All right.  Madam Clerk, if you wanna take our role on that.  That was an actual motion?  An actual motion.  That was a motion.  You got a presentation and motion.  To give Eric more work.  That was the motion?  Yes, the motion is.  There's no more presentation.  The motion is,  Okay.  and we'll see if Mr. Bennett just less openly accepts it  and actually accepts it,  is to move forward with this program  and ask city staff to have discussions with Cal Water  so we can have them move forward  with the water saving program  as it comes to become available from Cal Water side  and whatever else we can do.  Okay.  Second.  All right.  All right.  Council member Bennett?  Yes.  Council member Morgan?  Council member Tandon?  Yes.  Council member Van Overbeck?  No.  No.  Council member Winslow?  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds?  Sure.  Mayor Coolidge?  Aye.  Six, carry six one.  All right.  All right.  Thank you very much.  Appreciate you guys' presentation.  Thanks for being here.  All right.  With that, we will move on to our next item.  And that is council member Winslow's.  5.2 consideration of  of council member Winslow's.  Council member Winslow's request  selling of alcohol ban on specific dates.  And I believe we have one recusal on this.  Mr. Van Overbeck?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I need to recuse myself.  I have a financial interest in a bar downtown.  All right.  So we'll wait for him to step out of the room  and turn it over to council member Winslow.  Thank you, mayor.  As you can see in the council member report,  it's pretty simple thing here.  It was actually recommended by bar owners  in the discussion we had  on allowing new liquor licenses downtown.  They felt that that threatened to provide some competition  that would endanger their businesses.  And that's not necessarily the reason  why we were banning liquor licenses,  but it does make sense, I think,  to look out for our business owners.  We specifically prevent bars from selling alcohol  after midnight on the most popular days of the year  for people to gather and spend money on alcohol.  So naturally it does hurt their businesses.  I would just add from another perspective,  that I think is really important  looking at these sort of things of what's going on downtown.  In what ways does the city step in to stop  a culture of drinking downtown?  That people don't stop drinking on Cesar Chavez Day  or graduation weekend because the bar stopped selling alcohol.  They go to private parties to drink.  Private parties do not have bar owners  that are by our municipal code required to be trained  in how to mitigate nuisances around alcohol use  and also provide a more secure environment for people.  So I do think that,  by offering a space during these celebratory occasions  for people to drink,  we are providing a better environment for safety for people.  But so I thought this was worth bringing up.  I'm inclined to say that it's worth actually removing  these sections from municipal code  or amending it in some way.  But at least we could have some good questions from staff,  probably the police chief,  and I'd hear from public comment and such on it.  All right, do we have any questions  for Council Member Winslow?  Mr. Brant?  No, but I do have,  I'd like the Chief Aldridge to chime in on this, please.  Chief.  I think this was part of the conversation  that we had with planning,  what was that, last week, I believe it was.  And there were two holidays that I said  that I would support testing this out on.  But it requires a little bit of work  from either Planning or Council,  I believe because it's in the code.  And so we're just picking and choosing to not enforce  those rules and enforce the Ordinance.  And it gets a little cloudy for us.  So the two days that I am speaking with my staff  and with Brendan and his staff, the two days that we felt.  would be ones appropriate to test would be Labor Day because that problem has  been quelled for us it's not it's a non-issue for us anymore and then  graduation weekend because typically family members are in town you know the  younger population is controlled by their parents grandparents aunts and  uncles and sometimes we get a twofer where we get a you know a father and a  son who have had too much and we've had that issue but for the most part we we  have responsible you know beverage imbibing going on so those are the two  days I feel like we could test but I again feel like it it's cloudy because  there is an ordinance that says you know these holidays here's the rule so I'll  push that back to council to figure out how you guys want to do that but that's  my support  all right maybe mr. lamb you can weigh in on yes thank you mayor you know my  opinion is that if you have it on your books and you prohibit it I think  there's legal risk of someone possibly suing you or the city to stop you from  or requiring you enforce your ordinance so my my suggestion is council have the  discussion if if the desire is to have staff consider  amendments to the ordinance and if there's any concerns about that I think  there's there there there there there there there there there there there there  there there there there there there there there there there there there there  there there there there there there there there there there there there there  there there there there there there there there there there there there there  there there there there there there there there there there there there there  there there there there there there there there there there there there there there  they can do so without having to go through code amendments and adopt an ordinance just to change one particular holiday.  Makes sense.  All right.  Madam Clerk, do we have any speakers?  No.  All right.  Well, that's easy.  I'd like to add something.  I mean, here it says the business which sells alcohol, right, in number C,  shall take action to prevent nuisance activities associated with the sales of alcohol and a bunch of other things.  I don't think any business owners take responsibility of those things on the normal days.  And if we allow them to sell past midnight on certain holidays where I'm sure we have extra issues,  I don't know how would that help.  So just keep that in mind.  Well, how often are you at the bars on Halloween to see what they're doing?  I'm never out there.  I never had a drop of alcohol in my life.  Same.  Excuse me.  Okay, now.  You're not under oath, but really.  We all know better.  Okay.  Some further discussion.  So, yes, the idea of amending this or our municipal code, so with the new ordinance,  to make it so we would need to pass a resolution,  in order to get it to the next level,  or to either restrict or to allow on these days.  That's sort of the idea, because I hadn't thought about that before.  So I'm just trying to make sure I understand correctly.  The council would be asked to amend the ordinance to refer to a resolution  that references the dates on which alcohol is prohibited at certain times.  So, again, if let's say, as the chief mentioned about test runs,  you could, in theory, amend the code, adopt a resolution that lists those particular dates and holidays,  and do a test run, and if it doesn't work, you can bring back the resolution,  and add those holidays back, rather than just ignoring your ordinance.  No different than what we do with fees, typically, that are identified in the muni code.  They point to a resolution for a fee that was adopted by resolution.  One more complicating factor is these rules are in Title 19, which always requires a recommendation from the Planning Commission.  So we have to keep looping back to them, getting a first and second reading out of you.  That's the resolution straight to you.  One meeting.  Right.  Okay.  So the cleanest way to get it done then would be  pass or to make a motion to direct staff to come back with a updated municipal code,  or do we have to do that? Can we do that tonight?  It's a code amendment and resolution.  Code amendment and resolution. That would be the cleanest and easiest and the least painful.  And then we would review it once a year, if needed.  If we amend it, and if there's a need to bring it back, and if it just goes horribly the first time, start with the two.  If it goes okay, maybe add one more.  I remember the times when this was needed.  I think Chico State has done a really good job of engaging their students and educating,  and they're trying to bring up the standard and code of conduct out, and I think that's the first time we've had that.  And then we've had it in public and that sort of thing, so I think it's worth definitely trying.  I would make a motion then to bring that back.  Sorry, to have a code amendment and a resolution come back.  All right. We have a motion. Do we have a second?  Yeah, I'll second it.  Yeah.  All right. We have a motion and a second.  Madam Clerk, when you're ready.  Council Member Bennett?  Yes.  Council Member Morgan?  No.  Council Member Tandon?  No.  Council Member  Van Overbeck is disqualified.  Council Member Winslow?  Aye.  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds?  Aye.  Mayor Coolidge?  Aye.  It carries 4-2 with one recusal.  All right. And we'll bring back in Mr. Van Overbeck  because he has the next item. That's not the only reason, right? He just has to bring it back in.  I should put both yours in the row and then we wouldn't...  I didn't think the same thing.  Next time.  I should put both yours in the row and then we wouldn't...  I should put both yours in the row and then we wouldn't...  Send someone else but we might lose them too.  I'll send someone else but we might lose them too.  I'll send someone else but we might lose them too.  There we go.  Okay. Item 5.3, consideration of Council Member Van Overbeck's request.  Lindo Channel Sediment Cleanup.  And we have a report from Council Member Van Overbeck.  So Lindo Channel, I think all of you know, splits off from Big Chico Creek at Five Mile Recreation Area.  So Lindo Channel, I think all of you know, splits off from Big Chico Creek at Five Mile Recreation Area.  And it was built in, completed in 1965 by the Army Corps of Engineers as a response.  So in 1955, we had a huge flood in California.  Yuba City had six or eight feet of water in the downtown.  And so as a result, the state passed the State Water Project in 1960.  It was a bond measure.  Anyway, too much detail.  But there were a number of flood control projects that were built at the time,  including the Lindo Diversion Channel from Big Chico Creek.  That, as it was engineered, was designed to carry 14,500 cubic feet of water.  And that assumes that the sluice gates, letting water into Big Chico Creek, released 1,500.  So you got a total capacity in the system of 16,000 cubic feet per second.  So you got a total capacity in the system of 16,000 cubic feet per second.  So for the first, you know, 20 years or so of the life of this,  every year the county, primarily the county, would clear the debris that was washed down.  When you have high water and big rains like we had in the last couple of days,  lots of rocks and trees and things get carried down.  And where that channel diverges from Big Chico Creek, that tends to pile up there.  And so...  And so...  What's happened over the last 40 years is they've stopped maintaining it for a variety of reasons.  And as a result, that channel that was designed to be 140 feet wide is now 50 feet wide.  And it's estimated that the bottom of the floor of the channel is 8 feet higher than it was before.  And...  Which says to me that the design carrying capacity...  Capacity of 14,500 cubic feet per second is probably now something like 6 or 8.  So I think there's a real clear and present danger to the city.  If we have another flood like we had in 97 here,  it's going to end up in downtown and the neighborhoods around the park and maybe more.  So...  So right now, the city, Mr. Gustafson and his counterpart,  at the county, are talking about how to get the county to basically step up to do its responsibilities to take care of things.  Am I characterizing that properly?  Yeah, I think I agree.  The first effort is for...  We're aligning with the county to approach Department of Water Resources.  But I think it's pretty clear in the documents that I've seen.  I read that big folder in the city manager's office, that big binder, that the county...  It's confusing, but it's pretty clear that the county's responsible for that.  That's our understanding.  But I think the intent is to try to engage with DWR first.  They had agreed, like we know they agreed to do that sediment removal project some time ago.  And we hope to partner with kind of a multi-agency role.  And I think the intent is to determine if DWR is willing to partner with us again.  And then, you know, go from there once we figure that out or have that determination from the state.  But this is the principal flood control protection structure.  Mr. Van Overbrook.  Yeah.  Let's finish.  Let's finish our presentation.  And then, so if that's the...  I'm working on it.  I know.  But then everybody's supposed to ask questions of you and staff.  Particularly what you're...  Well, part of my presentation was getting confirmation from staff.  Okay.  Thank you, Mr. Mayor, for the guidance.  It's always been helpful to me.  So I think this thing, this matter is of sufficient gravity that it needs the attention of the council.  And so what I'm proposing is that the city...  We'll let the city staff give us a report.  And Eric, we don't need a bunch of PowerPoints, but just a simple verbal report on where we are with...  I don't want to put another brick in your backpack.  On staff?  Sorry?  I object to the attack on staff.  No, I don't want to put another brick in his already filled backpack.  I object to the attack on staff.  But give us an update on where we are with the county on getting, you know, getting some...  action taken to start removing that material all right so do we have any  questions mr. van over back on this issue or staff for that matter we have  to have public comment too if we have that comment we do we have we have mr.  Bennett well I met with mr. Gus of sin what two weeks ago and he walked me  through this thank you for your time I think he has it in complete control  along with the city manager of course and is working on it but I think it'd be  great I think it's a great idea that we hear about this from time to time so we  can stay on top of it Lindo channel a good part of Linden  channel is in my district and obviously it's a issue of concern for all of us so  I support your motion well let's wait on the motion  you  see what we have do we have any speakers we have one Robin McCollum all  right let's do three minutes  so mr. McCollum is the person who brought this to my attention and took a  part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part  part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part  part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part  part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part  what turned out to be 160% of the design.  So the important thing here is we need to get this going.  I don't mean we've got to get a dozer in there tomorrow,  but I mean we've got to get the planning process going  and the commitments from the actors who are going to do it the sooner the better.  I think this question about who's responsible is a red herring.  So we need to get past that as soon as we can.  And I understand we need to be polite, et cetera.  But at any rate, and if I can,  I think there's a lot of confusion about the functioning of the system  and what's at risk and what's in danger, what's out of shape.  And the primary thing is right there, just above the dams,  just above the Big Chico Dam.  That's the bifurcation of Big Chico Creek where it splits to Lindo Channel.  And it's primarily that large shoal that's formed there that is the problem.  And it's not allowing the water to head down towards Lindo as fast as it should there.  And that's why it's liable to come over.  It's coming straight into it, and it's liable to go over the top of the levee  if it gets a little higher than last time.  And that was 27 years ago or something.  You know, it was designed for a 100-year event,  by the Corps of Engineers.  And that's a nice-sounding figure,  except that was 1960s, you know, climatic norms  that they were using to establish a 100-year event.  Now we're looking at something different.  I don't know if we've got new standards articulated yet or not,  but we know that there are extreme weather events that happen,  atmospheric rivers.  We've had several just now, just recently.  The only thing that saved us, really,  wasn't any snow in the mountains to add to that flow.  Anyway, I'll be glad to answer anybody's questions,  any time on this issue.  Going forward, the sooner and quicker we go on our meetings  and get this rolling, the happier I'll be.  Thank you.  Any questions?  All right, thank you.  Okay.  Okay.  Mr. City Manager, you brought this up on email to us as well,  and we'll see if we can get it back.  Do you have some thoughts on this,  kind of where we stand and what the city needs to do at this point?  Exactly what we're doing.  Press the county and DWR to fix the problem.  Yeah, because Mr. McCollum's exactly right.  There is definitely, in my opinion, there's definitely a problem.  So happens January 1st, 1997, I was out there myself  and saw exactly what he described.  All right.  And it was, you know, I was out there, and I was like,  it means a lot to me because I live six-tenths of a mile downstream.  I was going to say your house is pretty darn close, I think.  So I'm very tuned into that.  You know, fortunately, what we just had recently was comparatively nothing.  I think it topped out at 2,600 cubic feet per second,  not the 20 or so thousand that was in 97.  So, yeah, there's no question that we're taking it seriously,  that this is something that needs to happen.  All right.  But unfortunately, we're dealing with a plethora of state agencies,  including various, you know, Fish and Game, Army Corps of Engineers,  et cetera, et cetera, that we'll have to navigate.  So he's right.  There won't be a bulldozer out there next week.  All right.  Further questions, discussion?  I don't know if you need a motion.  We've already started.  All right.  Are you comfortable with that, Mr. Vandermeer?  Well, I think what he's looking for is a periodic check-in,  which we're happy to do.  All right.  I haven't made a motion yet, so I'd like to do that,  which is that I would like the city staff to report to the council  in a frequency that they deem appropriate,  the city manager deems appropriate.  So maybe now it's...  You know, it's monthly, and if it comes quarterly in a year or so.  Whatever you think is right, Eric, I trust your judgment.  So the motion is that the city staff report to the council periodically  on the progress toward reaching a resolution to resolve the problem.  Second.  All right.  Motion on second.  Madam Clerk, when you're ready.  Thank you.  Let me get the motion.  Council Member Bennett?  Yes.  Council Member Morgan?  No.  Council Member Tandon?  Yes.  Council Member Van Overbeck?  Yes.  Council Member Winslow?  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds?  Yes.  Mayor Coolidge?  Aye.  Carries 6-1.  All right.  Item 5.4, consideration of Council Member Winslow's request,  bike path lighting.  And we have a report from Council Member Winslow.  Thank you, Mr. Mayor.  This isn't something that's like novel to my ideas,  which is why in my little report I attached all the general plan policies  related to crime prevention through environmental design,  or as people like to pronounce it, SEPTED.  The idea is that you modify the built environment in an area in order to  make it feel and actually be safer.  And so a good example of that is lighting.  And I did think it was warranted to have some kind of like review of like  where our bike path lighting is at,  consider that.  I don't know if you've heard of that.  I don't know if you've heard of that.  Because it is a public safety matter.  Because we hear all the time, those of us at least who have districts with bike paths  running around in it, we hear from people all the time that it's a significant issue  in people's daily lives that they don't feel safe at many times of the day and night on  the bike paths.  And I knew that there were some areas that were somewhat lacking in lighting, but I just  did a little like rainy bike ride around last night.  And I can tell you that there's a whole stretch of bike path from Bike Boy 99 from Lassen  to where a residential area like connects to Eaton that all the lights are on.  And I think that's a good thing.  There's a number of areas all through the bike path, railroad bike path that they're  out right now.  And I think we're probably just lacking some kind of like mechanism.  People don't know how to report that.  And just a review of that in itself I think would be a good thing.  I also think that in the spirit of the policies we have to support SEPTED, there are more  things we can do to try to implement these in the short term and in the long term.  Some of that, the concepts of SEPTED that are really basic to urban design are like,  eyes on the street, getting windows and doors to face these public areas.  So they're no longer like locked off in sort of tunnels where it's dark and people don't  feel like they have any like entry or exit.  They kind of, like if we would have gone back and intentionally designed some of our bike  paths to be crime corridors, we would have designed them very much like the way they  are right now with backyards backing up onto it, tall fences.  So it's all locked off.  There's no visibility on them.  Maybe we would have just peppered in some little spots for people to hide around a corner.  Or something in there.  And I think that it's not an easy thing to do to look at this, like the airport bike  path, for example, and say that we're going to make this a safer area.  But I think recognizing the issue that it is right now, we can take steps so that in  20, 30, 40 years, our children and grandchildren do not inherit this place with the same level  of inherent danger that it is to us today.  And we can take some steps to gradually move in that direction.  That being said, I...  I think that there's enough going on in this that I didn't really want to come up with  a super concrete proposal and say that it's like this is what we should do.  Because I think that what it is and where I've seen in other cities it's been implemented  well, it's about having a conversation between the police department, who already has SEPTED  certified officers, I think a couple more going through a training on it.  And they do sort of consultations to businesses.  And you can add anything, Chief, in a minute.  And...  But it's expanding that in a broader conversation with planning and public works to look at  what kind of...  What kind of investments we might be able to make in an area.  And what sort of other programs we can do to encourage development of like windows and  doors facing the bike path so that eventually it become safer and even in like little bits.  I think...  I know that there's been talk...  I'm almost done here.  About an area specifically around the university, the bike path there.  And the university has like interacted with the city in ways about potentially taking  over the cameras that we've installed there.  They put improved lighting in because it's such a high traffic area.  And I think there's other areas in town...  Time in town that warrant that sort of attention.  But even starting with that is a good idea.  So that's the gist of it.  I'm curious what you all have to say.  All right.  Questions for Council Member Winslow?  What is it that we're being asked to do here?  Mr. Winslow?  In the Council Member report I put on here, it says Council should direct staff to consider opportunities in return to Council.  Council should direct staff to consider opportunities in return to Council. in return to Council with more specific recommendations, but that is to say, let's take a serious look about what we can do to improve these areas, and I give some examples there, is we have a discussion or housing element about subsidy programs for accessory dwelling units, and we could look to target those subsidy programs specifically for properties that abut the bike path so that if they build to where somebody's looking out onto that path, we prioritize them for some funding that's gonna help them do that, and we already support ADUs in many ways. Others is just a review of the lighting, adding it where it doesn't exist,  where it doesn't exist and certainly repairing the existing lights that are just not working  for whatever reason yeah so are you are you do you envisioning every bike path being lit or or the  the highly trafficked one so you reference the the one that leaves the university i mean that makes  a tremendous amount of sense but you know we have a couple hundred miles of them and i can't imagine  we want to light them all there's a lot of lighting that just isn't working um and in other  areas it's like it's like you have a long stretch where there's only one light and so when you look  at that area and i have some like pictures it's like it doesn't look like something that's  comfortable to go down hence the experience that we hear from people all the time and i yeah i think  there's opportunities to add more in some areas it might not be as appropriate it might not be  worth prioritizing um so certainly starting with the highly trafficked areas is what i'd recommend  thank you a lot of those bike paths have lights but some of them definitely need some more too  a lot of them yeah yeah um  really  okay do you have any comments we have one monica mcdaniel i wrote come on down  council it's getting late so i'll keep it brief i just am in support of this idea  that chico has high efficiency lights so we can use them in more places they're energy efficient  i think improving safety on bike paths with lights is a huge thing the bike paths where we're  a place where we can use them in more places they're energy efficient  and they're not going to be able to do that in the first place because it was dark and they were  able to live in the shadows and so um i think adding the lights would be would be a huge element  right from councilman when council person's winslow's report um he talks about crime prevention  through environmental design while the police are the primary agency charged with crisis  intervention they cannot solely be responsible for controlling and limiting crime and  interpersonal conflicts youth neighborhood watch programs as well as planning through design  concepts just just like lighting in problematic areas can make a big difference um also the  speaker earlier was talking about encampments that are still happening in lindo channel  i spoke with residents in that area who also suggested lights there too so i think that  lighting is a great step in the right direction towards crime prevention in the city thank you  all right thank you very much  further comment i have a question for you so um so what would your ideal be  to have this come back to us what would you like to see happen um what's the next step i i think  that it could be something that just if we you know send clear direction that we're interested  in investing in safety on the bike paths and that that can take the form of something like lighting  then that would be something we'd look we'd see it in the budget cycle um i think that's one element  of it i because there are more and more people who are interested in investing in safety on the bike  path and i think that's one of the things that we're looking at is more creative approaches like  i described with the adus um i'd like us to consider that uh after kind of vetting it through  a conversation with staff um okay so have staff bring back some suggestions and include additional  discussion during the budget about lighting and bike path and i i'd specify because this these are  there have been some ongoing conversations about partnership with the university for that stretch  right there potentially turning over um maintenance of some of those areas to the university  um that that would be included in the direction and i would like to see that as well um so i think that's one of the things that we're looking at is that we're looking at is that we're looking at the  there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there  Yeah, I've scoured the bottom of those looking for that number and then not found them.  It's right, yeah.  Yeah, I can send it to you.  It's rightawaymaintenance at chicoca.gov.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  All right, so that's an easy one.  Okay.  Because there isn't any way to remotely detect when a light's out.  We don't pay folks to go out at night necessarily looking for them, unfortunately.  Okay.  So it sounds like we got one problem solved.  If we maybe advertise that with some information to bring back more information on what we can do further.  And if there's specifics about specific areas that might benefit from more lighting,  of course, sometimes that depends on, you know, logistics of getting electricity there.  So I can say when I was in college, I used to drive my bike a lot at night around Chico.  And it is, there are several places that are,  just thought, you know, they're pretty darn scary.  That would, right through now, save my life.  I think it's worthwhile to at least look at probably investing in the smart lights on bike paths.  So I'd make a motion that we consider it during the budgeting time  and also have staff maybe review some of the areas as well.  I have a very quick suggestion.  Maybe, Council Member Winslow, maybe you could talk to Chico Velo and ask them to go out  and check the bike paths.  I think if they go out and check the bike paths at night,  a lot of people, they could probably put a small crew together and take care of this pretty quickly.  All right.  So in terms of the budget and additional, that's the motion.  So.  I'll take them back.  All right.  Would you add to that that we do come back with some further recommendations and broader  community design concepts?  And I don't know if you said specifically in terms of the partnership with the university  for the area adjacent to the.  I think the partnership.  Partnership with the university is pretty well underway, my understanding of it.  Yeah.  We've offered, for example, on that bike path to give them the cameras that we have.  They do need to be updated.  They're old technology that store video in the camera itself.  So if something happens and somebody wants the video, PD has to go out and download from  that camera.  So it really needs to get upgraded to something that is connected to a network.  Video recorder.  But we see that as something that university PD should take on.  And they express some interest, but we haven't seen any action yet.  So.  Sure.  Okay.  Yeah.  We can include that in the motion.  Okay.  Who was the second?  Council Member Tandon.  Okay.  All right.  So we have a motion and a second.  That is the clerk when you're ready.  Council Member Bennett.  Yes.  Council Member Morris.  No.  Council Member Tandon.  Yes.  Council Member Van Overbeck.  Yes.  Council Member Winslow.  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds.  Yes.  Mayor Coolidge.  Aye.  Carries 6-1.  All right.  Item 5.5 is items after the posting agenda.  We have none.  Item 6, reports and communications.  No action can be taken on items under this section of the agenda unless Council agrees  to include it on a subsequent agenda.  6.1, City Manager's Report.  Mr. Sorensen.  So moved.  All right.  6.2, Council Member requests pursuant to AP and P-1010.  Council members may verbally request an item to be agendized at a future meeting after  stating what the item would be.  A majority vote of the Council is needed in order for staff to agendize.  Do we have any Council Member requests?  I do have one.  Going once, going twice.  All right.  This was actually brought up by one of our members of the press who happens to be in  chambers, but I think it's an idea that a lot of us have been wanting for some time.  Because without social media, if you don't care to engage in it because of its ugly nature,  there is no real way for Council members to actually talk to the community unless they  go out to the community.  But from this dais, you only talk on the issues necessarily that are in front of us.  So my thought is to have Council Member reports, not all seven of us at one meeting, but alternating  between two meetings and having a time limit of three minutes like we give the public.  So that would be my Council Member request.  That we discuss that in a future meeting.  That's a good question.  Don't we already have that?  Council Member reports?  If I remember right, like six years ago, I was able to give a report on something if  I wanted to after City Manager reports.  I'm just wondering if we need to do it.  Do we have it?  Ms. Clifford.  I mean, we did it briefly in 2012.  That one was more for attendance at the various meetings and the other meetings.  And that didn't go very long.  But yes, Council members can reach out to the Mayor to request that or I can double-check  the policy.  I'm trying to think of an exception there.  But you definitely could bring it up under Council Member request and say, I'd like to  come back with an update.  Other...  It might be more specific towards because we all represent districts now, whereas we  didn't before.  So now you're discussing the issue?  No.  No.  That's what you're doing.  Sorry.  I guess that's my fault.  I was making clarification.  We're trying to make sure that it doesn't already exist.  Great.  I will second the motion.  So we have a motion and a second.  And so that's to have Council Member reports staggered every other meeting or every meeting  for three minutes each.  Okay.  On any topic?  Yeah.  Okay.  Well, it would be reports in terms of what's happening with the district.  Okay.  All right.  Yeah.  No, you would report.  This is what's going on in my district.  This is what I think is important.  Assuming the City Manager doesn't touch on it in his report.  Yeah.  Okay.  Council Member Bennett?  Is this going to be required or is it optional?  No.  Not required.  And we can discuss it when we discuss it.  Yeah.  This is just a discussion.  Council Member Morgan?  No.  Council Member Tandon?  No.  Council Member Tandon?  Yes.  Council Member Van Overbeck?  Yes.  Council Member Winslow?  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds?  Sure.  Mayor Coolidge?  Aye.  Carries 6-1.  All right.  All right.  With that, we will adjourn.  Thank you very much.  You're recessing back.  You're recessing.  So we are not adjourning.  We are going into closed session.  We'll be back to adjourn. [inaudible]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.
