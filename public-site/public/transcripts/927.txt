 Thank you.  Thank you.  Do you want to advise them that we might wind away?  Sure.  Sure?  I mean, oh.  Man of chair.  Man of chair.  Yeah, we're double checking with the audio team to see if they're not here yet.  We're trying to figure out if they're going to be here.  So maybe why is the wait a little bit if we can get all of them?  Sure.  Let's give it a few minutes.  We can say that is there a time that we can start if we don't hear from them, like 610?  Sure.  Yeah, Nicole's trying to call them right now, but they knew that we had a meeting somewhere.  We're checking.  We're trying to see if we can get ahold of them, but they're not here now.  Yeah.  That's right.  Okay.  Yeah.  Well, I'll have a recording from the WebEx video, but we won't be broadcast on Channel  11.  And to the extent people know that the Planning Commission is always broadcast on Channel 11,  we'd like to have them here to make that happen.  Well, we can wait.  Nicole's trying to call them right now, so we'll have some idea.  We were able to get ahold of them, but there are many types of rivalries.  Sounds good.  Thank you.  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  All right.  All right.  I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think  I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think  I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think  I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think  Just a few of us, I guess.  Four or five?  It was panelists.  It was panelists.  When they come back, then we can reopen it.  I feel like it might take some time.  It'll take about 15, 20 minutes.  Or we can just wait until they get back, whatever you choose.  Yeah, yeah.  Okay.  Do the folks on WebEx or whatever, they are aware of what's going on?  Good.  In order for the people in the computer to really hear us,  we want to make sure our mouths, covered as they are,  are very close to the microphones and that we're speaking clearly into them.  Thank you.  Thank you.  For those who are online,  we'll have public comment kind of in the middle of the meeting.  And we'll, of course, be commenting through WebEx.  And generally, we go through the list of attendees.  And we'll unmute you one by one to make sure that you're not outstuck on you.  And ask if you want to speak.  And make sure that everybody gets a chance to speak if they want to.  But you can also comment in the chat.  Or I think there might be a hand raise function to let us know ahead of time  that you want to make a comment.  So make some noise.  I think some of you will make some noise.  I think some of you will make some noise.  I think some of you will make some noise.  I think some of you will make some noise.  I think some of you will make some noise.  I think some of you will make some noise.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  The music is by the band The ! so so  I love you.  I love you.  I love you.  I love you.  I love you.  I love you.  You asked for it, I should? Sorry.  Okay, sweet. I will watch then.  I will watch then.  I will watch then.  I will watch then.  I will watch then.  I will watch then.  I will watch then.  I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America  and to the republic for which it stands,  one nation, under God, indivisible,  with liberty and justice for all.  All right. Have a seat.  And item 1.2 is roll call.  Can we get the roll call, please?  Yes.  Commissioner Rensink?  Present.  Commissioner Scott is absent.  Commissioner Ober?  Here.  Commissioner Howlett?  Here.  Commissioner Dermede is absent.  Vice Chair Arumla?  Present.  Chair Goldstein?  Present.  Thank you.  Great. Thanks.  All right. Item 2, the consent agenda.  It looks like we have approval of minutes  for September 17th and November 5th.  Hopefully everybody's had a chance to review these.  And I assume we can pass those in one motion  to approve the consent agenda.  So if anyone would like to make that motion.  I'll move approval of the consent agenda.  All set.  All right.  All in favor, please say aye.  Aye.  Aye.  Any opposed?  And any abstentions?  All right.  The motion carries.  Consent agenda is approved.  Item 3, business from the floor.  Members of the public may address the commission  at this time on any matter not already listed on the agenda.  With comments being limited to three minutes,  we can't take any action at this meeting  on requests made under this section of the agenda.  So if anybody is here specifically  for business from the floor, then you can chat in the WebEx  and we'll probably give it a minute just to make sure  that anybody who wants to speak can tell us.  And we'll probably assume that most of you all are here  for the next item.  It looks like nobody's raising their hands.  Okay. All right.  Then let's move on to item 4, public hearings.  So our big item tonight, well, first, public hearing guidelines.  We'll have a staff report and commission discussion.  Then we'll have our public hearing  where the applicant speaks.  Then we'll have our public speakers,  perhaps an applicant rebuttal or, yeah.  And then we'll close the hearing  and commission will discuss.  And decide.  So item 4.1 is use permit 20-07, Sabbath House  and Renewal Center on Fair Street.  Would staff like to give their report?  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Good evening, planning commissioners.  This project site is located on Fair Street,  on two properties on each side of Fair Street.  So on the east side of Fair Street, we have CS zone parcel  that is 1.468.  And it's currently developed with the work training center  office building and parking area.  And on the west side of the street,  we have IOMU zone property.  It's also part of the wedge.  So on the east side, sorry, I need to go back for a second.  But on the east side, it's also zoned SD6 with the,  and that overlay tells us  that it's within the Chapman Mulberry neighborhood plan,  as with the neighborhood east of there.  And then on the west side, we have the wedge.  It's zoned IOMU industrial office mixed-use.  And it's also identified as an opportunity site  on the general plan.  As I mentioned, the 1.46-acre site on the east side is  developed with the work training center office building  and parking area.  And it's adjacent to residential properties.  And then on the west side,  it's also the work training center sort of yard area  where they have, you know, they store buses,  they have a nursery, there's a landscape business there.  And it's mostly developed with outbuildings.  And on that side of the street is also not improved  with public improvements,  or some minimal improvements exist there.  And then that property would be subdivided.  The applicant doesn't need all of it for the renewal center  that would be located on that side.  So it would, you know, be a little bit more accessible.  And then the site would be divided in the future  to create the site size they need.  So discussing each in turn, the Sabbath Center would be located  on the east side of the street in the existing office buildings  that would be repurposed for residential use.  19,500 square feet approximately of office space would be  converted to support a 60-bed homeless shelter for individuals  and families.  And we described that in detail in the report.  It would be run by the Jesus Center who currently exists  on Park Avenue.  And they have a 20-year history actually  of running a Sabbath House homeless shelter  in that building.  Most people know it for the drop-in meal service  that they provide.  But they also have experience, developed experience  over the years running.  And it's a really good place to be.  So some some some some some some some some some so  some some some some some some some some some some some  some some some some some some some some some some some  some some some some some some some some some some some  parking area that would serve the staff that would manage that site. There's  there would be approximately nine daytime workers and six nighttime staff.  A couple couple shifts of nine workers during the day and we calculated that  the parking need for a homeless shelter would be approximately one space per ten  beds of the shelter plus spaces for staff. They plan to remodel the front of  the building and it would look somewhat like this so that it would really  improve the streetscape along that that side of the street that's already  improved with the public improvements. Then on the west side of the road would  a future development would be the the Renewal Center and that would be a new  building.  It would basically redevelop a portion of that site to create a large  38,000 square foot building and approximately 100 parking spaces and  that would conditions would recommend that in the future the Renewal Center  goes through the full design review process but that the facade remodel for  the Sabbath House would just be an administrative approval.  There was a neighborhood meeting held in September and it was well attended and  the applicant team went through their process and describing that the work  training center is changing their model and at the same time described how  they're changing the the Jesus Center would be changing the way they operate  by moving to Fair Street instead of providing that drop-in meal service that  people are familiar with it would just be a residential  emergency shelter and that way for people staying up to six months at a time.  So it would it would be a different type of use than what we are familiar with on  Park Avenue at their current location. We did get some comments back from various  city departments. Public Works was one of them and they wanted to make sure that  it was clear that the public improvements that are lacking on the west  side on that wedge side of the street would be required at such time that the  renewal centers developed or the parcels split to divide off that that site for  development. Public improvements exist on the east side already. I also got a  phone call from the police chief today and he informed me that they have walked  through the site and that they're very happy as well as a building official and  they have no comments or concerns with this use.  There's at your chairs this evening a memo that was distributed. We got a couple  comments this week via email or and one's an email one's a letter so we  summarize those. One was an immediately adjacent residential neighbor who  expressed some concerns and I summarized some responses that we gave to them over  the potential that people could throw something over the fence or something  like that and basically replied that this site will be very well managed and  that management will be responsive to the  needs of the residents. I think that's a good point. I think that's a good point.  I think some some some some some some some some some some some some some some  some some some some some some some some some some some some some some  some some some some some some some some some some some some some some  some some some some some some some some some some some some some some  security concerns and also identified the fact that when they want to retenant properties or  you know hypothecate it for a different type of development that they don't want there to be a  concern that the normally permitted manufacturing or heavy commercial uses would be prevented in  some way because we have this residential use here so this memorandum that I distributed this  evening would we're recommending an additional condition with that and that additional condition  sort of borrow some language from our right to farm ordinance which says that basically residents  you are you are in a certain location where adjacent properties they might make noise they  might make smells it those could cause some inconvenience of being a resident here the  uses of this memorandum would be in some way in some way in some way in some way in some way in  for temporary stays, so we're not overly concerned with that, but we do want to send a clear signal  that we want to be able to allow these adjacent properties to carry out their zoning and do the  things that they would normally be allowed to do on those properties. So we would recommend that  we include that condition should the commission decide to approve this project tonight.  And then just a quick reminder that this is a housing development project, so it's  subject to the Housing Accountability Act and Housing Crisis Acts.  We are recommending that you determine the projects categorically exempt from CEQA  as an infill project, that you make the use permit findings as set forth in Resolution  20-15, approving the use permit, and to add that condition number 8 from the memo.  And I'll try to answer any questions you have. Great, thank you, Mike. Also, I forgot to  ask, is there a question about the use permit? I don't know if you have a question about the  use permit. I don't know if you have a question about the use permit. I don't know if you have  any of us have ex parte communication. Do we have any of that?  Yes, I had a brief communication with Matt Galloway, architect.  Okay, thank you for sharing.  Done.  Yeah, I've kind of followed this site a little bit because Safe Space used to have part of their  operations there, and I volunteer for them, but I haven't spoken with any of the project  developers of this, so it's pretty new to me.  So, yeah, not really any here.  So, yeah, questions for Mike?  No questions for Scott?  Very, very brief, specific one.  Just to clarify, Mike, you said that as part of the renewal center, did I hear right, that  there would be 100 parking spaces, or that they're currently on the plan there's 100?  Did I hear that right?  Because that sounds like a lot.  There's actually more than that.  I misspoke, I think.  Okay.  I think it's close to 100, but the actual number is going to be on attachment C, 117 parking spaces  associated with that use, and I think that is because there's more beds.  There's 100 beds instead of 60.  Right.  And also there's envisioned to be many more office-type users there that would be providing the  services needed for the occupants over there.  So I would encourage the commission to entertain additional questions with the applicant.  They know their project better than I do.  Understood.  Thanks.  I just wanted to clarify that I heard that number right, so thank you.  Well, thanks.  Are there any other questions for staff?  Alrighty.  If not, then I think we can move on to hearing from the applicant.  So, yeah, looks like we have a question.  We've got a few representatives from the project here, I think?  We do.  I think Matt Galloway is going to start, unless I'm mistaken.  They will correct me if not.  Go ahead, Matt.  Nope, I think you got it right there, Mike.  Thanks a bunch.  I appreciate the opportunity to talk tonight, albeit remotely, so a little different.  I'm actually at the headquarters here at the Jesus Center tonight with Laura and Amber.  We are properly social distanced from each other, I assure everyone.  So, yeah, thank you.  Anyway, Mike, I was hoping that you would run through the slides here as we go through.  As I mentioned, I'm a project architect for this amazing new endeavor here that we're going through.  Also, I have to speak to the fact that I'm a neighbor.  My office is just off the page here,  probably about 600 feet away.  Honestly, as a property owner in the area,  we had concerns and I would like to let everybody know that I feel fairly alleviated with my concerns  and really have a strong support for the project as it's coming forward here.  It is a unique opportunity for us here with this building.  We've been looking at the project now for two years,  not necessarily at this location,  but at a number of locations.  I think that the BMX site location that we had looked at,  that was pretty well publicized.  We explored that opportunity pretty extensively as well as other locations before this location finally fell in our lap here about a year ago.  Less than that really, about 10 months ago.  It was really just an amazing opportunity with buildings that were already in place that would work pretty well for a lot of the program.  I'm going to let Laura speak to the program a little bit more here shortly.  But the buildings on the east side with the Sabbath House,  are going to go really fit our program amazingly well and give us a good opportunity to probably move in and do some renovations relatively quickly.  Whereas other locations we looked at could have been years away,  this has the ability to alleviate some pressures within our community literally within months.  We're talking about a move in given approvals here this evening that could happen early next spring.  As you can see on the page here,  we have the Sabbath House,  which is the initial component for development and renovation.  But we also show the renewal center on the west side,  which is the lower side of the screen.  We've taken a lot of great efforts to have proper street frontage,  and really thinking about how the shape of the building and how it addresses the street gives opportunity for privacy,  for staff,  for the community,  and for patrons and the different populations that might be using this building.  So although there's the possibility that the building could morph a little bit in terms of its size,  we're pretty set on its shape and the fact that it is really creating some good,  rich opportunity sites around the building for privacy,  for employees,  for privacy,  for patrons,  and also for privacy for families,  all of who would be using,  we envision using this center.  I know there was touch base a little bit about parking,  but programmatically,  there are a number of different collaborators and partners that are interested in being involved with the Jesus Center on the renewal center site.  And that number is somewhat in flux.  So we have the opportunity to grow and design a building here that could grow as our needs are there.  And,  but we also need to be somewhat responsive to what our partners might need and how much space they might need.  So we're fairly loose with this in terms of its ability to grow,  but its configuration and size and location on that site is pretty well set.  I also know that there have been a number of questions about security and safety on site.  And obviously that's something that we've had a lot of discussions and a lot of planning regarding.  Okay.  Just talking to the previous tenant on the site,  the work training center,  there's a tendency for traffic to be traveling down this road in excess of 60 miles an hour.  So we've been working with public works and just discussing potentials for road diet to slow speeds down on the street.  We also have the ability as of a request that came from the work training center many years ago,  but it's just now coming to fruition.  So we're excited about that.  And we're excited about the ability to put a blinking light crosswalk as shown on this slide that would connect pedestrian traffic across the way.  So we're thankful actually to Don from the work training center for making that application to public works over a decade ago.  We're happy that it actually came to fruition as we literally were an escrow on the property.  So we're excited about that ability and look forward to different opportunities to help kind of maintain a safe,  a approach in terms of speeds on this on this roadway.  We have reached out to neighbors.  I know one of the letters that's in front of you is from Carlton Lolan.  Carlton is actually one of my neighbors as well.  I would say that most of the properties that are between my property and this property are owned by Carlton and his partner.  And so we hear and share his concerns about safety and security and feel that our plan and the management of this plan can really,  can really go.  A long ways to making sure that we're actually enhancing this environment from from the state in which it's at right now.  The other last part from my end and I'll turn it over to Laura,  but I think everybody needs to recognize that as we move the Jesus Center and the Sabbath House from the current location,  this gives us a great opportunity to change some of the programming,  the Jesus Center and the folks that I've been working with here for the last three years.  And so I think that's a great opportunity to recognize what they're doing well,  and they're going to take those activities and we've designed spaces for those activities to come with them.  But other things and Mike touched really briefly on this in the staff report.  Some of the things like drop in services for meals are not going to come with us.  So it helps us create a unique environment from an architectural standpoint,  where we don't necessarily have to address all of some of the problems that we might associate with the building.  So we don't necessarily have to address all of the problems that we might associate with the current Park Avenue site.  They're not going to they're not going to come along.  So I'll let Laura speak a little bit to the programmatic part of this facility.  And of course, I'm here if you have questions architecturally, but let's let Laura work through the program a little bit.  Thank you. Thank you. Thanks, Matt. Do we have questions for him?  All right. Who's our next applicant speaker?  So.  Thank you. Hi, everybody. I know many of you.  I'm Laura Kucsona. I'm the executive director here at the Jesus Center.  And I just have to say, as I sit here, I'm just feeling incredibly thankful to be in this place.  We've been in this community almost 20 years and to be a part of a project that could really change the face of not how only how we care for the poor,  but really some really important corridors through our community is just a thrill.  And I throw so much love into it.  And I want to thank the city of Fair Street,  which thanks to Matt Galloway and Tom DiGiovanni and Amber Abney Bass for their tireless work on this.  And Mike and his team, so many folks at the city have really pushed their shoulders into this from the BMX track all the way here to Fair Street.  We're thrilled about this plan. We think it fits both our individual needs for the Jesus Center,  as well as this vision that really grew because of the BMX site,  of creating a more expansive approach to wrapping around services to those in need.  And we are aware that the needs are growing in our community.  The campfire changed the face of the county and of the city.  And certainly COVID is doing its part to wreak some havoc as well.  So we have been able to put one of our biggest assets to work in this project,  which is flexibility and I think creativity to see if we can really build something that,  yes, will be an extension of what we've done before,  but really builds in our strengths and contributes to what the other providers,  the city and the county as well, are doing to address the issues.  So we're really letting the opportunity of these buildings that are standing on the east side  to offer us a new home for the core of our program,  which is our now one-story building.  We're going to be a 24-7 shelter for women and men.  We've only been able to serve men in the past,  and we've only been able to do that at night.  And so we will have day space for folks so they don't have to linger on the sidewalks and around.  They'll have interior and exterior space in what Matt and his team has designed.  And this is really critical to how it affects the neighbors and how it affects the participants,  because we believe that not everyone's going to be active  and always have a space to go to.  And so we want to protect that time where they need to stabilize  and get busy moving forward to live their best life.  And Shelly Watson, our program director, is recasting our day program around four pathways to health.  And so we can really help each individual move from their place of not functioning as well  and certainly from homelessness all the way back into productive citizenship.  So we're really excited about making some shifts.  We're using a slightly odd time of COVID to completely retool our team  and retool our approach to a trauma-informed model with a strengths-based approach,  which is really best practice.  And all the research we've done, we're pouring into this retrofit  because we know we're not going to do this for another 40 years.  So we want to make this opportunity the most we can.  And the other really amazing part of this is on the west side of Fair Street,  where the work training center was never really able to realize all of their aspirations for their full program,  with the help of so many incredible community members,  we'll be able to not only build this,  but we'll have a vision that will be responsive to the growing needs of our community.  And the county has been incredible from the very beginning.  And then of course, all the other shelter providers, all of us were on a call yesterday.  There was just such a unified vision around this renewal center,  really being able to wrap around some of the more difficult folks  who absolutely want to move forward in their life,  but they need extra care with a general shelter like the Torah shelter.  They do so much so well, but then some folks need more.  And we'll be able to wrap them around with substance use management,  and substance use management training will be able to help their mental health issues,  as well as the vocational life skills.  The only thing else I want to add in terms of this is really that we are developing that top floor to be shelter,  on the lower floor to be day services.  And like both Matt and Mike said, we really are preserving part of that for family shelter.  During and after the fire, the Torah shelter made the strategic decision,  to move the families out of the Torah shelter.  And they are now in Aurora North, which has been a very successful program for them.  But we know from the campfire recovery, which we are very active,  and just by what the folks who come here, that families are a huge demographic.  And yet they don't do well in a large congregate shelter, meaning lots of bunk beds in the room.  They need to preserve that family experience.  So we will be building micro units in here,  they will still be short term, but it makes that landing a little softer,  preserves the family, and those are very fragile times.  And so we are wrapping around services from the county, from the Butte County Office of Ed,  and other partners where that's really their specialty.  We are the host of the Renewal Center, but it will be a community-wide effort,  to be responsive to some of the more complex parts of the folks that are finding themselves there.  And we know that they are really struggling in our community.  So we are thrilled at this opportunity,  super eager to answer any of your questions,  and what I can't answer, Amber is here as well.  So, thank you.  Thank you, Barbara.  One last quick thing from my end.  Mike, you could scroll through.  There are a few other pictures that just provide some samples and images of what our vision is.  Obviously, these pictures on the east side are existing buildings that are going to undergo a facade renovation.  This image and the next image are visions for what's going to happen at the Renewal Center.  So, as you can see, it's definitely a pretty major upgrade to the neighborhood.  Wow.  This image here is an exhibit that shows maybe the possibility about how it might grow a little bit on the left side.  It gives us opportunity for additional 6,000 feet, actually, if we need it.  I might add as well,  that again, we're really working closely with our other providers  and trying to do our best to make sure that the whole continuum of offerings for the homeless are addressed.  And one of the things that we learned immediately after the fire is that we probably were not going to avoid being in the permanent housing business.  And I made a kind of casual promise at the City Council one night that we would ensure that the Park Avenue property would also be  retrofitted and hopefully bought by an affordable housing provider.  And in fact, we're about an inch away from closing escrow with Jamboree Housing Corporation,  who has the funding, tax credits, and the vouchers to build 59 units of affordable housing.  Okay, next we have Amber.  Have any baths?  Yes.  Good evening.  I'm here in a supportive role to answer any questions.  I don't have any prepared comments at this point.  Thank you, Mike.  Thanks, Amber.  Thanks, Laura.  Okay, next we have Tom DiGiovanni.  Same, actually.  Okay.  I'm going to unshare my screen and start working through the rest of the attendees.  Do we have any immediate comments we can also ask?  Questions of the applicant after the public speaks?  It looks like we've got about 12 or so people in the queue here, so we'll just start at the top and invite Don Taylor.  Don, would you like to address the Planning Commission on this item?  Yes, I would.  Take it away.  Three minutes, Don.  I'm hoping everybody can hear me okay.  Yep.  All right, thank you, Commissioners.  I just wanted to introduce myself.  My name is Don Taylor.  I work for the County Butte in the Department of Employment and Social Services.  And I oversee our Housing and Homeless Branch as the Housing and Homeless Administrator.  And just wanted to say that the county has several county departments that have enjoyed working and have a very collaborative working relationship with the Jesus Center and their staff.  These have included my department, Employment and Social Services.  Behavioral Health Department.  And as well as the Public Health Department.  We are very excited to see this community partner moving forward with plans for such a much needed services.  With the approval of the use permit application, we, the Department of Employment and Social Services, will move forward with our plans and our commitment to partner in providing services to the clients that are going to be served.  The additional 160 beds would extremely help narrow the gap.  And we are also looking forward to having a gap in emergency shelter resources for our unsheltered residents here within the city and within the county.  And I look forward to having county entities operating at the site.  So really excited about this.  Very well planned out.  And looking forward to continuing to foster and work that relationship with the Jesus Center and its staff.  Thank you very much.  And that's just what I had to say.  Thank you, Don.  Sorry.  What organization were you representing or you work with?  I'm with the County of Butte.  Okay.  And I work with the Department of Employment and Social Services as the housing and homeless administrator.  Good to know.  Thank you.  Okay.  Thank you.  Okay.  Next, we have Greg Webb.  Greg, would you like to address the Planning Commission on this item?  No, thank you.  Moving on, we have Brian Firth.  Brian, would you like to address the Planning Commission on this item?  Only if they have questions for me.  Hearing none, I guess we'll move on to Christy Hughes.  Christy, would you like to address the Planning Commission?  Christy, can you hear us?  Sounds like she's in the background.  Yes, I am.  Can you hear me?  Yes, we can hear you now.  Sorry about that.  My microphone is not working.  I had my laptop closed.  No, thank you.  I'm on the Jesus Center Board and I'm here just as support for the meeting.  Great.  Moving on, we have Jim Mathies.  Jim, would you like to address the Planning Commission on this item?  I am here in support.  I'm a board member of the Jesus Center, so I'm just here as a support.  Okay.  Next, Jenna Hill.  Jenna?  Gianna.  It's Gina.  It's Gina.  Sorry.  No, that's okay.  My name is Gina Hill.  I'm also on the board of the Jesus Center and I don't have any comments right now.  Okay.  Jennifer Lazdens.  My computer says you're not paying attention.  Can you hear us, Jennifer?  Sorry, that came out wrong, but it has a little indicator that somebody's not engaged.  Jody, I can't read your whole name.  Jody D.  Jody Drysdale.  Yes.  I'm also a board member of the Jesus Center Board.  I'm here to show my support and gratitude specifically to Tom and Matt and Laura and Amber and your leadership.  I'm thankful for the city's partnership in coming alongside this project.  Okay.  Thank you, Ms. Drysdale.  Shelly Watson, would you like to address the Planning Commission on this item?  Good evening.  I'm Shelly Watson.  I am an employee of the Jesus Center.  I'm actually the program director.  I've been on the front lines for 12 years and I am very much in support of this project.  Thanks, Shelly.  Robert Troush.  Robert, would you like to address the Planning Commission on this item?  Yes.  I'm Robert Troush.  I'm a founding member of CHAT and I'm just here to support the motion tonight and the  unbelievable collaborative way that the Jesus Center has worked with us with the community  and outreach to all of us and her willingness to help all the other organizations and the  community get together and see what the Jesus Center has accomplished.  It's just been amazing for us to be a part of that and we certainly are hoping that this  will pass this evening.  Thanks.  Okay.  Next we have Ann Powell.  Ann, would you like to address the Planning Commission on this item?  Yes.  We can hear you.  I just want to say that I am also a board member and I am so grateful for the support  that you have given to this project.  I am so excited and waiting for this to be built so we can give the people that sleep  on this street a place to sleep inside, either warm or cold, depending on when it is.  But I am very excited about this project.  Thank you for the nice presentations.  Thank you, Ms. Powell.  Larry Ruby.  Larry, would you like to address the Planning Commission on this item?  Yes.  Thank you.  We are not hearing from Larry, so we will move on.  Last speaker, Giovanni Tricera.  Would you like to address the Planning Commission on this item?  Giovanni?  Thank you.  I am also a member of the board of the Jesus Center.  I have been involved with the recovery efforts post-campfire.  And my goodness.  What a project.  And the leadership that this has taken to get to this point.  I fully support this proposal.  And I just can't think of anything better for our community than this project at this point.  Okay.  That rounds out our list.  Great.  Thanks, Mike, for going through the speakers.  Thank you to everybody who spoke.  Great to hear from you all.  So at this point, if there are any questions, please feel free to ask them.  If the applicant has anything they would like to clarify from what the public said, they can have a few minutes to do that.  I don't think we had many comments for them to clarify.  But might as well give you that opportunity.  To our panelists, you can unmute yourself if you would like to speak.  Also, the Planning Commission, we can ask you any questions.  I was just going to say, I don't think I could be any clearer than all the support I just heard there.  Which is absolutely amazing.  And it's a very gratifying feeling.  So I appreciate all the amazing support.  And, yeah, again, here for any questions that you might have regarding the boot thing.  And Laura can answer questions regarding programs.  Thank you, Matt.  All right.  So commissioners, do we have some questions for these applicants?  They seem very ready to answer them.  Yeah.  I have a couple questions.  One is about the occupancy numbers, I guess.  And I'm not sure, Laura, you might be best to answer them, I guess.  In the Sabbath House itself, what are we looking at in terms of capacity for the day program and the night program?  COVID versus hopefully one day post-COVID.  What are our numbers looking like?  Capacity.  So thanks for that question.  The capacity is the same for day and night.  There is no drop-in service in the new facility.  So the max is 60 beds.  Again, we do our sheltering in small rooms of four and five beds.  So sometimes we can figure that depending on, you know, the needs of the group.  But I think at this point we've been using 60 as our max number.  Don't slap my hand if we go to 65.  That range right in there.  And so that's the same.  And day numbers that we'll have.  And COVID, can COVID just go away and then I can answer that?  I don't have to answer the question.  It's less than that, obviously, with COVID.  It's very tricky currently to bring and the Torah Shelter and the Judah Center and Catalyst and Safe Space and CHAT, we've all had the same issues.  We're trying to juggle the need to bring people in off the street and make sure our staff are healthy.  We've been very fortunate, particularly with the county project room key, to be able to keep some of our most vulnerable housed through that state program.  So we'll see.  You know, obviously less than that, probably 20% if we open.  And we always open small anyway.  We'll be retooling our staffing approach.  So we really like to take our ramp up slowly anyway.  And so we'll always be open.  We'll always start at probably about 20% of capacity as a general rule in any new program that we start.  Okay.  And I have another question, too, really quick.  What are some of the services that are currently at the current Jesus Center site that will not be at the new site?  Meals, right, is one.  So meals are a funny thing.  Everyone who will be in residence will get food.  So we will still provide meals.  And then, you know, one of the things that we have seen in other communities is that we have a lot of food.  And one of the things that we have seen is that meals often have a central provider, but they may be distributed differently.  So rather than distribute through a common kitchen, and I'll tell you, our numbers have diminished quite significantly, not because of COVID, but over the years.  These people are all throughout the town and they're not coming to one site.  So a couple of models that we're playing with, one is to work with someone like Safe Space if they're able to open a 24-7 shelter to meet the contracted food providers.  That gives us, you know, we're able to stay in our competency, which turns out during COVID, doing 600 meals a day, we've gotten quite good at mass production of high-quality food at a reasonable price.  And it allows them to do what they're best at without having to deal with all the regulations around food production and deal with that.  So that's one model.  The other model that we're working on collaboratively, and Don can speak to this, too, is utilizing food as part of outreach.  We've always seen as food as an identity.  We all need a tractor.  Obviously, food is a good end to itself.  We all need it.  But it also is a way to draw people into services so that we can help them get more help.  We know, though, that the best option for people to stabilize and move forward in their life is to be sheltered.  So we are working collaboratively with all our providers to focus on getting people out of the elements and into shelter.  And so our food provision, albeit we will not have a drop-in kitchen like we have on Cook Avenue, it will, our hope and our plan is it will be accessible to the public.  And we hope that the response will be actually more significant than it is now.  So that's our goal.  And that is obviously the biggest.  The other things that we have been able to do which, of course, are all somewhat shuttered at the moment because of COVID is we have what we call the resource center.  And that is a day service option for resource and referral for computer use, telephones, and social work needs to connect people with resources in the community.  Okay.  So this is just a small example.  A variation of that will occur at the renewal center as well as for our residents.  And we use collectively now a lot.  We all use 211.  They have grown quite significantly as a resource and referral service since the fire.  And so our own staff calls 211 for questions.  So we are all, you know, we can get that at different folks can get that in different ways.  Probably the biggest challenge will actually be the mail service.  We provide hundreds of people an address to receive mail.  So we have begun conversations with Don Taylor, and right after the holiday, after Thanksgiving, when we settle back down again here, we will pick that back up and then probably look for other options.  I would say 80 to 90 percent of the mail received here at the Jesus Center for our folks is government mail.  So we're kind of hoping that maybe government might take back that opportunity to distribute the mail to the folks.  It's a very expensive thing to do, and it's a cumbersome process that just has grown kind of out of control.  So we will provide mail services to those in residency, but not for the general public.  Okay, thank you.  Yeah, this is Zach.  Sorry.  Making sure you can hear me.  Hi, Laura.  So I have a couple of questions related also to how your current program essentially will port, if you will, over to the new Sabbath House specifically.  And so one of the part of our packet is the attachment D, which is the expectations of guests.  And so I think that it becomes important as it relates to use permit.  Particularly as we envision potentially, and we'd all like to have this kind of problem, but other organizations, you know, coming to the city and having a program, having a plan, having the need or the desire to open a facility.  And they may have a very different, you know, vision that might include their own set of Sabbath, or sorry, of house expectations.  So my question is related to a couple of the specifics in what we...  We have as attachment D, which is the house expectations.  And it goes to really kind of the root of your program historically.  You are the Jesus Center.  And I'm quite familiar with the value of that.  So my question really has to do with specifically the requirement of Bible study and how that kind of requirement,  which is part of the...  I guess my first question is, do these expectations come with you?  I assume they do, but you can clarify what all the expectations of the new Sabbath house will be.  Will they be the same as the existing Jesus Center, the existing Sabbath house, or will they be altered in any way?  Yeah, thanks, Rich.  I think that's a really good question.  And I know Amber and Shelly worked quite extensively to slightly modify what we're currently using.  And with the full expectation that they will go through a full renovation as we move over,  particularly in light of our trauma-informed care retrofit.  So we know that those are going to be refined.  And specifically related to the Bible study requirement,  we have always offered opportunities for lots of different kinds of exploration.  And what we're calling our pathways now,  the pathway for salvation,  is the path of spiritual health,  and we're offering people the opportunity to look inside,  not just around,  to do that interior work.  And we feel that that's one mechanism.  We have never required that,  and we have all sorts of religious persuasions come into the Sabbath house.  We've never required anyone sign any paper,  agree to do anything,  read anything out loud,  pray out loud.  It's really a chance to gather and to hear words of hope,  to be able to say,  I'm going to be honest.  And we didn't remove that because that is our mechanism that we use that.  And one of the great aspects of having this two-fold physical plant is we can still,  under the Jesus Center banner, if you will,  we will freely and carefully and dignity forward do that.  But on the Renewal Center side,  we will be one of many collaborators.  And so those kinds of expectations will indeed more,  if I'm sure.  Amber, I don't know if you want to add anything else,  or Shelly,  who would need to be unmuted,  but on just how those expectations will probably change.  Can someone unmute Amber?  I think she's trying to.  Amber, did you have something to say?  Hi, thank you.  Yeah, I think the thing that I would just add to Laura is just echoing the fact that  those are not mandated.  Bible studies are offered.  We are not required to do that.  You know, particularly in our current facility,  one of the issues that we have is being able to keep people in a certain area together  for safety purposes.  And if anybody's been here over on Park Avenue,  you know that our building is a little bit of a Winchester mystery house.  And so that is another piece of it.  It's just keeping folks all together.  Again, it's the offering.  It's the idea of, you know, folks who want to opt into that.  We like to say people are required to be together,  but they're certainly not required to participate or anything like that.  So I just wanted to make that distinction for you guys as well.  And then I think that I got a couple of comments from Shelly,  but I think I pretty much summed that up for her as well.  Thank you.  Thank you for your answers.  And also thank you, Rich.  I was also going to bring that up because in the final page of our packet in attachment D,  it does say it is a requirement of all Sabbath House participants to attend the weekly service.  So we scheduled life skills classes and a weekly Bible study.  And it says in that paragraph,  failure to attend life skill class in the Bible study without prior permission to be absent may affect your stay in the Sabbath House.  And it does say without prior permission.  And it does say earlier in the packet that, I don't know, it's ambiguous.  To me, that's a concern for me.  Has anybody in your program been reprimanded?  Or even like not, I guess, has anybody been suspended from staying there because of not attending the Bible study portion?  I would like, yeah, I, Shelly would like to speak.  Is that possible?  Oh, yeah.  Sorry, Shelly, one of the board members.  Shelly's our program director.  Oh.  Yeah.  I mean, I think if that's, if she's the person who has the knowledge to clarify this, I'd be open to hearing her response.  Thank you.  Hi there.  Sorry I can't turn on my camera.  I'm having some difficulties tonight.  But I'm here and I'm listening to all your questions.  And I will say we, probably over a decade ago, maybe eight years ago, there actually were no life skills classes.  And one of the things I discovered is many people that came through the shelter that got housing actually would end up losing their housing.  And there was so much recidivism.  So we decided to take an hour a week to try to really help people and prep them and get them into housing so when they did get a key, they could keep the key.  And I felt compelled and that was really my part was to teach all I could to help them.  As for the Bible studies, I will say no.  Nobody has ever been asked to leave the shelter because they did not attend a Bible study.  Bible studies have not always been around in the evenings.  There are Bible studies in the mornings which are completely voluntary for the current guests that come there for breakfast.  And then we had one in the evenings and they did not have to participate.  They never had to pray.  They never had to read.  And going forward, I am pretty sure we're looking at doing something different.  Even a little different with the new program.  And the other thing is I'm a believer that although we're the Jesus Center, I believe in sharing the love of Jesus, not preaching to people.  And that's really my approach.  We don't give them scripture.  We don't tell them what you have to say or do.  We want them to discover their own spirituality on their own.  Does that answer your questions?  I think so.  Yeah.  Thank you for elaborating on that.  Yeah.  My concern is similar to Rich's.  I wanted to make sure that nobody is essentially being discriminated against for religious participation or preference.  And it sounds like it's optional.  And I would like to see that maybe more clear in the guidelines because there are parts that make it sound kind of scary if you don't participate.  And somebody who...  Who doesn't follow the same religion might feel that way.  Yeah.  We'll take another look at that.  And like Laura mentioned, we are creating this new pathways model which we will be offering more learning and more learning activities and life skills.  It will be a mixture between stuff for sobriety, stuff for your health, stuff to help with your economic stability, your mental health.  We're going to try to come up with everything.  Because as we know, not everybody needs the same thing.  And my goal is and always has been is try to get people to be the best version of themselves.  And so that they can stay in housing.  Well, thank you.  I've got some follow-up questions on that, too.  I was also concerned about a couple things really related.  The first thing I think, Chair Goldstein, that you had about the life skills Bible study requirement.  And it's pretty clearly stated.  And actually, I think I'd like to get the city attorney's opinion on this part.  Where it says, it's a requirement of all Sabbath house participants to attend weekly scheduled life skills classes and a weekly Bible study.  It's our desire to take this opportunity to share valuable resources, life lessons with you while you are staying at the Sabbath house.  Failure to attend the...  The life skills and Bible study without prior permission to be absent may affect your stay in Sabbath house.  If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to staff.  In your reading of that, how would you...  To me, I read that...  And first, my first question was...  And I'll come back in just a second.  My first question was, are they always combined or are they separate?  Is it a life skills Bible study class?  Or is it a life skills class and a separate Bible study class?  And if I could get an answer from the applicant, that'd be great.  They're separate.  They are separate.  And I just want to mention one other thing.  And it's probably something that was an old model.  We will offer Bible studies.  I want to be clear that we will.  But it will be an offering.  Again, it's the same thing in our houses.  We don't have studies, but we have seven houses under the Jesus Center.  Seven transitions.  So we always offer it.  But yeah, I'm open to what you guys want to suggest and how we might want to word that.  Okay.  And so, I mean, from a legal perspective, how would you look at that?  To me, that sounds like if you don't go to the Bible study, that there's a chance that you may be asked to leave.  Can I address that, Shirley?  I'm going to get, if you could hold on just a second.  I'm waiting for the city attorney's response.  Well, so we're talking about the program.  Yeah, the bottom part you've got marked up.  I mean, you are correct that it does say that not attending may affect your stay at the Sabbath House.  So that does say that attendance at both the weekly scheduled life skills classes and the weekly Bible study is mandatory.  The phrase, may affect your stay at the Sabbath House, imposes a lot of discretion on part of the organization on how they want to enforce that obligation.  Can you scratch down noise, please, if you all can mute?  Sorry.  And the other point that the applicant might clarify is to what extent they already have that discretion to remove folks from their facility.  It's possible that they are, you know, if they already have the discretion, you know, to remove them from the facility.  But if they are not willing to remove folks or to, you know, change the rules of their stay, then this may or may not, you know, matter as far as enforceability of that.  Right.  I think the difference that I saw between that, and there's plenty of examples in the program about being removed for being belligerent or being intoxicated and those types of things that violate the rules.  But this particular one rang a bell with me because it has religion as a basis for removal.  Or not.  Not being religious, I assume, or not wanting to go to something religious as a basis for removal.  So that's why I asked for your opinion.  Of course.  Did I clarify?  Sure.  I think it would be helpful, too, if this is a good time to really help you guys understand what we mean when we say life skills classes.  And just maybe give you some examples of that.  And it will better understand for you guys how those are actually two different, very separate classes for us.  So life skills are things like, you know, being a Christian.  You know, conflict management.  They are effective communication skills.  One of the classes that I personally teach here is the differences for folks between a stranger, acquaintances, and friends.  So it's really lessons that I think that what we find is that we typically work to address things that the majority of our population has grown up without having exposure to that type of information and education.  We have classes on finance.  Classes on nutrition.  We have other groups and organizations that come in and provide that type of support.  And we're hearing everything and the concerns and the questions.  I just wanted to reiterate that in our current building, we're really careful with that word attend.  Because for us right here and right now, what that means is coming downstairs, sharing a common space for safety concerns that everybody is there together.  So attend to us.  Really the spirit of that word for us in our current building.  And I think that's something that we need to be careful about in our current policies and expectations is about everybody is here, nobody is loitering in a different part of the building, or being unsupervised, and we're all in one space together.  So I just want to make sure that that's clear.  And, again, you know, we're excited about expanding staff and redesigning the program so that we have some alternatives.  But because of the constraints of our current building, that was the way in which we managed that.  Because safety is always our primary concern here.  hopefully that helps a little bit yeah i think it does amber my question is not so much about  the life skills class i think those i mean that sounds terrific but um it's if everybody has to  be together and i understand that part about being the safety part what about those people though  that do not want to for whatever reasons do the bible study and yet where do they go to leave the  group and still be safe and still be you know supervised yeah absolutely that's a great question  and i think right now our challenge is that we don't we don't have an answer to that in our  current facility uh in our new facility that'll definitely be part of our design and we will be  able to offer as shelly mentioned and laura it is on one of the one of those redesigned components  because we will be able to do things hopefully you know thankfully a little bit differently than  we've done now  yes  you !  so again i'm sorry to to drill into this but i i still am not totally clear if what i'm hearing is  that that programmatically currently it's actually optional and the intent would be that it continued  to be the bible study specifically continue to be optional and so it might be as simple as changing  this document to indicate that it's optional as opposed to it is a requirement so if that's really  the intent here and the way that it's being implemented i think that's a good question  some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some  because with the city issuing a use permit  for the use of this particular site,  that includes, obviously,  at least based on the information we have in front of us,  what the program actually is.  And when the city issues this use permit,  I want to make sure that the city and you,  as the applicant,  as the organization that's going to be doing this program  and operating this facility,  are, in essence, are protected from any sense,  from somebody from the public or from another organization  or something, that there be any fear that there is any...  Discrimination?  Yeah, thank you.  So that's why I'm drilling into this.  Discrimination.  Discrimination.  Sorry, thank you.  Yes.  Right.  So I think that we need to make sure that the city  and that we as commissioners, you as an organization,  in essence, have that protection or have that reassurance  and the community has that reassurance  so that the next organization that comes in  and has a program, that they are assured  that they'll be held to the same standards,  that they'll be allowed to have the same kinds of uses, etc.,  and so that we're being as fair and transparent as possible.  So I'm just offering that as a clarification.  It's not an attack on the program from my perspective  or anything like that.  It's just making sure that everybody is clear  on what the intent and, in this case,  what the actual program truly looks like.  So the next person that comes along and says,  wait a minute, what's going on over there?  We all know.  So I hope you understand the intent behind my  and probably others raising this with you.  Sure.  Sure.  Yeah, thanks, Rich.  And we're not doing it personally, if you will.  I think what we'd like you, we'll take that back to our,  this is part of our six-month goal,  is to revise all of these aspects of how we do business  and take another look at a lot of different ways.  And words matter.  And I will just tell you that as not a member  of the Satisfile staff in a programmatic way,  I have been incredibly impressed with the unified,  voice of our staff that is about inclusion,  that is about helping people find new health  and a path to stable housing.  And the reason we offer the spiritual component is we believe,  and that's part of who we are as an organization,  that spiritual health is part of a full life.  And we have a very wide tent for how that gets accomplished  for folks and people can say no thank you.  And dignity is at the,  at the core of who we believe Jesus is.  And we think that we need to respect,  and we do respect the freedom of every human to choose into that.  So I've routinely, particularly with Shelly,  Shelly precedes both me and Amber.  And she's about to get her master's in social work.  We have gone through fair housing training, LGBTQ training.  We are in a very inclusive environment.  And I appreciate you raising this.  And it does matter to us.  So we will continue to work on all those aspects.  Thanks, Laura.  I appreciate that.  I'd like to say something.  Hi, it's me, Lupita.  And I think this is a really great conversation.  And I agree with you, Laura, that part of the healing,  the component of spirituality is extremely important.  When you have, when people go to AA, it's a higher power.  And I think that the discomfort here is that it's very specific to,  you know, the way that the Christian faith.  And I think that, you know, Jesus, you know, had,  his house was inclusive of all faiths and, or no faith.  So I think that that's the discomfort here is that we don't,  you know, and I certainly believe very firmly, very strongly,  that people do need that healing component,  the spiritual component that brings  hope.  And light and clarity and grounding.  And so I support that, but I absolutely see the problem with the,  with this paragraph as well.  Yeah. Thank you.  I'd just like to comment too.  I think that those assurances are definitely reassuring, Laura.  I'm wondering how we're going to come to a conclusion tonight though,  because the program expectation part,  which is included as part of our packet,  we have to,  we have to approve that.  And unless you have the ability as director to change the wording on that,  I mean, this is,  that's something that,  that I'd have a hard time supporting the way it's written.  Yeah, that wouldn't be probably something I would choose to do in real time.  That's not really how we work as a team.  So if that's an expectation,  unfortunately I wouldn't be able to do that.  Can we put that as a condition of approval that the applicant will not require  residents to participate in the process?  I think some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some  written in a mandatory way and I'm thinking I'm hearing that that from everybody that it's really  an optional requirement and the program is still yet to be defined or refined or in fine-tuned so  to speak so I agree Bruce I think you could I mean it could be solved if we went addressing  bible study instead of saying scheduled life skills and a weekly bible study you could say  scheduled life skills and optional and separate bible study and that pretty much would take care  of it yeah or encouraged to attend bible studies I mean as long as it's not required yeah but  we're I would prefer to hear from the applicant really before we get a lot further in there if I  could just add I think there's a misunderstanding that that there's no conditions attached to the  resolution that require adherence to it  you ! so so so so so so  shelter  shelter  shelter  shelter  It's just information for the commission that this is the type of operation that has rules.  But what if we view those rules as discriminatory, Mike?  Then are we approving a use that is potentially discriminatory?  Potentially. I mean, if we had a use permit for a church, we wouldn't tell them what type of religion to espouse in that church.  True. But the permitting process for churches, I think, is different.  It's optional for people to go to church or not. Nobody forces you to go to church.  Nobody forces you to go to the homishop.  Nobody forces you to use the services here either.  But what I'm saying is the audience that will be there seeking services,  what if they are opposed to a particular religious study?  Yet we have evidence that it says that it's going to be...  Required.  In front of us.  And then the other thing I have a little question about is that, you know, I just want to make sure, number one,  that we're not approving something that's discriminatory.  And so that's why I've asked for the city attorney's opinion on this.  And then, I mean, the partnering agencies that you're going to partner with are awesome,  and they're all public agencies, and they're great.  I mean, I know folks that work for most of them, but I think that if they, you know,  if there were people...  People that had to attend Bible study and they were dismissed from the program if they did not go,  a lot of people that work for those agencies would probably have the same issues that I have with it.  Well, this is just the Sabbath rules, the Sabbath house rules on the east side of the street.  The renewal center would be a different type of shelter, and it would have different rules, presumably.  I guess we could ask the applicant if anybody has been expelled from Sabbath house at their current location.  She said no.  So they don't have any such requirements that they don't hold Bible study at their current location.  It doesn't seem like a place the planning commission needs to go.  I guess my final thing I would question is then why is it in front of us?  It's to illustrate the fact that they do have rules,  and they do ask people to perform in certain ways to be part of the program.  And I'll go back to my original point, which was,  I view those rules to be discriminatory,  potentially against people that have religious objections to doing those.  And yet we're granting them a use permit,  saying, in good faith, please carry this out.  I guess I would go back to the church example,  where we do require use permits for assembly churches,  and we consider the physical effects that they will have,  and we don't get into what type of religion they're talking about in the building.  Go ahead.  I would like to say that I heard Amber and Laura indicate that they would take a look at this.  The folks that are there, I think the length of time, six months, is that what I read?  Approximately six months.  From the street to a shelter.  Okay.  Okay.  They are, say, if, you know, worst case scenario,  so the worst case scenario is what we're talking about.  Worst case scenario, an atheist does not want to go to Bible study.  And what I'm hearing is that they wouldn't be required to go.  They wouldn't be forced to go.  They wouldn't be kicked out.  It hasn't happened yet.  And we've heightened it, and this is our community.  And I think it's, we so desperately need this sort of program,  and the building and the structure.  Personally, I feel very comfortable with the reassurance that Laura and Amber will be taking a look at this.  And I'm asking you to take a look at it, lighten it up, so we could have that wiggle room.  And it's that, you know, words are rigid.  And when we're reading something, there is no...  Your culture, this culture, if we were just to take this paragraph,  the culture is very rigid, and it's, you know, the nuns are coming in,  and they're slapping your head.  Slapping your head.  And so that is what we're trying to pull ourselves away from.  So...  Can I add something to that?  I appreciate that confidence.  We just, I just got confirmation from Shelly this afternoon  that we have scheduled an appointment with a Ph.D. specialist in this work from the university.  To work with our team and revising all sorts of our policies throughout our programming.  This will be one of the ones we look at.  My hesitation and my resistance to making a change in real time, like I said, as a leader,  this isn't something that I would do to my team to change that in real time.  And that's just a show of respect for my team and my board.  But that does not mean we won't consider it.  We totally hear what you're saying.  And I want to just underline what Amber said.  One of the huge reasons we began looking for a new facility four and a half years ago.  We started in the spring of 16.  And the reason was because the programming complexity that we want to offer, we cannot offer here.  This is a fantastic example.  First of all, you're not going to put 60 people in any one room in any space in this new expanded shelter.  So there will be options.  There will be different kinds of facilitators.  Even now, when we say we offer Bible study,  you might as well go get your degree in religious studies,  because every single person who leads it has a different version of how they do that work.  And we do that on purpose because we want to offer opportunities for folks to go in a way that works for them.  So I hear you and you have my word.  And I'm appreciative of the interest that we would not be an organization authorized by the city to be discriminatory.  Not on my watch.  I give you my word.  Well, I think I appreciate that, Laura.  Thank you.  And I do believe that that would happen.  But when you leave us tonight after the vote,  we have no control over what you do or do not change on the wording at all.  Right.  So we have to look what's in front of us tonight.  And I think we've already, I mean, I think I've already heard that people are concerned about the language,  the possible discrimination.  That could occur there.  And so other than that, I think the program is incredible and it's completely needed.  And yes, I'm totally for your move.  And, you know, opening the property up on Park Avenue,  I know it fits with the long-term homelessness plans for the city.  It's this one part that is really troubling to me.  And so I don't know what to do in terms of voting,  because, you know,  like I say, when we, after we vote on it tonight, that's it.  We don't have any say over the language.  We can't come back and say, did you change that yet?  And you say, no, we didn't do it.  And then pull your use permit.  We don't have that ability to do that.  Can I just add one thing?  And I think Mike said it in his report.  But I think we did this as a team to put this application together.  And we were under the impression that you wanted to see a sample of what we had done.  And we knew that language was in there.  We weren't surprised to hear that it's problematic.  It's not perfect.  And it does need revision.  And we didn't do that revision in advance of this because that wasn't what was asked of us.  We were asked for a sample of what is being done now.  Like I said, we are changing everything.  So, you know, particularly to be inviting and dignity forward.  And so I understand your concern.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I appreciate you speaking so much to this because, as I've said, I feel the same way.  If this was an apartment complex or something else similar that had a rule like this, like a rule book,  and it would be very uncomfortable to approve it and not be 100% sure that that rule would be changed to be more lenient when the project is approved.  So it's a tough situation.  I don't necessarily know if we have, you know, the ability to change what that says.  And I do believe that.  What you say that you haven't kicked anyone out because they didn't go to Bible study.  It's tough for the same reasons you're saying.  Like the project is great and super necessary.  It's just really tough to approve something without changing a thing that to me I wouldn't feel comfortable if I went to something that was I felt would be discriminatory towards whatever my faith is that I.  I.  I don't believe in and if I didn't want to attend a certain type of Bible study and was kind of living in fear that I might get kicked out.  Yeah, I'm rambling now, but you get it.  You've heard all of us say it, so I'm not sure how's best to proceed with that.  And I appreciate you all answering the questions and talking with us about it.  Well, I wouldn't want to hold up a project that's got so many different community stakeholders all in agreement.  We know that this is a project that we're going to be doing.  We know that this is a legal issue.  Now that they're aware of it, I have every confidence that they're going to fix it as soon as possible because they don't want to be open to lawsuits or litigation.  So I have every confidence they're going to fix this.  And I don't have any qualms about voting for the project tonight because, I mean, we've seen legal cases over the years.  This is clearly problematic.  It invites legal activity at some point.  They're going to fix it.  So I trust them.  Do you want to talk?  Actually, this might be a question for staff, but anyone from the applicant could maybe respond, too.  If the intent is to, as part of the program going forward, is to rework, and this is just an example that wasn't intended to represent the current program,  let alone what may happen in the future, what would happen if we didn't approve the use permit tonight pending the work on what the program that we're actually really going to be approving is?  My question is how much of a delay would that represent?  And so maybe staff could address that.  And then the related question would be probably for the applicant would be what kind of hardship would that be?  And then the related question would be what kind of hardship would that potential delay that staff may be able to tell us about would have in terms of being able to move forward with where you are with the project and aligning all the pieces that you need to align?  Because we all are in agreement that we want to see this project go forward.  So that might be a hard one to ask because you don't have control over the kind of change that the applicant is saying is likely to occur.  But I think in this instance we have enough understanding of the concern to be able to move forward.  And so I'm going to address it with a condition.  And I have two versions of a condition.  And I like Ryan's better.  So I'm going to suggest that we consider, the Planning Commission consider a condition of approval that would state something to the effect of prior to commencement of the use, the applicant shall revise the program expectations to provide non-denominational alternatives to the Bible study program.  I like it.  With their new site plan.  Right direction.  With their new site plan.  Right direction.  Which I didn't include in the presentation because it's too small to read anything on it.  But they have more space.  They will have more space.  That's part of why they're pursuing this larger location.  And in the group lounge areas, there's also little antechambers for like computer labs and stuff like that.  So there will be alternatives right there that will give some people privacy if they want to seek privacy during these times.  So I would recommend that the Commission consider adding a condition.  That would address the concern.  Yeah.  I think adding a, that's perfect, condition would be great.  The wording I think we could maybe tailor.  I wasn't sure about the alternatives.  I guess you might have to reread it if you want.  Did you say you had two versions of it?  Of your recommended condition or?  Yeah.  Would you like for me to reread it?  Yeah.  That would be great.  It would say prior to the commencement, prior to commencement of the use.  The applicant shall revise program expectations to provide a non-denominational alternative to the Bible study program.  Okay.  And did you say you had a second version of it or did I mishear that?  I did.  It was my first thought.  It just would say that the applicant shall not discriminate against program participants based on religious preference and shall provide alternatives for participants who desire not to participate in any specific group religious activities.  And would the other language be struck then in the?  The current, the way that it's currently written or would that still continue through?  It would just be a performance standard that we would seek their revised version of their, we wouldn't revise their language.  They would revise their language and present it to us and we would determine whether it met the condition imposed by the commission.  And I do think that that's important because I don't think it's our role to create, you know, the applicant's program.  Right.  In fact, that's way outside of our role.  So they need to be the ones that drive their program and we need to respect that.  Yep.  And so I really want to go back to the only thing that we need to be careful is that we're protecting the city and ultimately perhaps the applicant from either their perception or the reality of, right.  So I think that, I don't think it's appropriate for us to make a use per, you know,  a condition very prescriptive in language for what their program is going to look like.  That's not our job.  Thank you.  And so I think that we need to allow them to do that and they have the right to make that as long as it, you know, is legal, which I know that they have the ability to do.  But, you know, they have the right to write their own language on that.  So I wouldn't want our condition to be that prescriptive.  But I think that's the right thing to do.  And I think that we may want to, and this is why I was asking about a delay, we may need the use permit to reflect what the actual program is because we're being told that it's not what is in front of us.  So I go back to my question about the hardship around if we were to, I guess it wouldn't be deny the use permit, but would be to ask the applicant.  Continuance.  Continuance, right.  Yeah, continuance.  And so I go back.  What kind of hardship would that create for staff or for the applicant?  I actually know the answer to that question.  They have submitted for building permits to do the facade remodel and it would, I'm pretty sure, be extremely concerning to them to have a delay at this point because they need to vacate their current site so that we can build the new apartments there.  And they will need a place to go come March.  And there's a lot of work to do.  So I would like to piggyback on Commissioner Ober's comments.  I agree with you 100%.  That we shouldn't be writing their policies.  I think that if we're going to put a condition, I think that's a very wise idea because I would like to approve this tonight.  Some sort of condition that they would not make a Christian Bible study mandatory or not be discriminatory.  Something very open so then when Laura gets back with her board that they can figure out how to language that particular policy.  So that's what I would suggest in order for us to move forward.  To put a condition, the condition being broad, just to assure that there is no discrimination against non-Bible readers or people that are interested in any sort of Bible study.  But just to avoid any sort of discrimination.  Religious discrimination.  Yeah.  I agree with those points that we should have a pretty broad policy.  I think that's a pretty broad condition that just gets across the point that we want to make sure there's no discrimination but not tell them how to write it.  Yep.  I agree.  Sounds great.  Madam Chair, I'd like to get the applicants' idea and feel, get their perspective on how they feel about that condition.  Good idea.  If they would be amenable to something like that.  We don't, I don't, it's their operation.  And this is a form of kind of managing their.  Their operations.  So I think it'd be helpful to hear if this was workable from their standpoint.  Yeah.  Laura, would your team.  Yeah.  Thank you.  I appreciate that.  I appreciate you guys really working hard to help us through this.  I also particularly appreciate the concern about timing.  Mike is spot on.  I think it was Mike who said it, that this building is due to come down.  And we really don't want to render ourselves homeless.  So.  I think some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some  So that just feels like a big precedent and probably would limit us to put much in writing at all.  I mean, any of us.  And I would hate to strap my predecessors, successors, with such a specific thing that this is the program manual for everything that's ever going to happen in this building.  So that's another reason why I would, if there's a real revision that's a requirement for moving forward, we're going to have to look hard at that.  But it seems like you're possibly moving in a different direction, and I wouldn't mind hearing the agreed-upon language just to get one more take at it.  Yeah?  Could you read it one more time?  Yeah.  Which one, the first one or the second one?  I guess both to compare them.  Okay.  Two versions.  First, prior to commencement of the use, the applicant shall revise the program expectations to provide non-denominational alternatives.  Alternatives to the Bible study program.  Second one, the applicant shall not discriminate against program participants based on religious preference and shall provide alternatives for participants who desire not to participate in any specific group religious activities.  So I'm not comfortable with the first one because it goes back to the idea that we're actually writing their program.  So I appreciate the intent of that.  Because you're really trying to capture what this discussion is all about.  So I appreciate that.  But I think it does, unfortunately, cross the line and rights their program.  The second one, I think, gets at the heart of it.  And in a way, I support it.  And I think perhaps the applicant would, too.  But in a way, it doesn't even really need to be said.  Right?  Because if any organization has in their program something that crosses the line.  Into illegal discrimination.  Then they're putting themselves at jeopardy.  And so clearly they would not want to do that.  But I don't know if the applicant will be comfortable with it or not.  But the first half of the second one that simply says a condition is that the use permit is conditioned on the program not discriminating, if I understood.  And if it ends there.  Then I think we've captured.  The spirit of what we're trying to.  This dialogue.  And I really appreciate that it is a conversation.  I think it captures the spirit of that.  It captures the intent of the commission.  But it continues to allow the applicant to create their own program.  And not have us do that for them.  So I don't know if the rest of the commission agrees with that or not.  I agree with you.  I think that's great.  But that might.  Be a way.  And again, we are in dialogue.  Which is a little bit unusual.  But it's working well.  And I'm okay with it.  But we could continue to find out whether Laura and the organization is comfortable with that or not.  What about there'll just be no religious test for denial or acceptance of services?  That covers it both ways all over.  Sounds kind of more specific than what we were.  I mean.  Again.  There'll be no religious test.  The spirit of.  For acceptance.  Or denial of services.  I liked kind of the beginning of Mike's second proposed condition.  I forget exactly.  But basically saying there's no discrimination.  But yeah.  I think limiting it to just kind of that sentence would leave out kind of the intent of why we're saying that.  Of like.  Basically that the applicant will revise their rules.  I don't.  I don't.  I don't.  I don't.  I don't.  I don't.  I don't.  I don't.  I don't.  I don't.  I don't.  I don't. so  I don't. [inaudible]  I don't.  I don't. so so so  so so so so  and educate folks that were coming into the Sabbath House what they can be expected to be protected from.  And that last item says you have the right to be free from discrimination based on ethnic group identification,  religion, age, sex, color, or disability.  So I'm hoping that, and I understand the consternation around the word attend,  but I think that this really effectively shows what our spirit is.  And our spirit is absolutely to let all people know that come here that they do have a right to come in,  to engage, and to be able to do that free from discrimination, in this case, particularly from religion,  which I'm hearing is your guys' primary concern.  So I'm wondering if that's helpful.  Thank you.  I've got to mention, I mean, in the same breath, though, at that last statement on life skills and Bible study,  it says they can be removed from the program for not going.  Bible study.  Sure.  And I think the intent of that, again, is to say, hey, where are you?  There is an expectation after check-in time.  We do have a check-in time for the safety and security of our facility.  And honestly, primarily embedded in a residential neighborhood,  it's very important to us that we know where folks are.  And so that prior approval could be something like maybe someone's on an overnight,  maybe somebody's ill and staying back.  I mean, currently.  Currently, those are some of the reasons that that language is effective for us in our current facility.  But that's the spirit in which those were written.  So could there also be a, as part of that written pre-permission not to go,  religious objection at the intake?  I will assure you that we have a variety of spiritual preferences for the women and children  that have come through the Sabbath House now.  I don't exclude them.  I'm just saying that that's our current experience.  And we have that.  We have all denominations, all beliefs.  As Laura mentioned, we have a variety of folks who come in both downstairs during the breakfast Bible study,  also offering to the women who are staying in Sabbath House.  So absolutely.  Absolutely.  I mean, I don't even think all of us on this call here could agree in terms of spirituality and what our beliefs are.  But one of the great things about our beliefs is that we're open to all of those things.  We think that that spirituality compiles.  We think that that component is important for everyone to develop in a manner in which they're comfortable.  So I know I feel like we just keep saying the same things, but I just really do want you guys to know that this is absolutely something that is important to us.  But somebody can opt out when they do their intake?  Yes.  Okay, thank you.  Cool.  I'm thinking we should probably wrap up the public hearing and discussion portion of the meeting?  Okay.  Unless we have more questions for the applicant?  Okay.  Okay, well, thank you so much to the applicants  and to everyone else who spoke.  Very good discussions.  So closing the public hearing  and moving into just internal commission discussion,  how should we proceed here?  I'm open to, well, I guess I still feel  that it would be a good idea to have a broad condition  that basically just says that those community rules  will be rewritten.  But I also, I don't feel like that's a hill I'll die on  if we don't do that.  I think I share the same concern  that I think Lupe and Rich did  about not wanting to set that,  we're not policy setters for their organization.  You know, my only concern is that  something we're approving is not discriminatory.  That's my only concern.  And so, and to me, I mean,  it's one of the things that's right in front of us  to me appears to be discriminatory.  So we have to have an additional condition  to fix that in my view.  Yeah, I would tend to agree with that.  When I first read through this project,  I was like, this is great and awesome.  And then I read the does not discriminate against  paired with the, you know,  could be removed if I don't attend Bible studies thing.  And I was like, this just,  seems like it could lead to discrimination.  And I would like to at least just make sure  that we're not setting a precedent  that you can have a rule like that  if you're a different applicant.  I wouldn't want anybody to bring something here  that basically says like,  you have to go to Bible study  or you have to do something to live here.  That's generally considered discrimination.  I would just like to make it really clear  that we're not discriminatory.  We're not doing that.  But I also trust that you all,  that that's not the intention.  And I respect you.  Well, then let's trust them to fix it.  Let's pass this and be done with it.  Look, they're not going to leave themselves open  to legal liability.  I mean, I think we've made this abundantly clear.  There's a big hole.  There's a problem there.  Intimately aware of it.  These are documents that they provide  as examples of their current practices.  They're in the process of transitioning  to new facilities, creating new procedures.  And I trust that they're going to do that.  I mean, the type of people  that do these types of organizations  are not the type of people  that are looking to, you know,  squeeze through on some legal technicality.  They want to do it right.  And I trust that they're going to.  So with that said,  I'm going to make the motion  that we approve Resolution 20-15,  approving the use permit 20-07,  subject to the conditions set forth therein.  And on the conditions of approval  that we had in number eight  that was referenced in the Chico City Memorandum,  which is the applicant shall advise program participants  that they're going to be able to do that.  Thank you.  I thank you.  I think you can make it.  I don't know my procedure well.  I'd like to make a substitute motion.  And my substitute motion would be  that we include, Mike,  the first sentence from the second one  that you had.  Could you read that back to us though  really quick?  The applicant shall not discriminate against program participants based on religious preference.  Yes, I would like to include that into a motion that Kent made.  I would accept that as a friendly amendment.  Okay, can we do that instead of substitute motion then?  He didn't have a second, so I'll second.  Okay, cool. Motion and a second.  And then I'll accept the friendly amendment.  There you go.  I guess I shouldn't say substitute motion.  I guess it would be a friendly amendment technically.  Yes.  I was just going to clarify procedurally that that's what we just did.  Yeah, friendly amendment.  So it is Kent's motion with the friendly amendment of adding a condition number nine as read by Mike, seconded by Lupe.  I think the parliamentarian, I think I should have accepted a second on you first before the amendment.  But I think before.  You got it now.  I think we should all do a parliamentary procedure training.  I've forgotten it all.  It's been a few years.  No doubt.  All right.  So we do have our motion and second, including that.  So can we repeat the motion, please?  Sure.  So since I made the motion, the motion is to approve Planning Commission adopt resolution 20-15, approving use permit 20-07, subject to the conditions.  Assigned.  And then on the conditions of approval, first add a number eight that reflects the City of Chico memorandum information that we were given that I read.  And then that there would be a condition nine that says, hit it, John.  Hit it, Mike.  The applicant shall not discriminate against program participants based on religious preference.  Yep.  Works for me.  Okay.  That's the motion.  Thank you.  Okay.  And just a quick comment that I fully support this motion and support this project.  And I just want to express my appreciation to everybody from the applicant, from the Jesus Center, who's been participating and been willing to engage in a very open and receptive way to this.  And we'll just say again.  I hope that the spirit of the reason that we felt the need to have this conversation is truly based on wanting to make sure that we all are protected from any perception or actual discrimination.  And so I really greatly appreciate the fact that we were able to actually have a conversation around this.  And I hope that we all feel like we reached a place that we're comfortable with.  And then really...  And I think that the opportunity also allows this project that we all do very much support and want to see happen move forward.  And so I'm just expressing my gratitude to you all for engaging with us and having some patience as we work through this.  Thank you, Rich.  Well said.  Yeah.  Thanks to the applicants and to staff.  Everyone for having a really good conversation about this.  I'm glad that we can express these concerns in a positive way.  And I think that's a really positive, constructive way towards getting to a common goal.  And it's a good thing because we do need projects like this to help get people off the streets.  All right.  I agree.  Thank you very much.  All the questions?  All right.  All in favor, please say aye.  Aye.  Any opposed?  Any abstentions?  Motion passes.  Congratulations.  Thank you.  Okay.  So that's the end of item.  Four.  On the item five, the regular agenda, it says none.  Item six, reports and communications.  So reports and communications.  Anything?  Here, I don't have it.  We don't have any announcements.  Just to let you know that we'll need to cancel the next coming meeting the December 8th, I believe.  Okay.  That's good to know.  Yeah, December 3rd.  Sorry.  Okay.  And do you think we'd meet in mid-December or more in January?  It's too early to tell at this point.  Good to know.  And earlier, Matt told us about the park opening and cool things that were happening.  So thanks for that.  Yeah.  And we can move on to adjournment then if there's no more reports and communication.  So we'll meet again in a month or so.  Have a great night.  Thanks.  Thank you.  Good work everybody.
