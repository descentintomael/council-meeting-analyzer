 Yeah, that's fine. If you go grab it, that'd be great. Yeah. Can you tell me? Hi. There's some right there. There's some right in the. Oh. There's some on the floor right there in that box. Oh. Okay. I'm sitting back here. No. Yeah, I definitely know some of you. Okay. Bryce, can you turn on your microphone and speak again? Sure. I'm speaking. Is that audible? Yeah. Cool. I just got some feedback. Can you turn on your mic? Oh, good to know. Thank you. You have everything turned up. I just turned on my mic and I can hear. Turn that off. I'm going to try to get it turned on. Just go find the mic. If it says start first, you have to turn it down and avoid the feedback. Start first with the program audio, counsel, and guidance. I know I'm not very pertinent. I know I'm not very pertinent. I know I'm not very pertinent. I know I'm not very pertinent. I know I'm not very pertinent. I know I'm not very pertinent. I know I'm not very pertinent. Oh, what language is this on our screen? Just kidding. Oh, okay. Oh, awesome. Okay, everybody settled in? Calling to order the Planning Commission meeting, special meeting of Thursday, February 11, 2021. And due to protocols established for COVID-19 community response, we're holding the hearing in a virtual format. So hopefully we have some folks joining us online through WebEx. And if you're participating through WebEx, I think staff or I will go over how to participate. Should we do that now or once we get to those parts? Probably at the start of the public hearing would be best. That sounds good. Let me just, if I may continue, the reason why my microphone is turned up so high is because our microphones are very quiet in the Zoom. We switched from WebEx to Zoom. And we're still kind of working on that. We're not the bugs. Okay. Appreciate the explanation, Mike. All right. Item one, call to order. 1.1, pledge of allegiance to the flag. So please stand and pledge and salute. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. All right. Now for the roll call. Can we please have a roll call? Let's have the roll call. Okay. Commissioner Deremedy? Here. Commissioner Scott? Go ahead. Commissioner Rensick? Present. Commissioner Ober? Here. Commissioner Howlett? Here. Vice Chair Arumal? Present. Chair Goldstein? Here. All right. Thank you. Item two is the consent agenda. It looks like all we have on the consent agenda is the approval of minutes for November 19, 2020. Do we have discussion or a motion to approve the minutes? I'll have to go ahead and move to approve the minutes. I'll second. All right. Then all in favor of approving the minutes please say aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Any opposed? Any abstentions? Aye. All right. Abstention. Great. The motion passes. Minutes are approved. Item three, business from the floor. Members of the public may address the Commission at this time on any matter not already listed on the agenda with comments being limited to three minutes. The Commission cannot take any action. Nobody at this meeting at this meeting on request made under this section of the agenda. So do we have any people in the WebEx who appear like they're here for the business from the floor? And if you are here in the WebEx, you can enter in the chat if you want to speak. Actually, Madam chair, there is an updated agenda that I don't think made its way to you. This being a special meeting, there is no business from the floor at a special meeting. Really? Okay. So we should have struck that out of the original. Okay. Yeah, that would have been good to know. So no business from the floor then. Sorry if anybody is here for business from the floor. Not sure what you'd do if that. Yeah, Madam Chair, just as Mike indicated, the online version of the agenda does have that notation. So we didn't switch out. We didn't deliver yours with that, but the online one does note that. Okay. Well, then on to item four, public hearings. I believe we just have one item for public hearings tonight, and that's the special item that we're here for on an off Thursday, 4.1, Development Agreement 18-01. Would you like to take it away? Yes. Thank you, Madam Chair, and thank you to all the planning commissioners for making it here tonight for this special meeting. Item 4.1 is a development agreement proposed between the City of Chico and JP Real Estate Investments LLC, also known as Courtesy Automotive Center, represented by Jerry Paju, who we'll hear from later this evening. First, I'll go a little bit about the project site and the project itself before speaking to the development agreement before us this evening. The project site is located on the east side of Garner Lane between Esplanade and Highway 99 at the far northern end of the City of Chico. It also borders 3-7's Lane, which is a private street. The site's zoned a combination of CC Community Commercial along the freeway, and then where it exists along the Esplanade and 3-7's Court is zoned ML Light Manufacturing. And also featured on this slide is the green line. It shows how to the west, on the west side of the Esplanade, extending west, The green line is the last word is county ag lands that the city and county have observed this green line for many decades now, and we don't have any intention of breaking it. So the project site, a little bit about the design, being abutting the green line over where the Esplanade is with the manufacturing type zoning and the commercial along the freeway, the site is laying out more or less consistent with that zoning, where you have four dealership buildings each containing two brands of vehicle. On the far left of the series of four buildings is a pre-owned car dealership and those would be oriented toward the freeway and have a very freeway oriented appearance for the car dealership and then there's a 50,000 square foot building back on the site. It's a collision center and repair building and that's more appropriate for the manufacturing side of the operation and orienting the whole project this way toward highway 99 and away from the green line is also consistent with general plan policies that are aimed at preserving that green line. Here's a picture of what a couple of those buildings would look like. Actually this is one building one side would be Volvo the other side would be Subaru and there's two other buildings that would also have two dealerships with within them. So the projects once once the applicant courtesy found their site it was it was in the county and they developed plans and requested general plan amendment specific plan amendment the county has a specific plan up at this north end of Chico and a rezone all to change the underlying zoning for the site so that it would be consistent with what would allow the car auto dealership. Then a year later in 2017 the county adopted an initial study mitigated negative declaration to cover the environmental review component of building the automotive center and then they approved their plan amendments which paved the way so to speak for courtesy to move forward with their project. However the city saw that courtesy motors was about to I'm sorry courtesy automotive center was about to be constructed out in the county and we petitioned for annexation in that area and that was approved in twenty seventeen later that year which is a very fast pace for annexation to go through the process and become part of the city that all happened before the applicant was able to obtain building permits from the county which would have locked them into building the project under those county regulations that they had designed the project form in twenty eighteen after the annexation place, the developer came to the city saying, hey, I have these plans. I would like to build the same auto center. And from city staff perspective, it wasn't the city's intent to disrupt construction of the project, but only to definitely have operation of the project in city jurisdiction. So that led to this development agreement we're talking about this evening. Thank you. And over the course of time, while we were negotiating the development agreement, Courtesy did realize they're under the city's rules now, and part of that entails going through design review. So we took them to the board in September. Maybe it was October of last year, and the board was very complimentary of the design and approved the buildings and site layout. But it left the... The matter of the public improvements. And that's what the development agreement is all about. It would allow Courtesy to initially develop the site to the county road improvement standards that they have plans for. But it would require Courtesy to upgrade those frontage improvements along Garner Lane and the Esplanade to city standards, which means initially you would have an asphalt dike on the side of the road and sort of a ditch situation along the edge of the road. And then you would have a lot of road improvements that would require Courtesy to upgrade those the edge of the road. And then the car dealership would be behind that. And in the future with city improvements, it would have curb gutter sidewalk drainage, storm drains underneath the ground, and all those improvements at a later date. There is an awful lot of frontage associated with this particular project. That's also part of the reason why we're here. We took a look at what the county did, because the way the applicant feels, they really did a lot of investment and work with the county, and the county took a really hard look at their project. They didn't just assume that they were going to be able to get a lot of road improvements. They were going to change a couple of plans, but they were assuming that they were doing so to build this auto dealership. So they did a thorough analysis in their initial study, and they adopted and mitigated negative declaration to support their plan amendments. And as far as staff is concerned, that's very close to what we would have done if we were looking at this project anew, and it was on an 11-acre site, so we would have to do an initial study. And they identified mitigation measures to an important one for us. So the first one is to upgrade, and for the community in general and even the county people north, is to upgrade the intersection of Garner Lane at Highway 99. Right now, people are limited in the turning movements they have as they approach Highway 99. And people that all want to turn left just want to turn left. And so the improvements would flare out those intersections a little bit so that everybody would be able to get through that intersection a little bit more efficiently. So that's an important part of the project. And that's part of the mitigation that we would propose to inherit from the county and use here. Then to assure that we would get the improvements in the 20 years or by the deadlines established in the DA, we would have the city would record liens on the property, which would give us the ability to really play hardball down the road if we needed to. Nobody expects that to happen, but it would be there as an assurance. And then there's a couple of minor things that the county was going to allow. It was going to allow the city to have a lot of land in the area, but it was going to allow that land in the area. So that was very pertinent to the city. I think that was very pertinent to the city. I think that was very pertinent to the city. I think that was very pertinent to the city. I think that was very pertinent to the city. I think that was very pertinent to the city. and you know disrupting those plans if they've already made significant progress with the county. It's we found that it's consistent with the general plan and the goals specifically that speak to economic development and maintaining that. It wouldn't result in a lot of infrastructure being constructed in this particular area which is about a half mile north of Shasta Elementary School which is kind of the closest place where you can find decent amounts of sidewalk and stuff that would connect you into other parts of the city. So instead of having this island of infrastructure out there at the north end of town it would forestall that and for a future date and if other properties around it were all developed with city standards that kicks in one of the triggers for courtesy to have to upgrade their improvements sooner than the 20-year deadline established as the last deadline possible. And it would also retain an important sales tax generator within city limits. That's why we went after annexation and that is part of the goal of moving forward with this development agreement. So to conclude staff recommends adoption of the resolution in your packets which would recommend it would be a planning commission recommendation to city council to enter this development agreement to find that the project is within the scope of the environmental review that the county adopted and we would apply that to the development agreement. So that's the first step. The second step is to find the project and to apply those mitigation measures and to for the council to approve development agreement 1801. And I'll be happy to field any questions you have. Thank you Mike. Questions for staff? I just have a point of clarification. Is the developmental agreement is it I was when I was reading it I was thinking is this similar to like a memorandum of understanding? Is it a legal document or is it a memorandum of understanding? Is it a legal document or is it a memorandum of understanding? Is it a law that pertains to the development of a piece of property? Or is it a law that pertains to the development of a piece of property? Or is it a law that pertains to the development of a piece of property? Or is it a law that pertains to the development of a piece of property? Or is it a law that pertains to the development of a piece of property? Or is it a law that pertains to the development of a piece of property? Or is it a law that pertains to the development of a piece of property? Or is it a law that pertains to the development of a piece of property? Or is it a law that pertains to the development of a piece of property? Or is it a law that pertains to the development of a piece of property? Or is it a law that pertains to the development of a piece of property? Or is it a law that pertains to the development Yeah, no, and the development agreement predicts that it may, it itself may be amended from time to time through mutual agreement and stuff like that as other circumstances arise. Cool. I also want to comment that I really appreciate you starting off the conversation by talking about the green line. That was really great. Thank you. I got one more question, Mike. The development of which parcels would trigger the improvements to city standards? Are there any that you foresee in the near future? Well, they're listed in the development agreement, and those are the three CC properties you see across the street on Garner, and the additional property that's within the city limits. So, those are the three CC properties that are listed across the street on 3-7's Lane. Tony, you were next. Okay. So, just a couple questions. One on the green line, Mike. I'm pretty sure, and you can correct me, but the county ag buffer is 300 feet, and the city's is 100, correct? That's correct. So, which one are we using for this site? I don't know that we're using either one. I thought it was a residential buffer that you're talking about. Okay. So, we don't have a commercial? However, I think it meets a 300-foot distance from the nearest orchard. I guess I shouldn't say that. I don't know that for a fact, but it's not right near a bunch of active orchards. There are orchards on the west side. Okay. But it's not like across the street. And basically, when you go across, the distances can be deceiving on this map because they're large properties. Esplanade's close to 100 feet wide. It's at least 82 feet wide. I thought there was a commercial buffer, but there's not. You're saying... I guess I don't know, but there is no significant conflict between this project and the properties to the west. The county was prepared to adopt it, and I haven't brushed up on that particular section. I don't know if it's in the analysis. Okay. To see how it compared to that. Okay. But the county was approving this project, and they found it consistent with their plans. So, I'm in the belief that there are no active orchards within 300 feet if they applied that rule. Okay. And then, if you could, and I'll ask the applicant this too, but really what I'm interested in is what is the delta between what the county would require it to be? Okay. And what the city is requiring, and if you have an idea of what that, the cost that that would be. Is that a better applicant question? I don't know what the cost differential would be. Okay. And then, this is probably an applicant question too, but if you know, based off of any other projects, those liens that we hold for 20 years, do you happen to know if that impacts any financing arrangements? To build projects? If that would, excuse me? If it would impact any financing arrangements to build projects? No, it's a subordinated lien, so it would be subordinate to the banks that might be lending on the primary improvements of the property. Perfect. Thank you. I had a quick question on the development impact fees, Mike. It mentions in the general plan consistency section that there's going to be a deferral of those fees. Do you know how long that deferral is for? And will those all ultimately be paid in full like any other development? Yes. In fact, they would be paid more than full because what the DA says is that no development impact fees are due for a period of two years. And then there's 10 installments after that. And that delay also is accompanied by an escalator of a percentage tied to some index that I don't recall at the top of my head. But it's... It sounds like it ranges somewhere between half and 1.5% as a late penalty. Okay, so it's just like a two-year delay? Yeah. Okay, great. Thank you. Yeah, a couple of questions. So, Mike, sorry to grill you on the green line, but that was, you know, I kind of keyed in on that as well. And I'm curious, and I think you've already addressed this by your comments regarding the county, you know, meeting county. And I think you've already addressed this by your comments regarding the county, you know, meeting county. But you described the kind of, I think you referred to it as sort of a buffer zone, if you will, that would be between Esplanade and the property. And I noticed, I believe if I understand right, that kind of southern section is primarily employee parking. Yes. So that would be very hard-scaped. And so my observation, my question in terms of that kind of, I'm calling it a buffer zone. I don't know if that's the right terminology, but that you described it as kind of a, you know, a catchment almost between the street and then the property. My question has to do with runoff. So, and related to the green line. And I'm not sure if that's part of what was observed or perhaps, or built into the project. Perhaps that's part of the county, you know, meeting county standards. But whether that is designed to capture runoff from the entire project, but especially that parking lot, that might be a good idea. But that might ultimately have some kind of impact on, you know, any agricultural uses across the street there. So I'm curious if that's a part of the consideration here. There are significant storm drain facilities associated with this initial development of the site. So they will be handling their stormwater runoff on site to a large extent. The applicant and the builders in the queue here, they can tell you more about that. Okay. Other than that, it would, I believe, discharge into those. County ditches that flow along Esplanade. Okay. Great. Thanks. And maybe we'll circle back on that. My other question, I had noted the special conditions. It's section 47 in the agreement. And you mentioned it in your presentation. I appreciate that there's been an acceptance on the sign height as well as the light standards. And I'm just curious how. I. Probably could have looked this up. But how much of a variance there is. So this calls out that the freestanding sign should be 25 feet, 6 inches. Is that significantly higher than would normally be allowed in this zoning? 20 feet would normally be the limit for this user. So I would call that significant. But maybe not, you know, enough to raise an alarm, I suppose. And same question in terms of the light standards. We usually shoot for 22 to 26 feet for light. Light standards in a commercial use. So not much of a variance there. And I guess my question has to do with things like light pollution and impact on neighbors. And this is a very big development in what has historically been a pretty rural. And I know there's nobody very close right there. But has there been any communication with property owners or neighbors in that area, specifically having to do with that variance? The sign and the lights? Not since the county ran through their process. And they did have some comments along the way. But they did look at the lighting. And they decided that they needed a mitigation measure only for special events. For like spotlights and strobe lights. You know, throwing a party in the sky sort of thing. Okay. Okay. Thanks. I did find an answer that I'd like to amend an earlier response to Commissioner Scott. The initial study says that the closest distance between the southernmost project parcel and the nearest active orchard is approximately 160 feet. The collision center will be located approximately 220 feet northeast of the nearest agricultural use. So I think that building is where the city would try to apply its 100 foot standard. We were following along. Thank you for clarifying that. All right. Do we have any further questions for staff? If not, I think we can move on to opening the public hearing. So yeah, for the public hearing, I don't know if we have people tuned in online. I'm sure we have the applicant who we'll hear from first. Should we go over the procedures for that? Please. All right. I don't really have, I don't have an annotated version that if you have a better idea of how to explain it. For people who are called in, it would be great if you could share that, Mike. Thanks. Okay. We're heading into the public hearing portion of the meeting. So I will be inviting people to take themselves off of mute. And you might see a request pop up on your screen for that. I don't see the primary applicant. So we are in the public hearing now. We're ready to go. Okay. So I'm first going to invite James Siegert. James, would you like to address the commission on this? On this item. Okay. Hearing nothing from James, I am going. Yes. There you are. Okay. There we go. Okay. Actually, you know, so I'm sitting here asking Diane and Jerry Pondry as well. We're doing this in a little session. Okay. If you wanted to. If you have any questions for Jerry, you could ask us now. Can you. We've been working on the product for quite a while. We're working as well as the intelligence. We're trying to identify any outstanding issues that are, you know, of any concern. Excuse me. Can you identify which, you know, which company you're with? I'm not too familiar with all your names. Oh, sure. My name is James Siegert. I am president. I'm a monitor. Thank you. Go on. Sorry to interrupt. No problem. So, we've been working for four years now. Trying to work with all the mitigating factors and everything. So that we can get it quite a fair way. Seems like we're pretty close. And it's just a bit of a finish line. If there are any questions or items that you guys would like us to address. Thanks. Can I ask one question? Sorry. Jim, it's Tony Scott. Quick question. I asked Mike. But the delta between what the county was requiring and what the city is requiring. What do those improvements look like for this project? So, the county was essentially not requiring the improvements. So, the road improvements. You know, there's the storm drainage improvements. And the additions to the curb better than sidewalk. And the approximate engineer's estimate that was provided for that were, I would not compare it, but I believe it was about 430,000 or so. Okay. And then I trust that that is, you know, the! I know that I was not paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid paid that we're going to have to look at and I'm grateful. It's been an exciting project for us to put together. We've been working on this on the international for over 40 years. As you can imagine, going through the process with the county, we've been excited about going out there and going home to Virginia and finding out that the city has a hand in this. It certainly turns the page for us when we have to make some adjustments and modifications and it wasn't just the offsite improvements, it was also the utilities on the site. So, you know, water, sewer, gas, electric and all of that. That's increased the expense so much. That's what led us to ask for this department of public improvements because I really care that the city has to offer and all of that. So, you know, the members of the city might have to make some adjustments and we're not going to be isolated enough. And members of the city, we really have very thoughtful trying to help us navigate our way through the positive way that we can do this. So I can thank them for their hard work and their recognition for being here tonight to try and help us extra-thin. I'm open to any questions that you may have. Thank you. Commission, do we have questions? All right. It seems like we're done. So we can move on to other public comments if there are any, if I'm following the right procedure. Okay, we're going to mute the last speaker and move on to Russ Erickson. Would you like to address the commission on this matter? Russ? Hi, Russ Erickson. I don't really have anything to add. My involvement with the project was I helped the privacy of the engineering and the change figure out what needed for the off-site roadway. So I think the city did a great job in presenting the information. And if there's any point of engineering questions on like Arden Lane, I can attempt to answer those questions. Other than that, I don't have anything to offer. Thank you. Thank you, Russ. Okay. That actually does maybe provide an opportunity. Russ and perhaps staff as well, maybe this is Matt. So Mike described in, you know, fairly briefly that there would be some flaring out. I believe it was on the highway probably. I'm not sure. No, on Garner. Okay. To accommodate some, you know, left-hand, probably right-hand turns, et cetera. Can you describe that a little bit more? Whether we feel pretty comfortable with, you know, what that will do to traffic? That's, you know, that's a, at times, can be a very busy intersection. And, you know, it's a point on the freeway where a lot of people end up going pretty fast before they hit that light. So I'm curious, the additional traffic and number of people turning right in there, are we comfortable with where we are with that? So I'm not sure, Russ, if that's a question for you. Or for staff. Or maybe both. Well, this is Russ again. I can speak to the fact that I'm a little bit ignorant on that issue simply because I wasn't involved with the project from the start. I know that the county required some mitigation to that intersection. And what I do know about that intersection is I believe there's a two-lane, if you're approaching the Highway 99 from the curbside, you're pointing out the intersection. And I believe there's basically one dedicated lane and a little bit of a right turn lane. And I think what the improvements, I think what the county was looking for is to expand that a little bit to make it a little more CalTrans friendly to have a dedicated straight left turn lane and a dedicated right turn lane to get out to that, onto the freeway. As far as the improvements on the other side of the street, I'm really not familiar with. I would have to rely on either James or, or Jerry to respond to that. Thanks. Thanks, Ross. And maybe Mike, do you have more on that? Yeah, it's included in the packet. It's one of the exhibits to the development agreement, all the mitigation measures. So it would be under attachment A, exhibit one. But I can just read it. It's brief. It's explaining the intersection improvements required at Garner at 99. And these are Garner Lane improvements for people who are using Garner Lane to facilitate them getting out onto the Highway 99 more efficiently. And what it says is that the eastbound approach on Garner, additional lanes will be constructed to allow for an exclusive left and through lane and right turn lane. At the westbound approach, that's the city side, an additional lane will be constructed to allow for an exclusive left turn lane and a shared through right lane. That'll facilitate the, including the people who live in the county and residential properties, it'll cut down on the competition. If courtesy were to add competition for through traffic on the other side, it would delay people trying to make a left. So you would split the phasing of that signal, if I got that right, Matt. You know what? I don't really know on that. I know that, Rich, they were conditions that were provided by Caltrans to the county. So we haven't been real familiar with those, but we know they're not part of the deferral other than they need to be done before they get a certificate of occupancy on the buildings themselves. Okay. Okay, thanks. Thanks, Russ. Thanks to Matt and Mike for that. I appreciate that. All right. So other speakers in the Zoom are city employees. So I'll just say if city employees, if any of you want to speak, I think you're just here to see how it goes with the Zoom technology. You can raise your hand, hit the raise hand button, and I'll try to get you on here. I'm sorry. There is one attendee. Oh. Natalie Hanson. Would you like to address the committee on the city of Caltrans and the commission on this item? I know her name as a journalist, so I wouldn't be surprised if she's observing. Typically just observing, but I want to give her a shot, right? Of course. Thank you. So there it is. I think we're done with the public hearing. Okay. All right. If there's no other public comments, then public hearing closed. All right. Further commission discussion. What shall we discuss? Or we can also make a motion if desired. I'll make the motion. I move that the planning commission adopt resolution number 21-01, recommending that the city council find the development agreement 18-01 is within the scope of a previous legal agreement that would be adopted to mitigate negative declaration for the project and approve development agreement 18-01 based upon the findings therein. I'll second that motion. Thank you. We have a motion and a second. Do we have further discussion? I'd just like to thank city staff for navigating through this process. It seems like we have a very happy applicant, which was probably really due to you guys, being so conscious of them and working through that process. But I could see that this could have been a much more contentious process and just really appreciate you, Mike. Thank you. And thank you, Tony, for saying that. Okay. If there's no further discussion, then I suppose we can call the question. All right. All who are in favor, please say aye. Aye. Aye. Any opposed? Any abstentions? All right. The motion passes. Okay. So I believe our next agenda item is five, regular agenda. And it looks like we have none on there. Item six, reports and communications. I believe we have some reports and communications. Yes, Madam Chair. Thank you. I included a memo in your packet that kind of gives you an idea of the current update on the housing element update process that's currently underway. We had the, and I hope some of you folks may have attended, we had our first community meeting, yes, last night. We were pleased with the turnout. I think we had about 85 people at one time in there. We had to do the meeting virtually. And so we weren't sure how the turnout would go. But we were happy with it. And we got some good feedback. There were some online polls that were conducted so that the participants could get feedback and we could gauge what the interest level was at the time and see what the questions are. The results from the meeting will be posted probably tomorrow. And that's the way it will go. We're going to, there will be another community meeting in the summer. And then the same thing, those results will be posted. And the survey results will be included, too, on the website. The website is chicohousingelement.com. We encourage folks to visit the site. There's information there about the timeline, what the housing element is and what the update is about, the laws that are applicable to the update process, and the different components that will be included in the housing element and how people can participate. Thank you. I just wanted to say thank you very much. I know that I've seen that you've uploaded pertinent pertinent pertinent pertinent pertinent pertinent pertinent pertinent pertinent pertinent pertinent pertinent pertinent pertinent pertinent pertinent pertinent pertinent pertinent pertinent pertinent pertinent pertinent pertinent pertinent pertinent pertinent pertinent pertinent pertinent pertinent pertinent pertinent pertinent pertinent pertinent pertinent pertinent pertinent pertinent pertinent pertinent pertinent pertinent pertinent pertinent pertinent pertinent pertinent pertinent pertinent pertinent pertinent pertinent pertinent pertinent pertinent pertinent pertinent pertinent that was developed by the Butte County Association of Governments. And that's also known as the RHNA, and those are the housing affordability numbers that are assigned to every jurisdiction in California. And we went through that process, and that information is on the RHNA too, at that link that I provided in your memo. And lastly, I just gave you a snapshot of some, you know, some performance indicators, and the number of approvals we've had last year, and plan checks we've completed, number of units under construction. What you're seeing is a lot of that development activities. On the heels of the fire, all these projects kind of got submitted. Well, that slug is moving its way through the pipeline, and now these projects are starting to come out. So a lot is under construction. Some of these are under construction. Some of these are turning over, and are finishing completion now. So we're starting to see all of that activity from a couple years pay dividends into the housing market now. So I just wanted to give you a quick update. Those are all those resources. If you have any questions, I'd be happy to answer them. Thank you, Bruce. Give the Commission a few moments if we have questions. Any questions for staff on that? Actually, I would like to have just a little discussion. I looked, I wasn't, I didn't attend last night, but I did look at the presentation, and it was really, it was great. I am always concerned that these, the housing element, these are necessary litigated processes that we need to do to amend our general plan. However, I'm always concerned, and I'm just kind of putting this out there, because, you know, once you put something out there, it's kind of like the universe will take it, hopefully. The inertia. So I think to myself, okay, this is really good stuff, and we have such a housing crisis. I've been thinking about it since, well, I've really been, it's really been on my mind pretty much daily since I read the article in the ER regarding the, how difficult it is for families to, to, you know, find a single family home under 400,000. And it just, it just really blew my mind. And then I did a little bit of research. I've been here for 20 years, and my home has, gosh, tripled in price, which is ridiculous. My, I'm from Whittier. My dad bought his house $6,000 in 1958. We sold it for 160 20 years ago. Two bedroom house in a middle class neighborhood. It's $649,000 today. So I just get this feeling of just really, just strong concern. And then I was looking at the numbers on the graph that you prepared, and for the very low income, they're quite, they're very few that were built. And I think, okay, we're going to do some necessary analysis and data. But turning that data and analysis into action and actually providing the housing that we so desperately need. So I'm looking forward to moving from this great process. And I really appreciated your email that you said, we're a very pro-housing, pro, how did you word it, pro-development, we need to be from the fires. And I thought that's really great. We're all on the same page. But by the same token, I just get so concerned that we, that it will be difficult for us to move from data to action. So. I share those concerns. And that's why I had asked for a quick report on our affordable housing and housing in general in the community. Because I think all of us know it's extremely hard for most people to find affordable housing or just housing at all. And yeah. I appreciate that. I appreciate staff putting together the report. Also, I did attend the housing element meeting yesterday. And one of the things that I know other people attended were blown away by was this graph that's also a version of it's included in here. Where we see that only 15 extremely and very low income units have been built or permitted in the past, let's see, there's about nine years here through 2022. And let's see, five in that time period in low income. And then we're way over the projection or sorry, the arena allocation for above moderate. So we're building a lot of expensive housing and not a lot that is affordable. And I know the city is trying to change that. And I share the sentiment that how are we going to get there is a question. Well. Well, we've, Madam Chair, we've made significant progress in the last two years. We've delivered over 700 affordable units. So it's happening. The disaster recovery money is helped for tax credits. And that's pushed forward about two or three projects that are taking a big chunk of that. So the outlook is optimistic still. I had some questions. Are you done, Bryce? I'm just saying it's good to see that there are a lot of units in the pipeline. Go ahead, John. Yeah. I have some questions about that disaster recovery money, Bruce. So that's community developed block grant money. And approximately 34 million in total. Is that right? Yeah. Yeah. I'm not sure. I think it's around 34 million. Five million max per project I think is what I read. So each project can receive up to $5 million in tax credits, depending I assume on what type of, you know, level units they build. So I want to look at attachment two. The four that you guys have listed there, Bruce Commons, Deer Creek Apartments, Lava Ridge Apartments, and Senator Kaness, I guess. Am I saying that right? Right. Kaness. Yeah, I think. Kaness. OK. So let's, if we could, and I don't know if you have this information, but could you give us a breakdown out of those 60 units at Bruce Commons? Yeah. What is the level of units that they build? What is the, how are those going to lay out? How many of them are going to be like extremely low to very low? How many are going to be low? Are any moderate? You know, that kind of thing? At the top of my head, all of these are really towards the bottom end. So, I mean, towards the very low and the low. So they're getting right at the target. My recollection of all of these, we're getting right at the sweet spot of affordability. OK. So my concern over this one-time money is that it go toward the, toward that bottom end exactly that you're talking about. Yeah. I mean, obviously we've overbuilt when it comes to housing above moderate. That was clear in the RHNA report, I think, that we saw last night in the housing element summary. So what, how does, exactly how does the city go about calculating how to award those tax credits? In other words, can you give me an idea of what the, what the tax credits are? I mean, I think it's kind of like, you know, let's say that Deer Creek Apartments, 156 units, and 90 of those are going to be extremely low to low. Do they get more credits if they build that? I'm not quite sure. I'm not sure how the tax credit split goes. The answer is, though, that these affordable projects are done by a group of people that know how to do affordable housing. And they put together layers of funding. OK. And tax credits are a critical part of these that kind of bridge the gap from commercially affordable to supportable. OK. And, but I don't know how the specifics work of the financing of these. OK. And then I guess my other question would be, is there a maximum amount of that disaster money that can be spent on, say, moderate to above moderate units? I would have to, I would have to look into that and check back. I'm sure there's some affordability aspect to it, but there, I don't really know, but I'd have to get back to you on it. I just, I do know this, that the projects we have in the pipeline now are geared right at the sweet spot at the very low and low. OK. Almost, yeah, the significant majority of them. Good. I mean, as a matter of fact, all of them that I recall were right at that level. Yeah. I mean, my concern, obviously, is going to be that this one-time money is targeted where we've been lacking since the loss of RDA money. Yeah. And that's going to be at the extremely low and low levels, and that other people that want to develop apartments at market rate or moderate rate don't look at these tax credits as just another way of padding the, or reducing costs of their construction. So it'd be great, and I imagine those rules are somewhere in the, in there? Yeah, yeah. You can, those rules are, they're in the, they're in the! We can get that information to you. I'm sure it's available on the websites, and you can also check with the housing folks. Yeah. And they'd be happy to tell you. I think if you can keep track of all of that progress, but those kinds of questions about, you know, the mechanism for tax credits and all that, yeah, we can put you in touch with that information. OK. Good. And then, obviously, again, one-time money. I mean, this is not going to occur again. So, you know, as we're looking at the housing element, what are we going to do long-term to make sure that we're not losing that money? We're going to make sure that once these types, and we're not going to have, you know, campfires, hopefully, again. And so, you know, what are we doing long-term in terms of making sure that we're not in a situation where we're meeting, you know, less than 2% of our arena on the two lowest categories? So I'd like to see that in the housing element, definitely. Some long-term solutions that don't involve, you know, just being bailed out by the federal government. Yeah. OK. If I could, I'd like to echo that because I think, and Bryce alluded to this in the presentation last night, and this data has been out there for a while, but another way to look at those, at that deficiency in building very low and low-income units, according to the RHNA report, over that period that it covers, which I think was 2014 to 2021, the The! the most recent report of what was established as needed, the number of units needed in extremely low and low compared to what has actually been built were at less than 3% of actually building the units that were established as needed in those lowest categories, whereas in the top category, above affordability, we were at 166%. of what was estimated as needed. We've built nearly one and a half times, nearly twice as much as we needed. And so I think to John's point, and this I know is not, this is just kind of exploring the report that you provided as we go into the work of the housing element. But I think that to John's point, I think that figuring out a way to not have the correction that you're identifying, Bruce, and I think we are so grateful that that's happening, that there are 700 and something units coming online. That's going to have a huge impact on the community. And we should not, you know, just move right past that to some, you know, we should acknowledge that work. But we need to figure out a way to make that not a one-time thing so that the next time we're at the end of the next housing element, we're not still right back at where we had this little blip in 2020, 2021, 2022, where we built a lot of units. Because we had the tax credit money and people were, and, you know, developers are incentivized to build that kind of housing. And then by, you know, 2030, we're back to where we built a small fraction of, you know, a few percentage points of what was actually needed. So that's, I think, the challenge in front of all of us, including, you know, planning department, planning commission, et cetera, to try to make sure that the housing element, if possible, we need to figure out what the mechanisms are to try to address that going forward. So that's, you know, that's just an observation. That's not a, you know, a criticism of anybody. I just think it's critical work that we're going to have to do. I don't want my comments to be taken as criticism at all. I think it's awesome. And the work that you guys are doing, I know you're excited about doing it. I know you've waited a long time to have this type of an opportunity. I cringe to think what would happen if we didn't have that money. How could we even come close to meeting our low-income housing needs? We wouldn't be. And so, and we could spend it prudently. And why? And why would we? And you guys keep doing what you're doing because these look like terrific projects. So thank you. The, if that's all you had on housing, the only other thing I wanted to mention is we're going to need to cancel our next meeting because we don't have any items on that one. But that concludes my report on the housing element. Thank you, Bruce. Bruce, how long, it's, how long do we have to do the housing element? Like, when does it have to be done? It needs to be, it needs to be submitted in June of 2022. Okay, that's what I thought. It needs to be certified by then. Right, so. So we're going to, we, yeah. And it's an eight-year cycle, right? Yes. Okay. So the next workshops will be in the summer. And then roughly about a year from now, the draft element will be returning back to the Planning Commission. We're in the process of gathering this information, doing the workshops, collecting, analyzing the data. There's a lot of information. There's a lot of changed laws. And so. I know, that's what I was thinking. Yeah. It's all very different than other past housing elements. Okay. So there's a lot of moving parts. So it's a complex project. So I have a, I have a question. I'm thinking about investment. And I had this question at the League of Cities as well. You know, folks have private owners, you know, owners, everyone wants to make a profit. And you want to, and obviously in the numbers, we see that the development leans towards high profit. How, and you may have, this may have been answered earlier, but I missed it. How do you generate the investment for low-income development? That's a good question. That's the problem. That's where we, without redevelopment, we really don't have a funding source. There's a minor amount that's generated from recent legislation off real estate proceeds. And I think the income stream on that was like $2.5 million or something. But that's the problem. We don't really have a source. And that's why it's so hard to do that without redevelopment. It stopped everything cold. And we're, we've still, we've never fully recovered ever since they stopped redevelopment. So. I'm sorry. We share your concerns. These are the same things everybody else has been talking about. Right. Just trying to. It's a common problem, an acute common problem that everybody's experiencing. This affordability aspect. So something else. When we were, when we were together back in November, we approved, it was a development, it was an apartment development. And I brought up the question of, well, gosh, you know, wouldn't it be great if we had some low-income housing within that? Shouldn't it be? Shouldn't it be? Shouldn't it be? Shouldn't it be? Shouldn't it be? Shouldn't it be? Shouldn't it be? Shouldn't it be? Shouldn't it be? Shouldn't it be? Shouldn't it be? Shouldn't it be? Shouldn't it be? Shouldn't it be? Shouldn't it be? Shouldn't it be? Shouldn't it be? Shouldn't it be? Shouldn't it be? to be able to incorporate that. Yeah, that's the conversation that's occurring in the housing element update. That's what we're trying to do is identify those things. So that is the process we're talking about. Not at this meeting, this was an update, but the process is through the update process. And that's the time now through the housing element update. Right, thank you. Thank you, Lupita. Okay, I was curious, I don't think we've ever had a special meeting before, and I'm curious what spurs that to happen. It was just scheduling. The reason why it's special is because we have normally scheduled meetings on the first and third Thursdays of the month. And those are normally scheduled, those are a regular meeting scheduling. Anything other than that is called a special meeting, and it has different rules, as Mike mentioned, and as Mike indicated. For example, a special meeting was brought to our attention, we didn't know this, but the clerk's office did, that you're not allowed to open up business from the floor at a special meeting. That's only at a regular meeting. And it's a small nuance. The reason why we did it was to provide for the applicant to meet their schedule so that they could go before the city council. And I understand there's some time constraints with the project delivery schedule, or project delivery schedule. But I think that's probably financing. I don't know. Mike may be able to answer. But we did it for purposes of scheduling. Okay. That's good to know. I wish that the meeting format was made clear before the meeting, or at least for future reference. But now I know how that... If we could have waited longer, we would have. But their time was critical, and that's why we called the special meeting. Okay. So the 18th is canceled too, right? Yes. We've got that through now? Yes. Okay. Well, thank you for that information, and thank you for the report. Do we have any further reports on communications, discussion, et cetera? Seeing none, I think we can move to adjournment. Adjourned. Thank you, everybody. Thank you, guys. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
