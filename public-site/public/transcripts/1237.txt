K-12. I know you could do it  as a resolution  or whatever. You could do that as a body.  The reason why you avoid a lot is  trouble. I'll skip right to five.  Honor thy father and mother.  You know what that says? It covers everything.  That means LGBTQ+,  and abortion, done.  That's it. I get a razor.  Done. What's the Supreme Court?  What's the Supreme Court missing? What's your local  state Supreme Court missing? Why can't  the lady not make a cake or  prepare flowers for somebody? Why does somebody  it's right there. You see what I mean?  And it goes right to six.  Thou shalt not murder. Now I'll go back  to number five. Now  abortion and also that it's a  choice. It's a bad choice. Mr. Hazel, you need to keep it on  the city of Chico. We have no jurisdiction  over the school districts. Oh, I know. I know. I have no jurisdiction, but you  as a body, you can send a resolution. Keep it on the city of  Chico, please. A resolution. I'm saying this  covers it. By sending that  resolution, it covers this. And it's true  because it's a choice. It's not equal  protection. Ask your lawyer. That's where  they got you. It wasn't equal protection.  LGBT. No, it's a choice.  And you can say if it's a good choice or not. It doesn't matter.  That's it. A month before.  Remember the  Sabbath. Where's the competing religions?  All they say would just don't work.  Take Sunday off. Not to be  sarcastic, but I want to play double time.  Where's the  competing religions like Christianity,  Islam, even Judaism?  I didn't say that. Or the person talking or  somebody making money off my son's  second coming, which is the Mormon church  which right now has over $300 billion  in money. Mr. Hazel, can you keep it on the subject of the city of Chico, please?  It has to do with exactly  why. Tell me how. I'm talking about the Ten Commandments.  In fact, if you went to the beginning,  Moses was tripped. No one says that.  Why do you think he was up in the mountain for 48  to 49? And you know what happened with those corners?  How do you think the pyramids were built?  Two Jews went up there, got the  corners, gave it to Egyptians. Little  rock moves  big rock. Whoa.  Even raising a lower denial. Why do you  think we're getting with this climate change? There it is.  And when you see Elon Musk,  his little cyber truck, whoa, that's a little  corner. It is a little baby corner.  You know why? Because I'm the creative author  of the Ten Commandments. That's why. Mr. Hazel, you are off  topic. This is a public meeting and this  is your first warning. I'm talking about the Ten Commandments.  The Ten Commandments ought to be displayed  within your city. And there's a  reason. And there's a history of it.  And Elon Musk has  the corner. And he has half the corner.  That guy, it mirrors  the little baby corner. That thing, the biggest way to  South America, Pumapuku,  made to Easter Island.  Those statues made all the way around to  modern day Europe. On his way to  and ran into a piece of ice on his way to  the United States. Listen, I'm talking to you.  Your comments are not on the statue.  This is your second warning. George Denikwick.  George Denikwick. It has to do  with the Ten Commandments. George Denikwick  had the small commandment.  He drowned and his wife got it.  Now, Elon Musk's a possession one.  They don't want to tell you that. FBI, it's area 51  in your house. You know where I live. Talk to me.  Come to my house. I'll tell you everything.  Okay.  Ashley Murphy is our last speaker on this.  And before we have Ashley  speak and I start the time, I do want to  let anyone who's standing  know if you would like to go and sit in  conference room one, you can hear the sound.  You can get a comfortable seat  if you would like  to do that.  And then if you do have a card in,  I will give extra time so that they can come  from conference room one and come back  over. So just to let you know, conference room one  is, if you go out of this,  it's out in here and then to the left.  It's out and to the left as you go out the door.  Yes, thank you.  So, Ashley Murphy, go ahead  and start.  This is on Chico's topic.  Good evening. My name is Ashley  Murphy and I'm here to speak about  the blatant discrimination  in card inclusion program  in both the after school and the summer program.  I moved back  to Chico with my autistic son  two summers ago  where he was never once excluded  or sent home from any program.  But when we came to Chico,  everything changed.  I was told I needed approval,  paperwork just for my son to belong.  I went through every hoop,  jumped through all the paperwork  just to get Far Northern's one on one  approval for card.  And there I was finally  realizing  the concerns that every parent in this  community have.  The blatant disrespect of Erin  and every single one of her leads.  She not only  allows for multiple parents  every single week to complain to her  while doing nothing about it.  She stands behind her uneducated  and un...  her uneducated leads that have no education  and no experience in special education.  Erin's Recreational Department stands by  the belief that disabled children need to abide  by strict code of conduct to be included.  But that's not how inclusion works.  Disability and special needs children  often have special needs.  They need guidance, structure and respect,  not exclusion.  When leadership doesn't understand that,  include...  and inclusion becomes just a word on a piece of paper.  It's not a practice that changes lives.  Our children deserve better.  They deserve stability during the summertime  and after school.  Our parents and families deserve the same stability  to not get phone calls every single day of the week  to pick our children up six hours early.  And Chico, we can and we must do better.  We need leadership with training  and special needs and inclusion.  We need programs that embrace our children  for who they are, not exclude them  because they need extra understanding.  Inclusion isn't about children that fit into rigid molds.  It's about adapting the programs to their needs.  Behind me, I have mothers that have experienced this.  We have mothers that have experienced the same things.  We have mothers that could not come,  but we need this community's help.  Thank you.  Ms. Murphy, can I ask you a quick question?  Thank you so much for coming up  and I'm sorry that that happened before  and we absolutely want to hear what you have to say.  Did you say this was a card, a program at CARD?  Can I bring this to you?  No, you can leave it over here in the...  I'm trying to find myself.  The only reason I'm asking is I want to let you know  CARD is definitely part of the Chico program,  but they also have an individual card.  I understand that.  And I encourage you to go.  The community needs to hear.  Oh, absolutely.  No, no, no, absolutely.  I just want to make sure you knew  that they also have an individual meeting.  I understand.  I'm out of town for a work conference that week.  Okay.  And it's monthly,  but I will make sure to pass that on as well,  but I just want to make sure you are aware of that.  Thank you for coming to speak.  She was our last speaker.  All right, we don't have any public hearings.  So agenda number 5.1, Eric Gustafson  has a presentation for us.  He is our Public Works Operations and Maintenance Director  on the alternative site.  Mr. Gustafson, take us away.  Thank you, Mayor Reynolds, Vice Mayor Bennett,  council members, appreciate the opportunity  to speak to you tonight.  This item is a carryover from September's meeting  on bringing back some options to potentially move  the alternative site.  with land that's controlled and operated by the city.  I will start and kind of open by saying  it's a difficult presentation.  Obviously, there are really no good options.  And of course, whatever we decide will impact those areas.  So we don't take this lightly.  Recognize that the current location has had many impacts  as well.  So it's a tough discussion, but we're here to have it  and want to present.  And we're here to make sure that we're doing what we're  bringing forward today.  So a quick overview.  The alternative site requirements, we're going to  touch on that just with a quick summary.  We're going to talk about the available locations that are  city owned, city controlled, and then one that's not.  And then we're going to end on the staff ranking of the top  three available options from a staffing perspective.  So this is out of the settlement agreement.  It's paragraph 10M that touches on the alt-site requirements.  And this is a little bit of a summary.  And this slide is just a summary.  So basically, if an individual does not qualify for shelter,  the several sheltering options that we have available, which  is Genesis and the tourist shelter, and when we say not  qualify, there are certain scenarios.  Either they're a violent convicted felon, a sex offender,  or they have more than two dogs, then the city has to offer them  designated public property where camping is temporarily  available.  And that's what we call the alternate site.  And I will say, out of the existing 18 that  are there, the animal situation is the majority of those that are  there.  Yes, we do have some violent convicted felons.  And yes, we do have several sex offenders that are there.  But the majority of the people there are due to they have more  than two animals.  In most cases, it's dogs.  There are some requirements outlined in the settlement  agreement.  Basically, the city must ensure that those sites are within a  half mile or 2,640 feet of public transportation and some  form of food service, whether it's a convenience store or  grocery store, restaurant, that type of thing.  We also have to offer transportation to the  alternative site through the outreach and engagement  process, which we do, along with belongings if requested.  And we can only move those folks twice per year.  So only two times in a 12 month period.  And just for clarification, the site originated at its current  location at Eaton and Cohasset in 2022, and it's been there ever  since.  And this is the current site.  So this is kind of the format of how we're going to be able to do this.  and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find  well. So this is the current site, again, that it's been there since 2022. I will also add that  when we first started this site, we could not layer in any rules, which was extremely problematic  and very challenging to manage. And so basically, it was a free-for-all, and we really had a hard  time, as we discussed before, keeping those unauthorized people out. And those were really,  you know, reflecting back the ones that were causing all the issues. We had lots of conversations  with those that were allowed to be at the site, and the problems were they were being preyed on by  those that were unauthorized to be at the site and then would come in and go at their free will.  Recent changes have helped. We are able to administer a code of conduct and require all  occupants to sign that, which outlines a set of basic rules. There's a departure process that  layers in due process, so there's multiple warnings, written warnings, until ultimately  somebody has departed for bad behavior.  We have a lot of !  We have a lot of rules that we're able to enforce now. The site is much better managed. It's not  perfect by any means, but we're able to get a handle on it, and it's a lot better than when it  started. And to remind everybody, we have about 15 months left in the settlement agreement.  Second site reference tonight is simply across the street. It's 11 and a half acre site. Positive  point, it's a large space. Unfortunately, there's no good access for services, no utilities. It's  not graded.  the eastern side is commonly impacted by water during a large rain event so it's it's a big  site in fact we listed this as our second third site through negotiations in the settlement  agreement process and dispute resolution process but we do not we haven't activated it since some  of those earlier discussions just because some of those negative points it's it's hard to manage  access is terrible of course it would require significant work to make usable move required  and I don't think it accomplishes what we're trying to look at as far as moving it away from  this particular area of course it's just across the street but that's the second site that's  referenced tonight the next site is a city parcel further west on Eaton and Hicks pros it's it's  fenced it's flats graded there's utilities it has good access  cons it's similar in location to the existing site it's adjacent to a lot of residential homes  which is problematic it is the future fire station 6 location however we're of course  we're in the planning and design phase of fire station 6 so there will be no conflicts as far  as impacting the building of fire station station 6 ultimately because we only have  15 months left in the settlement agreement but this is the Eaton and Hicks location  and  the next site is on the south end of town and on the south end of city limits we call it the fair  street detention basin it's kind of as fair street curves around and ultimately adjoins to count  country drive it's a new area not adjacent to residential which is a plus of course it is  adjacent to commercial which can be problematic it's large it's two acres a move is required  we have been interfaced by the folks at the city of Eaton and Hicks and we've been working with the  county residents off the sale campaneros quite often they're well organized and vocal so they  would definitely have an opinion on it it is environmental set aside for the excavation  required for the fair street detention pond so it could solicit some and you know regulatory agency  scrutiny but that is a location that is usable and available in city owned and controlled  the next spot is depot park of course this has been heavily impacted by the fire station 6 and  it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is  So that's the two acre parcel  that city owned and controlled.  Next is tiger ponds.  Large site, 34 acres, new area,  a move would be required.  Access is terrible.  There's no real good access for  services, no utilities, has a  pretty significant fire danger  component to it.  The neighborhood adjacent is  also very organized and engaged  and they would definitely have  an opinion on it as well.  So there's a lot of residential  that it's adjacent to.  But again, large area that city  owned and controlled.  The next site we dabbled into  the private property ownership  a little bit and we put some  feelers out there with several  commercial real estate agents.  Let them know we're very candid  on what we're looking for and  we're looking for a lot of  We did not have a lot of  participation but this site did  become available.  It's pretty close.  It's on 9th street.  It's owned by the Miller family  and that particular parcel is  just over half an acre.  Privately owned.  It's a new area.  It's large space, good access,  has utilities of course but is  privately owned and the asking  is how much is it worth?  So here's where we're going to  kind of land on the staff's  recommendation of the three  sites.  And these are ranked from three  to one.  So the first one is the fair  street detention basin.  We have that ranked as number  three.  Again, it's a large site.  Good access.  No utilities.  Not adjacent to any residential.  But it's a good site to activate  an alt site there.  Site number two is the Eaton and  Hicks facility.  Again, it's fenced, flat,  utilities, good access.  Unfortunately it's adjacent to  residential and very close to  the existing site.  It is again the future home of  fire station six but that is a  little ways off so if we were to  move the site there, activate the  And finally we landed on  recommendation number one is the  existing site.  And especially mayor Reynolds,  we didn't land on this lightly  recognizing that this continues  the impact on your district.  It's been there since its  inception in 2022.  Again, when we first started this  endeavor and activated the  alternate site, we had severe,  severe impacts to the joining  impact on the development of  La Dolce Piazza, which is the  shopping center just to the south,  significant impacts there so  that it's not, we don't say this  and recommend this lightly  recognizing it would continue  some of those impacts.  On the same note, we have layered  in the code of conduct, the site  rules, we have our hands around  it.  We have a big effort there to  find a more permanent solution  for some of those individuals to  transition them out of this  scenario because the settlement  agreement is terming in 15  months so we need to start working  on that now so when it does term  there's a path out for these folks.  So that's why we landed on staying  with the existing site from a staff  perspective.  It's currently operating, has all  the amenities we would need.  It has fencing, surveillance, water,  restroom service, gravel lot that's  graded but also on the con side it  has been there since its inception  and would continue some impacts to  those adjoining neighbors.  So that concludes the presentation  at this point.  Happy to entertain any questions.  Thank you so much for your  time.  Thank you for that exciting and  uplifting report.  We'll take some council discussion  first to start with.  I'm going to start with council  member McBrien because he brought  it and then I'll come over here.  So the reason for this  discussion is the current site  has been plagued and has plagued  neighboring houses, businesses  for a number of years to include  gun battles and other violent  I had a woman come who's from  that neighborhood and talked about  two times in the last six weeks  she was locked down because of this  violence.  So this is horrible and  unacceptable and that's why we  wanted to at least have the  conversation to see if we can't  find some better option.  And I do want to express my  appreciation to Eric and staff  for bringing options back.  This is not your fault. You didn't create this. I want to make sure that everyone in the room is  understands that.  And there's no win in this  scenario, right?  However,  I agree that none of the other  location options right now are better and are  likely worse than what we currently have.  And that's tough for me to say  but that's the reality as we sit  at this moment. And I think we're going to  hear just that, unless I'm mistaken,  from all of you  in the audience.  So I'm going to save  any further discussions on what I'm going  to recommend to the end.  I want you guys to have your say.  And thank you, Mayor, for allowing me to  express that.  No problem. Council Member Holly?  I apologize, Mayor Reynolds. You said council discussion.  Did you mean council questions more?  Sorry. Or questions for staff or questions  for anybody before we take comment  and then we'll of course discuss again at the end.  Yeah, just making sure. Last council meeting  I had floated the idea  of perhaps  splitting the population  that's currently housed at the alternate  site into multiple sites  even if it were potentially to be in  District 5. But I was hoping  if you could comment  on that as an option  in regards to a financial  impact and staff  time impact because that would also require  further distances  driving for staff and other contractors  like Jesus Center staff to  service the areas as well.  Yeah, Council Member Haley. Holly, it's a great  question and agreed. It would probably lessen  the impacts to a certain degree if we were to split  the population up. However, it would also  increase  cost to maintain because  we're going to two different locations.  If we were to have surveillance there  as if you recall we pay about $3,500  a month for the surveillance camera and  lighting system there. We would want that  at both locations so that would double that price.  Could be done but it would of course increase  our operating costs and  staffing bandwidth to maintain and manage  and likely impact our service providers as well  to do that. Okay, thank you.  I just want to ensure when we're talking about this  that the pros do outweigh the cons  if we take any action. And then  one more procedural question  I believe this is for Ms. Presson is  because this agenda item is  specifically in relation to the location  of the alternate site, are we able  to have any discussion regarding  facility improvements  whether that's increased staff  time or anything else?  I think I would probably ask the City Attorney  if the title is  broad enough to cover that. Okay.  Council  Mayor, I believe you can  speak about that because the alternate site  the existing site is part of one of the  existing sites that are being proposed.  So you can speak on that.  Okay, phenomenal. Thank you.  Council Member Winslow. That was a perfect  segue because my thinking  is it doesn't make sense to move the site at all  for the reasons you named, I mean doubling over  things, the cost of changing services.  It took us so long to get the little facilities  we have out there just like water,  a big enough dumpster, a fence, like a lock  gate. But I don't think that  that should mean that we just land back  on the same status quo of what's been going on.  And so I've been out there  like kind of consistently like over the last few  years and most recently just  a number of things that I could name. It's better  in a lot of ways than it was before there were even aisles  between some of these camps. But  I saw something as an example  that two extension cords that were  hooked out together  hanging off the top like a broken piece of  chain link fence on the back part of that  site, so right adjacent to the  dry canal and all the grass.  Like who is inspecting  to look at just even small things  like that that can be mitigated?  I don't think there's like a clear answer.  It's kind of like, you know, we'll have police out there, we'll have a target team.  We have some Jesus Center employees that are out there.  It's definitely not their job to do that. We have volunteers  out there. But it's nobody's  job and I don't think we should leave this conversation  without being sure when something like that's  going on, which may still be the case for all I know,  that we don't have somebody designated  to address those things.  I  don't know if you have any comments as far as like  could we use a designated  position? Do we need to like commit  for the next 15 months like some staff  time in a particular position  to know that somebody's on a regular basis visiting  and looking for some like some extreme  hazards like that? I'd like to see us have  some kind of direction on that.  Yeah, I could just comment. I mean we look  for a lot of self-compliance because things  like that happen overnight.  The water, for example, when we were able to  bring with assistance from Cal Water  a water utility there, we started out with a campsite  style spigot that was  spring loaded. Like you see at any  normal campsite, you push it to fill up  a water jug.  Within 24 hours that was removed.  And a  hose, another hose was put on with  multiple splitters and hundreds of feet  of hose. So it happens  rather quickly and we probably changed three  or four of those spigots and then finally  just threw our hands up in the air.  To your point,  Council Member Winslow, I think  outside of having  somebody there staffing it 24  7, it is difficult to manage. But  we're there.  Police Department's target team is there  multiple times. Behavioral Health is there.  Jesus Center folks are there. Outreach and Engagement  staff are there commonly.  There's a lot of interaction at  the site, but it's tough to pick a lot of  those things out. They  pop up very quickly. We get compliance  and give direction to get compliance quickly  and then within a couple of hours  as soon as we walk away, it's back to the way  it was. So it's difficult to manage.  Council Member  Van Overbeek?  This is a terrible situation  and there's no good answer.  I mean, if we move it, we're just  transferring the problem from  the existing site to  another site.  It has to be there for another  15 months, at which point  we need to shut it down.  And those people need to go to the shelter  if they're accepted. And if they don't want to go,  then they need to try their luck in  Redding or Biggs or someplace.  But  I  I  So  I think  moving it is  a bad idea. I would like  to take the money that we're  going to spend  we would spend in moving it and use  that to further improve  the management  of the site. So I think everybody agrees it was  a complete disaster before.  It's better now  because there's some management  and I would ask us to take  it up another couple of notches.  Alright.  And I think  that's it for this end for now.  And so we will go to our speakers.  How many speakers do we have?  We have 36.  Alright.  So  I've got  Alright.  We hear you.  And yes, we are super excited to hear from  all 36 of you. So you're each going to get  one minute because  we can only take 45 minutes  of public comment and we want to make sure to  hear everybody. Feel free  if somebody said the same thing before  you, you can say what she said or he said  and or what they said and  you know, add to it. But  yes, one minute each and take her  away. Ms. Preston. Okay. So  I'm going to call the first two names and  I would ask you to please line up  in the middle aisle. It will help that  go a little bit faster. I also  recognize that we may have some speakers  who are sitting in conference room one.  And so if there is a delay in that person  being able to get into this room,  I'll go to the next speaker.  So the first two speakers  are Bill Webb followed by Dee Dee Christian.  And just a quick reminder,  we want to do the best that we can to make everybody  feel welcome and able to speak here  so we try not to cheer, clap,  click, you know, yay,  boo, whatever. We don't want anybody  to be discouraged to come and tell us how they feel.  So thank you for being respectful.  Good evening, council. Bill Webb, private  property owner off Hicks, currently  building a subdivision out there.  I just want to express my concerns with  alternative site option  two, Hicks and Eaton Road.  The impacts  it will have on the subdivision, but more importantly  the impacts it's going to have on the residents out there.  You've got several hundred residents  within a quarter mile where they exist.  The existing site does not.  Furthermore,  that is a major traffic  corridor between this proposed  site and the services  on the corner of Eaton, or  excuse me, Esplanade and Eaton.  It's about a quarter mile to a third of a mile away.  They've got to navigate a roundabout  on ramps, off ramps,  Highway 99 South,  discontinuous sidewalk to and from,  no lighting.  I'll let the rest of the speakers  finish it out from there. Thank you.  Thank you.  Didi Christian followed by  Okay, so just so that everyone can hear  if there could be no applauding.  Didi Christian followed by  Carolyn Ferris.  Let me just get the number up there.  You can go ahead.  Thank you for listening.  I'm Didi and I live at the property  adjacent to this property.  Our fence would be  from the front to the back.  It's a wooden fence.  Yeah, we've lived there for  25 years, paid off our house.  We're not going anywhere, no matter what you do.  We have a pretty  strong neighborhood. Thank you.  Hicks Lane and these other  neighborhoods do too, but ours is pretty strong.  My concerns,  I emailed all of you and I appreciate  that you've read them. Some of you did respond.  I would be concerned  mostly about random gunshots  because I have grandchildren and they  would not be coming to my house.  The dog fights that one of them led to  a shooting and a death.  The overdoses,  the fire danger,  ironically that should be a fire station,  not a fire.  There's trees there and one little campfire  would be poof and my house would be gone.  So I appreciate you guys  and I think you're on track.  Thank you.  Carolyn Ferris followed by John Kelso.  I am here with 78 signatures  to this petition letter.  I am here to strongly express my opposition  to the proposed relocation of the homeless  camp on the corner of Hicks and Eden Avenue.  This location is far too close to the  residential homes and poses serious concerns  for the safety, security, and overall well-being  of those who live in the area.  While we understand the importance of addressing  homelessness in a compassionate and effective manner,  placing a camp so near to a neighborhood  is not a responsible or sustainable  solution. Residents deserve  to feel safe in their own homes and  locating a large encampment within  close proximity to family residences  risks creating significant public  safety, sanitation, and quality of life issues  for both residents and those living in the camp.  We respectfully urge the City Council  to consider alternative sites that do not directly  impact nearby neighborhoods and to prioritize  long-term humane solutions that provide  real pathways to stability and housing  rather than temporary placements  that create new problems.  I imagine this room would be full of my neighbors  had they been aware of this meeting.  I only learned about this myself yesterday at 3.30.  Thank you.  And we have 78.  And you can leave those with my signature.  Thank you.  So, John Kelso followed by Marty Long,  and let me get the time changed for you, John.  Good evening.  Some familiar faces here.  Aside from Chief Hack, I'm probably  the leading expert on fire protection in this room,  aside from some of my neighbors.  And we've been waiting 20 years  for our fire station.  I moved into that house in the Rosewood Estates  over 20 years ago.  I stood at this podium about 15 years ago,  based on my experience,  and I'm not going to talk about homelessness.  We can't fix that tonight.  But I'm going to tell you that your chief back in March  and in November told you  you have a problem out there.  I spent most of my career here in Chico  identifying those fire problems.  And we've been paying for it for 20 years.  So, I think that Hicks Lane should be off the table.  If it's not, you will see a very, very  motivated group of neighbors.  Far more than above Heritage Oaks,  far more than above Campaneros,  the Rosewood, and  Thank you, Mr. Kelso.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Marty Long followed by Laurie Mason.  Good evening.  Yes, I think moving the alternative site  to Eaton and Hicks  is a bad idea.  The only pro that I could see in that  is the news station  would just have a hop, skip,  and a jump  to carry  their cameras  right over to the site.  We're talking  you've already put major  money of our taxpayer dollars  into the current site.  We've got  liability at the roundabout  and we're not  going to be able to  We have my friend  Steve Blayhorn,  a neighbor,  literally his property  backs up 50 feet away from  that current property.  I'm going to have to beef up security  because we've already had problems  from the current site coming down  our street, getting in our trash cans,  and theft.  We've got trash breeding flies. Lori Mason followed by Carrie Burley. Hello. Thank you. As many of you know, I'm at the campsite at Eden and Cohasset every Friday. We provide showers for the unhoused.  is the people who are committing the crimes that you're all complaining about,  which I would too, are not the people in the campsite.  The people in the campsite are happy as all get out with what's going on right now.  They love that locked gate.  They don't want that riffraff in there, and they don't want the neighbors upset.  The man who showed up on that poor woman's doorstep was not even from our area.  He was not from the campsite.  So I just really want to make a plea that you leave it the way it is  and let people try to sort themselves out and get on to something better when the settlement ends.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Carrie Burley, followed by Carlos Cesar.  So hold on one second.  Let me just change the...  There you go.  This is my first meeting I'm coming to, but I'd like to see a show of hands.  Who's here for the Eaton and Hicks specifically?  Pretty much the whole room.  I just bought a house there last April, and had that site been there back then,  I would have never even thought of moving into a community with something so close because of the dangers.  I mean, look how many gunshots and all the violence that we see down the street.  You don't want that backing up to somebody's backyard like Dee Dee's.  It is the worst...  Well, it's a depot park.  There's no real good solution for this, but Eaton and Hicks has got to be the worst.  There's just too many communities.  My mother-in-law lives in that same community as us.  And I fear for her safety being in the front of the park, one of the easiest access houses, being burglarized.  They've already had trouble with people coming from that camp down the street.  And we just do not need that in our community.  Thank you.  Okay.  Thank you.  Carlos Cesar, followed by Stephen Hazel.  Thank you for the opportunity to address you.  The suggested parcel at Eaton and Hicks roundabout is not a safe location for motorists.  It's a homeless encampment.  My research indicates that homeless people are more prone to pedestrian fatalities than the average human being.  A couple of examples of that are San Jose.  So unhoused pedestrian deaths in 2021, 18 out of 23 fatalities were homeless people.  In Los Angeles, those experiencing homelessness are 53 more times, 53 times more likely to die in traffic  than housed.  In Chico and Dallas and Dallas and Dallas and Dallas and Dallas and Dallas and Dallas and  Yeah, Stephen Hazel  Is this your third meeting?  The third meeting and absolutely nothing done  We get to this point and nothing  And that's the best thing, of course  At the second meeting, oh it's absolutely unacceptable  Oh, but all of a sudden now, oh that's all we got  Just look at the Warren vs. Chico  You know what, you have the money  It's a Mormon church, I told you in closed session  5-14-2023  60 minute peace, that's it  300 billion dollars  If there's your money, I'm going to give you a billion dollars  No, you get half, you get a  Percentage of a half billion dollars, you get 200 million dollars  What would you do with that with a homeless?  You could build your tiny hometown in Chico  Dive in by Peshawar, right up there where the valley is  With hookups and everything  Half and half, look at this  Garbage you've got, you don't even have the homeless problem  I spent 14 months  At the Torrey Shelter, under Joy  And Torrey Taylor's story  You don't know nothing  Until you walk the walk  Until there's a button  I'm God, you ain't, and you know it  You wouldn't know if God was standing right in front of you  I'm standing right in front of you, yeah I am  Alright, that's time, thank you  Thank you, Charles Withoon, followed by Michael Morgan  Good evening, Mayor, Vice Mayor  Counselors and staff, thank you  Why  Isn't the alternate site  A good neighbor?  To say people are the problem  Misses understanding the circumstantial causes  Of their behavior  Turns out, people adapt  And react to their environment  With homelessness  Predicted to triple  In the next five years  Wouldn't it be more productive  Of us to ask  How can we create a camp  That is a good neighbor?  What are the features of successful  Camp programs?  After studying this issue  And visiting programs up and down  The west coast  We have found successful  Camps  Programs include a secure perimeter  That includes a gate monitor system  That is not 24-hour armed guards  Tent decks, micro-shelters, tiny homes  A common building for food storage  Washing dishes and meetings  Thank you  Thank you, Michael Morgan, followed by Timothy Shelley  Thank you  My name is Michael Morgan,  And I'm actually just to give you guys a face  To the residents of Eaton and Cohasset  I've lived there for several years now  And I have to say personally  I'm so very thankful to all of you  And grateful for the new things that have happened  And the gate being closed and so forth  Because we've been accused of so many things  I am not a convicted violent felon  I have no record whatsoever  I don't even have  I don't have one dog, okay  And I'm there with my partner  And we are assessed to be there  Because the attorneys got involved  And I'm just very grateful  Just to give a different view  That I've worked in this community for several years  At several gas stations  From Power Mart to Circle K  And to Speedway  And I love working at gas stations  I'm a Chico State grad  So I'm a psychology major  And I'm just very grateful  My homelessness, unfortunately, is due to my illness  And partly because of just depression and so forth  And that impacted just my whole attitude  Thank you very much  Thank you  Thank you  Timothy Shelley followed by Janet McMurray  Hey guys, it's my first time here  My name is Timothy Shelley  I live at that all-in site  I'm not a sexual offender  I'm not a thief  I try not to bother people  But  People label me  And I don't label other people  That's wrong  So I try not to be that way  You guys should come out and see the site  Each of you individually  Check it out  Talk to some people  Because you know what  If we don't have communication  Hey, I wouldn't want to live with a bunch of criminals  Right next to my house either  But we're not all criminals  You know, some of us have had  You know, circumstances that are way beyond us  Until we all start to look at each other right  You know, it ain't gonna change  Thank you  Thank you  Janet McMurray followed by Philip Simpson  My name is Janet McMurray  I'm a retired behavioral health nurse  I worked at Enloe Behavioral Health  So I have some understanding of homelessness  I currently live near  The Eaton and Hicks Lane proposed site  I know the current site  I've donated things there  Extra loaves of bread, produce  I've been in the site  I've heard about the shootings and stabbings  And I really don't want this moved closer to where I live  Because I'm afraid the crime will go up  And our property values will go down  We've lived in our house two years  We've improved our property  And so my husband and I are very concerned about that  Thank you  Thank you  Next speaker is Philip Simpson  Followed by John Nguyen  What they said  My request to the council is to look ahead  Rather than playing musical chairs with the existing site  Start planning for what it needs to look like in 15 months  The people will not be going away  It's more likely that more people are going to be coming  Your constituents don't want them moving back to the parks  The creek bed  And the empty lots  So the need for a solution is  That is humane  Promotes public safety  And is fiscally responsible  Will still be needed  Better to start now  Rather than trying to cobble something together at the last minute  Thank you  John Nguyen  Followed by Kay Sullivan  My name is John Nguyen  And I own the liquor store of  In Love and Cohesive  In Love and Cohesive  And  I  Every day  When I have to show up  Somebody sleeps in front of my store  And I'm a small guy  But I have to  Challenge myself  To tell them to move  And not to sleep right in front of my door  My store right now is  Nothing but negative  Because everything is still  Every single day  Calling the cop is not an option right now  Because by the time the cop shows up  I'm going to be in trouble  They already leave  So right now  I don't know what to do  I'm asking to see  If anyone can help me  Maintain  My place out there  And try to go out there  Every now and then  To check it out  To see  What is out there right now  Thank you  Kay Sullivan  Followed by Peter Hanson  Hello  I'm Kay Sullivan  I'm a lawyer  I'm also here because of the Hicks Lane alternate site  I've lived there my entire life  I bought my mother's house  I just moved my children in there  And we avoid the Cohasset area  As much as possible  Just because of what we do see  It's a horrible plight that we're going through  I don't say there's any easy solutions  However, moving them is not the solution  Endangering their residence  Is not the solution  And I think everybody here will agree with that  Thank you  Thank you  Peter Hanson  Followed by Laura  Excellent  Thank you, Madam Mayor  And Council Members  I'm Peter Hanson  And I'm a property owner  In the Bill Webb Homes  That were recently built off Hicks Lane  Having used the Eaton Circle intersection  Now for a year and a half  It's apparent to me that this intersection  Is perhaps the most dangerous in our city  The city is proposing to relocate the homeless camp  To within inches of the roundabout  That carries two lanes of freeway traffic  Speeding around at the same time  And the traffic is almost always interspaced  With almost constant traffic  From Eaton Road from both directions  Hicks Lane may occasionally get to use the circle  Without first stopping and waiting  But that's rare  My point is that this is an uncontrolled intersection  By which I mean there are no stop lights  No stop signs  No crosswalks even possible  I have never seen any pedestrian attempt to cross this circle  Nor would it ever be safe to do so  This proposed use of the land  To the northeast of the circle  Would place hundreds of persons  That's time, thank you  Thank you  Thank you, Laura Ekstrom  Followed by Ron Ekstrom  Good evening, my name is Laura Ekstrom  My husband and I live on Eaton Road  Just one lot away from the proposed site  We have three children and one on the way  And we also have three  We also have three rentals that we have  With tenants and tenants  That also have children  I understand the city is looking to be moving the camp  Because of safety concerns  The proposed location at Eaton and Hicks  Is right next to one of the busiest roundabouts in Chico  And it's surrounded by families  My tenants have children  Just like I said  One just welcomed a newborn baby two days ago  My daughter plays basketball in the front yard every morning  And my kids frequently swing  On the swing outside  These are the kids who will lose the safety of being outside  If this camp is moved next door  I know your motives are aligned with ours  But I'm here to ask to see  How this decision will drastically change  The daily lives of our families  Who live in this neighborhood  I respectfully ask  Please choose a safer alternative  That doesn't put more families at risk  Thank you  Thank you, Ron Ekstrom  Followed by Allison Jeffers  I think the cue card was wrong  It's Ben Ekstrom  I'm Laura's husband  I live two properties away from the proposed  Eaton and Hicks  Hicks Lane campsite  And I just wanted to let you guys know  That we oppose that  We had the opportunity to learn about this Friday  Laura made out some flyers  We walked around the whole neighborhood  Hopefully some of you guys saw me knocking on your doors  We have a great neighborhood  Filled with people that don't want this  It definitely will impact our lives  And I think you guys mentioned  Moving the site isn't going to solve the problem  It's just going to create a problem for us  We already incur a problem with it  At the end of the road where it is now  We've had multiple thefts  Burglaries  And what not  Thank you  Thank you  Allison Jeffers  Followed by Curtis Gedney  Hi, I'm Allison Jeffers  And I kind of just want to  Elaborate on the Hicks location  That it's not a good choice  For safety concerns, traffic concerns  Just like everyone has mentioned here tonight  I do understand you have a hard decision ahead of you  But I really want to make sure that you guys are aware of that  I really think that the choice at that location  Is not a smart one  It's going to put public safety at risk  Children, families  And that is something that we need to consider  The crime will go up  Property values will go down  And that's not right to those families  Thank you  Curtis Gedney  Followed by Joe Valine  Good evening  We can send a man a moon  But we can't get along with our neighbor  You know  We've got to do something  About this  And it's kind of hard  Because we live in a thriving town  I was homeless 12 years ago  I liked going to the Tiger Ponds  I recommend Tiger Ponds  Because there's four different accesses  To Tiger Ponds  One goes into the 20th Street Park  One goes over to the 7-Eleven store  One goes over the  New bridge that was just built  And they can go over there  And get supplies from Walmart  Or they're right across the  They're close to  Jesus Center  And 30 acres  Put space between people  And they live comfortable  Tiger Ponds is 30 acres  That's a lot of homeless people  Thank you  Thank you  Joe Valine  Followed by Tom Hobbs  Or Hobbs  I apologize  Thank you for your time  My name is Joe Valine  I work for a company called Pacific Coast Supply  That's been serving the community  For nearly 50 years  And we're grateful to be part of the  Hicks and East Coast Supply  We're a community of people  That's been eating property  And surrounded by great neighbors  And booming developments  And I understand there's tough decisions ahead  But we're here really to help  Be part of the building of this community  And new roofs  And houses that are getting built every day  And I've seen this in other markets  That we have stores in  And it typically leads to a decline  And people feeling safe  To do business in where these communities are  And I just ask that we don't transfer  This problem to  To this neighborhood  Versus we just figure out  What the right solution is  For these folks  To give them a good place to be  So thank you  Thank you  Tom Hobbs  Followed by Sherry Dixon  Hi, thank you  I appreciate all your comments earlier  My name is Tom Hobbs  I manage Rancho Chico Mobile Home Park  On Hicks Lane  That's 212 space family mobile home park  Altogether there's probably  Families, men, women, and children  Four to five hundred persons  We already have our share of  Crime and petty theft  Recently I called  Chico PD  And asked for  Not extra patrols  But just patrols, period  The answer was  We only have six officers on at night  So we'll see what we can do  So I don't see how  If that  Proposed camp  Moved closer  To our community  How are you going to patrol  And keep us safe  Most of my residents  A lot of people are here  And they're up in arms  I got a lot of calls today  Thank you  Thank you  Sherry Dixon  Followed by Courtney Woodcocks  Hi, I'm Sherry Dixon  I'm one of the people  That live on Hicks Lane  Close to the Rancho Chico  Mobile Home Park  I don't see where this is  Anywhere a positive thing  To transfer them to the Hicks Lane  Eaton area  It's a busy road  Just like everybody said  And as a resident  I don't see it as a positive thing  Thank you  Thank you  Courtney Woodcocks  Followed by Lynn Overholzer  Hi guys, thank you  It sounds like  We're all on the same page  I strongly oppose  The Eaton area  I'm right down the street as well  So I just wanted to put that out there  Thanks  Thank you  Lynn Overholzer  Followed by Adam Pierce  Hello  I will say I was disappointed  When I saw the list  That some of the more creative ideas  We talked about  My last two times I was here  Did not make the list  What about  Separating some of the pallet shelters off  From the existing Genesis site  And they could go there  And make it completely separate  A wall, a separate entrance  A separate name  What about  We've had churches volunteer  To have tiny homes  In their parking lots  There's only eight people left  I believe we're down to eight  Because we were told  Ten people were leaving  Eight authorized people  That need a place to go  None of these  None of these other choices  Are appropriate  And you know  You can put a water tank in there  And a water tank on parking lots  Doesn't have to be a piece of land  I'm hoping personally tonight  That you don't vote on any of these  Because none of them are appropriate  And some of our other ideas  Of thinking a little bit more out of the box  I think check all the boxes  And I hope you get another list  From city staff to consider  Thank you  Thank you  Adam Pierce  Followed by Kathleen Yeder  Thank you, council  I want to echo the sentiment  From others that have wanted to keep  The alternate site at its current location  It is a no-win situation  But I think it could be made  Slightly more effective  If we took those relocation funds  And like council member Winslow said  Maybe increased services  I mean, heck  Beautify the street in 15 months  To maybe make up for the residents  That have lived there  So I fully support  Keeping the location  In its current location  Thank you  Kathleen Yeder  Followed by Corey Cole  Hi  If you can pull the mic down  Just a little bit  There you go  Thank you  And I live on Silver Bell  Which is on the other side  Of Eaton  And I and my neighbors  Were pretty much all elderly  Except like I'm raising my grandchildren  I don't really need extra foot traffic  Just before I came here  There was somebody on the back side  Of my property  I had to get up and tell them to leave  I think that the homeless camp  Is going to make us unsafe  Probably trash and garbage  And the roundabout right there  There are sidewalks  On one side  But I drive down Eaton Road  Every day  Past the homeless shelter  That it currently is  There's people crossing the street  Not in the crosswalk  You move it to Hicks and Eaton  And somebody's going to get killed  Probably more than one person  Walking across that roundabout  And I think for the costs  That would be involved  In moving the homeless camp  Spend that money  And improve the current existing site  Otherwise you're just moving  The problems to a different neighborhood  Thank you  Thank you  Corey Cole followed by Chris Nelson  Yes, hello  A lot of my neighbors  Made some really good points here today  And made some good arguments  I do want to cover two points though  The off-ramp there  For all the northbound traffic  Coming off the freeway  Goes through that roundabout  And currently there are  A crosswalk there  But it would bring  Whoever's using that crosswalk  Right to that corner  On Hicks Lane and Eaton Road  My children do use that crosswalk  They drive the city bus home  They do  Effectively our access  To public transportation  On Hicks Lane  Will be cut off  And we will not be able  To use public transportation  And so I do want to make that point  Thank you  Chris Nelson followed by Joe Schultz  Hi, good night  I just wanted to say  That I think  That unhoused people  Are tough and resilient  And I'm amazed  At their ability to stay alive  And the conditions  That they're faced with  So kudos to them  But the thing that is true  Is that oftentimes  They have what we would consider  To be antisocial behaviors  And Charles Withune says  By creating a place  That has no security  An unsanitary water delivery system  No common building  No co-management  We have created  This antisocial environment  And when you apply  Externally apply  Rules and regulations on people  It doesn't work as well  With free wild people  As it would  As if it was coming  From within them  You've done a lot of the things  That Charles Withune suggested  In terms of a managed campground  So his ideas have been  Slowly filtering into your head  And everyone admits  That things are going better  My only thing is  More homeless people need shelter  And so I'd suggest  Also using the  That's time  That's time  Thank you  Fair Street  Thank you  Campground for more people  Thanks  Thank you  Joe Schultz  Followed by Robin McCone  Evening, guests and members  My name is Joe Schwartz  And I'm a public property owner  Off of Hicks  I'm speaking out to  That location  A number of points  I came here to speak about  About ten or so  But they've hit so many of them  That I'm going to hit  Just one of them  Which is probably  Need to be emphasized  I'm a business and estate  Planning attorney here in Chico  And I'm going to  Talk about this  So several people  Come to me  To seek risk mitigation tactics  And avoidance tactics  I think that with that roundabout  You pose two significant  Risk issues there  One is vehicles going around  The roundabout  It's a spectacle driving by  The current encampment  Which you probably know  Police officers, dogs  People walking across the street  I think that with that spectacle  It's harder to look away from it  When you pass it  And so people will be more prone  To auto accidents  Around that roundabout  So that's a significant risk  Secondly, you'll see people  Walking across the roundabout  On multiple occasions  And I'm sure  In addition to the easy access to 99  Which poses a risk to physical harm  To the person  So I think two significant issues  Which would lead me  To moving that off the list entirely  Thank you  Thank you  Robin McCollum  Followed by George Deeds  Go ahead, George  I'll go ahead  Hello  Yeah, don't move it  Back yourself up  By taking the money  That you're going to spend  And get the hourly perimeter checks  You know, I work at a place like this  And we deal with a lot of people  Who are their friends  That are outside the gate  And we're lucky  Because we're surrounded by cameras  Help those neighbors  Hook up the cameras  Get faster police response time  Over there  You know, yeah  They are good people  But there's a lot of bad people too  And so I encourage you guys  To spend that money  And help in  Working with the police  And beef up  You know, get the perimeter checks  And help the neighborhood  By putting up more cameras  And get a faster police response  Thanks  Thank you  Nancy Park  Followed by Mark Tennyson  Sorry  First of all  I'd like to say this  As somebody who's been  On the board of CHAT  For four years  In the past  Having said that  I feel like the stories  That are coming from  The police  And the neighbors  At the current site  Are legitimate  And they're compelling  As a result  This needs to be  A managed campground  It sounds like perhaps  It will stay where it is now  And when I say managed  24-7 security  Nobody's going to like  Wherever this place is put  But there are some  Bad actors  And we need to  Protect the neighbors  And some of the neighbors  And some of the neighbors  Somehow get it  More managed site  Charles McEwen  Has talked a long time  About a managed site  So I can see both sides  But I really do feel  For the neighbors  Thank you  Mark Tennyson  Followed by James Ingersoll  Good evening  My name's Mark Tennyson  I've heard some  Very good concerns  Here tonight  I don't envy your decision  But there's a couple of points  I want to make  One is Shasta Elementary  One is Shasta Elementary  Goes without saying  DeGarmo Park  Goes without saying  Our children  Throughout all  Our neighborhood children  Use DeGarmo Park  Secondly  Or thirdly  PDQ  These places are going to  Become a destination  For these folks  Our children use PDQ  As a candy store  So the one last thing  That I want to say  Is that a lot of us  In this neighborhood  Sold our homes  Throughout Chico  And we made it  Move to the frontier  Of North Chico  To get away from these issues  They're following us  Consider it  Please  Thank you  Thank you  James Ingersoll  Followed by Robin McCullen  If he's here  So  Just wanted to  I just wanted to add  That it sounds like  Moving the homeless camp  From where it is  To any residential area  Would be a bad idea  It's like putting a band-aid  On something that needs stitches  I suggest you just  Use the money  That we would be  Moving everybody  To any residential area  In Chico  To beef up the  Existing area  That it is right now  Thank you  Thank you  And then I'm just going to ask again  If Robin is in the audience  I don't see him  I saw him earlier  But I don't see him right now  I don't see him now  So that's it  For our speakers  Mayor  All right  Further discussion  Further discussion  Comments from the council  Council member Goldstein  Sure  Yeah  Thanks everybody  For coming out tonight  It's good to see so much  Public interest  And  I am really glad to see  So many positive comments  Where not only are you concerned  About the effects that  A potential move of this camp  Could have for you  But also the suggestions  Of how we can do better  At whatever  A site like this looks like  I appreciate those  And I want to echo  Those comments  And the feedback  That I think  My council members  Up here had provided earlier  That we could perhaps discuss  How to make the existing site  Safer  Better secured  So that we can not have  Those negative impacts  On our community  Or for the people  Who live there  So yeah  I definitely  Would not support  Moving this to Hicks Lane  We've heard that loud and clear  I also think it's notable  That we haven't really heard  A lot of input  About the other potential sites  Proposed  Although those weren't  Really ranked in the  Top choices  Recommended by staff anyway  Because of so many concerns  Already noted with them  Not yet  Okay  Council Member  Winslow  Go ahead  Well first off  It's really refreshing  To have so many different voices  In this conversation  Talking about homelessness  Not  You know I know  It's about your neighborhood  For the most part  But in general  This has been  One of the outstanding features  Of being on the city council  Like for years  Like way before my time  It's been  One of the most tense issues  In local politics  And nowadays  I talk to the people  That have been present  In the conversations  For like many years  Like going all the way back  To like simplicity villages  As a tiny house village concept  That got  I guess tanked  Like in 2019  And people are just  Exhausted in dealing with it  And I am too  Kind of  So I have a hard time  Like I don't want to encourage  People to come out  To these things  Because we don't need  The new information  So there's some very  Intelligent advocates  Who make really good cases  But we've really heard  It all before  Here  And just in the last few years  The things that like  Put people down  Like we've had the city  Like trying to shut down  Safe space winter shelter  Complicating them  We've had these  Really convoluted  Bureaucratic hurdles  For the concept  Of trying to do  Some sort of like  Non-congregate shelter option  Around from different groups  Even just one year ago  I tried to have a discussion  On the Eaton Classic Campground  It failed without a second  So we've come a long way  And I think it's  It's a good time  For people to have  Some energy  For really figuring out  What in the long run  We do in regard to this  Just as far as  What Eaton Classic is  Or this concept  Of having a campground  Somewhere for people  Who don't fit into shelters  That exist for whatever reason  Like many years ago  I remember it being talked about  As a sanctioned campground  And then we got into  The settlement agreement  And this place opened up  And it had never occurred  To me really  That you would  Sanction a campground  And just leave it  Entirely unmanaged  Like I just  I imagined that  The city would do something  To make it  Work a little better  So then we start talking  About managed campgrounds  If you look in like  Letters to the Enterprise Record  Or something  You see people talking about  Managed campgrounds  For a long time  And then  With this like  Steady stream of  Gradual improvements  That the city's done  We've had these elements  Of management  Which are not in and of themselves  Like they don't fulfill  Maybe the promise  But it's like  Well there's water  There's a fence  You know we talk about  These little incremental improvements  And so I feel like  We need to advance  The conversation a little more  Into like what are the elements  Of management that we're missing  And what I have come to  And what I'm hearing  From a lot of people's  Experience out there  Living near the camp  Volunteering within the camp  Living in the camp  Is that we lack a monitor  That's one of the main things  It's definitely a bill  To have somebody  To sit in the place  But you had something  Like Project Roomkey  We had people off the streets  During COVID  In motel rooms  They had monitors  All throughout there  So the way that I see it  Is we have like three  There's three options  That we have here  And how to move forward  None of them involve  Moving the site  This time  But one is that we  Find a way to have city staff  Provide that role as a monitor  Work it out  With existing staff somehow  Maybe we do  De-emphasize the activities  Maybe we have to hire  Somebody new  The other is that we put out  An RFP  Request for Proposals  That is  To ask some other organization  To provide that for us  You know we have  The Jesus Center  Providing some services  That is not monitoring  The site  They're not responsible  For issues that we've  Talked about  And the third is that  If it's under $50,000  We don't need to put out  A request for proposals  And we could just hand  And we could just offer  A proposal to  North State Shelter Team  That has been consistently present  Asking to provide  That sort of service  They've had a lot  Of different proposals  They have been complicated  By bureaucrat requirements  But things that I think  That with a shelter crisis  Declaration that we still have  We could bypass  So those are the three things  That I think we could do  I'm interested in what  Other council members think  But bottom line is  It's worth the money  I think at this point  For the next 15 months  Of this site  And its current character  Under the settlement agreement  Council Member Noberbeck  Yeah so  Clearly these people  Need some  Supervision  The problem is  24-7 monitoring  That sounds great  So what's that really mean?  Well if people are going to work  Five days a week  For 40 hours  That means to have  24-7 supervision  You've got to have four people  Right?  Well you've got  Some violent people out there  That have been in gun battles  You're going to leave  Somebody out there  By themselves  Well that doesn't make any sense  So you're really talking about  Two people  Times four  Which is eight  So we're over a million bucks  A year  It's just not feasible  It's not  It doesn't make sense  Having the police  Go out there more often  That makes sense  Maybe having the Jesus Center  Go out there more often  Having public works  Go out there more often  But having full-time  Monitoring  Is not financially viable  Vice Mayor Bennett  So I want to thank everybody  For coming out this evening  It's good to see you  I recognize some of you  Since I've been here  So many years  But it's good to hear from you  It's good to hear  How concerned you are  About this possibility  Which I don't think  Is going to happen  And I am open to  Considering some improvements  To the alternate site one  Where we are  I think that should be discussed  More vigorously  And take a look at  What we can do  Within reason  I will always go back to  Within reason  And Mr. Van Orbeck  You brought up a good point  There are a lot of people  Who are concerned  About the financial constraints  To what we could do  Or possibly consider to do  So I'm open to that discussion  I hope we have it  And we'll take a look  At making those improvements  To the existing site  Thank you for your time  Councilmember Hawley  I'd also like to thank  Everyone who came out  To share their input  I think it's really important  That we have thoughtful discussions  And I was very impressed with  The  The attitude of these discussions  Whether it be from storefront owners  People living near the proposed sites  People living in the alternate site  There's a lot of respect shown  Not only to council  But to each other as residents  And I really appreciate that  So regarding the considerations  Expressed by the Hicks residence  I am trying to equally apply that  To all of the alternate options  That were included in the proposal  Is included by staff  Because not every neighborhood group  Has the organization necessary  To come and speak to city council  In that manner  So I'm going to be applying that logic  To all of the sites included  On the staff report  In regards to councilmember Winslow's  Proposals of it lacking monitoring  I 100 percent agree  I am more inclined to pursue  The financial options of an RFP  To contract out security  I worry especially  I would look to Chief Aldridge  To comment on this  But one of the speakers mentioned  That there are only six officers  On it and it's really  So we have really stretched  Capacity for that role  Especially in such a specialized  Staff member  I would hate to take them away  From their regular duties  To monitor in that way  And then also naming a specific organization  To monitor that I don't  Have and it's really  don't have much confidence has experience with that monitoring um that would be required of them  i'm i'm a little skeptical of of your third option as well but rfp to contract out security i'm  curious to hear more from staff what they think of that option council member o'brien  thank you mayor so first i love when neighborhoods galvanize for their safety i'm a strong advocate  for that and for you it is really neighborhood watch on steroids so well done i like that  second i want to thank staff for a thankless job they were given a task that is impossible and i  do appreciate the effort and there really was no solution at least right now as far as another  location but thank you for those efforts so i will be supporting keeping the location as it is which  which is tough for many reasons, as these neighbors like Ms. Overholzer  and businesses like Mr. Wynn have communicated to us over the last several weeks.  They have borne the brunt of these very significant issues.  But we need a better alternative than what we heard tonight.  So I want us to keep pursuing better options,  to include winding down the site and imposing enhanced public safety measures,  and basic common sense rules.  Common sense measures and rules that protect those impacted neighborhoods and businesses.  I will say it again, as I said last time, we need more creativity.  I think we have 17 people in the site as it currently sits,  and six that may be moving into shelters soon.  You're telling me we can't?  You can't figure out something better for 11 people in this community?  I think we can.  I will not accept that we can't.  I'm going to go if that's okay.  Can I make one quick?  Sure.  So I really appreciate everybody coming out.  And in early 22, they wanted to put one of these, before I was on the council,  they wanted to put one of these camps near Marsh Junior High.  And at that time,  I had the record for turning out the most number of people to oppose having a camp  next to Marsh Junior High.  And the gentleman back here with the lovely family, with the hat on, put your hand.  He, I'm happy to say, you bested me, sir.  You have the record for turnout.  Thank you.  So I don't know where we're going to go from tonight or what we're going to do.  But I can tell you that I will continue to advocate to get rid of where it is right now,  because it is in my district.  And, however, an answer is not moving it to the other side of my district on Hicks Lane.  So that's not going to work.  We're failing.  This is not working.  The Jesus Center is stepping up and doing what they have been able to do,  given the limited amount of resources and their one hand tied behind their back  and one leg tied, you know, the old.  Kicking contest.  They've been able to do amazing things, given what they have.  So I don't know.  I don't think we're, obviously, I don't see the support anywhere up here to move it from where it is right now.  But I just want everyone in this room to remember and understand how every one of you feel  or how the people who live and work across from Eaton feel every single day  for over three years.  For over three years.  For over three years.  For over three years.  I see a gentleman in the audience tonight who did not speak,  who I cannot tell you how many thousands of dollars worth of pipe and sprinkler he's had to replace.  There's somebody in there that does massage, facial therapy, and everything else.  And she says, Casey, you know, it's not just that the camp's there.  It's not just that.  Like, it's hard enough to have every single one of your clients that come in.  I have to keep the door locked now.  I've got to let everybody in one at a time.  Like, I've got to do all these things.  But every single client that comes in,  wants to talk about it for their whole entire hour session.  My life is consumed every single day by what's happening there.  So what's happening cannot continue to happen.  So I'm going to make some recommendations.  I don't know where it's going to go.  I don't think we can afford to have city staff out there.  Our city staff's really expensive, so possibly an RFP to have something done.  We have got to up and enhance the code of conduct that is out there.  There is a code of conduct.  They do have to.  They have to sign.  And it is being enforced.  But that enforcement is limited.  So we need to correct whatever Amber needs to,  and Ms. Abney Bass, I'm sorry, needs to take care of that.  There cannot be freaking large structures that are built out of scaffolding.  It's ridiculous.  If there is a fire that starts in that place right now,  it is going to go from camp to camp to camp.  There needs to be delineated camps.  You know, George, I don't know if you're looking for a job,  but if you know how to manage something,  maybe we need to hire George.  I don't know what it is.  Apparently staffs, maybe we have a limit.  Maybe there's no more than five people at each site.  Maybe we need to have multiple sites.  Maybe District 2 doesn't need to bear all the brunt of this.  Maybe if it's only three people,  maybe there's some other sites that could be looked at that were not on this.  But no, Eaton and Hicks is not the place.  I doubt that, you know, anyways.  I would like staff to possibly give us some ideas.  If we can give you some direction.  And some ideas to come back with some items.  We need to do better.  What's that?  Can I ask a question?  Sure.  Mr. Gustafson, you manage a lot of operations.  It's in your name badge there.  There's four words and operations is one of them.  How, you know, Council Member Van Overbeek threw out some numbers  that would be like over a million dollars.  That would be like a full-time monitoring at probably pretty good rates.  What do you think we can do in terms of even if it's just for the select area of the day,  we find that there's the biggest issues?  Hiring the pretty bare minimum like monitoring presence out there.  Depends on the time required.  I mean, if we're looking at 24-7, then yeah, that's very realistic.  Depending on who's doing it, what type of safety measures that are required.  You know, are we doubling people up?  That sort of thing.  There's a lot of different variables.  You know, senior maintenance worker in my department is fully burdened as $150,000.  You know, we could do, you know, dynamic scheduling if we don't need to do 24-7 monitoring.  I think we could, you know, look at swing shifts, that type of thing.  I think when there's the most activity might be beneficial.  So we could definitely look at some options and come back with some, you know,  some prices associated with those options and maybe address some pros and cons or concerns  of either having one or two staffing folks out there or, you know, another organization out there,  what times might be appropriate, so on and so forth.  Thank you.  I'm a little hesitant to like throw it out that it's like we're going to care something back.  I know that it'll just be like months before anything happens.  We're really talking about next 15 months.  But however decisive other council members want to be, I think that that's the way to go.  It doesn't have to be the 24-7.  And the same principle that we don't have the same number of police officers on at night  as we do during the day.  I think we can be smart about allocating our resources and still get the effect  of having it not be an entirely unmanaged situation anymore  and having it not be the business owners are alone when people are wandering off site  or people are running out of time.  They're lingering around the site and going into their businesses and wrecking havoc.  Are we ready for a motion?  If you'd like to make one, sure.  Well, since this was Councilmember O'Brien's item,  I'd like to defer to him if he would like to make the motion.  Yeah, I think we need to look at this deeper, this particular site.  I want all of us to understand exactly what the code of conduct rules are,  what those...  things we have imposed, what we can impose.  I don't think we've done everything that we can do.  Again, that's not staff's problem.  That's a policy problem on our end.  I would like to have that brought back and then beef everything regarding that up,  regarding all these different rules and measures that'll make, again, our community,  our neighborhoods and businesses safer.  I want to revisit that and look at that and bring some solid things back to this council.  So we can do just that.  That's going to be my motion is to have staff bring that back.  We can have certainly Amber present as well.  And then if we need to look at hiring security, whatever that is,  to enhance those safety measures and protect those community folks that have been so impacted over the last three years,  I'm all for that.  I've spent a little money to do that.  I'm all for that.  But we need to take a deeper dive into this and get this done.  I'm sorry.  Before we take a vote, I'm not sure I understand.  That's a pretty broad ask.  It is broad.  I want us to take a deeper dive into the existing site as to what the existing code of conduct rules are,  what we have imposed on the site to date,  what can we impose on those in the future to keep, again, our community safe.  I want a more vigorous discussion on that.  Okay.  So.  I'm sorry.  It's the motion that we want to keep the campsite where it is, but we want the staff to come back with ways to enhance security and the rules at the site so it functions better and has less impact on the neighborhood.  So I think it was very clear that I have no desire to move that site.  We're going to keep it as it is, is my recommendation and my motion.  But I want to look at that site and everything that we're doing so far and what can we do differently to make it so that we can keep it where it is.  and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find it and find  of wandering off such as  cooking facilities things like  that also could help prevent  fire perhaps.  that is a friendly amendment  we can have that conversation as  a broader conversation I'  willing to have that but really  what I want to focus on is the  safety for the neighbors and  businesses but we can have that  conversation as well.  I think for the most part  that falls into safety but I  think if I need to do a  friendly amendment to perhaps  include some other verbiage like  livability of the site then that  would be my friendly amendment.  I will accept that.  I'  m really inclined to support  it because I think us having  these discussions is good and  all but also we have been at  this for so long and we have  heard about the code of conduct  we were talking about it as it  became a thing.  Over two years ago now I think  there is a lot of discussion  about it and I think we have  so much information out there  and I don'  t know that we need to deep  dive analyze it in order to  find the solution I think that  just empowering staff and saying  that our expectation is that we  have some more form of  monitoring management out there  or we at least take steps to  have contract and other  organizations provide that we  can be more decisive at this  point than just forwarding it  for a future discussion of  ourselves.  I completely agree.  I mean Addison Council Member  Winslow touched on that we have  already been briefed on the code  of conduct we have already  discussed that and we have  really gotten a deep dive from  staff and from the Jesus Center  on the improvements that have  been made in really full detail  not very long ago so I don'  t understand essentially doing  that again so I would like to  support it but I would rather be  more specific on come back with  what RFP for monitoring could  look like.  My motion is to enhance  that not just look at it but to  enhance it and that'  s a conversation that I want to  have.  So I'  m willing to accept that  Council Member Goldstein'  s friendly amendment and I'  ll leave it as that.  So we have a motion and a  second.  Can I just put on the record  that I would request that  enhance would also mean a  complete removal and reset of  at least looking at the  opportunity like you did I don'  t know was that eight months or  a year ago where we completely  removed everything and cleaned  and start up and set everybody  in a nice and I think it would  be a great opportunity.  Very nice for the neighbors so  at least to look at a complete  reset for the site.  That'  s part of the discussion as  well.  I just want to put it on the  record.  Can we start off with a  comment from the city manager?  I see a desire to comment.  Desire to jump in.  I was going to address  your comment about aside from  the motion we can certainly  explore well and we have since  this whole thing was thrust  upon the city.  I think it was to say that it  was half baked is something of  an understatement.  But we can certainly follow the  proposed motion but  simultaneously we can be looking  at some solutions to what we'  ve heard tonight.  I would appreciate if the  council just includes that sort  of the spirit of direction.  I would say keep it to well under  a million ideally but just keep  it to well under a million. You know, I would say to keep it to well under a million ideally, but just go and do it. You know, you know what needs to be done. I think and I think there's the emphasis here and this is what everybody coming out maybe has contributes to is that their sense of this is urgent enough that it requires some more action than we've taken over the years.  find it and find it and find it  and find it and find it and  find it and find it and  find it and find it and  year, then that doesn't even begin to include the amount of public work staff time and PD time.  All right. So we have a motion and a second. If the clerk could take the roll. If we want to  bring this back in two weeks, would we need to include that in the motion? Yes. And we can do  that and I can. So I'll make that request. Okay. In two weeks. Okay. So it's a motion by  Council Member O'Brien, seconded by Council Member Van Overbeek to direct staff to bring  back options on existing site to enhance it. What is there? What are the rules, code of conduct?  What can the city impose? And Council Member O'Brien, you mentioned a policy problem and that  Council should probably talk about it. Then beef up all the different rules and measures that can  make our neighborhood safer. There was a friendly amendment requested to look at minor changes to  the site. For example, cooking facilities, livability. And then the mayor also mentioned,  you know, resetting the sites where they are.  So we have to have them stay within their areas. And it will come back in two weeks.  You're really good. Well done.  It's like you just started doing this.  I just started yesterday. Okay. All right. Council Member Goldstein?  Yes.  Council Member Hawley?  Yes.  Council Member O'Brien?  Yes.  Council Member Van Overbeek?  Yes.  Council Member Winslow?  Yes.  Vice Mayor Bennett?  Yes.  Mayor Reynolds?  Aye.  Okay. And it carries.  Because it's going to make it better.  Hopefully.  Okay. It carries 7-0.  All right. And we are going to take a quick break. [inaudible]  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right. Item 5.2, growth and community development ad hoc committee update.  All right. Item 5.2, growth and community development ad hoc committee update. Who's taking it away? Mr. Van Overbeek or Mr. Winslow? Whoever opens the document first.  whoever opens the document  first.  the  council.  last time we had a conversation  about this at council what we  asked staff to do Mr. Veague was  to look at the recommendations  and come back with the staff'  s response and he has done that.  It'  s really up to Mr.  Veague to tell us what the staff  thinks of the recommendations do  you have anything to add?  I don'  t know if I'  d say it'  s up to you to tell us it'  s up to us to accept the  recommendations but basically what we have here is a  phasing plan for the things we said we wanted to  do.  thank you Mr.  Veague.  Some are wrapped in with scheduled code updates we have  coming forward some are involved in the nexus fee study  so they'  re going to be paired in with that.  There was never the intention that all these things would be  done all at once just logistically things get more  complicated so looking at the existing workload they just kind  of ranked where when they can take place.  There'  s any one of these things also I'  m happy to have the discussion if anybody wants to on any  particular one and when they say it might happen.  But I  think it'  s not the last opportunity to talk on it everything has to be  approved in a material form which is going to have another  hearing associated with it.  And most of that Mr.  Veague is something you want to share?  my understanding was you got these recommendations from the  ad hoc committee.  Excuse my voice I'  m fine.  You got the recommendations from the ad hoc committee council was  like this is a lot to digest and then you directed your two committee  chairs to meet with staff which they did.  We have a lot of work to do.  and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and  and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and  and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and  and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and  and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and  and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and  and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and  the planning commission and  staff would be able to say these  other ideas are all great ideas  that'  s what'  s in staff'  s responses and they would be  tiered into subsequent code  amendments updates investigations  that take time that would include  staff going to the planning  commission getting recommendations  and coming to you with that staff  says they all look good for  investigation and then there'  s a process we would  follow to bring it back to you  and it wouldn'  t be in one big plug  it would be over time.  I think what our recommendation  is that we see the schedule and  it all makes sense to us and this  is the pace we'  re seeking for.  the one glaring omission here  is the committee agreed that there  is not enough infill land that it  makes sense to have a plan for  housing system that makes it  financially viable to meet the  housing needs to accommodate the  growth forecasted growth of the  city.  Particularly as it relates to  single family houses.  We need to build roughly 300  350 units a year and last year I  think we built 100.  So one of the things that'  s missing here is  how do we accommodate more single  family homes and we think the big  opportunity might be the north  chico spa.  What'  s holding that back is the  infrastructure requirements that  was initially conceived as a mixed  use commercial residential area  and I don'  t think anybody believes  that commercial makes any sense  there so it would be all  residential which changes the  infrastructure requirements.  So that'  s something that we'  ve got to  think about.  I think we'  ve got a chicken and egg  thing.  On one hand when I talked to  Mr.  bieber about it he said we'  ll have somebody come to  us with a proposal and I think  nobody wants to put a proposal  together because they look at the  infrastructure requirements and  say that'  s too daunting but we  can work that out.  there aren'  t currently any requirements per  se there'  s a north chico spa our  special planning area in chico  is previously known as the core  area of the north chico specific  plan adopted by the county 25  years ago. All the single family  has gone up there outside of the  city limits and that core area  has some underlying assumptions  that were more manufacturing  commercial some residential some  multifamily. Those assumptions  were carried over into our  general plan. We'  discussions about that but as some  of you who are familiar with the  general plan the special planning  areas are pre-zoned they are  areas to be studied and to  include a proposal that'  s fairly  consistent with what'  s in the general plan.  We don'  t know if somebody wants to  propose all single family that'  s why it would be through that  process that we would determine  what ultimately the infrastructure  needs are. It'  s hard to figure how we would  have that investigation absent a  proposal. I don'  t know if it'  s chicken and egg  because we heard tonight for instance people talking about  the roundabout at eaton and 99.  The secondary access that'  s contemplated by the county'  s plan for that core that  secondary access going over creek  was to offset the  construction of the !  construction of the !  All those trips coming that way  but absent a proposal it'  s hard to  come up with a getting rid of  something that'  s contemplated by the county'  s plans. I don'  t know what the council wants  to do if they want us to run  some scenarios that'  s something that  can be coordinated with public  works that would require some  assumptions and studies.  I think we can that'  s too early to talk about  but we'  ve got this list of  recommendations what you'  re saying Mr.  Veague is the way we should deal  with it is as you get ready to  adopt this into code the council  can deal with these specific  recommendations at that time and  the staff responses?  These ones before us for sure.  Okay.  All right.  Any other council member comments  we'  ll take speakers?  We can take speakers first.  Okay how many speakers do we have?  We have four.  All right three minutes each.  Okay.  Steven Hazel followed by Eric Nielsen.  All right and it is and it is  and it is  and it is We wrote 612. We did exactly 612. We did exactly 612. Okay. Here we go. How's he, man? That's my one. You always cut me off. Tell me, go home. You have parties to go home. I live in Notre Dame, East 20. You know what's going on out there? You look out my window, you see a farmer's market. You look out my window, you see a farmer's market. You see these big buildings with, man, it looks like snow-covered mountains.  It looks like snow-covered mountains.  They're covered in plastic.  You know why?  Defective housing.  You know, I got a, you know my unicorn?  You know I'm a German carpenter.  You know that?  My son's a simple carpenter.  You know that?  You know who I am?  Yeah, you know who I am.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I am.  I got Vaughn here.  He's got Vaughn here.  He did.  He did.  He already came back a second time.  He missed it.  Doesn't matter.  Watch this.  I'm the real guy.  I'm right here.  I'm the guy.  Yeah, I am.  I'm 12-6.  I'm December 6.  My father, December 7.  You know, you've got a park here, Knights and Hazel.  Is that my father?  See, I got a connection here.  Knights and Hazel.  That's my father.  He was nine years old with Pearl Harbor.  It doesn't matter.  The housing?  No way.  That's just horrible.  See, you're scammed.  It's like mobile homes.  It's like Santa Clara.  What's happened to Santa Clara is going to happen to you.  You guys are being raped by these developers, man.  They go, oh my God.  You don't need housing.  No way.  You don't have a tax base.  You don't got no money.  It's just a drain on your general fund.  All housing is a call for service.  Fire, everything.  It's just a drain.  You don't need housing.  You need to fix up what you got.  You look at your streets, they're a mess.  Man, you look outside and go, I see those houses.  Man, who's going to build next to a water tower or a, oh my God, a substation?  Who puts housing next to that?  That whole thing.  Marriott Park's a dump.  And you guys didn't want to.  That's why I wanted to cheat code.  Come on.  I went back.  I did the whole thing.  I'm your people with you guys.  In the 80s, I'd float down the river.  I did the whole thing.  And it used to be an apartment.  A two-bedroom apartment.  It was $350, but you had no jobs.  I stayed on Silicon Valley.  My cousins lived there.  My parents lived there for 30 years.  My sister lived right on Gwynbridge Court.  Remember that?  You know Gwynbridge?  That big fire?  Her house is right next to that, number 38.  The guy's house burned there.  Huge house.  Now it's two houses.  What happened there?  He burned my sister.  Killed my sister.  You know my sister went to a valedictorian in Santa Clara.  Went to a valedictorian in 76.  She lived in here.  Man.  Our houses.  No way.  Getting ripped off.  You developers.  You're putting an infill.  A three-bedroom apartment doesn't even fit right around where I live.  What is that?  You need no housing?  It's ridiculous.  It's a joke.  The biggest ripoff ever.  God, they've never seen a freaking piece of land they've never won.  You can get rid of all your mobile homes.  I swear to God.  You get a 10%.  What was that last one?  You should be a 4% moratorium.  Every two years, you get 4% raise.  Max.  You're paying $800 for rent for a month?  No way, dude.  Just housing.  There's no such thing as 4,000.  It's the biggest scam ever.  You develop no more houses.  I put a moratorium.  That's it.  That's it.  No housing.  No, you've got enough.  It's the biggest ripoff ever.  Where's your jobs?  You've got no jobs.  You've got no money.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Eric Nilsen, followed by Cynthia Perrine.  Good evening.  Good evening.  Good evening.  I'm with the Household Council.  Any of the recommendations in the draft implementation plan  are to be commended and have the potential  to create the conditions to do the following.  One, provide a variety of housing choices.  Cottage courts, mansion apartments, duplexes,  triplexes, ADUs, and townhouses.  Tiny houses, just to name a few.  That will offer homebuyers opportunity and ownership  at affordable prices.  Usually.  Number two, using zoning reform.  Provide Chico's neighborhoods opportunities to build different  housing types to include commercial development so people can walk or bikes  to services located in or near their neighborhood. Three, developing and  adopting greater tiered impact fees that will encourage infill development within  city limits. It makes sense that if you're developing where infrastructure  already exists that the developer pays significantly less impact fees than a  development that requires all new infrastructure. Four, provide for mixed  use commercial residential development along the opportunity corridors using  street design that prioritizes walking and biking and slows the rate of  automobile traffic for public safety. As a member of the ad hoc committee I have  concerns about number three of this document. It states per the general plan  support development of land and special planning areas in order to support  projected population growth. With the previously stated recommended reforms  and all the opportunity sites and corridors within the city limits it is  possible to satisfy projected population growth by developing within the city  limits. The numbers bear out.  But current policy makes pursuing infill development less economically  attractive to developers. This is where the public-private partnership has the  potential to reform policy to make it more attractive. Finally we lost valuable  time in the ad hoc committee because of the disproportionate amount of time  relitigating one special planning area, Valley's Edge. It lost to the vote by the  citizens of Chico by a margin of two to one because it doesn't make sense on so  many levels. Probably one of the most important being the danger of fire in  the city. The city's infrastructure needs to be evaluated on its own merits.  The city's infrastructure needs to be evaluated on its own merits. As all of  that land is now designated high and very high fire risk. The cost of fire  insurance alone would be prohibited for most citizens. But it also would have  been another car dependent sprawl development. Did not provide a variety of  housing choices at affordable prices and would have added significant  infrastructure and maintenance costs to the city at a time when it is already a  fiscal challenge to keep up with the city's infrastructure needs. Each special planning area in the GP general plan needs to be evaluated on its own merits.  And with criteria that determines it is good for the community at large. This SPA Valley's Edge does not pass the test.  We are approaching another cycle of general plan review and update. This is our opportunity to move away from the  antiquated model of sprawling subdivisions and towards a vision of  design development that provides Chico citizens with options of affordable  housing and transportation, builds neighborhoods that value community with  small businesses and a variety of housing and green spaces, all to enhance  connection and economic and environmental health and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and  municipalities to identify land that would be really readily developed, checks all the boxes  for compliance with environmental laws, helps increase the property values in many ways  by setting aside conserved properties that are adjacent to developed areas, residential  for things like parks and bikeways. And so I go all around the country. Last weekend, I had the  pleasure of spending some time with land trust professionals on Oahu, and they're working on  Lahaina. And these are land trusts that are for conservation, but they're working with their  community land trust to try to identify which properties can the land trust help acquire,  identify, negotiate, and then turn over to municipalities. So this is something that's  working in other communities that aren't even as constrained, I think, as Chico. But one thing I  just hear over and over again everywhere I go is, please,  allow the land trust to be the property of the land trust. And I think that's a key thing.  the WUE, the wildland urban interface, everything that we need to be considering, which includes  what Mr. Nielsen just talked about, is these special planning areas that really aren't  good places to be putting people next to environmental hazards.  So I just encourage you to, we'd really like to be part of this solution finding.  We don't have the solutions as a land trust.  I'm not a planner.  I'm a scientist.  But we have a lot of smart people who've been living here for a long time who would  really like to help be part of this solution.  So please invite us to the table as these conversations continue.  And we would really appreciate helping out.  Thanks.  Thank you.  Elizabeth Devereaux, followed by Chris Jean-Pauli.  Good evening.  I am representing Smart Growth Advocates.  And reading over this,  much of the summary offers a blueprint for good future development.  Number three does not.  That is what Eric was alluding to.  The referendum on Valley's Edge, which won two to one to stop the development of this  special planning area, is a more recent response of the will of the citizens of Chico than  the policy of the 2010 general plan to support special planning areas.  I mean...  Yeah.  I was on the 94 general plan, and so I've taken a special interest in that.  In the community development element of the general plan, it states front and center that  the desire is for Chico to have a compact urban form.  The downtown definitely needs revitalization, and certainly homelessness and online shopping  have something to do with its problems now.  But mixed-use housing in downtown, as well as in opportunity sites,  like Park Avenue, would fulfill the general plan's central vision of compact urban form.  Not only that, but they would provide more community, more safety, and affordable housing  for young people at entry level and older people who are downsizing.  They would also address the increasing effects of climate change.  When I first talked with one of the council members about the ad hoc group forming, it  was to find areas of agreement between Smart Growth advocates and the Valley's Edge developers.  I will have to say I was disappointed.  That did not happen.  Instead, it seems as though it was an exercise to push forth number three, which is the development  or the relitigation of Valley's Edge, which does not represent what the intent of the  ad hoc group was meant to have.  I would say in regards to what Tom Van Overbeek said about single-family housing, it's very  clear now that young people really can't afford, not a lot of them can afford single-family  housing, and they're looking for alternative kinds of mixed-use housing in underutilized  areas where it's walkable and transit-friendly.  And so that's where I think our operations can be very important.  And the opportunity sites represent those, and we really need to give those priority  over special planning areas.  And otherwise, I would say that the rest of the ad hoc findings were really wonderful,  legitimate, and I'd like to see us do that.  Thank you.  Thank you.  And we did actually have five speakers, so Chris Giampale is our last speaker, if you  were counting.  I made it.  So I'm probably going to be a little too large.  different than the other folks that just spoke.  But I agree with Tom that the seven items that you have before you,  they don't talk about single family,  and they don't talk about what we're going to do for future housing in this community.  It talks about a lot of stuff that's already in the general plan that Brendan kind of alludes to.  And so we spent 16 weeks really to come up with these solutions.  But quantify how many houses you're going to get from this.  You can go ahead and talk about infill.  You think that there's infill around.  But if it's there already, people would start doing it.  So you can start tiering some fees, and you can kind of do that stuff.  But you're not going to get the quantity of houses that were behind.  So the general plan states that in 2030, we're supposed to have a population of 139,000 people.  Right now, we have 103,000 people.  So we have not met.  We haven't met our criteria to go.  There's 161 single family homes a year is what we've been doing the last four years.  We're supposed to be up around 250 to 260 single family.  2010, we told everybody that was up there at the council,  that it's going to get to a point where these special planning areas,  which were already, as you talked to the folks around here, that you heard,  and what Tom has alluded to, is that we have these special planning areas,  and fortunately, they're not all being built out for the areas that they're at.  Maybe it's pursuant to fire or whatever.  But you should have background, or you should have special areas  that you should be looking at into the future.  So you got five special planning areas.  You shouldn't rely on all five to happen.  So, oh, you got four?  I think there's five actually, right?  But you want me to, I could label them all if you want me real quick.  So, but anyhow, but if there are, you're not, you,  you got to have, you ought to be looking for other areas to be able to build,  as a background or a backdrop if something doesn't happen.  So, unfortunately, I think the one actually that you might actually have,  that's decent on here is number five, actually,  if you look on the list that would be around the airport.  So that's one that maybe that could get some more single family,  but we're dreadly behind.  We're going to be behind from here on out.  And unless something changes pretty soon, unfortunately,  the single family is just going to be behind.  And it's just going to be a way that it's just going to get more and more expensive.  Unfortunately, when you have less of it in town to be able to build,  and it's just going to get that supply and demand is going to get worse and worse,  unfortunately.  So I'm pretty sure there's five, Ashton.  We got rid of the Bellmere special planning area.  That's why there's four.  Oh, that's a good point.  It's not there anymore, but you're right.  There you go.  All right.  That's our last speaker.  Further council discussion or?  I think it was great that we had speakers come out to kind of express the divergence of issues here.  Yeah, we didn't make hard recommendations on some things that maybe people would have liked us to.  You know, one of that is like, well, we didn't recommend breaking in the green line.  We didn't recommend adding in some new sites.  We're looking at utilizing the stuff that is within our general plan.  Yeah, there's a few like specific issues on here,  which are kind of the same situation we're before of like there's a lot of things on here.  I don't think there's much that we need to like dive into.  I'm glad that you brought up that on the North.  And I don't know how the last speaker's response to the last speaker's response to the Chico's specific plan and how we're able to rethink some infrastructure requirements to make that economically feasible.  I think it's something it's got to be picked up at a future time.  The only other one that really struck me as like somewhat unsatisfactory in terms of what the staff response was on it was the one about parking requirements.  That is a huge barrier for infill.  Not only does it make some projects not work, but it makes the projects just not happen at all.  Or sorry, you get less units out of any project you do.  And they say.  say that they want to look at creating a map of parking impacted areas to like use to recommend  where we would not be requiring parking but i think that has a potential to flip this upside  down where like you have parking impacted areas because there's a lot of housing because there's  a high demand to live there think next to the university and if we exclude that area based on  it then we're essentially taking the walkable neighborhoods out of our analysis of where we  should be promoting more housing and so i think there's a little bit of a backwardsness on there  and i think that we should we ought to consider more broadly where we extend that ultimately  we're going to have to have the conversation on exactly what areas that covers um but that's just  my thought on that that i'd like to recommend so i'd like to make a few comments about  some of the comments that have been made so i so i don't know how to say this gracefully  uh and i'm known for being graceful so uh but uh of all the people here  so i'm going to say that i'm not a graceful person i'm not a graceful person  i'm not a graceful person i'm not a graceful person  i've gotten up and talked about infill none of them has actually built an infill project i've done  five of them and i can tell you the economics are very difficult on infill projects and that's why  now correct me if i'm wrong uh director veeg but in the last 20 or 30 years the city has been  really focused on encouraging people to do infill and in fact the development we have done has  largely been within the envelope the city's sphere of influence right but the reason there isn't more  um  um !  you know these four units on a single lot because in a you know close to the core  it's because the numbers don't work so ultimately in order to do what the city doesn't build housing  developers build housing and in order for developer to build a house they have to say okay  i can create this i can do this project and i can sell it to somebody at a number that  is competitive in the marketplace and i can come out with a reasonable return  and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and  risk zone is because it's dry  grass now. And if the dry  grass were taken away and you had pavement  and lawns and  fire resistant  construction of buildings, it would reduce  the fire risk,  not increase it.  So that is nonsensical.  And that's what I wanted  to say.  Alright. Council Member Hawley.  I really loved  reading through this  report here from our  ad hoc committee. The only thing I wanted to  comment on was 1A and B.  And I completely,  completely understand the  staff response to  why it's important to identify  and map those parking impacted areas.  But I do want to say  in the future I will be providing input  on how there's a lot of nuance  depending on the neighborhood  character and the neighborhood needs.  A really good example  in District 5 is  South Campus.  Lots of student living there  and just because South  Campus is certainly  a parking impacted area  it's an example  I want to say a successful  example of somewhere that  is potentially  having softened off street  parking requirements is a  good thing. Just because that's  serving the needs of the  neighborhoods. Another example is  Merriam Park when I was campaigning  going door to door I did hear from one  Merriam Park resident who  had built an  ADU next to her and wanted to build  another ADU on her property but  at the time which was over a decade ago  it required additional  parking which she just didn't have the space  for. So it was really unfortunate to hear  that someone in a  parking impacted  area wasn't able to provide more housing.  That was literally a block  away from campus  for not only CSU Chico staff but  also for potential students.  It's just another thing to keep in mind  there is nuance to this.  Anybody else?  Alright.  Is this a, do we need  a motion on this?  I suppose approve the report  which is this implementation program  go ahead and we'll take it  on the next step. Bring it to us on a time.  I think the next step would be  phase three of the residential readiness  which I don't know if you have a timeline you want to share  tentative?  I would think  by the end of the year will be before the planning  commission and then the council soon thereafter.  Is that a motion?  Yes, motion to approve  the report. With the comments I suppose  that we've had here about some of these  issues especially planning areas and parking impacted  areas. I second.  Okay.  Council member Goldstein? Yes.  Council member Holly? Yes.  Council member O'Brien? Yes.  Council member Van Overbeek?  Yes. Council member Winslow? Yes.  Vice Mayor Bennett? Yes.  Mayor Reynolds? Aye.  Carries 7-0.  Alright. 5.3 South Park Drive  access to keep breakers. Brendan  Auduboni, director of public works and  engineering. Yes, good evening Mayor,  Vice Mayor and City Council members. This is  the City Council meeting.  Coming back after the August 19  City Council meeting where you directed  the recommendation for the South Park  Drive improvements to keep as is.  We're just looking for clarification as  we look to finalize our design and get  the project out to bid this winter.  On one specific item and that relates  to the driveway access to  caper acres. Again,  currently that access  that is an exit only  essentially just to the east  of the existing parking lot.  So the  ask is  would the council like to keep it  as is or move that  driveway access and make it  bidirectional so it's  more of a direct access to the caper  acres parking lot? We're just  looking for direction on whether  or not your intention was to  relocate that or keep it that  as is. That concludes my report  but I'm available for any questions or  clarifications you might have.  Council member Goldstein? This is on a slightly different note.  To be honest, just wondering  if we're still looking at doing traffic  calming as part of the design  to make sure the e-bikes and cars aren't speeding?  The direction from the council I believe was option  four to just keep it as is.  All our project is going to focus on is  rehabilitation of the pavement  and then keep it as is.  Currently that is not  included in our scope  but that's stuff we continue to value.  When I changed my vote on that I specified that I was  going to change it with the compromise that we would do  traffic calming but maybe that'  s a thing we need to discuss at a  future meeting. I was under the impression  that we were going to include some  minor improvements like speed bumps.  We can probably  agendize that for a  future meeting. I would  actually like to see those as well.  I think that'  s a beneficial thing there in particular  with what' s going on with some of the e-bikes and such.  I support that. I feel like  agendizing that would push  our design phase for so long that we'  re not going to be able to do this  within the current cost approved. It was something  we discussed when we made the motion last time.  I don' t know if that will  totally throw off what you' re doing.  We can evaluate that as staff. I don' t think we  typically  we handle those requests in our traffic  engineering department or division.  We can evaluate things like  speed bumps. Those are  pretty easy additions. We  can certainly include that.  I just wanted to check. Sorry to put you on the spot.  You' re good.  Councilmember O'Brien.  I will say that we'  ve been down this road literally.  I don' t think any major changes are necessary.  I think we just need to keep it as  is. Rehabilitate  the existing exit and  let' s leave this alone. We'  ve been down this road. Like I said, I think we'  re done with that.  I just wanted to ask  because I feel like there wasn' t really  an explanation for it. If there'  s a strong reason to do this now,  you say the cost difference is  negligible, changing the driveway.  Are there particular conflicts  that you' re concerned about that would be resolved  by moving it?  It just improves access. I believe it' s more efficient  in terms of the traffic circulation.  To try and loop  back around, you can' t do that because it' s one  way. Having that direct access  makes it more accessible  as well as a lot of trips  come off of highway 32, 8th and 9th  streets and then use Linden. Rather  than having to go all the way down Woodland and  then back up, it just creates more of a direct  access point. It reduces  VMT in that regard.  I think it just improves that overall  access where those trips are coming  down from that whole  south side of Chico  off of 8th and 9th.  I think there' s value and benefit from an  engineering standpoint.  Understand the  community wishes  and desires for keeping  that.  Vice Mayor Bennett.  I appreciate you bringing this up for clarification.  I' m going to side with  Councilmember O'Brien.  Let' s keep it as is. We' ve gone down  this road. I don' t want any delays  in  if you change something, somebody' s going to  be unhappy.  My vote is going to be keep  it as is. Thank you.  Councilmember Van Overbeek and then  Hall.  I support the traffic  calming measures but I think that' s  a matter of putting down the  yellow bumps or the  pavement. I don' t think  that disrupts.  But  as my colleagues Mr. Bennett and  Mr. O'Brien have pointed out,  we still have the burn marks from the last time  we wanted to change this.  I want to keep it the way it is  which is what we approved.  Even though from an engineering standpoint  your recommendation I believe makes sense  from a tradition.  I' m running for reelection in a  I want to leave it the way it is.  I' m not supposed to say that.  I have more comments but I'  was going to wait until after we hear from the public.  Let Councilmember Holly go and then  I' ll back you.  Sorry I didn' t originally have a question.  Councilmember Bennett' s comment had me  confused. You said delays. This wouldn' t  create any delay in the project  completion would it?  No. We' re just again looking  for clarification to make sure we  meet the intent of the city council. What your intentions  were with the project scoping that we  requested. This is just simply making  sure from a design perspective it'  s pretty straight forward. It wouldn'  t have any impacts.  I had one comment.  I think at the time when we' re having  the council at the conversation  Councilmember Holly and I had mentioned  if we could pave some of those parking  areas if there was funds in there to  get that done that should be included.  I' m pretty sure that was included in the motion.  I don' t know what the  intent was.  I think we went from 2 point whatever down  to whatever. I think long-term wise if  we' re already redoing the road and  repaving it makes sense that we don' t  have to keep maintaining not moving the  parking spots but actually paving them.  Is that part of the  We' re considering that. Again it'  s going to come down to budgetary  constraints. We' re wrapping up the  design and our final engineer' s estimates  and ultimately it comes down to what the  bid prices are. The intention is to include  those as bid  additive items to see if it fits  within the budget. We' re closing  out our projects from this year rolling  over funds and we' re waiting to see  how much we have available to do the  project and that will ultimately dictate  whether or not we can complete the  asphalt paving for the parking lots.  thank you. That was my question.  I' m curious to hear what the  public has to say. I' m surprised we  don' t have a lot of speakers.  I think the idea of direct two-way  access from the parking lot would save  a lot of trips for folks like me who  might not need to drive the whole way  through if I' m getting in there. I  could see a lot of potential to increase  safety and increase access with that.  I' m curious what people think.  How many speakers do we have?  We don' t have any.  Shut the front door.  Nobody wants to talk about  bidwell park.  Should have been on consent I guess.  All right. Discussion?  Does council have any further  discussion or do we have a motion?  Council member holland.  Sorry.  I called you first. Go ahead.  I just don' t think that the  previous issue is comparable to this  one at all. Our previous design  was centering barring all vehicular  traffic from the park itself.  This would just simplify I want to  say vehicular traffic through the park.  I think it' s important to give  people who do want to drive  through it because that' s what the  council jointly decided on.  Multiple options to do it rather  than just force them onto south park  drive.  As director ottoboni said it would  reduce vehicle miles traveled.  It makes a lot more sense from  engineering standpoint.  It does make a funny joke but I  don' t know that worrying about  your reelection is necessarily the  most important thing to have into  consideration that we have to  I think that' s the future of  our almost permanent infrastructure  for decades to come.  That' s your point of view.  It' s my district.  I' ll note.  To me it makes sense that you don'  t have people in order to get to  this parking lot you have to enter  all the way over here and then you  have to drive in the park.  The council direction was let' s have  more cars in the park. We don' t want  I' m content to roll over on this  one as other council members did on  the last one.  are you ready for a motion?  we have one more comment.  I' m actually pretty  surprised that council member  winslow is opposite me on this one  because I will die on this hill.  We should not be forcing people to drive  quarter mile of more conflict  points between cars and people  biking in the park. Even just as an  occasional driver I don' t have to  deal with driving around bicyclists  for a quarter mile when I can get into  the park and if it doesn' t cost the  city any more money. I absolutely  would like to see us move this  driveway if there' s any potential  to increase safety in our park and  reduce pollution by cars that don'  t need to be in there. I also agree with council  driving in the park in the spirit of  the previous direction where people were  saying they want to be able to drive  through those gates off of pine street.  Those are the people who want to drive  through the park but why are we making  everybody do it if they don' t want to?  I would like to move that we move  the entrance from the cape breaker's  entrance per the staff report.  option attachment a.  I will second.  I will make a substitute motion.  Okay.  That substitute motion is to retain  the current one-way exit onto woodland  avenue and rehabilitate the pavement.  Second.  Just a moment. I' m sorry.  I' m sorry councilmember o'brien.  That was to keep the road open. I' m sorry.  as is. Yes.  And with staff looking at traffic  calming options.  And that was the substitute motion.  We'll take that first. Council Member Goldstein?  No. Council Member  Hawley? No.  Council Member O'Brien? Yes.  Council Member Van Overbeek? Yes.  Council Member Winslow? I  died on the hill and I rolled down to the bottom.  Yes.  Vice Mayor Bennett? Yes.  Mayor Reynolds? Aye.  It carries 5-2.  And so we don't go back to the  original motion. I didn't really speak  on this earlier, but just to follow up  why my aye vote of leaving it where it is,  that is a significantly bigger  area where cars can come  and go versus that  narrow. It just, that's my  reasoning for A, leaving it where it is.  Can you clarify what's the larger  area? Where it is down here  at 7th and Woodland versus this tiny  little, you know, just dropping onto  Woodland. Like, look at that whole area  where 7th and Woodland come together.  There's a big, huge area. So it's  a lot less conflict for people coming out.  So that's my reasoning.  Alright. Thanks for clarifying.  Sorry. Item  I'm usually  really good about taking everybody else's comments  and I always get my own in there.  Confirmation of interim fire chief  Mr. City Manager Mark  Sorensen. Thank you, Mayor and Council.  Section 605 of the city  charter states that appointment of a department  head shall be appointed by the city  manager subject to confirmation by the  city council. To meet that  requirement, the city council is presented  with the employment agreement for  interim fire chief Bill Hack.  In compliance  with government code section, I'll state  for the record that the city manager is  proposing to enter into an employment  agreement with Bill Hack as the interim  fire chief and is proposing to appoint  Bill Hack with an annual salary of  $184,518.58  and recommend that the city  council confirm the appointment of Bill  Hack as the interim fire chief.  .  any comments from questions?  I will make a comment and if  there'  s no further comments I  will make a motion.  I do want to make a comment if I  may.  We are excuse me can I please speak?  thank you. I just want to commend the city  manager for his  manager for selecting an  outstanding interim fire chief.  This is William Hack.  William Hack welcome aboard.  You are an excellent choice and I  appreciate you stepping up and  leading this fine fire department and  our community. Thank you for that  and I think this will go well.  Thank you.  the chief stole my thunder, mike.  We are very fortunate to have  chief hack on the board of the  city council.  person to be available at this  time to fill in.  He is a legend in the local fire  community.  I know the rank and file are excited to have  you back.  I'  m excited to have you back.  Thank you for agreeing to do this.  I hope I don'  t create a management problem for you  with those comments mark.  we have one speaker and it is  stephen hazel.  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  It has to do with fire.  And the fire, he needs money, too.  He needs more people.  But I want to be the Maytag repairman where he doesn't go out for a call for a fire.  You don't go out for a fire.  Point of order.  It's called a service.  Look at this guy.  He's interrupting me.  I got three minutes.  People died for my right to speak.  It just has to do with the firefighter.  Now, hey, in your mind, did you have my speech written out?  You might have your own idea how to approach it.  This is my turn up here, okay?  People died for my right.  I'm addressing a fire.  I think it's a good message, okay?  Okay?  Man, unbelievable.  Of course, Bozo would trip.  It's right there.  Fire.  You're fired.  Donald Trump.  Yeah, drop the D.  That's it.  The fire.  Last time I was here, remember, 107, there was a fire.  It was red.  Remember the fire in Palisades?  What caused that?  Well, Elon Musk, the corners, by Ten Commandments.  They're used for not intended purpose.  That's what's happening.  With a fire department, you need to know that.  See, those corners are supernatural.  They're like the mask.  They're a mask.  They're a possession.  Mr. Hazel, you're off topic.  This is your warning.  You're disrupting a public meeting.  That's your first warning.  I'm making a point to the fire chief.  Now, the FBI tells you not to tell them.  They don't want me to talk like this because you're airing 51 to the whole public.  This is open.  This is the fire chief.  343 firefighters died under Father Michael.  It's right there in stone.  I wrote the Ten Commandments.  This is real life Ten Commandments stuff.  You're denying the Ten Commandments.  It's written in stone right there.  I was a draftsman.  I got a degree in drafting, mechanical drafting.  I was a draftsman.  Mr. Hazel, this is your second warning.  You're disrupting a public meeting.  It's not disrupting.  I'm talking specifically on this topic about the fire chief.  There's over 100,000 people in here, and it's our new fire chief.  I'm the only person coming in here.  It's unbelievable.  And of course, you guys don't have no money.  I don't want to see people laid off.  All he talks about, you have more house and more stuff.  You put more work on him, more stress, more calls to service.  You don't look at that.  You talk about more housing, more money.  For who?  The developers who make money?  No way.  More taxes.  All you do is raise taxes.  You don't generate any money.  You have no brains.  You just raise taxes.  That's where you get your money.  And people in North and Special Elections for more taxes.  It's just more taxes.  Remember Father Michael Judge.  On his grave, George Bush at 9-11.  He's the devil.  That's your time.  That's your time.  He was our only speaker.  We're going to move to approve.  I will second that.  If someone beat me to it, that's perfectly fine.  It's okay.  Get out of here.  That was quick.  That was a quick trigger.  Whoever had that.  I'm fine with whoever made that second.  Motion by Councilmember Winslow and a second by Councilmember  Hawley.  O'Brien.  OK.  Councilmember Goldstein.  Aye.  Councilmember Hawley.  Yes.  Councilmember O'Brien.  Yes.  Councilmember Van Overbeek.  Yes.  Councilmember Winslow.  Yes.  Vice Mayor Bennett.  Yes.  Mayor Reynolds.  Aye.  Carries 7-0.  All right.  Item 5.5.  My request of the tiny homes placed on a church parking lot.  I think this one's fairly easy.  And I'm not asking for a lot.  But as we had our ad hoc committee meetings,  one of the ideas that was brought up in the meetings  was the idea of the possibility through whatever regulations  that tiny homes could possibly be placed on church parking lots.  And we heard that there is maybe some code amendments or some  information that might need to be brought forward in order for  that to happen.  So instead of waiting for our final report to come out via the  ad hoc committee meeting, I didn't think that there was much  reason not to have staff begin to explore and let us know if  there's anything that would block us or anybody else from  already doing this.  And just bringing the information back to us is all  I'm asking for.  So I'll take any questions if there's anything else.  I'm just going to go ahead and answer any questions of myself.  Yes, council member Hawley.  Just curious if you're asking for all department heads to  provide feedback or just specific issues like zoning or  emergency shelter status?  I think mainly Brendan can bring it.  He may need to consult and ask a few questions.  But I know that there's specifics on what year they can  be built, habitability, fire, safety, all the things that we  have to deal with.  And he actually gave a great report in the  ad hoc committee that will also bring that information forward.  But I thought we could jump ahead.  Sounds great.  I have a question for the city manager.  My understanding is that churches are exempt from so if  they wanted to put some little houses in a parking lot they  wouldn't have to go through the normal approval process?  Is that correct?  I wouldn't call them exempt.  I would call them exempt perhaps from a land use perspective but  there'  s still matters associated with  public health and safety, building code, all of those  kinds of things.  okay.  So there would be some sort of approval process that would have  to occur if a church decided they wanted to put these things  in their parking lot?  Most likely yes.  But we would really need a proposal to really answer that  I have a few thoughts.  We have reached out to some other jurisdictions that were  shared with us from the north state shelter team and again what  I think I shared with the ad hoc committee was the notion of four  sheds and a porta potty to house elderly homeless women in a  church parking lot is not something necessarily  considered or contemplated by a zoning code or the building code.  I will also say though I think it properly  managed and done the impacts were probably negligible and it'  s probably a good idea and  supportable.  I don'  t think it'  s a good idea to do a full  code amendment to create an ordinance that would be something citywide.  I believe a good idea might be a pilot project working closely with  maybe the city attorney'  s office and some of the  other departments and divisions that might be affected fire  building public works and seeing if there'  s a path forward to do an  administrative use permit and then  something where we can put some guardrails on the proposal. The notion is that it'  s temporary. That'  s a guardrail what does that mean?  Maybe it'  s confined to being elderly women so there'  s that understanding from the  neighborhood that'  s what they'  re getting. I would also suggest  that maybe council gives some direction to north state shelter team and any church that'  interested in holding their own neighborhood meeting. This is what we'  re contemplating and we'  re thinking. That'  s always a good way to get a  temperature read on if this is a good location and if this is a good idea and for them to  share their management program and how they'  re going to address these issues. Meanwhile we can be doing more research and coming up  with a way to bring it forward. I  don'  t know how to say this any more  bluntly but if there'  s not concerns there'  s not concerns. If there'  s concerns then sometimes we may need to go to code amendments and change  ordinances because it'  s not as we don'  t go to our zoning code and say  sheds and church parking lots here'  s the way that happens. There'  s just some little nuances part of north state shelter team'  s original proposal had city involvement. I don'  t know that the city really wants to be involved in leasing, owning or operating this  concept. The reason they wanted that is it provides some allowances to deviate from some  of the requirements of state and local codes if it somehow inhibits the  effort from being successful. I want to work the problem and engage the city  attorney'  s office but it would be nice if the applicant and the church wherever that  might be connected with their neighbors. Those are just some thoughts I had up  front.  thank you.  I didn'  t get to finish.  we have empty beds at the janitor shelter every night. We have empty beds at the  tourist shelter every night. Why are we talking about the empty beds at the !  re talking about adding little houses in church parking lots when we'  re not using the shelters we already have. It doesn'  t make any sense to me. The other problem is one of the things we know is that if these  things if homeless people aren' t managed the janitor shelter has been a huge success  because they have a very thoughtful management program and when that doesn'  t exist it'  s chaos.  council member goldstein.  first thought.  you have speakers for this too right?  yes.  just making sure.  first thought we had a lot of good discussions at the ad hoc committee  meeting on that topic of what do we still need to serve our own house community and  we heard from north state shelter team but I wanted to respond to brendan and maybe ask  another question.  That concept of a pilot program is that something that city council should direct staff to work on?  Because I feel like that could be a more clear direction than saying to come back with ideas  because it sounds like community development already has the ideas of what needs to happen next.  I' m not sure there'  s more to tell us before we can provide direction.  I would definitely appreciate council saying this is what we want to do.  Otherwise it'  s not clear.  thank you.  I'  ll keep that in mind.  speakers?  we have I believe eight.  three minutes?  three minutes.  okay.  I'  ll call the first two speakers.  laurie mason followed by stephen hazel.  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  and and  and  and that's a good point. I think that's a good point. I think that's a good point. I think that's a good point. I think that's a good point. I think that's a good point. I think that's a good point. I think that's a good point. I think that's a good point. I think that's a good point. I think that's a good point. I think that's a good point. I think that's a good point. I think that's a good point. I think that's a good point. I think that's a good point. I think that's a good point. I think that's a good point. I think that's a good point. I think that's a good point. I think that's a good point.  and  and  and  and  and  and  and  and  and  and  and  and  and  room is going to be deeply impacted by some of the problems with Medicaid and hospital closures.  Keeping four elderly women out of the emergency room, four elderly women who have complex medical  issues and take up a lot of space, if you will, is a big plus. Having them in a small area where  people, myself included, from North State Shelter Team can help take care of them,  will ensure that they get quality medical care. We can get them to appointments. They can deal  with their medical problems without going to the emergency room multiple times. Consistent health  care reduces early death. These women die very, very early. They're also the victims of crime at  much higher rates than, say, your average young man. And this will reduce some police costs,  although that's not a big plus.  It's going to be very indirect and probably very small and negligible. The other thing I wanted to  address was that we do have a good management system, Mr. Van Overbeek. We're not just leaving  these women there alone. There will be someone visiting the women, interfacing with the women,  and helping the women on a daily basis. And why don't women go to the Genesis Center or go to  Torrey Shelter? They don't like to be around that many people.  They're vulnerable. They've been victims of crime. Being in the Torrey Shelter, I don't know if you've  ever gone to the Torrey Shelter in the middle of the night, but it's loud. It's very loud. And it's  very difficult to get any kind of rest. Plus, you have to leave during the day. Genesis is much  better. The staff, I mean, the staff in both places are wonderful. You know, that's not the  issue. It's just that they're large and they're intimidating. And they're frightening for women  who are trying to rebuild their lives. And they're trying to rebuild their lives. And they're  trying to rebuild their lives. Transitional housing, like at the small shelter that we propose,  will get them more successfully prepared to be in permanent housing, most of which they already  qualify for, but are too disorganized and, frankly, mentally ill to do it on their own.  They're going to need our help. So I'm hoping you'll consider that. Pilot project would be great.  We'll prove you're right. Can I ask you a quick question, Ms. Mason? Oh, I'm sorry. You have,  North State Shelter Team has candidates.  They're currently unsheltered for these conceptual beds? That's true. Okay, thanks.  So, Stephen Hazel, followed by Charles Withone.  Tiny homes. Wow, that's a going. Hey, here's my car for the union car, right in my alley.  A local 405. I'm 45. $45 million deal. You know, I got it three and I, March 9th. The lowest,  that's when the stock market took a dump in 2008 under Bush, three and I, March 9th. The irony is,  I got my union car, the irony of that. Hey, it's great because you don't understand. The gentleman  on my left was overbeak. He mentioned, why do these people, why can't they go? Because he  doesn't understand. See, you don't really have to live there to understand this. You guys don't  get it. They have too much stuff. See, they won't fit in the palace shelter, all these different  things. They just don't, it just doesn't work for them. Plus, you've got so many restrictions,  I was at the tour show. I'll see how I made it. I'm the only guy there that would be allowed  someone above me. I'm the only one. You know how much stuff I had to deal with? These guys coming  in there? No one could sleep above me. I had my own bed. I had my own vigil bed, but when you  doubled them up to get the numbers for your enforcement, no one could sleep above me. Man,  I took a lot of heat. I probably survived like five fights. And you're actually ATL,  doesn't matter if you start or not, you'll be kicked out. I told you, I'd die if I'm out in  the street. I said, hey, I'd die. And thank God, I wouldn't have to live there. I'd die. I'd die. I  would, for the tour shelter, probably would have died, but I can't die. But then, remember on the  way home, it was August 20th last year, I almost got ran over by three Chico police. Yeah, I was  pulled over right across the fair. Or there's a, or is it fairgrounds? I got turned around. He's  like, I don't know, I missed a turn. It was about 1130 at night. They buzzed me, three cops, boom,  boom, boom, within inches of me, telling me that I could die. They did. They buzzed me. Chief,  the police department, three cops. Did I tell you about that? Yeah. It was August 20th,  August 20th of last year. I just said it. I gave a shout out to the tour shelter. Do you know what  I get? Thanks. These three SUVs come at me, whoo, within nine to 19 inches from me. Would have killed  me. I was tucked up against the curb. I go, whoa. Buzz me. This is about tiny homes on church  parking lots. What? Tiny homes on church parking lots. Yeah, I am. And you know what? The tiny  hometown of Chico. See, that's why I told you where the money is. It's a Mormon church. Okay?  Yeah. The second coming,  he's saving for that. Well, too bad. Biggest pyramid scheme ever. Well, he's already dead and  gone the second time. Now what? What does the Bible say about that? I'll give the dates, time,  when, where, why, and how. Yeah. It was 1122, 1941. So you don't get it. When they took Jesus  out of school, or they took church out of school, it was when this guy appears, triggered Jesus'  second coming. This guy appeared 1924. Mr. Hazel, you are off topic. Tiny homes and church parking  lots. Yeah, it is. But you're not going to get it. You're not going to get it. You're not going to  get it. You're not going to get it. You're not going to get it. You're not going to get it. You're  using Jesus Christ in there. You're using the Jesus Center and everything, so that opens up the  door. It does. Ask your attorney. I know parliamentary procedure. So Jesus is dead the second time. And  that's a fact. Maybe you don't want to admit it, but I'm the father. I'm his father. I'm 12-6. The  other guy's 6-12. He's 6-6-6. That's your time. Thank you. Thank you. You're done.  Yeah. Remember, 6-6-6 is James W. Boyle. He's dead.  So our next speaker is Charles Withoon, followed by George D.  Eads. Good evening, Mayor, Vice Mayor,  Councilors, staff. It's a shelter crisis that has contributed to the deaths of more people  outside, more tents downtown, more trash in our parks than any other disaster in Chico in my life.  Why?  Why do we need a few more tiny homes? Because it's successful in so many other towns. There's 12 other  towns in California doing similar programs. There's a town in just north of here in Oregon that has  140 of these tiny little homes, and the neighbors are okay with it. They're good neighbors because  it's well managed. We've got a program from Community Supported Shelters in Oregon, 46 pages,  and 20 volunteers to make sure this is well managed. We need to make some progress on this. We could  waive the rules. We could direct staff to issue NIST an administrative use permit and work with NIST,  who has won two international awards, to rent part of a church parking lot like other cities do. That  kicks in State Statute 8698. That's the state's first state statute. That's the state's first state  statute. That's an important part of it. That limits your liability, health and safety rules, and  expedites the creation of a wider range of shelter options in Chico. You could do that, and then  tomorrow, we could get going on a plan that has been proven safe and successful, actually lowered crime  rates in other towns. It could be repeated and get more of our older women in a safe place at night by  leveraging the safety of our communities. That's an important part of it. That limits your liability,  health and safety rules, and expedites the creation of a wider range of shelter options in Chico. You could do that, and then tomorrow,  the relationships that NIST has built over the years. With a bit of teamwork, we can create a wider range of shelter options more well suited to the remaining unsheltered women in Chico. Let's reduce the number of tents downtown and save our community money. We're not asking for but a dollar a year on a lease program for a part of a church parking lot, and we could get going on it tonight. Thank you.  So, Charles, I have a question for you, if I may.  I've got an answer.  So, do you have a church that's willing to take this on right now?  Three churches, yes.  Thank you.  Yeah, in fact, I just talked to the minister yesterday, and, you know, he said, well, just as long as the city won't fight us, we'd be happy to go ahead with the plan. We've got the space available. He's not only a preacher, he's a general contractor, and he's kind of excited about being able to use this abandoned area of their parking lot for four tiny homes and put a fence around it, have a surveillance camera, have people there all the time, case  managers helping the women out.  The neighbors embrace this program where it's been done before, and the next thing you know, another church wants to do it. The next thing you know, we've got fewer tents downtown. Let's get our parks back without building more fences.  Thank you, Charles.  Thank you.  Okay, George Deeds, followed by Chris Nelson.  You guys are going to love this. I lived in a church for eight years. I helped raise eight kids there, six girls.  And you know what I learned?  I learned the word love that was way overused, like tossed salad. I love this, I love that. It's confusing in the Bible because they have a bunch of different words from the Greek, you know, that explain it.  But what I found out was the word care. That's where the rubber meets the pavement, when you care.  When I, you know, Charles and us have been on the streets, and we know these women on the street, we care.  Charles cared enough, and a lot of people in this community, we all have their retirement party.  The other day, that place was full of care.  It was...  It was awesome.  You know?  Caring.  Caring about these women on the streets.  Caring about the predators that prey on them still.  I talked about this, I don't know, six years ago, I think.  About, you know, the women on our street and how these predators prey on them.  And the same women are on the streets still.  And now we've got an opportunity.  Churches are stepping up.  You know what?  They care.  They care about, you know, hey, you know this woman that doesn't got a chance at all.  Because...  She feels safe sleeping over here at the plaza.  That's why they sleep here.  That's why they got all their little places that they sleep.  Because they're scared.  A lot of them's got money.  First two weeks, they got their money.  They're drunk as hell.  The last two weeks, I'm giving them a ride.  You know?  And, you know, for myself, the churches want to step up.  And they want to care.  Well, boy, how do y'all ought to help them?  Because it isn't that hard.  And I mean, a dollar.  Come on, folks.  I'll give you the dollar.  It isn't that very hard.  But seriously, I am really happy about this town.  Because I have found, 13 years ago, not so much, but I know a whole lot of people here care.  And I know a lot of people care about these women that we've seen in the ad hoc committee on the thing.  I knew easily.  I recognize more than half of them right off the top.  And they've been doing it for years.  So, please have some mercy.  Please.  Please.  Please.  Please.  Please.  Yeah.  Let's do this.  I know people want to do this.  I know the churches want to do it.  Because that's what they did for us.  They cared for us.  We were interpersonal with them.  They come over here.  They gave us.  I can't even begin to tell you the blessings that my family received while I care taked  to church for eight years.  So, well, there you go.  That's all I got to say about that.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Chris Nelson, followed by Robin McCollum.  I don't know that he's here.  You know, as an elderly woman myself, I know that safety and security are the two most important things.  And also climate control, being able to be out of the cold and out of the heat are really important.  And I think what George just brought up about how these women are preyed on,  I saw that when I used to deliver sandwiches out at Comanche Creek.  I got very close to some of the women out there, and I worried about them constantly.  I took them to Enloe for different health problems.  I mean, they're so vulnerable.  And so I really appreciate that this is finally coming to pass.  I appreciate you for considering it, and I love the idea of even a pilot program.  I mean, it's fine.  You know, we've got the kinks and everything, and I don't have much more to say on it  other than thank you for finally, finally getting down the road where Charles has been a long time.  He's been pushing us all.  And I just appreciate you very much for passing this.  I know you're going to, so come on, team.  Thank you.  So, Robin, I don't see Nancy Park, followed by Ann Polivka.  Thank you.  Okay.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I'm very much in favor of this proposal.  For a number of reasons.  It's small.  It's well thought out.  And I think it's very manageable.  Beyond that, here you have people who want to do some of the work of the city.  The churches, through their faith, feel that if they take this on, it gives them meaning.  You've got the North State Shelter Team and Charles, who will help these women.  It's...  It's a really, I think, a win-win situation for the city.  There's been a lot of talk of trying some new and different things.  And I think this is certainly something new and different.  And I would say what Chris said, as an older woman myself,  I can see that there might be problems going to a congregate shelter and feeling safe.  And here, they'll have a little home.  They can lock the door.  They don't have to worry about being attacked or having their belongings stolen.  And I just think it's a really nice idea.  And I really think that the city should embrace it as somebody willing to do some of the city's work.  Thank you.  And is Ann Polivka here?  Good evening, council members and everybody present.  Yes, I'm an older woman myself.  One of the things I've noticed is a lot more sensitivity to heat, to cold.  I've got arthritis.  The sidewalk would be a very hard place to sleep, very uncomfortable.  And a lot of older women also have a lot of problems with chronic health conditions.  Everything from diabetes to hypertension, cardiac, lung.  All those are exacerbated by sleeping outside,  let alone the problem of security.  I really support this idea.  And I appreciate the fact that the council has seen fit to set up an ad hoc committee to consider it.  It's really exciting.  I was a little bit dismayed that it was just a small group, just four tiny homes.  But then I thought of the big hoop-de-doo for the CHAT retirement folks a couple nights ago that I attended.  And remembered back to the day when it was just safe space at the Chico Peace and Peace Center.  And there was maybe just 12 people in that small packed-in room at the Chico Peace and Justice Center.  And it evolved from there eventually into CHAT.  So these things that start small as pilot projects, and I support the idea of a pilot project also,  start small as a pilot project, but then move on to gather community support, church support.  I was part of the safe space with the Quaker meeting,  Chico Friends meeting.  One of the churches here in town.  And we worked with safe space, worked with at least five or six other churches and synagogues in town.  And provided eventually housing and meals for, what was it about, at least 50 people per night.  So I want to support this.  And I hope the council continues to see fit to support something like this that's small.  Especially when there's churches that, you know,  Charles already has lined up three churches.  I think that's pretty impressive.  Thank you.  She's our last speaker.  All right.  Comments from council?  Council Member Van Overbeek.  So I think it was the last meeting.  There was a woman that came in in a wheelchair that was an occupant of the alternate site.  And she told a heartbreaking story of how her life in the alternate site.  And so I was very moved by that.  And I think that's a great thing.  I can't remember until I found out from Amber Abney Bass that she had been offered shelter at the Genesis shelter and refused to go.  So the reason we have so many tents in the plaza is because most of these people, and Eric, I think you told me 80% of the people that are out there right now have been offered space in the shelter and they refuse to go.  So we already have a tiny house village that's extremely successful.  And it's called the Genesis shelter.  And there are empty tiny houses available every night.  So any one of those people that wants to get into a tiny house where the door locks and has heating and air conditioning has the ability to do that right now.  And we don't need to create another source of mayhem in the town, at least until we've maximized the capacity at the Genesis shelter.  And if people don't like that, we're going to have to do it.  And if people don't like the fact that it's too big or it's too small or it's the wrong color, that's unfortunate.  But there's, we have, they have the opportunity right now to find shelter in a tiny house village that exists and we know it works.  It's a proven success.  Council Member Hawley.  I think the comments by Council Member Van Overbeek have already been addressed by many of the service providers.  And users.  And users of our different shelters around town already.  And that is that there are certain needs that need to be addressed.  And right now our city hasn't fully fulfilled those needs.  And one of those are women who have been through a significant amount of trauma in their past that don't feel comfortable living with 100 plus other people in one space.  And rather than brushing it aside.  And asserting that they need to provide the specific set of shelters that we already have.  I think it's a good idea to continue to be creative.  And I really look towards staff when going forward.  So hearing Mr. Vieg's idea of going forward with an administrative use permit.  Maybe do a pilot project.  I am very much in favor of.  Council Member Winslow.  And then O'Brien.  This is not something that we are asked to do ourselves.  It's something we are asked to permit.  Like get out of the way of.  And I think that it's a great opportunity to invite people within the community to participate in what otherwise is the city's responsibility.  At least under the Warren settlement agreement right now.  So it would look like it would save us money.  And just one thing I want to throw in for in getting a report.  If we look at requiring administrative use permit or zoning variance or something.  I just want to make sure that we account for whatever permit cost those would be.  Because I think we could chip in maybe.  And that could just be in the form of subsidizing a permit cost that they have.  Mr. Vieg.  Thank you.  I was going to.  Before you guys concluded I was going to ask that question.  But I also want to share what an administrative use permit is.  You don't pay to receive the approval.  You pay for a process.  And the process includes engagement of the other departments.  It includes meeting with and engaging the community.  Having a hearing.  Where people get to hear and understand.  And that's where you set some conditions.  And have the guard rails.  And it's discretionary.  And if somebody wants to appeal it.  It could end up here.  So the point is people talk about let's just get that use permit and move along.  It's a process.  And there's findings.  And it's intended to protect not just the community but the applicant themselves.  It provides that protection.  And then to your question.  The administrative use permit is around 2600.  So I was.  I mean these questions will come up.  So I would be interested in understanding council's position on that fee.  But we would certainly need them to fill out the application.  And provide the information that they've already provided in another form.  Council Member O'Brien and then Council Member Nichols.  So Tom you make some really good points.  They really are fair points.  But I also want to make sure.  That we're not jumping head first into a major problem.  It's nice to say you know put a little tiny house in a church parking lot.  And go forth and do good things.  Until something happens with that tiny home.  It burns down or something.  And someone is hurt or injured and killed.  So we need to understand what we're getting into.  I'm certainly willing to look at.  At least the parameters of a pilot project.  Where you pick one church.  Two tiny homes.  And let's look at what that would entail.  Certainly have staff weigh in.  But I want to make sure we understand what we're getting into as a city.  And sometimes waving a magic wand does not remove our liability.  I want to make sure we understand that.  What we're getting into.  So we're doing it correctly.  But I understand the concept.  And I do actually applaud you Charles.  We want to take care of vulnerable women.  That's the reality on the street.  I get that.  And I understand that.  And I support that.  But I want to make sure we do this correctly.  And I think Brendan brings up some very valid points.  That I think we need to consider.  And really weigh in.  To make sure we're not jumping head first.  Into something that will be detrimental.  Council Member Goldstein.  Sure.  I think this is mostly being covered by other council members.  And our speakers.  But the idea of a pilot program.  Sounds good.  Sounds like a good start that we can learn from.  Figure out what kinks we might run into.  And I thought that was a really good useful clarification.  On the administrative use permit.  I think one question that kind of remains in my mind.  Is whether if we directed staff to work with North State Shelter Team.  On a pilot project.  If there's any way that for that pilot.  We could waive that fee.  Or if that's something that the community group would still need to provide.  Do you have any insight on that?  I think that's a good question.  I think that's a good question.  That's council's call.  For sure.  And then.  Do we have any spare change lying around in the budget.  Where that could.  You know under the couch or something.  Where that could be covered.  Okay.  Staff time too.  That is of course an issue.  Yeah.  Fair.  We're not providing snacks for the meeting usually.  I think.  I don't know where exactly we want to go on this.  But I think.  Charles I was pretty happy when you made it through.  Almost your whole entire thing.  Until you at the end once again brought up.  The city is going to fight you.  And we have said all the way along.  Never once has the city been able to fight you.  I know that this staff has spent time after time after time after time.  Having meetings.  And saying.  Here's what you need to do.  Here's what you need to bring back.  Here's what we need to do to bring it forward.  So to debunk this meeting.  And I think.  We're fighting.  You know.  We're doing.  You think what you're trying to do is hard.  Go try to build a house.  And see what these builders have to go through.  And what the stories that we have to hear.  About what happens on the second floor.  When you got to wrap your water heater with this.  And do this type of pipe.  And certain nails.  And everything else.  Like they fight the city.  So I'm all for.  You've seen it twice.  Charles.  Charles.  That's a great way to support a project.  So.  Bring something to the city.  We can.  Direct staff.  To analyze.  The administrative permit.  $2800 is a heck of a lot less than the $15,000 or $20,000.  That we were asking for.  On the permit for the.  What was happening over on the esplanade.  For I think that was safe space.  And I think that.  $2800 shouldn't be over comable.  And I think that you need to come together.  To the city.  With a program.  And have staff come back to us.  With what a potential pilot program would look like.  And we can vote at that time.  Whether we approve that or not.  And I concur mayor.  We need a proposal.  And outbursts like that Charles.  Will not sway any one of us.  Especially me in your favor.  I'm trying to advocate for you.  But those kind of outbursts will not.  Keep me in your camp.  So having said that.  I think we need a proposal.  I think that needs to go.  And that certainly can be worked in conjunction.  With community development.  So we understand.  But we need to have something tangible.  That we can look at.  That addresses all of our concerns.  That's what we need for us to move forward.  And I think the pilot idea.  Would be something like.  One church location.  With two tiny homes.  For two people.  Two vulnerable women.  I just wanted to share.  I don't want a proposal.  It's the same thing.  But he has given us pieces.  You know ideas.  I want an application.  Application.  Sorry I used the wrong word.  You need to apply.  So whatever that language is.  That's what we're looking for.  And the reason is.  You have to have property owner consent.  So the church has to say.  Yes this is what we want to do.  I do know.  For the record.  They want to do the four tiny homes.  Or the four sheds.  So I just want you to know.  That's what they've always been proposing.  I don't care if it's.  Council's direction to go to.  That's what we're looking for.  And that's what we'll do.  But I just know.  That's what they've been proposing.  I suspect I know who that pastor.  And general contractor is.  So I can certainly have a conversation with them as well.  I feel like we're a little.  Stuck maybe on some nuances.  Of who has to make the first move.  Because my impression was that.  We could direct staff to start a pilot project.  With North State Shelter Team.  And that then North State Shelter Team.  Can bring in their proposal.  They need to make.  And then staff can do what they need to do.  And if there's a problem.  It shouldn't even have to come back to us.  If there's no problems.  Right?  Administrative use permit would normally.  Because it's a lesser permit.  And that's why I kind of suggesting.  That they reach out to the neighborhood.  Non-controversial.  Would be going to the zoning administrator.  If there's a lot of volume.  And a lot of neighborhood resistance.  We usually kick those quickly.  To the planning commission.  Because they're not a staff member.  They are your appointees.  So.  That's why I think it's important for them.  To do some outreach ahead of time.  To kind of hear the issues.  That helps them address them.  Helps us address them.  When we then have a public hearing.  Perfect.  So there's really nothing for us to do then.  Somebody just needs to make an application.  And if there's a problem.  Or something that we need to overturn.  Or overdo or change in our code.  Then we would do it at that time.  So at this point.  There's nothing stopping this from moving forward.  But saying that yes.  We are going to look at how to.  The administrative use permit.  What we're going to say is.  They want to deviate from some of the standards.  Associated with the temporary emergency shelter.  And so I want to make sure that you guys support that.  So Mr. V.  If they sit down with you.  And get you the specifics.  Of what would be put on an application.  Could you come back to us in two weeks.  With a report.  On what action we would need to take.  In order to make that.  No I think the mayor has it correct.  If they submit an application.  We will start to process that administrative use permit.  We will reach out.  They will have a pre-neighborhood application.  Neighborhood meeting.  We'll talk internally.  We will engage the city attorney's office.  If we have some concerns about.  Because it's temporary.  Can they circumvent that.  On a temporary basis.  We're going to have to work through those issues.  As we played it up for the zoning administrator.  So it might not have to come back to you.  Might not okay.  So are you not necessarily looking for us to.  Vote on a direction.  Are you looking.  I want to know that you guys support.  Them proceeding with this proposal.  It seems.  I would make a motion then.  That we in general.  Support the idea of.  North state shelter team.  Bringing forward an application.  And we support staff.  To do everything that they can.  Within reason to make it go through.  And if there is an issue to bring it back to us.  Correct.  That's my motion.  Seconded.  Seeing nods.  I will help put on a community meeting.  Yeah invite us.  Do we have a scope of what that is.  Are we saying it's.  Two four six eight ten.  Do we have.  I said two to four.  No more than four.  Your proposal was four.  I think that's the number.  I'm fine with two.  If you want to make that friendly amendment.  I'm fine either way.  Like I said I think we need to start small.  This is a significant step.  Let's do it right.  I'm not done talking.  Thank you.  We can certainly expand that.  But I'm going to make a friendly amendment.  To keep that at two.  And certainly we can expand it to four.  If the two is working.  But we need to make sure that we have this on firm ground.  I made the original motion.  So I will accept the friendly amendment.  You can still say no to a friendly amendment.  Yeah I don't want to limit it to two.  I'm going to make it a friendly amendment.  I'm not going to block this from passing.  But I think we should leave that flexibility.  That if staff is working with a group.  That they should.  And a church.  That they should all be able to decide.  I'm not comfortable with limiting what people do.  To help get people off the street.  To only two and not four.  When there's a place for four.  And there's a proposal for four.  There's still two more people sleeping in camps on the street.  I don't care if we're not getting sued.  Because we can justify this out of our liability.  But this is still people sleeping on the street.  Who can still die by fire.  By all kinds of things.  And it happens all the time.  I'd be happy enough if it comes back as a pilot project for two.  With the opportunity for expansion.  But I think that should be up to the groups working together on this.  Alright we have a motion and a second.  Can I make a substitute motion?  To um.  You know that we support this concept.  But without the limit of how many structures.  That we have.  I'll second.  Okay.  So is the substitute motion to.  Um.  Accept the pilot program.  Or have the pilot program with the four.  As presented by North State.  And I wanted to clarify.  Are you asking North State shelter team.  To bring back an application.  Or are you asking them for additional information.  Yes.  I'm asking them for additional information.  Because I know that council member O'Brien was clear.  About the application.  But in this motion.  Are you wanting.  Because staff needs an application.  In order to determine.  If it meets.  Basically the same motion.  That Mayor Reynolds had proposed before.  But without the limitation.  Okay.  Thank you.  Perfect.  Okay.  Council member Goldstein.  Yes.  Council member Holly.  Yes.  Council member O'Brien.  No.  Council member Van Overbeek.  No.  Council member Winslow.  Yes.  Vice Mayor Bennett.  No.  Mayor Reynolds.  I'm going to go yes.  Let's move forward.  Okay.  It carries 4-3.  All right.  Reports and communications.  The following reports and communications have been posted in this council's information.  No action be taken under their items.  Unless the council agrees to.  On a subsequent agenda.  City manager report.  Nothing further.  Okay.  There's a draft MOU of Chico Public Safety Association.  CPSA for information only.  Any request may verbally request an item to be agendized at a future meeting with a majority vote from council needed in order for staff to agendize.  Do we have any council member requests?  No.  All right.  We are adjourned to closed session meeting on the 21st at 5 or 530.  Followed by our regular city council meeting on October 21st right here at 421 Main Street Chico.  Thank you.  Thank you.
