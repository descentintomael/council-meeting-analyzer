 Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. on the Paradise Sewer Program, the regionalization effort that we've taken part of in the last couple of years. Quick overview, we're gonna talk about the efforts and the formation of the Sewer Regionalization Project Advisory Committee, SERPAC, which Mayor Coolidge and Vice Mayor Reynolds are members of, along with two other Paradise Council members. We're gonna consider the impacts to Chico's Water Pollution Control Plant, basically what are the capacity impacts for that potential Paradise connection. We're gonna calculate or talk about a connection fee that we've kind of landed on to move forward with, just make sure that we're on the right track and kind of discuss that briefly. We're gonna talk about the status and then kind of continue on our project development as long as everything looks good moving forward. And so this is a pretty neat project, a potential project to be part of. We wanna do everything we can for our friends and neighbors up in Paradise. There's a big focus by the regional board now for larger regionalization components for wastewater. So for the potential pipeline to collect sewer from the town of Paradise and their sewer service area and then transfer it down the Skyway likely in a pipeline through portions of the city of Chico out River Road to our wastewater treatment plant is pretty neat, it's a pretty cool project and kind of one of those projects that you might drive with your grandkids and say, hey, I was part of that project. And so it's cool stuff and I'm excited to be a part of it, but then you look at project history and realize that this has been studied for about 50 years and realize you're not so cool and many before you have looked at this and so it's a little humbling for me at least that this is not the first time, obviously, this has been talked about. So over the last 50 years, even starting in 1969, there was feasibility studies and look aheads at, you know, a solution for the sewer in Paradise. Paradise is, I think, the only city of its size, incorporated city of its size, west of the Mississippi without a sanitation system. On ourよろしくよろしくよろしく andよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしく!よろしくuliよろしく to the sewer situation in Paradise. They like our plant. We have a great working relationship with the regional board. They know we run an extremely efficient plant. It's modernized. It's very technically advanced. And so they think and feel that this is the best solution for Paradise. This is a connection. Also, we have this. This is our NPDES permit, National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit. This is extremely valuable. Our permit covers both a land application that will go to groundwater because of a couple of holding ponds that we have at the plant, and then also our outfall to the Sacramento River. These are not issued anymore. So again, this is extremely valuable, and we should never, ever give it up. So this is a busy slide. This is just a little bit about the history. In December of 2020, the Town of Paradise voted unanimously to advance a regional approach to their sewer project and start performing and investigating a full environmental project. And then in December of 2020, the City of Chicago voted unanimously to pass a regional impact report relating to a potential connection to the City of Chico. And then soon after, February 2nd of 2021, the Chico City Council voted unanimously to execute a cooperative funding agreement, the CFA, to facilitate work and grant funding payments related to the City's ability and needs to accept a connection from the Town of Paradise. So really, that cooperative funding agreement opens up an opportunity for us to receive grant funds and reimbursement funds from the Town of Paradise to look at the feasibility of this and really to study the impacts of our plant. So that's a big step. On ourよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしく!よろしく for the surf pack first it's going to monitor progress of the paradise sewer project overall including the the eir and then efforts being done in the town and city's cooperative work agreement secondly develop principles of agreement for an inner municipal agreement between the town and the city so the principles of our agreement are just kind of a a road map with you know each side just kind of keeping us in our lanes and between the edges to ultimately form an inter-municipal agreement which will be the overarching agreement for the relationship in the in the cooperative regionalization connection guide the public participation through the eir process which happens separately but in parallel with the committee's work and that's really paradise's responsibility and they're responsible for managing their their eir and the public outreach but the surf pack will kind of oversee that and make sure there's plenty of opportunity for the public to engage and review the process and of course mayor andrew coolidge and vice mayor canada Casey Reynolds from the city of Chico. And then Town of Paradise representatives are Mayor Steve Crowder and Councilmember Jody Jones. And Mayor Coolidge and Vice Mayor Reynolds, you guys look fantastic in those pictures. For the record, please. Teasing. And so this is just kind of a quick overview that shows the service area. So it's not all of town limits. It's two corridors, if you will, Skyway and Clark Road. And that kind of shows you the potential route or the proposed route of the pipeline, which will go down the Skyway, cross over to the Midway, Higgin Lane, out on Crouch Avenue to Chico River Road, and ultimately to the wastewater treatment plant. This is kind of a focused look at the sewer service area. So, again, it's not all parcels. It's only about 1,200 parcels in Paradise. That's kind of a parcel layer there of the Town of Paradise. That kind of gives you a good look at what the sewer service is. And I recommend that the City Council and the Councilmembers in the audience go to paradisesewer.com. The town has done an excellent job propping up a website that has a narrowed focus on this effort. You know, great roadmaps and timelines, and they keep it up to date regularly. So it's a great resource for the public to stay up to speed on the project. All right, consider impacts to our wastewater treatment plant or our water pollution control plant, as it's called. So we've done a lot of work on that. A bit of planning, of course, with our plant. The last major facility plant update was in 2005. We recently engaged on our full sewer utility planning report and analysis in 2018. And, again, I want to stress that the regionalization effort, the potential Paradise connection, is completely separate from our ongoing rate analysis that the Finance Committee is hearing and will ultimately make it to the full Council. So two separate. Efforts that are completely separate. And the Paradise connection does not have a bearing on our rate analysis at this point. So this is a population growth chart that we really utilize to project capacity and build capacity at the plant. It goes back 20 years, and you can see our growth rate in 2001, 2002 was pretty aggressive. The housing market boom in 2004, 2005, 2006. And then, of course, the global economic growth. The economic crash in 2008. Chico really didn't experience that until 2009, 2010. And then growth has been pretty flat throughout. Until 2018, of course, the campfire in 2018 completely changed the landscape and our growth rate projections. Those numbers and those statistics came in in 2019. And you can see that unprecedented growth of 20% in 2019. That's unheard of. That's decades and decades worth of growth. And we basically experienced it within 48 hours. We were the fastest growing city in California for some time. What does that mean for wastewater? It means a lot. So this is our growth projections and our capacity projections chart that we reference commonly. And so there's where the campfire hit. And prior to the campfire, that was our average dry weather flow growth projections in blue. We had kind of an average of 1.2% growth, which is reasonable. And that's how we projected and continue to project our capacity needs. Post-campfire new growth. And you can see that in this area here. That's substantial. That equated to about 1 million gallons per day directly after the campfire subsided to about 600,000 gallons a day of added flow that we're now treating post-campfire. But what it's done, as you can see through the growth chart in 20 years, it's really changed our capacity requirements. And that's something that we're wrestling with. And the regional board recognizes that and understands that. Okay. Thank you. Here's where the potential Paradise Connection will hit in 2027. Their projected total flow at buildout is .464. So it's pretty minimal because of their sewer service area. It's something. I mean, it's, you know, 464,000 gallons a day is what they're projected at buildout. And their buildout is 20 years. So that's a long time. Okay. So at the immediate point of connection proposed in, you know, 2027, 2028, there's not going to be an impact. There will be no real impact. But as that continues and they continue through their buildout, it will impact and eat up a little bit of capacity that we have existing for Chico ratepayers. So looking at our capacity impacts. And so these are kind of our long-term planning efforts. We have a 100-foot secondary clarifier identified there. The first one in blue out of those four that you see, the three are existing. That's currently slated for 2028. And then a couple 150-foot secondary clarifiers, blower and electrical building, return activated sludge and waste activated sludge, pump station and some other ancillary upgrades. But that's kind of our growth. One thing we have, not only is our plant extremely modern and efficient. We also have a great resource for the community. Press and Press and Press and Press and Press and Press and Press and Press and Press and Press and Press and Press and Press and Press and Press and Press and Press and Press and Press and Press and Press and Press and Press and Press and Press and Press and Press and Press and Press and Press and Press and Press and Press and projected capacity. So what we're really focusing on, on considering the impacts to our plant from the potential connection from Paradise, is our water pollution control plant, our wastewater plant facility needs, flow projections, and then now we're going to focus on the payment, the potential payment, connection payment that Paradise would have to pay to us if they were to connect. So that's the next item is how do we calculate the proposed connection fee. So there's a couple of, there's multiple ways we looked at doing this. We took the value of the existing plant, which is our last valuation was in 2019, evaluated about 115 million, and that's just for the plant alone. Added a little bit of inflation of course because of 2022 it's likely going up due to construction costs and where the economy is right now. We looked at our capacity driven needs over time, those are projected decades out at you know almost 95 million with the Paradise connection, decades and decades out it's going to be 118 million. We looked at condition driven needs where that's plant wear and tear, so the condition deteriorates and then you have to replace it, that's called a condition driven need. Currently projected decades out is almost 45 million with the Paradise connection, decades out it would be 55 million. And then of course the regulatory needs, that's going to be a little bit more complicated, but that's going to be a little bit more complicated. We looked at the regulatory driven needs long term around 76 million with Paradise 95, and that's something I'm actually pretty proud about. I mentioned it in the state of the city. We have, we had about 105 million worth of capital projects identified in the next 30 years or so in our facility analysis, and again we have a great working relationship with the regional board and we were able to, through negotiations, take about 25 million off of that list of regulatory requirements through that term. So they recognize the value of our plant, the efficiency of our plant, what we're trying to do. They want to see the regionalization, the regional connection, and so we were able to work with them to shave off about 25 million, something we're pretty proud of. We also looked at our capacity needs and then of course with that capacity from Paradise at 0.464 at build out, again that's in 20 years, what that would look like. So again there were multiple options that we looked at and formulas that teams have been doing to help us with that. We looked at the capacity needs, we looked at the capacity needs of our contract engineers, we'll through both Paradise's engineers and our contract engineers and our internal engineers looked at. We kind of took the condition driven piece of the formula out because it's, you know, those the wear and tear on the existing plant isn't really Paradise's issue, it's really Chico ratepayers issue, so that didn't seem fair. So we took that out and just really focused on capacity and the value of the existing plant. So those are the formulas that we're kind of working with at this point. So the capacity in our plants, it's extremely valuable and so we're trying to put a number to that and what does that mean. So 118 million and that's the formula there that comes out to the capacity driven component is about 7.4 million worth of capacity driven costs that they would have to pay. And then of course the value of our existing plant. Having them owning and operating a wastewater treatment plant is extremely valuable. Having that discharge permit to the Sacramento River, you don't get those anymore, it's extremely valuable. So that's a component of that. So the total connection payment that we've landed on so far is just shy of 15 million. So that's what Paradise would pay just to have the ability to connect to our wastewater treatment plant. And I will add that this is the highest cost, this is the highest potential out of all the formulas we looked at, this was the highest cost. What could it do for me? It would operationally, we would accelerate that fourth secondary clarifier. Again it's slated for 2028, we have to build it regardless. But if this project were to move forward, they work through their EIR and everybody agrees on the scenario and the connection, then we would try to build it in 2026. We would use their connection fee payment to build the fourth secondary clarifier. So status real quickly, this is kind of where we are. Again the top arrow, that's the EIR current and Paradise is working really hard to finalize that. Draft they hope to release it late spring. And that's really their responsibility. But the SERPAC is kind of overseeing that as well, making sure they stay on track. And the SERPAC in general has, you know, we've gone through all the technical analysis. We've really mulled through multiple renditions and potential connection payment estimates. And we've landed on the 15 million. And then now we're using that connection fee to kind of finalize the principles agreement, which we will bring back to the full council to approve. And we'll start to work on the intergovernmental agreement, which will be the overarching MOU, if you will, that will guide the entire process. And that's kind of where we're at now. Just another timeline. If everything goes through, as you can see, we're on the top. We are here. They're finalizing their draft environmental impact report, which is slated to be done this spring, late this spring of 2022. And that's kind of the process of where they will go. And then construction, if everything goes as planned. They'll start their right-of-way acquisitions in 2023 through 2024. And they'll start construction in 2024, 2025. So I'll conclude that our intent is to continue with the SERPAC scheduled meetings. They're monthly, very informative. I recommend that if any of you want to attend to look at those or ask Mayor Coolidge or Vice Mayor Reynolds for updates or reach out to me at any time. We intend to move forward with that connection fee as a payment. We'll incorporate that into the principles of agreement. We'll bring that principles of agreement back for full council consideration and approval. And then, yeah, we'll return for that full council approval. So this is just kind of an update presentation. I'm not asking for any formal action, of course, right now. We're going to continue down this track. If there were any disagreements or any issues that any council member has with this on where we're at, then we'll need to agendize it for a next meeting and do a deeper dive or a real look through it. But this, again, is just kind of the guidelines of the principal agreement. We're trying to move forward with it and we'll finalize that draft and bring it back for full consideration. That concludes my update. All right. Any questions? All right. Thank you very much. Thank you. Okay. We will move on. Please note that Item 5.3 has been removed from the agenda and will be heard at a future date. And that's the Internal Affairs Committee recommendations. So at this point, we're in the middle of the meeting. We'll move on to the consent agenda. Do we have any speakers on the consent agenda? Yes, we have four at this time. I will call the first two speakers. If you can go ahead and line up. Nicole Nava and Julie Threat. Good evening, Council. Nice to see everybody here. My comments on this item, which is a whole lot of work, is a lot of parcels. And the main point on each title is basically the City Council authorizing the City Manager to execute the purchase agreement and any related documents in connection with the acquisition of real property located along State Route 99. There's like, I want to say there's eight on this, but there's nine in the report or it's seven and eight in the report. Sorry, not remembering. But here's my deal. I understand completely how grants work. And that's why I'm here. And this is probably primarily tied to that grant done a long time ago under the prior Council. I understand the need for wonderful bike paths that make interconnectedness a thing in Chico and to kind of close some gaps. What I'm concerned with is do we have the ability for maintenance and operations of all these capital improvement type projects and other projects that are happening when we tried to ask under the prior Council, under the prior Council, and ourよろしくよろしく andよろしく andよろしく andよろしく andよろしく andよろしく andよろしく andよろしく andよろしく andよろしく andよろしく andよろしく andよろしく andよろしく andよろしく andよろしく andよろしく andよろしく andよろしく andよろしく andよろしく andよろしく andよろしく and and and want to have way out there, but not having the foundation to have that be our reality. So I just would like to ask, and again, I support bike riding. I support all of this. I love the, it was like, we are so great at obtaining grants, kudos to people who do that. But please, we have to think about, can we sustain what we take on for the lighting that'll be on the path, the cleaning that's needed for the path when we're not even keeping up with what we have now. So truly, this is a concern of Chicoans. I'm not the only one. I'm here as kind of like a figurehead to talk to this point, because some of us were discussing this. And nowhere in the literature that was attached in the reports link could I find anything that addressed that ability to sustain it ongoing. And kind of like, I appreciated the map we saw in the demonstration of the roads and all of that and the cost associated, but I still don't see how we as citizens can get on other than seeing where you're going. And I think that's a big part of the reason why we're here. Yellow or red and danger, Will Robinson, when are we in the queue? So are we just squeaky wheeling and calling the city constantly, or are we in a queue? So that would help alleviate some of the energy that goes into like, hey, how come they're getting attention and we're not? So thank you for listening. I appreciate your time. Okay. I'm here to talk on 2.3, which I thank Ruth Starnup for bringing to my attention. It's the military use of the city. And I think that's a big part of the reason why we're here. On policy and I need to paint a picture. That's only way I can do things and this will paint a picture of exactly why we need to take a second look at this policy that is effectively weaponizing our police force and it's a hypothetical. It's May and we just had two weeks of rain. The birds are out and the temperatures are perfect and there are no raging wildfires. Warren versus Cheek goes over and no more close meetings and the palace and shelter has opened and is successfully transitioning folks out of Comanche Creek and service providers andよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしく There's an underlying current of division. The Chico Facebook group has moved on, but NAVA can't seem to relax because there's always a socialist problem or battle that needs to be fought. Maybe it's a retail cannabis business who is delivering pot directly to a rental house next to the baseball fields at PV. Or maybe the new assault on our junior high kids by the Butte County Public Health Department who have targeted the middle schoolers in Chico because their vaccination rate is much lower than state average, and they can get their vaccination without parental approval. They've put in a promotional program. At the Butte County Public Health Clinic directly across the street from Chico Junior High in Oleander, they have started lunchtime walk-in appointments. Kids can come in, get their shots, sit with their friends, and talk about how their mom's head will explode when they get home from school with their vaccination card. As they walk back to class, the mobile vaccine clinic is rolling in, having been up at Shasta Elementary getting the five-year-olds vaccinated as they sign up for kindergarten in the fall. All appears to be okay in Chico, but you can feel an undercurrent that something's not right. Parents are getting restless, especially the moms who have become more active in the community. Threats. Threats. Threats. Threats. Threats. City council meetings. They're down at Orville Board of Supervisors. And they're done with their kids being bullied into walking across the street into a clinic to get vaccinated. Tired of the school administrators doing nothing to keep the mobile clinics off elementary school property, and they're definitely tired of the state government berating them. What did Secretary Becerra say when he was here yesterday? He said he hopes that parents and family members look at the hundreds of millions of people in the United States who have gotten vaccinated and have proven that COVID-19 vaccines are safe. He will do everything he can to make sure people feel confident when a vaccine is offered to the child. You can almost imagine that this might really happen when another government official comes into town. When a mom has decided to quit their job or put their kids into school. Our elections heat up in June, right? We don't have, like, any crazy elections coming in June? When the illegaluliuli andよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしく Four shot, six shot, 131 feet or 50 yards. We need to take a look at this policy. Thanks, Ruth. Ruth Sarnoff, followed by Sasha Anya. Oops, sorry, I did the wrong one. Let's see. It's my understanding that the whole Chico Police Department document is going to be at a different point on the agenda. Am I correct? It's going to be on the legislative? That's a question. I'm very concerned. I have read the entire document a couple of times. Others are reading it, and others will comment on it. And I will wait to make my comments on that for a later time. I'm very concerned about the rolling of agendas over and the loss of a lot of the people that are speaking at different meetings. Yes. They're getting rolled over, and there's like about five different versions of the same meeting, you know. And it's really important, I think, that we, like I was at the workshop on Friday, and I don't know if that was rolled over. I'm not sure if I got into any information for you or not. It was a workshop. It was very hard to find. And I just think that there is a problem. There's a lot of continuation of some of the same things, and it's hard to follow all of the, all of the, all of the rolled over meetings and things that are then agendized later. And it's even harder for the public, because I spend most of my life trying to expose the fact that we're in climate change. Ms. Sarnoff, during this time, we need you to address the particular items on the consent agenda. I'm just saying that I don't think that the issue of the Chico Police Department, and the weaponizing, and all of this document is going to be taken up now. So I'm reserving my time for when it comes up. This is when it is up. You can speak to it. I think other people will demand differently. And, you know, this is not going to go away, because climate change and water are still issues. And if you don't want to talk about them, that's okay, too. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Tanya. Thank you. Greetings, everyone. I was kind of aghast when I saw the military equipment use policy approval piece in here. And it was just so many pages of so much weaponry. And I feel like it's out of place. I feel like... I feel like we're getting into, like, an area where if we need to bring in the National Guard, let's bring them in, you know, actual military. If we're starting to pretend to have, like, this ad hoc little kind of military, that starts to, to me, feel more like a police state. And I don't know if other people feel that way. I don't feel comfortable when I walk in foreign countries and police are walking around with, you know, a lot of weaponry and stuff. I don't actually feel safer. It makes me feel like, hey, there's a big problem. We have to have a lot of weaponry to deal with all of our problems. It kind of sends a different message. And I don't think it really helps the psychology and the culture of a town to have, you know, that kind of feel going on. So I don't know where all this is going. I may be speaking out of turn or, you know, misinformed about aspects of what this is. But at first glance, it really put me off. It made me feel very uncomfortable. The level of weaponry. The level of weaponry that's being requested and will be able to be available to the police department. It's like, it's not Chechnya. It's Chico. So just, I have big concerns. I think other people do. Thank you. She was our last speaker. All right. Do we have any council disqualifications or no votes? I'd like to pull item 2.3, please. All right. Any other no votes or disqualifications? All right. Entertain a motion. I'll second that. I have a motion from Council Member Morgan. A second from Council Member O'Brien. Madam Clerk, take your role. That's to approve all but 2.3, correct? Yes. Thank you. Yes. That's what I have of consent. Minus 2.3. Council Member Bennett. Yes. Council Member Brown. Aye. Council Member Morgan. Aye. Council Member O'Brien. Yes. Council Member Tandon. Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds. Aye. Mayor Coolidge. Aye. Carry 7-0. All right. Item 2.3. Council Member Brent. Thank you. And I'm assuming someone's here to represent it. I have heard a few things from the public about this particular policy. I think when you read military equipment policy, it can raise some concern. And so I was hoping that for the good of the public, we could hear a little bit more about the Assembly bill that led to this policy and why it has gone into effect. Sure. And you are correct. I do have Captain Billy Aldrich here, our operations commander, who's been working on this project, and he can come up and answer your questions. Thank you, Chief Menden. So if you could just start very briefly by explaining the Assembly bill that led to this policy and why it's gone into effect. Sure. Or the purpose of the bill, at least. Absolutely. And thank you for the chance to come here tonight and explain this policy and what has caused us to start this process. In September of last year, the Assembly of California passed a bill known as AB 481 to require agencies, both state and local agencies, to create a military weapons inventory policy. And that's what we're doing. We're creating a military weapons inventory policy and ordinance for approval by governing bodies. We've started that process, and that's what you have before you tonight. This is nothing new in law enforcement. It's just an Assembly bill that has been created so that we have some transparency within the communities that law enforcement serves. And that's what we have before you tonight is full transparency and the equipment that we have. I'd like to note that if you read AB 481, you will see that it's not just the military equipment anduli anduli anduli anduli anduli anduli anduli anduli anduli anduli anduli anduli anduli anduli anduli anduli anduli anduli anduli anduli anduli anduli anduli anduli anduli anduli anduli anduli anduli anduli anduli anduli anduli anduli anduli anduli anduli anduli anduli anduli anduli anduli anduli anduli anduli anduli anduli anduli anduli anduli anduli anduli anduli anduli anduli anduli anduli anduli anduli anduli anduli anduli anduli anduli anduli anduli anduli anduli anduli anduli anduli anduli anduli anduli anduli anduli anduli anduli anduli anduli anduli anduli anduli anduli anduli anduli anduli anduli anduli anduli anduli anduli anduli anduli anduli anduli anduli ourselves. I understand the concern from our speakers tonight, and I too, as a community member, would have questions if I didn't know the information that I already know from working in law enforcement for almost 21 years. So, yeah, this policy that you have for you will require several readings, obviously. It has an ordinance piece to it that we had to change. We had to make an addition to the ordinance for the police department to allow for this military equipment to continue to be used. The way it reads is that we have to get approval for continued use, future purchases, and then we have to have public engagement, which we already have planned and how we're going to achieve that. We have a complaint process in place already. We have an email Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press that was created for the community to be able to voice their concerns if they have any with this policy or any kind of future use that we would have with this military equipment as defined in the law and we have a process in place of a procedure in place with the department where we handle those complaints through our internal affairs division. Thank you. Great summary. It says in the report that there's no fiscal impact attached to the staff report but obviously we're not purchasing new equipment at this time but maintaining the equipment, purchasing new equipment when stock becomes low is certainly costly and you can see some of those numbers listed out various parts of the policy but it is a little bit confusing to have it say no fiscal impact when that's the case when there's dollar amounts associated with those two things. Can you explain that? Absolutely. So the way we look at that is we have a budget that's already approved. We have no request to extend any line items categories within that budget for future purchases in terms of additional equipment. The only thing that we have requested recently was when the budget modification that was approved on January 15th and that was just monies that are already within our budget. We're just reallocating those savings for some future purchases of some equipment that has aged and needs to be replaced and then to further bolster our newly created drone unit. Which has been highly successful and has assisted our community in mutual aid throughout the county. So the bill as it's written is really designed to allow citizens to have the transparency about what's in stock, what's going to be restocked to weigh in about the cost and the benefit associated with the arsenal of military equipment. I understand that that definition is brought in the bill. We're not necessarily aggregating those costs in the report. I think I have a little bit of a question about that because it kind of gives a fuller picture. But I appreciate the summary of it. Is this the last time aside from the 30 day period that people will have to weigh in on this process? Not specifically related to complaints but as it relates to public engagement in the future? No. So we are required by the law to have an annual public engagement where they will be able to provide feedback, complaints, concerns, suggestions. We're always open to feedback, suggestions and we invite that at all times. That's why we have the email address that was created. And if you look within the policy, you'll find that procedure within there. And annually our governing body has to continue to approve this policy and ordinance. So once every year we'll come back to the council and request that you continue to approve the use and future purchases. On our list here and our list here and our list here and our list here and our list here and our list here and our list here and our list here and our list here and our list here and our list here and our list here and our list here and our list here and our list here and our list here and our list here and our list here and our list here and our list here and our list here and our list here and our list here and our list here and our list here and our list here and our list here and our list here and our list here and our list here and our list here and our list here and our list here and our list here and our list here and our list here and our list here and our list here and our list here and our list here and our list here and our list here and our list here and our list here and our list here and our list here and our list here and our list here and our list here and our list here and our list here and our list here and our list here and our list here and our list here and of equipment that we have is right in line with other agencies throughout the state with our size. And, you know, in terms of what we would use it for, I can't come off the top of my head, but the historical events where we've used those, I do know that law enforcement traditionally started using the rifles after the North Hollywood bank robbery in 1997. And we found ourselves outgunned, for a better term, there and law enforcement had to actually go to local gun stores to get rifles to subdue other threats to our community at that time. And so we have experienced times where the rifles have assisted us in keeping the community safe. I do know that one particular incident that our chief was involved in back when he was on the SWAT team was a subject who wasよろしく!よろしくよろしく barricaded in a residence and firing rifle rounds through the residence at officers and actually striking the armored vehicle that was used to rescue an officer who was pinned down in that situation. You know, in terms of where we would use it throughout the community, you know, I can give you multiple scenarios, but the biggest that I can tell you is that we never want to find ourselves in a position where we can't provide safety to our community. And sometimes, you know, law enforcement isn't pretty sometimes. And I'll admit that. And unfortunately, we have to have these types of weapons in our inventory to be able to keep the community safe. And this is pretty consistent across police departments and the types of material that they would have? Absolutely. And I would say that actually we have a lesser inventory of weapons than a lot of agencies. And so I think that's a good thing. And I think that's a good thing. If you look at the larger agencies, they have, you know, things that are well beyond the types of weapons that we have in our inventory. And then to answer your question on explosives, I'm not quite sure which piece of equipment you're referring to there. We don't have explosives in our inventory. I know that the interagency bomb squad has that type of stuff. That's all managed by the sheriff's office. Okay. Thank you for clarifying. Last thing I want to make mention of. In my reading of the policies, it looks like approving this would enable PD to replenish and purchase additional equipment without consulting the council, and by extension, the public, right? That's our constituency. Why wouldn't that be part of the budgeting process and the public meeting process? Right. It's a good question. And to provide clarity to that, that can be a little confusing. And what that means basically is as we use perishable items, things that are one-time use items such as different types of ammunition or maybe a, say, a rifle gets broken, you know, types of equipment that we would already purchase within our own budget that we have allotted for that type of equipment. We're not asking for approval to go out and buy, you know, some large piece of equipment that costs thousands of dollars, hundreds of thousands of dollars. We're just asking for the flexibility of the council to allow us to go and purchase those perishable items without having to come back to you every single time that we need, you know, 100 rounds of rifle ammo for qualifications and we run out. As we all know, we're in a trying time right now with events that are going on in the world. And when we find ourselves with these types of equipment, we're not going to be able to do that. We're not going to be able toよろしく ourよろしく ourよろしく ourよろしく ourよろしく ourよろしく ourよろしく ourよろしく ourよろしく ourよろしく ourよろしく our!よろしく ourよろしく ourよろしく ourよろしく our!!よろしく our the state for our qualifications, our training, and I know that there's some concern over the amount of ammunition that's listed in that inventory, and to provide clarity to that, if you look at that, a vast majority of it, well over three quarters of that is just practice ammo, which is required by the state for us to qualify on those weapons, and then you add in, we have a specialty unit that trains four times a month using that type of ammunition, and so you deplete it really quick, and if you have to wait to come back to council and get approval to purchase that kind of stuff, you find yourself real quick behind the eight ball, and the times that we have right now with these wars going on, you get pushed to the back of the stove, so to say, on the back burner of importance, and so we just want to stay up on that so that obviously... Our officers can be highly trained, highly proficient, and have the availability of that equipment readily available so that we don't find ourselves in a position where we don't have that availability to use that tool in the field to keep our community safe. Thank you so much. I'm so sorry. The last thing was about the public engagement. This was published on your website. Was it shared in other places? How can the public... Is the only way that people can provide commentary through that email? Can you explain that just as a closer? Absolutely. So on... On March 7th, I posted the policy and the inventory on our website. The law says that we have to publish it for 30 days prior to our council starting the approval process of the policy and the ordinance, and so if we do the math out on that, April 5th would be the first reading of the ordinance, and then April 19th would be your final reading of the ordinance, What that allows then is once you approve, we'll move forward with any type of continued use, continued purchasing, and then the annual reviews by council and the open engagement by the community. Actually, that starts right now. We have the... You know, the email is active. People have my number in the station. Call the police department. Ask to speak with me. Send me an email. You know, I'm always available to answer those types of questions. Thank you so much. All right. I don't have a question, but I just do have a couple of comments. I wanted to say that, you know, pretty much I think everybody in here knows that our supply chain is absolutely decimated right now. I'm buying products from my shop that I'm having to buy a year's worth of product because it's taking me six months to get what used to take me three weeks, so I trust our police department to proactively plan for what we're going to need for the future. I also want to remind everybody we are on an island. We are an hour and 15 minutes away from the closest place that has... any kind of weaponry or anything support of the size that we need. So if we need to be prepared to protect our community, we can't rely on Biggs, Gridley, Clusa. Are we going to call them? No. We're talking Roseville, Sacramento, Redding. People are going to take an hour, hour and 15 minutes to get here to help us. So I feel much safer knowing that we have a few things on hand. God forbid there's an emergency and we need something right away. And we just learned in 2018 we can have 30,000 people in our community in one day. One hour. So it's not like emergencies haven't happened here before. So I want to thank you guys for putting this all together. I think you're doing everything you can to be proactive. And I just want to remind you, I understand the fear. I'm glad that this information is out there, but I don't think it's near... It's not like we're going out and purchasing tanks and doing something totally different. We're just publicizing and showing what we have and how we're able to use it. So thank you for keeping our community safe. I'd like to follow up. With Vice Mayor Reynolds' comments, they're perfect, perfect. That's exactly what I was thinking. These are crazy times, and we need to be prepared. The Chico Police Department needs to be prepared should something really goofy happen. So I'm happy that you have this equipment. And if you need more, I think that should be discussed. I feel much safer should there be an emergency, that you have the weaponry you think you need in order to keep the people of Chico safe. So I just want to say thank you. All right. Further comments or questions from Council? Entertain a motion. So I will make a motion to approve. Second that. We have a motion from Council Member O'Brien. A second from Council Member Tandon. Madam Clerk, take the roll. Council Member Bennett. Yes. Sorry. Council Member Brown. No. Is that no? Correct. Okay. Thank you. Council Member Morgan. Yes. Council Member O'Brien. Yes. Council Member Tandon. Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds. Yes. Mayor Coolidge. Aye. Carries 6-1. All right. Moving on to Item 3, business from the floor. Members of the public may address the Council at this time on any matter not already listed on the agenda. With comments being limited to three minutes, or as determined based upon the number of speakers, Council cannot take any action at this meeting on requests made under this section of the agenda. We have six speakers. All right. Three minutes. Okay. First speaker is James Hutchinson, followed by Nicole Nava. Last time I appeared in front of this august body, I asked you why you didn't respond to emails that I had sent you over several months on one subject. And of course, I still haven't heard anything back. Not surprising. So, what I did was, took a look at the law, because I was worried about a danger of a conflict of interest. I think we have some leadership problems here. The leadership problem we have comes under a California government policy. Under the code number 1099. Under this code, a public officer, including, but not limited to, an appointed or elected member of a governmental board, commission, committee, or other body, shall not simultaneously hold two public offices that are incompatible. Offices are incompatible when any of the following circumstances are present, unless simultaneously holding of the particular office is compelled or expressly authorized by law. Number one, either of the offices may audit under the memorandum of understanding for the pimp board. Mr. O'Brien is on as agreed. Mr. Commander, it states under section 16 that in fact this council can audit that board any time. He is on both. He is both on part of the task force. He is on this council, a multi-member council. Under the law, he has a conflict of interest. Under this rule. Secondly, the budget. Who is it that writes the budget for the board? The task force. Who writes that budget? You all know, because you must have looked this up, knowing that there was a possible conflict of interest. The commander does. It can be overridden. It can be changed. But he writes that budget. Who approves that? This multi-member board. Any member of this board, in a multi-member board situation, is considered an officer. Mr. O'Brien again. Last time I was here, I was insulted because I started to leave this thing and I was asked a question, a legitimate one, about what I was referring to when I talked about the last line and what I was talking about. In that, I was talking about this application and a statement of economic interest form 700. 700 must be signed and returned by the set deadline. That was the line I was talking about. I was not talking about the date. That's fine. Nicole Nava, followed by Julie Three. Good evening. Well, I wanted to speak to 5.3, but my understanding is that got pulled. So, I will do this. I want to paint a picture for you all and the citizens of Chico that hopefully are listening. Of what I encountered today and like what we all encounter pretty much every day. So, I pull up in the lot, walk over here, and I was attempting to document. Nobody was outside. Attempting to just document there's tents because I thought I'll draw a juxtaposition when we have the Palace hopefully filled up. And, oh, how wonderful it will look over here, right? Okay. So, before and after experience. I literally get subjected to a female who comes roaring out of her tent, screaming the most disgusting vulgarities at me. I catch a little gander at her sign, which has disgusting words on it that I'm sure you all have had to see walking up as well. It is literally located right at the ramp where you walk up to this building. Unacceptable. Free speech is apparently only free to certain people in this community. Because I inquired, is that really acceptable? That we're going to have that facing people when they walk up? Totally unacceptable. Yelling, cursing, loud music during meetings. You know, people have to ask them to turn it down. Why are the Chico friends of the street allowed to violate health and safety code? Why are they allowed to deliver food repeatedly downtown multiple times a week? Unacceptable. The rest of us are held to health and safety codes. I know people who have tried to do cottage type industry that have people come down. And yet we have that. Interesting how enforcement is not equally applied in that kind of scenario. So here's the thing with internal affairs and how I will link some of this too. We've been asking for quite some time that it would be really nice to have a no panhandling ordinance. I believe that will be very helpful in people seeking services where they need to be seeking their services. I believe that we need to have a shopping cart ordinance. I believe that that will help us keep the volatility of the pandemic. We need to have a lot of trash out of our creeks, waterways, parks, etc. So I think those two things need to be a primary focus of the IA group. I was looking forward to a presentation and hearing what was coming up with. Personal ideologies have no business here. I'm a little concerned that a certain council member kind of consistently lands on doing a whole lot of homework, it would seem, in areas of what our police department is doing and the tools they need to do their job. Guess what? I don't feel protected. I think a lot of people don't feel protected. So I'm pretty damn certain that I'm supportive of having quick and necessary equipment with these officers when they need it. So as it relates to this, please stop being so concerned about certain topics like homelessness, social workers, acting as police, etc. And focus on the majority of citizens and their concerns as well as the homeless. Thank you. Julie Threatt followed by Ruth Sarnoff. It's getting crazy. I want to make sure everybody knows I'm pro-police. My late husband was a police officer and my whole family is full of veterans. I think for me, and I'm going to have to talk to that officer because there's so much behind that policy, right? It's absolutely we want to be completely safe. I err on the side of the police force. I think they need more resources on the community side of things, you know, putting aside the military stuff. They need more training. I think there's a short eight, Chief Manning said like eight officers. We need to give them more training. We need them more resources to have better hiring rates or bonuses or something to get people in this town that could be officers. So I'm just trying to put my head out of that military stuff. And if you look at that list, there's like 20 different types of, you know, devices that I think just require a lot more training and a lot of opportunity for misuse. And I'm more concerned about the community members getting caught up in that and not so much. I know they're going to be protected for sure. You guys do a wonderful job protecting us. It's just that we, it's the, it's kind of the extra stuff. But when you have all of that, you know, you're going to be protected. And I think that's why I think we should be doing all of these very different items on that list. It's like 20 pages long that have to be cared for, trained for. I don't think we can get our guys to train on regular stuff. Truly I'm sorry. During this we're only supposed to talk about things not on the agenda. Sorry. Sorry. Oh, my God. It's business from the floor. Sorry. I got off topic. I did want to thank you guys for your press conference last week when you did the AB20. I thought that was fabulous. We had the guys from the county here again. That partnership was fantastic. when I saw all of you together. And it was interesting then when we saw the one yesterday where we had the county people there, but there was nobody from our council there. So I think there was two opportunities for us to mix folks up. So maybe like an Alex Brown could have been at the AB20 about mental health, and then one of you guys could have been over at the Enloe Center talking about the other public health issues. So that would be just another opportunity for the future. But fantastic job on both those press conferences. So thank you. Thank you. Ruth Sarnoff, followed by Sasha Onyek. Thank you. I don't put this in the public record, but I want to bring to your attention an article that was an AP article. It was published. It was published in the Enterprise Record. I have, it was published, I think, first on February 23rd, and it was, What Lies Beneath, colon, Vets Worry Polluted Base Made Them Ill. It's actually a most interesting article, because nobody has suffered more from the use of those weapons than the members of the military. So having all those weapons and playing war games here is just magnifying the problem. We got a lot of vets here in California. So I... Ms. Sarnoff, at this time you can speak on anything, but not items listed on the agenda. That was not ever listed on the agenda. Okay, well, we thought you were referring... It's not listed on the agenda about veterans and this article. Okay, go ahead. I have not seen it yet vetted, so you're running my time out, but that's okay. I've had it happen before. The last time I had my time run out was when I was trying to expose the fact that everything that you build, you build on top of hazardous waste dumps. Three stories down, we got Swiss cheese under, what exists here. And it's that way all over the country, and it's frankly that way all over the world because there are towns, and then there's townships, and there's townships in South Africa for diamond mines, and we buy it up here in the United States. That's the thing. If he loves me, it'll be a diamond, right? What a trick. So I'm just saying things are related. This is an important article, every veteran should read it because it shows how people moving around through bases, and we have bases all over the world, lots of them, and we have a piece there where they go on to that territory. And so you have this whole arrangement where through the drills and everything else that's going on, vets that were hit hard, Agent Orange, Napalm, all those things were produced right here in America. They weren't produced somewhere else. We've been the biggest weapons producer for years. Thank you. Sasha, Anya, followed by Jeff Creed, and that microphone isn't on, but handheld. I'll grab it. Thank you. Do we need this? No. All right. I'm reading from the newspaper, said that human health services was here at Enloe, had a round table with pediatricians, and talked about how important it is for children getting vaccinated against COVID-19. And it's always a treat, I quote, when you get to hear from those who actually provide the care, save lives, and do it every day. What's really behind a lot of this is not really talked about. One of the things that people don't seem to know is that children are 100 times more likely to be injured by their vaccines than by COVID and have a serious injury. And they're being pushed in this town. There's propaganda all day long. And I believe there's a real omission and lack of information to parents who need to know that their children are far more at risk of the vaccine than actually a serious adverse reaction to COVID. And that's not talked about. And if you talk to people about that, they're like, oh, that can't be. But it is. It is. It's true. It's a fact. Far more likely because children are not at risk. So I find it really disheartening in this town of how children are being, in a way, they're really being exploited and abused when that's a fact. And it's weird. It's made to look like you're doing the right thing. And the parents are being manipulated to think they're doing the right thing by having their kids injected with an experimental drug with no real long-term safety data. And here they don't really have a real risk of COVID, but they're being given a drug and being promoted as the right thing to do, the safe thing to do, the conscientious thing, protect your kids. And they're actually more likely to be injured by the vaccine than COVID. I find it really difficult. To square that with what I hear all day long. And every time I go into a medical facility in Chico, whether it's Ampla or if I go to Kenlow, everywhere I go, it's just nonstop ad nauseum. And it's a really must be very difficult when you look at that data and say, well, why are they promoting this? If they're more likely to be injured by the vaccine than by a virus that they're supposed to be getting the vaccine for. I urge people to take a closer look and go to children's health. On intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra intra that keeps the CDC in check or pharma in check.

A lot of good news, a lot of bad news, a lot of sad news. The state of the city is kind of where I wanted to narrow in, and I was here last month or last meeting, and there's been a lot of gripe and pushback from the council and people at the city about we're not being talked to nice, and I talked about how as a person we tell other people and groups of people how to treat us, and most people follow our directions. So when you act a certain way, people respond to that, and they treat you that way. And so... I listen to that State of the Union, and it's like I feel so sad. Did you listen to me? Did you hear what I said? So you get on the State of the Union, and you're... If you don't give us this tax, we're going to have horrible roads. But not once did you say, hey, we talked about our roads 2016, and we decided not to do anything. We decided to just let it crash. And now, you know, we're in a predicament, and we could use your support and get that tax money to fix the roads because previous councils didn't do anything about it. They had the information, they had the knowledge, and they just decided not to act. That would have been a better way than saying, hey, we need that tax money, otherwise our roads are going to be hell, and you'll be on dirt roads in five years, which is pretty much where you're at, right? The other thing that was funny is when we come here as citizens, we're coming here of our own time. Now, there are the crazies. There are the leaders, and there are the noisemakers like me. I come here as a noisemaker kind of going, hey, try and look at that, right? And that's our time. We're gifting you that time, that experience, that knowledge, that effort. And to be told that the disruptive or the negative people like myself who have been critical aren't willing to roll up the sleeves and get the work done, it's like, wait a second. What brought me here? What brought me to council the first meeting six years ago? I was out there with my sleeves rolled up. I was picking up dirt or trash on my own. I came to council, and I asked for help. I asked for you to adopt a best practice, and I asked for years, and nobody up there wanted to roll up their sleeves and help the citizens. How many people did Chico First bring here and ask for help? Chico First was out there in the bushes. He was out there in the creeks, in the waterways. So was CCW and all these other groups. And it was the council and the staff that did not want to step up and help their community. Where's a shopping cart ordinance? Simple thing. Ten minutes for the lawyer to do. We still don't have it. How many years later? We still don't have it. Why? It's disgusting. All right, last speaker, yes? Last speaker. Yeah, actually, probably not a bad idea. Why don't we take a ten-minute break? Thank you. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right, we'll reconvene, move on to item 4.1, redistricting of city council districts in the city of Chico, public hearing number three, first reading and introduction to ordinance adjusting boundaries. Mr. Ewing. Thank you, Mayor Coolidge. The council has held two of four meetings. This will be the third meeting and hearing, and at this time, I will turn this matter over to the demographer. Good evening. I'm going to have a short presentation. No problem. Let's see. Not seeing the new one up here. The other one might have gotten deleted. Mayor Coolidge and council, can I run over to the office and redo the presentation for this and bring it back? If you'd like to take another break. Or if you'd like to go to the island annexation, I can run over and do that real quick. Why don't we move on? We will. We will return to item 4.1 while you do that. Or we'll move on to item 5.1, rather, while you do that, and then return to item 4.1. Okay. Perfect. Thank you. Mr. Ewing. So, item 5.1, island annexation agreement between city of Chico and Butte County. Left, go. Butte, left, go. Why are you down here? Here. All right. Thank you. Good evening. I was ready for this. So, good timing. So, good evening, mayor, vice mayor, and council. Over the past 20 years, in an effort to consolidate the city's boundaries and to encourage the efficient delivery of services, the city and Butte Local Agency Formation Commission, otherwise known as Butte, left, go, have made substantial progress towards the common goal of annexing the remaining county island areas within the city's sphere of influence. An island is a substantially city-surrounded, urban, and urban area. It is a city-surrounded, unincorporated county jurisdictional pocket that is largely built out with residences and supporting infrastructure. The islands are functionally a part of the city's political, economic, and social fabric, and are logical to be under city jurisdiction. In 2015, in support of this ongoing effort, the city and left, go entered into an agreement that resulted in the 2018 annexation of the North Chico area, as well as the Chapman and Mulberry annexations. The 2015 agreement further directed that the city and left, go, have a joint! would finalize an annexation plan for the orderly annexation of the remaining county islands. Progress on that plan was reasonably delayed initially by the Camp Fire and then most recently due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Over the past year, city and left, go staff have had purposeful discussions addressing the timing of the annexations for the remaining islands, and that has been memorialized in a draft island annexation agreement before you tonight. Quickly. The fiscal impacts of the annexation agreement. Onuli Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press It is important to note, however, that having this agreement in place will benefit the development-driven as well as economic development annexations. City benefiting annexations, such as the 2017 North Esplanade annexation that concluded the future site of Courtesy Motors, as well as special planning area annexations like Valley's Edge Pacific Plan, which is due before Council later this year, will proceed more expeditiously with this agreement in place. So per the agreement, the City will submit an annexation application that will be for all four of the areas later this summer. To allow reasonable time for the City to prepare for the provision of services, LAFCO will stagger the state recordation of the annexations over the next four years. Here you can see a figure showing the location as well as the timing for annexation of the remaining islands. With the agreement in place, the ability for the City to provide sewer service to residents, and the ability for the City to provide sewer service to residents, will be greatly enhanced, which is highly desirable in support of the County and City Nitrate Action Plan. Funding for the LAFCO annexation by application, preparation of legal descriptions and plats, and state filing fees is estimated at approximately $35,000 to $40,000, and will be included in the Community Development Department's upcoming budget request. Ultimately, staff is recommending that the City Council provide authority to the City Manager to enter into the island annexation agreement between the City and Butte LAFCO. I'm available for any questions as well as Shannon Costa is here from Butte LAFCO. She's also available to answer any questions you might have. Alright, any questions for Mr. V? I have a quick question. On here it says, parcels. Do you have any idea how many of those parcels are actively, have houses and residents on them, versus how many are just parcels that could be developed at a later date? Sorry, thank you. That's fine. In these areas, you're mostly going to find buildings, but you're also going to find built out areas, areas that were built out in the county. There are some areas, for instance, in the El Monte Avenue, the Chico Canyon Road area, where you have these very large parcels that were built out a long time ago, where there probably is a potential for redevelopment or some form of development, you know, a single ranch on five acres or something like that. There is some zoning in place in the El Monte Avenue area, where it was already contemplated this place would come in, this area would come into the city, and the zoning isn't our classic R1. It's a very low density residential. It's contemplating kind of keeping somewhat of the feel and integrity out there, but I could certainly see some opportunities for some lot splits and things along those lines. Great, thank you. All right, any other questions? All right, public speakers? None? Wow. Okay. Entertain the motion. Move to approve. Motion from Council Member Brown. I'll second that. Second from Council Member O'Brien. Madam Clerk, take the roll. Okay, Council Member Bennett. Yes. Council Member Brown. Aye. Council Member Morgan. Yes. Council Member O'Brien. Yes. Council Member Tandon. Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds. Aye. And Mayor Coolidge. Aye. Carries 7-0. All right, so with that, we'll return to item 4.1. Yes, we're ready. Redistricting City Council districts. Pressureよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしく All right, so we have a short presentation as well as transition over to a ArcGIS interactive tool that I developed that's on the website where I can make a relative request, allow you to zoom in.

Thank you, Nicole. Bryce Goldstein. Good evening, City Council. Good to be here again. My name is Bryce, and I've talked to you before. So I'm kind of liking the new Demographer's Maps 4 and 5. I am pleased to see that they generally keep communities of interest together. They're getting a little bit more compact. I'm seeing that our demographer is learning a lot about our community, and that's great. So you'll probably remember that I submitted three maps, so I might talk about those a little if I have time. First, I wanted to give a little background on my process and my involvement in this effort. Some of you were on the council two years ago when we drew our first districts, and I was pretty vocal about the way that we should be drawing our districts to make sure that people have an equal voice, that we draw boundaries along logical places so that people know what district they're in, and so that they can organize for common causes with their neighbors. And, of course, I think we're all on the same page. Good to see it. And I want to make sure that that's what happens this time. But it seems like I don't really have to tell you all because it seems as though we're on the same page, which, again, is awesome. So I bet you're glad that I am not here to complain this time, this round. So the demographer's maps, 4 and 5, have been posted on the city's website. And as I said, they're looking a bit more compact, taking into account community interest. But I had one comment. Map 5, I actually think, is keeping our communities of interest a little bit more together and keeping our districts a bit more compact than map 4. But there's one line that I would prefer to see shifted. It's in what's kind of a gray area between the West Avenues and the student housing area. There's a boundary line on West 1st Avenue and Nord. And to me, that's a neighborhood right there. It was... A neighborhood that I called Rancheria Drive because it includes apartments on Rancheria Drive and West 1st. So anyway, if I were you, I would move that line south to West Sacramento if you moved forward with that map. And the population could be balanced out by island annexation. So convenient that we have that item tonight to discuss, too. Or already did. Let's see. So I also saw some similarities between the new demographer maps and the maps that I had submitted. I think that we're kind of coming towards each other, towards a consensus on what's important in these maps. And as you saw, I submitted my communities of interest. I kind of submitted a ton of them. I had to take up two maps to draw them all. Thanks for extending the time limit. It's great to just talk about maps forever with you guys. But I'll wrap it up here in a little bit. So I did submit a bunch of communities. I did submit a bunch of communities of interest, including south of campus. But I didn't call it Soku. Oh, I thought you said there wasn't a time limit. Dang. Well, anyway, I support the new demographer maps and my own maps. I hope you'll consider them. And have a great night. Sorry, I was looking at maps. All right. So that is all that we have. I was following along too well. So that's all the speakers. So we'll close the public hearing. And then. So council questions. First one to make or address a couple of things. One, as far as other communities of interest, I did receive them late last night or earlier this afternoon. So did not have a chance to put them into the presentation. They will be included in the next presentation, though. All right. All right. And. Do you want me to briefly go over the new ones or did you want to just begin with questions? I think it would be valuable to have you go over the new ones. I think it would be also valuable to maybe run through this tool with each map overlaid over the communities of interest just to get a visual sense of that. I have it open over here, too. Sure. So what do we have here? Is this through our GIS connected to Esri, which is what the GIS that I use to draw the districts. So. Here what we have here, this is demographer map one. These are the other outlines is the community of interest boundaries, although the 32 corridor will be changed to be moved westward in the next iteration. So as you can see, some are within completely within one district. Some are not. Now, if you want to turn it off and not see the communities of interest, you click hide layer. Goes away and you just want to see the district boundaries. Zoom in. You can see where each street on the detailed street level. Basically what Vice Mayor Reynolds was looking for. So be able to get a good idea. And it really does help in getting that a good idea where some of these boundaries are. And the map you currently have open is the right sized map, right? Yeah. It is right size. Yeah. I set it up to start just at one. So click off that. Click on two. This is the one that got some critique from the barber neighborhood. As you can see why it does cut in. So it gives you that idea of which neighborhoods are. Divided. Cana is divided among three. Three St. Demography map three. As you can see, Cana once again had the southwest corner near Chico State is in a separate district. Although barber is whole as well as Chapman town. Okay. So. And then we'll go on to the new ones. This is the Marva map for. So part of the idea is taking these community of interest boundaries and trying to fit them all into one district as much as possible. Obviously sometimes one has to be put in due to population balancing issues. But the Marva map for it was to really try and nest them all. As you try to get them all in one district. You can see Cana here is in one district. The student area is in one district. And parts of that Nord quarter right here. Barber is also in one district. The only one that really is split on this one is. The lower bidwell park. A portion of district three comes in. At the. Northeast. Section of the community of interest. Margo format five. So the biggest change here was to try and. So. For. Four was meant towards keeping one and two kind of along that 99 as a boundary. This one is more to keep it. Along Lassen Avenue. Based on. Certain testimony that was. Given an email to us from local residents. Cana is still in one. The two that are divided the Northern end of the student area, which I believe. One of the members of the public spoke about moving that boundary potentially. And the once again, the Northeast corner of lower bidwell park. We'll go on to. Goldstein 1000. It's again, it's another one where Cana is whole. Student area here. A small portion of it is split. At the very Western edge. So I was a block. Up here by. Cana. And then. The. Goldstein 2000. Cana split between East and West. So all student area here is split into three districts. And lower bidwell park. The Creek is serves as a boundary through much of that. Area. Okay. Press and holdよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしく The fair for all map, many of the communities of interest are split. Student area has a split through the middle. Kena, same thing. It goes through in various portions. Actually, it's part of three districts with the northern part being in District 1. The Chico Help People Vote Map. Many of these communities of interest are split, including Kena is split among three different areas. Student area is split into somewhat into two, similar to Demographer Map 5. And a portion of Lower Bidwell Park is split. Chico Mindful Map. It has Kena split into portions of three districts. Student area, once again, kind of split between north and south. But the rest are in one district. Part of Chico, Kena is split among four different districts in this one. Student area roughly is whole except for one block here at the southern end. And Barber should be noted. Literally, Demographer Map 2 is the only one that does split Barber. So it's whole in virtually all of them. And with that, I'll take any questions. So does anybody have any questions? Go ahead. No. So we just got an update from Mr. V that has 668 lots that will all be incorporated by 2026, which is well within the next 10 years. So it's about, if you have 2.5 voters per household, I think is usually what's approximately considered when building a house. I don't know what it is when you consider voting. Sometimes. There's 1,600 residents. Has that been taken into consideration in the annexing of those? We took it into consideration as much as possible. So you were aware of all those different elements? Yeah. Same thing. A conversation with some from the planning department let me know where some of the future development and addition, county additions were coming in. And also I went and did an idea of what the current population was there currently. Gotcha. And Stonegate was taken into consideration? Yes. Okay. And you said there was some very vocal feedback. Are you the only one that's getting that feedback? Or is that I don't I would look through my my piles of copies here, but I don't see any of that as to where the boundaries are. And it sounds like maybe we're missing a couple. So obviously the 32 corridor will be moved based on Mayor Coolidge's information. Okay. And some of the Cana boundary, as I mentioned, was given some info from the city planning department on certain neighborhood boundaries. Okay. That was able to determine some of the boundaries of these various neighborhoods and communities of interest. Yeah, it's super subjective. I realize somebody that lives in that neighborhood probably thinks it's one thing and somebody who's from out of the area could see it as something different. So I appreciate you. I appreciate you doing the homework and trying to figure it out the best that you can, given that Chico's not your hometown. And then my last question was, so I happen to represent District 6 right now, although I'm at large, but that's technically my district. And that east side of the community has a lot of the and this was not a something that we identified necessarily before, but something that I'd like to throw out for the council is consideration. That whole side over there with the park and everything. I'll say there's a lot. I might ignore the reason. Is it the west side? East. Yeah. East. I was right. It was my first time. Never eat soggy waffles, right? Do we, they're all prone to fire. Like that's a common interest. We had Stillson Canyon almost go with the campfire. We had the upper park fire. So there's a lot of like interest there. And I'd like to consider that that possibly be something we consider putting together. And maybe receiving some feedback. Maybe some different input on new maps even with that as a possible consideration. So just a bit of clarification on any new maps. Right now, this late into the game, you can introduce a new map or we can have a new map or you can actually have one done up yourself. But we probably have to have a special meeting if it wanted to be considered. Okay. And. That's a good point. It has to be posted a week before that special meeting for the public to review. Perfect. So if we wanted to, I'm not saying that we're going to, but if we wanted to, we could accept more input, more communities of interest, more maps and post them and do a special meeting if we absolutely needed to, if we didn't get to where we need to be tonight. Correct. Okay, great. Thank you. Mr. Mayor, can I follow up on that? Yeah, go ahead. So echoing a little bit of the vice mayor's comments. The help people vote map six has. It kind of goes around what I would consider that a fire district, the heart of Chico map seven does that. Demographer one or is that seven? No, demographer one has it that way. Public submission map one, which is Chico Council mindful, does it demographer four and five doesn't it separates the fire zones. I don't know that you call that a community of interest, but those people have probably had more than a hundred. I think it's a little bit more consternation than anybody else lately. So it's, it'd be interesting to, and some of your maps do it. So I just don't know how much you can continue to continue to play with that. And then the flip side of that is I understand the argument, you know, one of your, one of the, not one of your maps, but one of the map shows can has got it's represented by four people. Is that better or worse? I don't, so I don't have an answer to that. Right. I mean, I wish there was another representative in district one, so I didn't get all the heat all the time. They're trying to build. Okay. I don't know where that. So I understand the communities of interest. Let's get them together to the extent possible. But at the same time, every now and then there's going to be some crossover, but I don't necessarily think that's a terrible thing. And that's a debate that redistricting does. I've been having is more better or is having one better. And that's been a constant argument in redistricting politics for decades now. So I mean, to summarize, I follow up. what Vice Mayor Reynolds said. I do think that is an important district. There's quite a few of the maps that bring it together. So if you're gonna create some more based on feedback tonight, I'd like to see that incorporated again. I actually got a one. Yes. So we can go. Go ahead. It's like one public submission map. Your map's one, your map one. Yes, and public, that's Chico mindful map. Yes, you can see the over. Chico, does it and . Yes. And I don't even know if that's something anybody else is interested in. I know . All right. Do we have more questions? Thank you. So just a quick comment to those questions. So what we could do is like, say, do a, I'll give an example, 4B for the next meeting, you know, for the next meeting. And it could be considered since it'll be up. So you can choose three tonight to move forward. And then one more at your request. And which what we can do is have it, it'll be posted in time for the meeting. You can make that decision that night. So it's up for that week for review. And you can maybe play with say four or five or Goldstein 1000 to see, like, just for example, you can pick one and say, work on this one to see if we can do it. A lot of this area is pretty sparsely populated. So there might be a way to make it work. So. All right. Do we have any other council, member Carter? Questions? If not, I have some. So I'm a little bit, well, first off the question is, so one person's community interest may not be another's. And I'm sure you've faced those questions before. So, you know, someone might define Canada as a particular areas, one else might define it as a different area, bigger, wider, longer, whatever it might be. Right. So, I mean, can there be multiple? I mean, cause on the before, I think you showed, and I think it was Ms. Goldstein's division of Cana to East and West and some of her communities of interest. Yes. So if you'd like, I can bring that up as well. No, it's fine. I think we all remember it. So maybe we could incorporate those two in there just so we could get, you know, hey, here's the, you know, the core of Cana. Sure. And East versus West. I think that would be helpful. And then, yeah, like I mentioned on the Highway 32 Nord or Walnut and then not necessarily 8th and 9th, although I'm sure someone can make a play for 8th and 9th all the way down to the freeway also as a community of interest as well. So let me ask you this. You've done this quite a bit before, yes? Yes. So typically how many maps do you see in a city of 110,000 people? Honestly, it fluctuates based on activity. So I'd say about your site, I mean, there is one process where they had four. Wow. Three by the demographer and one public submission. And then you have say, actually another one I'm taking part, Montebello where it's 62,000 people. So it's 62,000 people, yet we had 19 public submissions. Okay. So. You know, our supervisors had, I don't know, something like 2000 comments or something on their maps. You know, and I'm not saying that, you know, we want that because it could mean that we're headed in a bad direction. But I don't know. I'm just not seeing at least the level of public comment that I'd like to see. You know, I'd really like the public to be a little more engaged in this process. I mean, we've had obviously some controversial redistricting decisions in our county recently. So, you know, my anticipation was that this process was gonna be much more involved by the community. So what I was last time too, so. Right, and what I've seen too is when jurisdiction does kind of a good job of getting the word out, people are not as active almost. It's like, well, they must be doing something right by being so loud. Okay. So we've seen that. We trust them. While when it seems like they're trying to be secretive, that's when it's like, oh, they're up to something. Let's go. Gotcha. Okay. All right. I am not against holding another special meeting. If we, you know, think at this point, you know, I'll leave it up to the council, obviously, but at this point, if we have to, to just get more submissions and invite the public to have. Mayor Coolidge, can I ask a question? Yeah. Do you have a problem with the maps that are on this list here? No, not necessarily. There's, I think I have a question. I have four or five I like. Sure. So subjectively, you're saying that because we didn't get more than seven public submissions, we should reopen the process and have more people submit maps? No, that's not what I'm saying. What I'm saying is I'd just like to see more public comment on them. So. I mean, you can't force the public to engage. I, of course, would want the same. I'd want people to show up and participate in the process as it's laid out. I think creating another meeting where additional maps can be submitted just runs kind of counterintuitive to the process given that we don't have maps here that are poorly done. There's quite a few that are, I think, absolutely appropriate to move forward with or to prioritize. Yeah, I would certainly say that, you know, of course, we're all entitled to our opinion. But I mean, in terms of how many comments were received just within our county on other maps, you know, I don't think extending the process is necessarily a bad thing. Well, and I'd like to follow up with that just to make a comment of, you know, for instance, I really appreciate how much work we're doing. I think that's a lot of work Ms. Goldstein has put into this. But on almost I think all of her maps, if I'm not mistaken, then that fire area would be divided. And given that information, I'd love for her to have the opportunity to resubmit something showing how she thinks that might work. I know the demographer has done that. But I mean, Bryce has been here with us for this for three years now. So I would like to have Ms. Goldstein, sorry, her opinion on it as well. So I don't, if we're going to take more input, be it the Communities of Inland. interest. I don't see the difference in taking a few map submissions that we could look at as well. The demographer just stated that he'd be willing to adjust a map that doesn't include that firebreak to include your suggestions and I think that that's a super appropriate recommendation to make. I'm just feeling confused as to why seven maps wouldn't be enough and if there's not specific concerns with some of the maps that have been submitted given that we've got some really good things to work with here. I don't necessarily have specific concerns with these maps. I know we have a town of 100,000 people where we can fight over the color yellow for six months and we are here talking about redistricting and we have two speakers on the week of spring break. So I think maybe opening things up when it's not spring break and people are traveling with their kids might be worth having another public hearing because we were accused last meeting of not having enough public hearings and doing like we did last time, even the last time we only actually had one off-site public hearing, but just giving people a chance to have input. Just so you know, that was an actual thing. It did take five months to decide which color yellow. Children's music. I was here for that. Alright, will the council? A question? So you're asking, requesting that we give you some number of maps to kind of move forward with. You may bring back two new submittals we haven't seen. Would that be a special meeting before the first meeting in April? So are you looking for direction? Narrow it down to like three maps today and then we'll bring the new ones in. We'll see if we like any of that. Yeah, so pick three and then one that, you know, among those three, one that you would probably like. I'd like me to adjust to try and fit in that fire corridor. Just to get the ball rolling, I will throw out, I mean I will suggest, not throw out, I will suggest one, six, and seven. Two of those are from the public and one is from the demographer. Can you read the names of the ones from the public that are included in the process? Heart of Chico, Help People Vote, and Demographer, Number One. You don't have very creative names for your map, sir. You do everything else really well. Would you be willing to put up the Heart of Chico map, please? Sure. Okay, there you go. Thank you. Would you be willing to put up the Chico Mindful map, please? Sure. I think that these were easily ones, less so the Mindful map than the Heart of Chico map that were, in my opinion, completely unacceptable given the amount of division in the neighborhoods that took place, particularly in the Canaan neighborhood, some of the student neighborhoods. And so, I said this before, that yellow that's bleeding into the purple up there, I can't recall where that is, yeah, and 8th Street just feels like a weird jet into a place that doesn't really make a whole lot of sense to me. When I was reviewing these maps, I'll say it before, I'll say it again, clean lines, compact, where it would be relatively effortless for the people who are residents of that district to identify which district that they live in, and I would say both of those last two maps don't do a good enough job of it. But if I were to recommend any, or recommend, I would be demographer map 4, 5, including that fire break if that's of interest to council, and I think Goldstein 1000 is probably one of the cleanest maps on there, as far as it relates to compact neighborhood consideration, following the right lines, and people would know which district that they live in. So, seems to me a little bit of disagreement there. All right. Further comment, or we have a motion? Yes? That was a motion. Well, I'll just try and start the discussion. Okay. I mean, I'd be the halfway, except I have to, I don't know. Which map is that, Michelle? This is Chico Mindful map, so public submission 1, just wanted to, wanted to use. Oh, I talked about it. Yes. Vice Mayor? You mentioned a demographer, 5 or 6, I'm sorry, but I was looking at last week's. 4 or 5? 4 and 5, yes. Thank you. And if you want to put up 4 and then 5, that might be helpful. Sure. So again, compact keeps almost all the neighborhoods, keeps all the neighborhoods together. 5, if you don't mind. Compact follows the right lines, keeps almost all the neighborhoods together. And then if you could go to Goldstein 1, compact keeps all the neighborhoods together, clean lines. Well, except for the fire zone, it separates it every time. I totally understand, and I am perfectly willing to ask for a map that adjusts for that, if that's something that's of interest to Council. So just to let you know, this block here that comes all the way up and almost to this boundary has 10 people. Right. So that could easily be adapted into the yellow line. The yellow district in this map, is that right? Easily, yes. That block. Yeah. Okay, so a question for you here. Can you bring up Goldstein 2000? 2000, sure. There you go. So in my opinion, it separates out the student areas pretty heavily. And then Goldstein 3000. And that's, well, that one does not, kind of cuts the avenue. So. Pretty heavily. And then 1000. Yeah, that one does. And then what about your five? I think five's not opposed to five. I would be perfectly willing to. Support moving forward with five and including that the fire area, fire prone area in the yellow district on this one. Why is it five? Did you say five this morning? Demographer map five specifically. So which ones, could you repeat that please? What I just said? Yes. I said that I would be perfectly open to moving forward with demographer map five. I think it's one of the, I think it is the best demographer drawn map. And including the fire prone area in the yellow district to keep those community, that community together. And it sounds like that would be pretty easy to do given the population. And the other two? The other two that I thought were common. On ourよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしく!よろしくよろしく Yeah, you can kind of recommend three, but yeah, five, you can do five. I'll make that motion right. Plus the new two that I haven't even seen. Okay, so your motion, state your motion, so I don't have to. So Goldstein one, Demographer four and five, and Public Maps six and seven. Second. Forward with an additional meeting or without? With an additional meeting. So Heart of Chico and Chico Help People vote then. Could you read? The last two were Help Vote and Heart of Chico? Yes. Thank you. I'm sorry, Vice Mayor Reynolds, could you restate the maps? And the numbers? Sorry, I just want to make sure I'm getting the right. Yes, hopefully. So it would be Goldstein one. One thousand. One thousand, sorry. One thousand. Demographer maps four and five. Okay. And then the Public Submission maps six and seven. Which is? Help the People vote and Heart of Chico. Okay. And then we have a good mix of them. We have a good mix of Public moving forward and Demographer and we can continue to take input, continue to take adjustments. And so with the special meeting or not? I think we need to hear from our public. I had two speakers on districting. I'm not against that. Like, I mean, I'm just, yeah, I would like to take submission by email and maybe we can get a copy of all that. Make sure we have all of the communities of interest. I know that you said you're going to make a couple of adjustments to this and maybe there's, you know, a couple of things that you want to make sure that we're able to make. I don't know. Are we allowed to go on and adjust the communities of interest? No, no, this isn't. Yeah, it's not adjustable. It's more for viewing. Okay. So what we could submit is additional. Yes. And then we can add it as a layer. So say I might add the Goldstein one so you can turn this off and see Goldstein's over, you know, overlay. Yeah. Okay. And so Sean, that making you making that motion or Casey? I helped Casey make it. And then actually she helped herself make it and then I seconded it. Okay. So we've got a motion and a second and I assume we'll figure out the scheduling of that additional meeting. Right. We'll have to back into in order to meet the five days, you know, all of the requirements. So we can talk about that. Yes. Seven days actually. Seven days. Okay. And I would encourage the public for whoever's watching because apparently Tuesday night TV is like the best watched thing in Chico sometimes. But for those of you who are on vacation and you watch this later, like we're all going to be opening this back up, please send, I want to hear, the whole goal of doing this is communities of interest and keeping communities of interest together and making sure that we have the right demographics within those. So I think it's really important for our community to give us feedback. So give us as much feedback as you can, send it in and let's get it on the website and have that for us to make our decision because I don't feel like we've had enough different people give us their opinions on where we're going. Yeah. And you make a very valid point about spring break. Yeah. And I think that's a great point too. So, all right. Further comment? Madam Clerk? Okay. Council Member Bennett? Yes. Council Member Brown? Aye. Council Member Morgan? Yes. Council Member O'Brien? Yes. Council Member Tandon? Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds? Absolutely. Mayor Coolidge? Aye. Carries 7-0. All right. Okay. Item 5.1 we addressed already. So we'll move on to Item 5.2.! Deputy City Manager Jennifer McCarthy. Good evening. Let me pull this up real quick. Good evening, Mayor Coolidge, Vice Mayor Reynolds, members of the Council. I'm Jennifer McCarthy, Deputy City Manager. And today I get to talk to you a little bit about the guidelines and proposed implementation plan for a small business assistance program. This program would be funded through a million dollars that the Council set aside on June 8th of last year for assistance to businesses that were impacted by COVID. This funding is through the American Rescue Plan, which are one-time dollars that are coming into our local communities to help offset the impacts of COVID. Specifically, one of the eligible uses of these funds is assistance to businesses impacted by the pandemic. There's been quite a few different plans. One is the Rehabilitation Program, and many others that have been there to try and really help bolster programs and projects for businesses to stay afloat during these difficult times. So when staff started to think about what is it that would make a good program for the City of Chico moving forward, it was important that we thought through what is the gap out there and the need that still exists with local businesses. And how can we leverage these one-time dollars, and most importantly, how can we streamline this process for our local businesses? Staff is recommending that the million dollars be set aside to be part of and to supplement the Butte County Business Stabilization Program. This is a program that is being funded through the County of Butte with their American Rescue Plans. They've allocated $1.5 million towards this program. This is a program that is being funded through the County of Butte with their American Rescue Plans andよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしく!よろしく!よろしく that you had to change your hours or that you had to move your business online. Those impacts that we're seeing from our business community are wide and they're varied. This program really looks at not just how can we meet that need, but how can we help the business stay in business moving forward? So what are those obstacles for a business to remain in operation? So this program would cover the cost of operational expenses that are there to help meet that barrier to remaining open. So that may include things like helping with the cost of rent or utilities or some of the fixed costs associated with operation, the creation of new jobs, as well as the retention of existing jobs, which those of you that have businesses know have been very difficult during these times. And then in addition, it can help with the cost of COVID prevention measures. So businesses have had to do things like set up new barriers, change their business models, or do enhanced cleanings. From an eligibility perspective, businesses would be eligible to participate if they had a demonstrated impact from COVID-19. These businesses would be for-profit businesses in good standing, meaning that they don't have any outstanding debts, taxes, liens, or leaner judgments against them. They need to be existing businesses. These are businesses that have been in business since March 1 of 2020. And the reason is, is these funds specifically have to be used to offset the cost of cleaning. So they need to be used to offset the cost of cleaning. So where I'd love to be able to help out a new business that just started up yesterday, that's not the intent of these funds. The business would have to have an active business license. And the county's program states that these funds would be available for businesses with 20 or fewer employees. Staff is recommending for the City of Chico's fund that instead we look at funding businesses of 100 or fewer employees. Several of the programs that have come down to help businesses have been for-profit businesses. And so we're looking at funding businesses that are very small. And so this is an opportunity to help a larger number of businesses within the Chico community. The Butte Business Stabilization Program is funded with $1.5 million, as I noted earlier. And those funds are allocated by each one of the local jurisdictions by a percentage basis. So the county's funds, 60% of those funds would be going to Chico businesses. So that's over $850,000, which is pretty amazing. If you add to it the million dollars that the City of Chico set aside, there would be over $1.8 million that would be available for local businesses. So it's really important to understand that these funds, what would happen is a business would have a single application that they would apply for. And this, again, makes it very simple for businesses. So they'd have a single application that they would apply for. Those businesses that are 20 or fewer employees would first be looked at through the county's program. And so that's what we're looking at. And so the county's fund would be eligible for the city's funds. Then the remaining businesses that have applied, as long as they're anywhere between 100 or fewer, could be down to one, would be eligible for the city's funds. With that estimate, we're thinking with a $10,000 grant limit, and that is, I apologize, that is the grant limit that's set on these. With a $10,000 grant limit, we'd be looking at up to 180 businesses, potentially. So really the next steps in the program, the first is to enter into subrecipient agreement. With three core. Three core is a local organization that has had quite a bit of experience in funding COVID-19 related programs and projects. For instance, they funded the first round of the business stabilization program. And they were also one of the state partners in the California small business COVID relief grant program. Three core would then finalize the grant application documents and open an application portal. This application process is all done online. It isn't something where we've got a lot of information. We've got a lot of information. We've got a lot of of papers to sift through. There's an actual quarter where they're putting this information in. That being said, we will always work with a business that doesn't have abilities to participate online. So I wanted to make that clear that we're not discriminating against anybody that might not have those technical capabilities. The concept is that a grant application period would open on May 1st, and there'd be a window that would be open for three weeks. So we would do just like we just did for the building enhancement grant program, where we would announce it in advance so that businesses have an opportunity to think through this project, see the guidelines, see if they're interested, and start putting together the information that they'll need for this application. Then come May 1st, application window is open, and it's open for a period of three weeks. Then when the application window closes, businesses are chosen on a lottery basis to participate. I anticipate there will be a lot of excited businesses to participate in this program and a large need in our community. Whether it will be oversubscribed or not, I don't know, but I do imagine that it will be heavily utilized. So again, first run applications for 20 or fewer employees would be accepted and funded through the county's pot, and then those remaining applications still within the City of Chico would be funded through the City of Chico's remaining funds, that million dollars. It's a little complicated. I hope that made sense. So at this point, I'm happy to answer any questions that you might have. I just want to thank the Council for your commitment to our business community. The programs and projects that you've set forward are really helping them to go through this process and work towards recovery. So thank you. All right. Questions from Council? I have a short one. Yes. Approximately, what is the fee that 3Corps is going to be charging for the administration duties? 3Corps has the ability to charge up to 20%. What? They have the ability to. They have the ability to do that. They have the ability to do that. I was just about to say that I thought your presentation was fantastic and I couldn't find any problems with it. That's a problem. Well, we're working. We will work through the subrecipient agreement and to a part that makes sense, whether that's Are there alternatives that you could hang over 3Corps' head and say I'm not saying that that is what they're asking. I'm saying that for the American Rescue Plan, that's what is eligible. Can you tell me what the American Rescue Plan is? All right. How do I face this? And of course, we can always negotiate costs and we always do when we have contracts with vendors. Thanks. You're welcome. I'm willing to go to 5%. Thank you. That's just insane. I mean, it's government, so it makes sense. It's like whatever. It's not our money. Other questions? I have one. Council Member Chan. Are these grant funds, will they be taxable for the businesses? That is a really good question. I do believe that you are issuing a grant. I just issued a 1099 for those funds. Thank you. You're welcome. And is this separate funds than the Building Enhancement? This is, yes. The Building Enhancement Grant Program is something that we just announced today. That is a I hadn't heard that that had come out yet. I knew it was supposed to be around the 1st of March, so I was wondering. Thank you. You're welcome. Is that on the website then? It is on the website. You will see it on the main page of the website if you scroll under updates. There's an announcement there. It's also on the website. It's also on the City Manager's homepage as well. It's on our social media. And we did a press event today on that program. Okay. Great. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. So, any questions? I have a question. Yes. So, why 10,000 instead of 5,000? Why 10,000 instead of 5,000? Why not reach, you know, 170 businesses instead of 85? We could absolutely have the ability to do that. When you think about making an impact on a business, though, you really need to think about the business. A substantial need to a business is probably more in terms of 20,000, right? So, a 10,000 is an ability to spread those funds a longer distance. And once we start getting a little bit lower, the impacts to the businesses become a little bit less. No, I get that. But I also understand, too, that, you know, something's better than nothing. So, if we have, you know, 200 people apply and we can only give it to 85 people, I'd rather give it a little bit less. So, you know, spread, but I'm not sure in terms of past programs, how many businesses applied versus, you probably don't have that at your fingertips. I can tell you absolutely with the Butte Business Stabilization Program last time around, the county of Butte allocated $5 million towards that program. Again, 60% of the funds went to Chico businesses, and there was approximately 190 businesses that were funded. Do you know how many applications? We actually didn't have anybody in the city of Butte. We had a city of Chico that wasn't funded that applied. Okay. And just to clarify, there was 800,000 going to Butte County and plus our million, so it was approximately 180 businesses at $10,000 apiece that should be helped. So, we got 180. It's better than five. Yeah, well, and if they received it in the first round, they still receive it in the second? If they received it in the first round, yes, they can still receive it in the second. If I heard your question right. Yes. Okay. That was my question. All right. All right. Those were my questions. All right. Do we have any speakers on this? We do. We have two. All right. Thank you. Thank you. So, Nicole Nava followed by Jeff Crean. I wish you handed out frequent flyer, Miles. I'd be doing pretty good. The reason I wanted to weigh in on this one, I watched back the press conference today. Well done. My concerns center on kind of like where Mayor Coolidge was landing about some of the, you know, fairness and spreading the love. I was a little concerned that maybe some of the folks that already got the payment protection program monies might get it. And then I worry about those who maybe weren't eligible for the PPP being potentially left out. I wonder if there could be some kind of like point leveling to give people maybe extra points if they didn't receive it. I know if I was a business owner and I was down there scrappy dogging for the money that was handed out before and wasn't privy to it, I would be thinking it would be nice that my city would be thinking of my business. The other thing that I heard you today in the press conference related to this topic was about the parklets. So, certain businesses are benefiting that they have the parklet bump outs, right? And there are other restaurants and such and businesses that don't have things like that. My understanding is some of the businesses are benefiting. On our side, our housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and like so that enough people hear about it, get interested and have, um, maybe at the Chico chamber do something too. I get you did the press thing, but guess what? Everybody was working, including those businesses. So I just hope we go the extra mile this time, because I think there were some businesses that really, um, kind of got to level up this last time. And so, and I will say with that parklet, it might help those that have put in for this. And so then they'd get the double benefits. So just saying, thank you. Thank you, Jeff. I hadn't planned on speaking on this, but a couple of things kind of came to mind. I wanted to speak about one five grand. I mean, that's a weekend in Mexico. That's not going to help any business substantially, but a hundred business, a hundred employees. I think if you have a hundred employees and you're scrapping, you're not going to be able to get a hundred employees. If you're not going to be able to get a hundred employees, you're not going to be able to get a around for 10 grand to make payroll, you know, you probably shouldn't be in business. So I don't see any reason to help such a large business. You know, I could see going to say 30 employees as opposed to 10 or whatever. Um, but I mean, just think about it, you know, a hundred employees, 10 grand, that's not even payroll for a month. Right. So what's the point? Why don't you help the businesses that suffer? And the real thing that kind of chaps my height about all this, is there are businesses in this town who have gone out of their way not to keep their storefronts clean. And I've talked about this one back in July when the city manager said he didn't want more input on this subject from the citizens, but there's, there's businesses in this town who've gone out of their way not to maintain their property, specifically downtown, some around town and to reward them with a bonus to, to pick them up a little bit. And that just seems disingenuous to me. And it kind of, you know, as a taxpayer, it kind of rubs me raw. If, you know, I'm not cutting my lawn for 10 years and now you're going to give me money to remodel my front yard. That kind of seems like a bad practice. So I wish there were some way to, you know, score these requests. Um, the other thing is, is you have a roster of all the businesses in Chico. Why can't you send them a postcard saying, Hey, we want your input on this. You know, what's the cost of that? And to Mr. Four, I was going to call you mayor. Sorry. You know, to his point for 5%, hire somebody to do it yourself. I mean, why are you going to spend that money out of the city? You know, for the cost of, you know, 20%, I mean, you could hire a lot of staff to do it, right? It's only a six month job, but why not do it in-house? Why not hire some temps and do it in-house? That's all I got. So this might be a tiny bit out of order. So if it's not okay, then council, please stop me. But there was a question as to three core and a concern, obviously of the 20%. And I see Audrey sitting in the back row who is a three core partner and has been amazing. And I know you guys have had tons of meetings on this. Can we continue conversation on it and maybe address that question and let Audrey answer that if you want to, if you don't, that's okay. I think we can bring someone up from three core to answer that question for you. Whether she has the answer. I don't know if you have the answer or not, but you've been a wonderful partner in the community. So I'd love for you to maybe explain a little bit as to why the city is partnering with you and not administering it ourselves and how you can help us. I'm glad to try to give you some answers on this and be put on this spot. I actually hear, represent, and I'm glad to be here. I'm glad to be here. I'm glad to be here. I'm glad to be here. On ourよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしく!よろしくよろしく programs and there are certain things that they have to do. I don't know exactly what 3-4 would charge you, you know, but as Jennifer has said, probably up to 20 percent, which is not unusual, you know, for administration of a program. It's usually between 15 and 18 percent is your administration cost just to make sure that they're doing the financial due diligence so that when that money does go out to that company, that is the right company, and they're also supporting getting out to those micro businesses and providing assistance. This is all partnered with the SBDC, so there's coaching going on, there's mentoring going on, there's other services than just getting the money out to the businesses, particularly those under 20. And I think on the 100, I heard that question, the 100 and 100, I heard that question, the 100 and employees, you have a lot of companies that do have 100 employees that kept employees on who still incurred impacts through that time and they weren't eligible to go to other programs, such as these grant programs. If they were to go to a program, they had to borrow the money, and so they're having to pay interest rates, and they still incurred all of that. So I think the program, the way it's been set up by the county and the city is much like most of the other programs I've seen. I've seen other cities give higher grants because of the impact. Several of those I've helped the cities formulate and they monitor. I would think it's a smart decision to use three core issues to doing financial assistance versus having staff do that. I think it's a good deal, even if they charge you 20 percent, you would get your money's worth on that program. All right. Thank you so much. Thank you so much for the clarification. Thank you, Jennifer, for all the work that you've done on this. I know you've had hours and hours and hours of meeting on this, and I really appreciate it. Thank you. Okay. Council Member Tannen, you have the answer. That 20 percent, which fund will that come from? So to be clear, we don't have a subrecipient agreement with three core yet. The dollars in terms of that administrative cost that we're talking about, we're looking back at what we've done previously with them, and that was in terms of a 10 percent instead of a 20 percent. So that's certainly much more reasonable. And I'm sorry, Council Member Tannen, your question? I was just curious, if it's 10 percent, which fund will that 10 percent come from? It all comes out of the same million dollars that's been allocated through the American Rescue Plan. Okay. Thank you. So, follow-up question. Just to make a point, of that million dollars, if three core charges 20 percent, they'll get 200 grand? 10 percent. Well, I said I was willing to go five, but I think they're, but is my math right? If they go to 10 percent. There's a million dollars, and we went with 20 percent, which they're allowed to. They're allowed, right. That's $200,000 that goes to three core. If we went that way. Is three core a non-profit? I'm not putting you on the spot. I'm putting three core on the spot. Okay. I just want to be really clear. I shouldn't have never mentioned what the American Rescue Plan allows in terms of administration. You absolutely should have, because you're supposed to be transparent. You're doing exactly the right thing. I was very transparent. Your presentation was perfect. Thank you very much. So, in the past, it had been a 10 percent fee that was part of the running of this program. Which, when you think about the level of work that goes into this program, the hand-holding for businesses, and I will tell you, for example, the web portal where you get the application materials, it's in three languages. Something that we, personally, here wouldn't have the ability to do. It's in English, it's in Spanish, and it's in Hmong. They will reach out and meet with individual businesses to make sure they have the ability to really submit that application. So, where I said there's an online portal, if you're a business and you can't do it, you actually go there and they'll walk you through this. They'll refer you to other partners, whether it's the SBDC. If there's certain information that you need to put together for your financials or from a business planning perspective. And they'll also engage in conversation because this is actually part of their job, is to refer businesses to other service providers within our region. So, they'll help with more of a needs analysis as well. So, that's another part of it. And again, they are a financial institution. So, they are an organization that is used to working with these types of funds. They're used to implementing grants. They're used to implementing grant programs. Doing the necessary paperwork. Running the necessary background documentation that's necessary. I do want to talk also quickly to the PPP question that was raised. The applicants must attest to the fact that they will not be using these grant funds in the same way that they used any other previous funds received through the American Rescue Plan. So. All right. Further questions? Discussion? All right. Intertainment motion. I'm ready to approve it, but I would ask that staff work to keep that number as low as possible, which I know you would anyway. Second that. All right. We have a motion from Council Member Morgan and a second from Vice Mayor Reynolds. Madam Clerk. Council Member Bennett. Yes. Council Member Brown. Aye. Council Member Morgan. Yes. Council Member O'Brien. Yes. Council Member Tandon. Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds. Aye. Vice Mayor Coolidge. Aye. Carry 7-0. So, Council, before we go, and Mayor Coolidge, can we just go back to the redistricting? I just would like to ask that if that motion, you did talk about the introduction of the ordinance. I would just like to read the title of that into that. Would that be acceptable, city attorney? Yes. Is that okay? Yes. Okay. So, it was to move five maps, bring five maps forward, to have a special meeting. And that ordinance is an ordinance of the City Council of the City of Chico to adjust the current City Council district boundaries in accordance with Chico Municipal Code Section 1.30.250 and California Elections Code Section 21601. And I will make that a note in that motion. Thank you for that. Thank you, Madam Chair. Ms. Debbie, can I also make sure it was in my motion to allow for submission of communities of interest and other maps also? Absolutely. I just didn't pull up the motion. Okay. I just want to make sure that you're letting in more maps. Yes. All right. Okay. So, item 5.3 was removed from the agenda. So, we're not going to be discussing that one. Item 5.4, Council Appointments to the Butte Choice Energy Authority. Clerk, please. Okay. Thank you, Council. As you're aware, the Council in 2019 actually authorized proceeding with the implementation of a community choice aggregation program. And which was approved. Which allows cities and counties to aggregate the electricity buying power of residential, commercial, and municipal customers within a jurisdiction to purchase power and to meet their electricity needs. That authority was established by a resolution and also, I believe, an ordinance to enact it. In that resolution that was adopted, it stated that we needed two board members and two alternates from the City of Chico. This board, this authority is comprised of a myriad of people. From across the county and other agencies. And it will be added to as other people, as other agencies and entities join in. But at this time, well, at the time in 2019, the Council, it was a Council appointment. And it was Council Member Brown and Council Member, former Council Member Huber who were selected as the actual board voting members. And then former Council Member Schwab and Stone were appointed. Okay. And then the Council was identified as the alternates. We should have brought that back and taken care of that when the election switched out those positions. So, at this point, I'm asking the Council to consider appointing one board member and two alternates. And I'm happy to answer any questions. Questions? I will state that the meeting, the meetings are held the first Monday of each month. And I believe they start at 530. And they're held at BCAG. Now, originally in May of 2021, we asked the Mayor, because we thought we needed an alternate, we asked the Mayor to appoint and he appointed Vice Mayor Reynolds to serve as an alternate for this authority. And the Council did confirm that by a majority vote. But at this point, because the meeting's conflict with internal affairs. So, I do want to let everyone know that internal affairs is held on the first Monday of each month and they're held between 4 and 6. So, we're kind of limited with who might have the time to do that. Okay. Okay. So, I'll leave it up to the Council. I will happily remove myself from consideration. And Ms. Brown has been serving on that board, correct? Yes. She has. She's been attending the meetings and representing the City of Chico. And she would be continuing to do that. Okay. You're good. Gratefully. Yes. Okay. Yeah. It's a really cool space, but also a very big learning curve. And so, welcome whoever's interested. But what's happening at the county levels or at the regional level is pretty darn cool. And I hope that interested folks will step up. Okay. Not to single anyone out. But who isn't on the board? I'm on internal affairs. Okay. So, the internal affairs committee is comprised of Vice Mayor Reynolds, who's the chair, Councilmember Tandon, and Councilmember O'Brien. I knew the answer to your question. And Shawn is not on that committee. Shawn is not on that committee either. I was actually going to ask if Councilmember Bennett had any interest. I know that you've expressed some interest in issues related to renewable energy and things like that. And that could be an interesting space to... To learn more. I think we see a volunteer. Thank you. So, for the voting member... I would nominate Councilmember Bennett as the additional voting member. And then the two remaining Councilmembers who are not on internal affairs would be Mayor Coolidge and Councilmember Morgan as alternates. I don't think there's any alternative option. You don't have to show up. I won't. Well... I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You can leave me on as an alternate if we're not having... If we're not having... I can do this. If Casey has to... If Vice Mayor Reynolds has to go to this thing, I'm happy to cover her internal affairs meeting for her. Problem solved. Denied. Okay. So... I will say, just for the record, Mr. Morgan serves on how many committees already? This is in defense of you. No, that's not true. It is true. You have like six. Yeah. You have like six. I don't have them in front of me, but I believe it's more than six. Yeah. I think. I will say, I'm an alternate. I'm pretty sure I probably won't have to go to this. All right. I'll amend the motion to nominate Councilmember Bennett as the additional voting member with Vice Mayor Reynolds and Mayor Coolidge as the alternates. Second. We don't have public comment on this, obviously, right? Because it's just a point not processed. Okay. Well, if we had had speakers turn in cards, yes, but we did not. Okay. All right. Well, then we're good either way. So is that... Oh, we have a motion and a second. We have a motion. And who made the second? I apologize. Morgan. Yes. The most enthusiastic. Oh, that's right. He did. Second. I apologize. Okay. Thank you, Council. Councilmember Bennett? Yes. Councilmember Brown? Aye. Councilmember Morgan? Yes. Councilmember O'Brien? Yes. Councilmember Tandon? Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds? Yes. Mayor Coolidge? And yes to Committee 10 for me. Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Council, for that. All right. Okay. Moving on to items posted...no items posted after the agenda. Six, report and communications. The following reports and communications items are provided for the Council's information. No action can be taken in this meeting. On items under this section, unless the Council agrees to include it on a subsequent agenda, item 6.1, City Manager's Report, City Manager Marc Orr. Yes, Honorable Mayor and Council, good evening. Just a couple of quick highlights I want to ensure everybody's aware of. The ALS item that Chief Standridge brought forward at a recent meeting, our last Zoom, I believe, was our last Zoom, there's continuing conversation and dialogue. I know the City Council asked staff to continue in that effort, and so I just want to assure everybody that those conversations are in order. Those conversations are continuing. They've been very productive, and I want to commend Chief Standridge for his continued due diligence in working with our community partners, in particular, Enloe and also our Butte County friends also we had some good meetings with. So those conversations continue just for the benefit of the Council and the community. Also just want to highlight the fact that the Hope Street Coalition final documents were released. They were posted onto the City's website for those individuals that have been wondering what those final recommendations are. Go to the City's website, you can download those and take a look at them if you would desire to do that. If you go on our front page under updates and you click on more news, there's a tab dedicated to that in the upper right. We're looking at transitioning it over to our sheltering part of the webpage as well to make it a little easier to access there, but for now it's on that section. And then finally, I want to just really say thank you to Chief Madden. He and his team have been doing a tremendous job of collaborating with a lot of our community partners. And I just want to make note of one, it's our evacuation map. The Chico Police Department is now fully integrated with the Butte County Emergency Management Plan for evacuation zoning. I know that he had assigned Captain Aldridge to play lead in that. And that team effort really resulted in an amazing opportunity for the public to know and for the community, the City to have the ability to better engage should there be an evacuation necessary. And so I just want to highlight that fact because I see the Police Department doing so much. I'm not sure if it's a good thing or not, but it doesn't get highlighted. And that's just one that really caught my eye. It's going to greatly help to speed up the response times if needed to evacuate and or if a shelter in place is necessary. And what you can do is go to the website as a member of the community and on that update section right on the front page, current evacuation maps is right there. It's the second item over. Click on that. You can put in your address and find out where you're at in that evacuation zone. So just want to make sure you're aware of that. A lot of stuff going on. Those are just three highlights I wanted to share. Thank you. All right. Council member requests pursuant to APMP 1010, council members may verbally request an item to be agendized at a future meeting after stating what the item would be. A majority vote of the council is needed in order for staff to agendize council members. Requests may also be made in writing. Anyone? Going once, going twice. All right. We will move to the next item. We will move on to closed session public comments or council disqualifications. How many speakers? We have two speakers. All right. Three minutes. Nicole Nava followed by Jeff Crean. Good evening. All right. So a little bit up front, I do this every time that this will remain in closed session, so sorry to bore the dais up there, but I think the public needs to know that the homeless settlement, Warren v. Chico, is still riding under control. On ourよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしく! financials some of us have done PRAs and there was nothing available so if there is something now available it'd be sure great to know I haven't seen it come out I would like to speak to items 7.5 6 & 7 on the performance evaluations first off I'm going to start with the city clerk's because I would like to recognize the hard work that they do and I don't know what you consider when you do this but I have to say they are the shining light for me personally and I think for a lot of people in this whole process because they literally have to track so much they are the most impartial group of people I've seen they are ultimate consummate professionals and I thank you because I know I have added to your workload tremendously and I do recognize that it's been years of it thank you from the bottom of my heart and it's not just that anytime you have a need or something they are up on what is happening in the city and are just gracious and helpful and I think that's what I would like to see happen in the city and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and host sessions. What I am concerned with is a lot of why we're here with Warren versus Chico and all of that, because I do not know. I am not privy to what is happening. So I don't know. Does some of it lie with you? Does it lie with other people? What is the driving factor moving that forward? And unfortunately, that is the tail wagging the dog of Chico right now in our ability to get other things done and accomplished. I think you're frustrated probably more than a lot of people as well with this. But I think problematically, some of this stemmed from this plan of a renewal center, Jesus Center being tied and interested. And then all of a sudden, where did that go? And then it's the Pallet Palace. And then here they come again. And it's confusing. If you're trying to watch the bouncing ball that is bouncing in the dark, all you can do is hold on to what you knew at a certain time and where we landed. And it pains me to not sit here and trot out a glowing thing, because I appreciate some of the good fiscal things. But it concerns me. This concerns me about our ability, as I've said before, road infrastructure, focus elsewhere. Some of your department heads deserve a lot more money than they're getting that has been going elsewhere. And then for the attorney, the same concerns about being tied to the settlement and all of that, I just feel like we went down a dark path. And I'd like to see us reel back. I'd like to see you dig in and figure out why are we doing the center closed session? Not necessary anymore. Thank you. Jeff Creed is our last speaker. So it's Mr. Critic back again, right? Label me and dismiss me all you want. But, you know, a true leader would listen and then question what I say and make the decision for yourself. I've never asked anybody to believe me outright. All I ask is that you listen and see if what I say has any merit to it. And if you can't put some of the things that you've said in the center of the room, I'm going to ask you to listen.

So what am I talking about? Specifically, the city of Chico has let its number one infrastructure, the roads, degrade. And where has there ever been a plan presented to bring roads up to sustainable levels? And I'm not even talking improve them above their levels. I'm talking sustainable maintenance. Where has there been that plan in the last six to eight years? So there was an intentional decision to let the number one infrastructure in your business degrade significantly to the point of near collapse, which is where you're at. You're on that precipice of near collapse. There's been the disenfranchise of voters. You're talking about people not chiming in on the districting. It's because we've been taught as citizens, unless you're... Tenacious and persistent like me, how many citizens don't show up here? How many showed up for years caring and wanting better and wanting help from the council to make their community better? And how many don't even tune in anymore? First time I came to a council meeting, I was walking down the street a couple of weeks later and somebody's like, oh, and they came up and introduced themselves. And I almost jumped out of my skin. I was like, what do you mean it's on TV? How many people still even chime in and watch on TV? I know we can't... I can't track that, but it's an interesting number to me because I would say very few. You've chased away customers from downtown. The civil disobedience downtown for years has chased away customers from businesses. And it always made me sad because watching these businesses support the council and then the council doesn't support them by keeping civility downtown, it chases away businesses. And, you know, I could go on and on. How many businesses... How many businesses chose not to come to Chico? There was a lot of talk about a battery maker. No, I'm not coming to Chico. I have to get in my car and specifically choose which roads to avoid. So if you're driving a Tesla, are you going to be driving around Chico? I doubt it. That is it. All right. Thank you very much. And we will adjourn into closed session. In council room... Let's... One. One. Not two. Not normal. Back to our normal. That. That. Yeah. We're going to do that. Admin. All right. You're out of here for two minutes. What's the topic? Well, there's two topics. One is your seating choice. I got promoted. You got promoted? Well, I wanted to do that. Second.
