Good evening, Madam Chair and members of the commission. The first item on tonight's agenda is a request for use permit approval to establish a commercial cannabis storefront retailer use in the community commercial zoning district. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Following the adoption of these ordinances, the permit application window for proposed storefront retailer businesses was open for submissions from June 2nd to July 16th of 2021. The City Manager's Office received a total of 29 applications for cannabis storefront retailer businesses. Ultimately, three applicants received a notice of selection from the City Manager following the fourth and final phase of review and were issued a commercial cannabis permit on August 30th, 2022. The project site of the proposed storefront retailer is located on the south side of Cohasset Road, east of Esplanade. The CC Zoning District is applied to areas appropriate for a wide range of retail businesses. A commercial cannabis storefront retailer use may be allowed in the CC Zoning District subject to use permits. The proposed storefront retailer use would be established in an existing 2,280 square foot commercial building previously used as a restaurant. Tenant improvements would be made to the existing building. No new construction is proposed on site. The project estimates a total of 26 employees with approximately 6 to 10 employees working per shift depending on the day of the week, time of day, and volume of sales. The proposed operating hours are between 8 a.m. and 9 p.m. seven days per week. Vehicle access to the site is provided via two access driveways off Cohasset Road. The proposed storefront retailer use would occupy an existing building with a footprint of 2,280 square feet. The total parking area provides 32 standard parking spaces, satisfying the City's off-street parking requirements. The proposed storefront retailer use would be established in a 2,280 square feet building in a 4-star vacant garage in a 4-star vacant garage in a 4-star vacant garage in a 4-star were required to submit detailed plans for the safety, security, and operational characteristics of the proposed use. Additionally, a zoning verification by the planning department was conducted as part of the associated cannabis business permit to verify compliance with the location limitations for cannabis-related land uses consistent with state requirements. At the time of staff's analysis of the location proposed, no known sensitive uses were identified within the minimum buffer distances of 1,000 feet from any property containing a school providing instruction in any grades 6 through 12, or 600 feet from any property containing a school providing instruction in kindergarten or grades 1 through 5, a daycare center, or a youth center with primary youth center activities. The proposed project is consistent with various policies and actions in the general planning and management plan. Specifically, the project would be consistent with economic development goals and policies which encourage Chico residents and visitors to support businesses that are located in the city of Chico. Applicants for a commercial cannabis permit were required to prepare and provide safety and security plans for proposed facilities which support the deterrence of crime through site planning and design consistent with safety policy 5.5 as well as community design policy 3.4. These plans were also required to be considered in the general planning and management plan and were reviewed by the Chico Police Department and meet state requirements. The proposed use reflects a new commercial retail land use category that is limited to a total of three establishments citywide, thereby providing a mix and distribution of uses that would meet the identified needs of the community consistent with land use goal 2. The proposed use would be located on a parcel designated commercial mixed use and operate out of an existing commercial building. Both general and use specific operations would be used to provide a mix and distribution of use. The proposed use would be located in an area characterized by a variety of commercial and retail service uses far enough away from existing single family residences but proximal enough to be walkable or bikeable and provide a missing neighborhood retail element consistent with land use goal 3. The proposed use would be located in an area characterized by a variety of commercial and land use policy 4.4. The project has been determined to be categorically exempt from environmental review pursuant to 15332 infill development projects. And ultimately it's staff's position and recommendation that this use would operate similar to other retail uses which are and this use is subject to the use specific standards similar to liquor stores commercial cannabis storefronts. The proposed use is in a mix in a mix in a mix in a mix in a mix in a mix in a mix in a mix in a mix in a mix in a mix in a mix in a mix in a mix in a mix in a mix in a mix in a mix in a mix in a mix in a mix in a mix in a mix in a mix in a mix in a mix in a mix in a mix in a mix in a mix in a mix in a mix in a mix in a mix in a mix in a mix in a mix in a mix in a mix in a mix in a mix in a mix in a mix in a mix in a mix in a mix in a mix in a mix in a mix in a mix in a mix in a mix in a mix in a mix in a mix in a mix in a mix in a mix in a mix in a mix in a mix in a mix in a mix in a mix in a mix in a mix in a mix in a mix in a mix in a mix in a mix in a mix in detrimental effects and therefore staff would recommend adoption of resolution 2206 approving use permit 2206 for embark can take any questions are there any questions of staff commissioner wall why are only three sites made available in chico this was a large discussion a long time coming ultimately it was a determination of the city council who worked based upon um originally it was going to be based upon a population estimate of one to every 25 000 persons in the city limits and through further discussion that was the determination of the city council that was limited or further reduced from four to three locations based on the city's current population and that was based on just a let's start slow was the additional reasoning for that we didn't want to open the floodgates in california when was marijuana made permissible in california in 2016 2017 the medicinal adult use um cannabis act was passed maursa was the acronym um! recreational became on 1118? Correct. With meeting all the requirements. And so cities were required to either adopt the state's ordinance regulating commercial cannabis or to adopt a ordinance prohibiting commercial cannabis. I believe that's what we did at the time while other municipalities around us regulated some businesses. That's why we see some delivery services in Chico, but it hasn't been until recent years that we've gotten our own ordinance on the books. Okay. I don't know if it was in the report, but I didn't see it. It was. Is it permissible to grow a marijuana on-site? No cultivation, no commercial cultivation of any kind is allowed in the city. We do have regulations that have been previously. So that's covered under a separate ordinance then? Not this one? Cultivation is prohibited, but it's not allowed in the city. So that's covered under a separate ordinance then? Not this one? That's already been provided in 1975 and in Title 5. Okay. except for personal indoor cultivation for medicinal uses. If you have a medical card, you can grow six plants if you're 21 or over. How does this operation fit in with the Schedule 1 requirements of the Controlled Substance Act of the federal government? I am not sure I have the best answer for that. If you want to elaborate. Mr. Ewing, Lynn, do you want to weigh in on that at all? I can't weigh in specifically right now. I can take a look at it and come back to Commissioner Wall and answer that question at another meeting. Okay. There are cities and jurisdictions all over California that are allowing the sale of marijuana, both recreationally and medicinally, with no engagement from the federal government, as there was about eight to ten years ago. When Chico ventured down that, we received a letter from someone from the federal government. That is not the case anymore. I understand that, but just because they can doesn't mean we should. Okay. Mr. Hooper, do you have any questions? Okay. Just a question on kind of the background that you provided, which I really appreciate. Sure. It's a simple thing, and I'm sure it's probably just a matter of timing, but I'm curious, maybe the public is curious as well, given that there were three permits allowed, but we're only looking at two so far. Is that simply a matter that we can anticipate another one coming before the commission at a later date? Yes. I would expect the third and final application to be forthcoming probably after the holidays, beginning of the year. Okay. Great. Thank you. Yeah. Any other questions? I have a quick question, I think, from Matt. The traffic counts on a retail establishment versus... A breakfast restaurant. Do you anticipate any deviation or a major deviation between those? I wouldn't think there'd be much. Our old general plan, when we looked at traffic for new developments, they had a threshold of 75 trips per hour, peak trips per hour. That would kind of needed further traffic study. I can't imagine that we would have anywhere close to that. Our new general plan looks more at... It helps in a way in which there is a difference in traffic in a relatively relatively relatively relatively in a relatively relatively relatively in a relatively relatively in a relatively relatively in a relatively in a relatively in a relatively in a relatively in a relatively in a relatively in a relatively in a relatively in a relatively in a relatively in a relatively in a relatively in a relatively in a relatively would be something, just wondering the impact of this project on that. Is that negligible? Wow. It would have been nice if we would have heard that before. We could probably have provided some accident data. But I think that in this situation, you know, with the restaurant that was there, it was busy in the morning. So you had a lot of cars coming in and out during the a.m. peak. I think this situation probably, its midday traffic generation would probably be the highest. And, you know, kids riding back and forth to school, I don't, you know, they're not, they're already in school in the morning, coming home later in the afternoon. I don't think that there'd be much of a change or impact. But we could provide you some information on that location from a vehicle accident. From a vehicle accident standpoint or pedestrian. Okay. Tony, can I? Yeah. Following up, I have the same question and then forgot to ask Matt. Can you describe, and maybe it's on the map, but I don't think it was, or on the diagram, where the center turning lane, you know, kind of begins, I think, what, probably just west of the crosswalk and then in relationship to where this business would be located? Do we have a question? It's a little bit tight in there, I think, maybe, but I believe that, you know, that that turning lane in the middle is, you know, provides ample room for people to get into the left lane and they're traveling west. Sorry, I didn't mean to put you on the spot. Oh, no, no, no, no. I'm just, I'm looking here. Not sure if there's a site plan that reflects the park turning lane. Okay. As Matt mentioned, it's an existing condition. Right. At this point. Okay. Rich, I'll just, I can throw something out there. When I went by the site today, when I was at Golden Valley Bank, the, it's pretty much a turn in each way, whether you're on the south or north, almost that whole section, if I remember correctly. I think I'd agree with that, Dennis, because to the north of it, we have Golden Valley Bank, and I know that they have an entrance and exit on both the westerly and easterly sides over by the railroad tracks. So I'm sure we have it. But continue as two-way left turn lane there, so. Good. Great. Yeah, that makes sense. Thank you. Any questions on my right? Commissioner Cooper? I have one question. You mentioned, and I see it's billboards for these delivery services and radio ads, and so are we going to have those people continuing in these also, or if they're planning to use those? I think in part the market will sort that out for itself. I think there are some people who will still utilize delivery services. Unfortunately, at this time, I don't believe we're accepting applications for commercial cannabis delivery services in the city of Chico, although it's one of the five commercial cannabis land uses that were regulated with our ordinance amendments. So in the future, we could see our own delivery services established in Chico. In the meantime, the storefront retailers will be the only location. So if I'm delivering marijuana in Chico, that's not a thing? I don't think it makes them out of compliance with their regulations. You can still order out of the area. The idea would be to encourage local sales. The code actually does read that as soon as the first storefront is opening and delivering, outside deliveries can no longer come into the city. Absolutely. And how to manage that might be a little difficult. Yeah. But that's all we want. Yeah. I was just thinking, yeah, there's 10 deliveries plus this. What's now? Yeah. Just. There we go. Any other questions? Okay. So we will open the public hearing. We'll start with the applicant who will present, and then the commission can ask questions of the applicant. Okay. Okay. Okay. We will open the public hearing to anybody else who wants to speak on that item. If you could direct any questions that you might have to us instead of the applicant, that would be great. Then we'd allow the applicant to come back up and address anything that was said in the public hearing. Yeah, that's fine. So good evening, commissioners and staff. This has been a long time coming. I just want to say an extended thank you to the staff that has worked through this process. This has been a long time coming. My name is Dustin Moore. I'm one of the owners. I'm the CEO of Embark Chico. As you guys were having the discussion around, you know, kind of previous commercial cannabis policies I didn't want to share, I was the day-to-day campaign manager for Proposition 64. So I'm partly to blame for this discussion today. You know, there is this conflict with federal and state law that is, you know, objectively, you know, we can't dispute that fact. There are some major policy shifts that are happening at the federal level, but that, you know, unfortunately does not change the current situation. That being said, you know, we are very proud of the company that we built today. So we have six operational stores in California, Northern California. We're Sacramento-based. Our local partner, Carrie, is in the audience here tonight. And we're just so proud to be in front of you tonight to talk about our dispensary, hopefully our dispensary in Chico, should you all, you know, allow us to proceed forward. So just starting meeting Embark. Again, Dustin Moore. This is Lauren Carpenter, my co-founder, life partner, and better half. So, you know, when it comes to the deep local market, we're going to be talking about the local roots here. We are Northern California based. Carrie has lived in Chico for quite some time. Our leadership and operational experience, I think, is unique in the space, given our public policy background. You know, as having worked on cannabis public policy for as long as I have, you know, being held to that standard is critical. Operating this business truly is a privilege and it's not a right. So we understand that we're up for an annual renewal each year. And it's very important that you understand that we bring that. Um, ethos, uh, to, to the city of Chico and all of the other communities where we operate, we've had zero issues of public health or public safety, no compliance violations. Um, and we're very proud, you know, even though there is this conflict with federal law, we are federally banked. So we have two NCUA and FDIC accredited, uh, banks that, that bank us. So that means that about 40% of our transactions are actually electronic, which is, uh, which is quite unique. So, um, that goes to the secure and compliant nature of our operations. And, you know, generally, um, you know, we're proud of, of this location. I think 185 Cohasset road in the conversations around, uh, trip generation and impacts, uh, we've had a number of traffic studies done in other communities in which we operate. And in those traffic studies, when you look at trip generation, um, cannabis retail actually does not, um, increase when compared to other traditional retail uses. So that's something that we've had experienced in other communities. We have not done a traffic study here. However, we have not. We have not seen, um, increases in, in previous studies that, that we've done. So the site selection was really driven originally by a listening tour, um, that we did in the community. And what we realized is, you know, not to be on, you know, some of the main, um, you know, entry points and historic thoroughfares of Chico. So we stayed away from, you know, the Esplanade, obviously. And Cohasset made a lot of sense because it's a commercial corridor. We also have three times or over three times the required parking. So it was very important to us to ensure that there was ample parking on site so we would not be a detriment. Um, you know, to neighboring businesses. Um, we do have a significant buffer from sensitive uses. I think when the 29 original sites were proposed, we were the furthest from any sensitive use in the city of Chico. Um, and we also had, um, you know, the most dedicated parking spaces based on the ratio of parking based on our square footage. Um, the surrounding businesses, we've already done a significant amount of outreach carries, knocked on doors. I've, I've talked to folks and, you know, generally is even, I think, evidenced by the press that you all have seen. It seems to be welcomed, um, you know, in this particular area. So we're very close to, um, public transit too, which I think is, is, is quite important. And this is a vacant building. So this is not displacing another business. This building, as you can see, um, could use some love. Um, and we're here to, to reimagine it into a world-class retail, uh, site. And, you know, for this reinvestment into the property, we do really believe that, um, the end result will make the city proud. And it's really built. It's built to look like a palace, but the security infrastructure, um, makes it much more of a fortress than anything. And I can kind of walk you through the process, um, so you can kind of get a sense of, of how this works. So when somebody comes to the business, they're greeted, they have to have their identification checked before they're ever allowed inside the premises to assure they're over the age of 21. Um, they go actually into a waiting area that's separate and apart from the retail floor. So that gives us an extra security measure. It's a man trap. I don't know if you've seen them at your bank. Where you walk in one door, the door shuts behind you and the second door can't open until the first door closes. So that ensures that people can't force their way into the business. Um, once the individual is let inside and onto the floor for the retail purchase, they're guided by one of our guides that helps them select the product, um, that they, that they, you know, see fit. Um, finally they check out at the checkout. That identification is checked again and to ensure that that individual who's in the system, um, is the individual that's purchasing. So finally, once the individual has consummated the transaction. When they exit, they exit in, uh, with an exit bag and that signifies to our security that that person should be leaving the site. So that deters loitering offsite. Our security makes sure that people get in their car, uh, and leave the premises. So, you know, additionally, not only is this a safe and secure site, but we do have a very significant neighborhood compatibility program that actually, um, is bolstered by our good neighbor policy, which includes us hosting open houses prior to opening. Um, we have a pretty significant. Neighborhood beautification efforts. So part of our business, um, 1% of all of our gross receipts goes back into a community investment fund. Um, that's distributed by our community advisory board. And we have a member of our advisory board here tonight. Um, that they can, I think, attest to, um, you know, our, our business. And as part of our community investment fund, we actually do have, um, every one of our employees gets paid for 40 hours of volunteerism a year. And part of that is for neighborhood beautification efforts, um, trash cleanups, et cetera. And also volunteer their, their local causes. So, um, you know, we've, we've put together a number of different, uh, partnerships that, that Lauren can, can go ahead and walk you through. It's my favorite part to talk about. It's not specific to the building. So a little bit less material to the discussion, but I think the part that I am most proud of, um, Dustin touched on it, but in every community where we operate today, we allocate 1% of gross receipts in perpetuity to a community investment fund. And that community investment fund is then, excuse me, not COVID allergies. I promise, um, that community investment fund, you too, right? Um, is allocated by a community advisory board. And the reason that that's important is we're giving local residents and community leaders a seat at the table and really ensuring transparent and accountable operations. Obviously that's bolstered by the fact that Carrie is a local resident and an owner of the business as well. And I think that's important just so that, you know, you know, this isn't just sort of another dot on an expansion map for us. Um, this is Carrie's home and we treat it as such, and we make sure that the community is at the table. Um, and I think that's a really important part of the work that we're doing. for the lifetime of the business's operations. So we have that feedback loop. So that's the Community Advisory Board and the Community Investment Fund. Dustin also touched on the paid volunteerism. And so I think that's important because 1% of gross receipts, you know, obviously knock on wood, that's substantial. We won't know until we open and begin operations. But we bolster that significant community funding with significant volunteerism. And I think that's important because, you know, our staff is local, which is not altruistic, right? When people work where they live, they care more and they perform better. But giving them that meaningful paid volunteerism is also a critical component of that feedback loop, right? Our employees are not just in our stores, they're also in the community, which is, I think, so important to maintaining those deep community roots. And then finally, Dustin mentioned a community listening tour. And as that timeline from earlier explained, this has been a very important part of the community's work. And so I think that's important. And I think that's a very long process. So thinking back to almost two years ago now, we really started engaging with members of this community that were supportive about cannabis, members who were not supportive of cannabis, and I think folks anywhere and everywhere in between. And what we heard consistently were a few things that really shaped the proposal that we put before the city and ultimately before you all now. And one of them was that this was a community that wanted to make sure that with legal licensed cannabis came meaningful youth prevention and education. And so I think that's a really important part of that. And I think that's something that we're really looking at. This is a community that really cares about its kids and wanted to make sure that operators were investing in protecting youth. So another key component of our application is the development and deployment of a third party accredited youth drug education and prevention program. This is something that we do in other communities where we operate. It is not me or Embark that is out educating and preventing drug use with our youth. It is us creating grants with local nonprofits in each of the communities where we operate to deploy that accredited program. And we've seen great results so far and obviously are very excited at the prospect of being able to do that here as well. And then as you'll see on the other side of the screen, we do all of the things that all responsible cannabis operators should do, right? We do partnerships, we have addiction resources, we work to create partnerships with other businesses, we provide scholarships to our employees and to community members. The list goes on and on. And I think that's really just intended to show you sort of the depth and breadth of our community integration. Yeah, and we just sincerely look forward to this opportunity. We stand here tonight, you know, ready to answer any questions you have about the business or the operations. I think what you'll find again is we do at our core believe this is a privilege and not a right and the transparency of our operations, I think, is it's not just something that, you know, you should take our word for. You can see this is happening in all the other communities in which we operate and you can see the community advisory board that stands with us in this operation. So thank you for your time. Are there any questions of the applicant? And I'll start to my left. Right? Commissioner Cooper? The 1% is the city oversees the 1% at all or do you guys think, you know, I'm going to fix up the front of my house for 1%? We prove it. And I get it if the board and stuff, but how is that maybe, is there an oversight from the city or something? So we actually invited a board member. Right. So as part of the application, we actually invite a member of the city staff to sit on that board as a nonvoting member for observation. We understand how busy staff can be. So there's not always going to be that opportunity. However, as part of our annual compliance, that is something that we have attested. We will report back to the city of how much was that? Where did it go? So there is that oversight. And again, because these are annual operating permits, we don't do what we say we're going to do. We lose the right to operate. So and I think, you know, separate and apart from that, we're going to have to do a lot of work. We will find ways in which we will find ways in which we will find ways in which we will find ways in which we will find ways in which we will find ways in which we will find ways in which we will find ways in which we will find ways in which we will find ways in which we will find ways in which we will find ways in which we will find ways in which we will find ways in which we will find ways in which we will find ways in which we will find ways in which we will find ways in which we will find ways in which we will find ways in which we will find ways in which we will find ways in which we will find ways in which we will find ways in which we will find ways in which we will find ways in which we will find ways in which we will find ways in which we will find ways in which we will find ways in which we will find ways in which we will find ways in which we will find ways in which we will find ways in which we will find ways in which we will find ways in which we will find ways in adopted and picked up the torch on some of the programs that we had initiated. So I think it is an opportunity. Obviously, it's not appropriate until we're through the entitlement process to begin that engagement with the city. But I share that just to say it's a real opportunity for meaningful public-private partnership that I think can go sort of bring the benefits beyond just, you know, revenue generation. Thank you. I've got one. Yeah, just curious, where did the other six communities that you're currently operating in? So Tahoe was our first, then we moved and opened in the city of Alameda, Martinez, Fairfield, Fresno, and we just got our operating permit for the city of Sacramento, our hometown. Thank you. Okay, thank you. Thank you very much. And this is my cell phone number if anyone has questions, comments, or concerns. Thank you. And not during the public hearing. Are there any other public comments? I just have one speaker. Okay. Terry Moore. Good evening. I see a few faces of people I recognize from years past, Larry and Paul, Matt, Brendan, Shirley, before I left. I'm an ex-City of Chico employee. I worked, hired on with the police department in 1975 as a reservist. I'm an ex-City of Chico employee. I worked, hired on with the police department in 1975 as a reservist. I'm an ex-City of Chico employee. I worked, hired on with the police department in 1975 as a reservist. I'm an ex-City of Chico employee. I worked, hired on with the police department in 1975 as a reservist. I'm an ex-City of Chico employee. I worked, hired on with the police department in 1975 as a reservist. I'm an ex-City of Chico employee. I worked, hired on with the police department in 1975 as a reservist. I'm an ex-City of Chico employee. I worked, hired on with the police department in 1975 as a in 1975 as a in 1975 as a group of people that I support for what they just talked to you about. I don't think I saw the last time where another business came in with such a proposal that you just heard. I've seen some of the pictures of the places that they have refurbished. They're beautiful. I mean, they've taken pieces of trash, not saying that the old Russell's restaurant is trash, but it needs some attention. It needs it soon. You know, it kind of goes along with that broken windows theory that we used to have that the big cities put together. If you let the little things go, if they don't mean anything to you, then the big things start coming up. And heavens, we got enough problems without those things we can fix. And this group is coming in here to fix. I remember I had a friend that was going to go into the old Calneva restaurant. Larry, you might remember where that is. I've been here for 50 years. And so it was down here at 6th and Main Street. There was a old restaurant there and the city. And I wanted him to put in 27 parking spaces for a boot shop. I don't even think they had that many. This place has got, what, 30? Is that what I heard? You're not going to fill those spots up anytime soon. So there's a couple things I would just say from a police perspective that I like about the location. 85% of the calls that came into the police department were west, starting from Yosemite to the west. 85%. 85%. 85%. 85%. 85%. 85%. 85%. 85%. 85%. 85%. 85%. 85%. 85%. 85%. 85%. Cr It's really a logical place. You go up the Esplanade, you connect over, and you're on the freeway. And I'm not saying they're going to have calls for service because of what they do. Banks have calls for service because of what they do. And they have money and people want it. I don't know if that's going to be the case here, but they're in a good location for a response from the police department. They're less than a mile from the fire department and the trauma center. That's good in terms of medical. So I see a couple of positives with the location right there. Someone pointed out, I think, Rich, you pointed out about the turn in the center lane. And I agree that it might be a little tight coming from east to west and going in there. But I never had a problem when I was working getting in there for the coffee or the meal that I ate in there. I ate in Russell's quite frequently. So I'm very familiar with the location. There's a walkway, as you know, the old Southern Pacific right-of-way, the railway. It used to run right behind there. That's what that bike path is now. And I don't think there's any danger for what they're bringing to the location. And so we've already decided as a city that we're going to have it. We're going to license them. So now we're just talking about whether the location is good. So I've just got a couple of things here that I wrote down. It's like they've asked me to be on their community advisory board. Mr. Morey, that little sound was your timer. But let me check. With the commission, if you're our only speaker and this is such an important issue, would we like to extend Mr. Moore's time? They used to have a signal light out here so you would know. Yeah. Let's do two more minutes. Okay. Okay. They've asked me to be on the community advisory board, knowing who I was, what I did and everything. I think that shows an openness, a willingness to work. I get to be part of the group that will have some direction as to the 1% that they've guaranteed, that they're going to contribute to the city. That's important to me. I work, I volunteer with the Jesus Center. There's a lot of places that need help and that community advisory board is going to determine, I think, to a great extent where that money goes. So I think it's important to have people like myself. I worked here for a lot of years. I know where the problems are and why people need money. So I think they're going to be a trusted partner. I'm totally impressed with their presentation. Obviously, I think based upon what you presented, that the choice of location complies with your general plan. That's obviously probably the paramount consideration. Plenty of parking. I don't see it being any conflict with any of the neighboring places down there. In fact, I see it being better than most of the liquor establishments that are close by. Trust me, they don't have anything like the security or the sense of give back. Just drive down the Esplanade about half a mile north and look on the right side and drive around that building after they build this one. You'll see that you're getting a much better deal here, I think. Anyway, 20-some jobs. It's got to be something good for the community right there. So I totally support what they're doing. I hope that I can come back to the community and tell them what we've done with the money that's coming from the whole operation. And thank you for your time. Thank you. Any other public comment? Okay. So with that, we will close the public hearing and bring it back to the commission. Well, I'll start off by saying I think there are going to be good operators if this is approved. I have a problem with it. It helps guys in San Francisco. the city advocating breaking the law which is what we're doing here we're saying oh it's okay we can break the law for this one for this ordinance for this uh proposal and i think that that's a problem for our community and for the kids in this community and because of that i'm going to move that the planning commission deny resolution 2206 which would approve use to permit 2206 parent embark while proposition 64 allowed marijuana in california marijuana is a schedule one drug in accordance with the u.s controlled substance act and is illegal permitting commercial cannabis business sets a bad example to the community and to our children in that it says it's okay to pick and choose which laws we choose to obey and i think that is a real problem we have enough of that going on not only in the community but across the country hey we don't have to obey that law anymore we can do as we want well i think if we were doing this right we would wait until until the senate and the president sign off on the house resolution that takes marijuana off schedule one i i think that would be the correct way to go so before we get into discussion we have a motion there is there a second okay so the motion dies for lack of a second um any further discussion or any further motions um i'll make a motion to adopt resolution number 22-06 approving use permit 22-06 subject to the recommended conditions therein a second okay who wants to fight over it i'll take a commissioner cooper so we have a motion from commissioner goldstein and then a second from commissioner cooper to adopt resolution number 22-06 approving use permit 22-06 subject to the recommended conditions any further discussion i i would just offer the comment that i i greatly appreciate the thoroughness of the proposal i think as as has been pointed out the location is great so i i i am i'm just really deeply respectful of the work that you've already done and looking forward to what uh what you'll be doing in the future for the community does vince have an answer yet on the schedule one the the answer is it is a schedule one um drug and the the federal law is different than the california law yeah it is still so vince i'm wondering and this is just for my edification not um are there we are a community that values local control And we are a state that tends to value our values maybe a little bit higher than federal. But are there other instances in land use or in planning where our laws may conflict with federal laws? Or is this the only one? This is the only one that I can think of. There are, and remember, Chico is a charter city, too. So it's a home rule city versus a general law city. So there are a couple of areas that are, the reason I mention that, that are occupied by the state. And so the state says to those cities, look, we're going to occupy this particular area of the law. You cities have no say on it. You have to follow what the state law is in this particular area, specifically with land use. So one of the things that I can think of off the top of my head was pretty contentious in the 90s is mobile home. And then there's the state parks, for example. So that's an area that was occupied or that is occupied by the state. In terms of local laws that conflict with state laws, I'm not aware of any at first blush. I can do some research, come back to you at another meeting and maybe bring you a list or say I did the research and there is no list. But at first blush, I cannot think of any. And mind you that we're talking about a state law and a proposition that was passed by the voters. And so as a result, for the last several years, there's been no public opinion. It's gotten a little bit in there in the last few years. Okay. All in favor of the motion to adopt resolution number 22-06, signify by saying aye. Aye. All opposed. No. So that motion passes 6-1. And then we will take a quick break so we can allow Commissioner Poulin to step out of the room for our next item. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Do you have some questions? No. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. We are going to call the meeting back to order. And we'll turn it back over to senior planner Kelly Murphy for use permit 22-07, which is our item 4.2. Thank you, Madam Chair. The second item on tonight's agenda is a request for use permit approval to establish a commercial cannabis storefront retailer use in the traditional neighborhood development T and D zoning area. This is the project site of the proposed storefront retailer located in the northeast corner of Alcott Avenue and East 20th Street in Merriam Park. The project site is designated special mixed use on the city's general plan land use diagram and zone T and D and designated T and D core by the approved regulating plan. The core designation is intended for the most urban conditions within the T and D zone. A commercial cannabis storefront retailer may be established in the T and D core subject to use permit approval. This aerial view provides another perspective of the project site and the surrounding area. You can see we're still in an area of towns experiencing a lot of significant development. The project estimates a total of 20 employees with up to eight employees working per shift. The proposed operating hours are from 8 a.m. to 9 p.m., seven days per week. Vehicle access to the site is provided via an access driveway off of Alcott Avenue. The proposed storefront retailer use would occupy one of the commercial suites approximately 4,250 square feet in size. The total parking area provides 49 parking spaces which satisfies the city's off-street parking requirements. An application for architectural review was approved by the architectural review board for the new single story commercial building described as a restaurant and retail space in September 2021. No additional new construction is proposed on site or modifications to that entitlement. The project is consistent with land use, lot coverage, landscaping, building type, building height, and setback requirements for the T and D core. Tenant improvements and proposed signage will be reviewed at the staff level. As previously explained, the project is a project that will provide a As previously explained, a zoning verification was conducted as part of the associated cannabis business permit to verify compliance with the location limitations for cannabis-related land uses. At the time of staff's analysis of the location proposed for the storefront retailer use, no known sensitive uses were identified within the minimum buffer distances. The project is consistent with various policies and actions in the general plan. As previously described, the proposed use would be located on a parcel designated special mixed use and operate out of a multi-tenant commercial building. Both general and use specific operating standards have been required, ensuring land use compatibility with the surrounding area consistent with land use policy 2.4. Furthermore, the proposed use would be in an area characterized by a variety of commercial, retail, and service uses far enough away from established neighborhoods, but proximal enough to be walkable walkable or bikeable and would provide a missing neighborhood retail element consistent with land use goal 3 and land use policy 4.4. Again, the project has been determined to be categorically exempt from further environmental review pursuant to section 15332 infill development projects. And staff's recommendation again is to adopt resolution 22-07 approving use permit application 2207. For sweet flower LLC subject to the recommended the recommended conditions of approval. Any questions? Questions to my right? Yes. Where did the new high school go? Um. Is that right across the street? No. Is that good? I guess I'm trying to. It's significantly south down Bruce Road. That is farther away. Yeah. Well. Well. Well. Outside of the buffer. Yeah. Down the Brady Boulevard intersection with Bruce Road. Directly across the street will be Stone Gate. Okay. Great. It's also worth pointing out that our sensitive use analysis was conducted based on the sensitive uses in existence at the time the application was submitted. So future sensitive uses wouldn't be considered with this review. Okay. So, Kelly, if you could just speak to us about this new high school. Sure. Kelly, could you speak really quickly to, we got public comment on both of these as far as, I would say, uses that bring in a youth demographic. How is that, I guess, different from what our code says about schools and proximity to schools? Could you speak to that? Sure. So, Kelly, if you could just elaborate on that question. Sorry. So, I think we had a letter from Mr. DelRial that mentioned that there are uses, and they seem to be in closer proximity on this application than the previous one that we heard tonight, that are geared towards youth or children that are within a thousand feet. and it looks like our code says it's actually schools that we're looking for or daycare centers where that's the primary purpose so how is that considered and youth centers is also one and we do have a definition for youth centers which is defined as a facility that caters primarily towards youth the letter that you were talking about listed i think five different locations near both of the sites i have done a measurement so none of those locations listed are within a minimum buffer distance or would qualify as a sensitive use site there was a art school it's purely online the address given didn't even correlate to a physical address um i've further researched that that's going to be an online use we have a martial arts i believe there's a martial arts i believe there's a martial arts i believe there's a martial arts i believe there's a martial arts school and that caters to both adults and youth it was forwarded to the city attorney's office during the initial zoning verification and sensitive use analysis process that happened in the first phase of review for the commercial cannabis permits um where the city attorney provided feedback that another location similar to that a martial arts school was not a sensitive use because it had adult classes as well as youth classes um does that answer your question yeah they were either not sensitive uses or if they possibly were they were well outside of the buffer established both in the state regulations as well as the citizens it's it's a little strange i'm aware of max del rio he is a marijuana lobbyist for the state of california and he also i believe was an advocate so it's a little straight i don't understand what what this is but yeah so that is correct so he's a marijuana lobbyist which i'll tell you i think mr wall is intimately uh aware and i was too sitting over there in that uh back room with uh mr del real too so yeah so yeah um any other questions okay thank you kelly uh we will open the public hearing um the applicant will go first uh we commission will ask questions and then uh will we will open it up to any members of the public who wish to speak on the item if you do want to speak on the item if you could please uh give a speaker card to nicole so thank you thank you uh thank you kelly and thank you staff um my name is tim dodd i'm the ceo and co-founder of sweet flower and the ceo of sweet flat chico uh i'm very humble and grateful to be here this evening and i'm going to hand it over to the speaker for the presentation and i'm joined tonight by one of our local partners colleen winter who contacted me about two and a half years ago with the notion of of creating a best-in-class legal cannabis retailer in the city of chico so it's about two years now since i first came to chico and worked with colleen uh to build what we hope uh if tonight goes okay um it will be a best in class retailer in this great city so i'm going to hand it over to the speaker for the presentation i wanted to start with a quick introduction to sweet flower um we are we are a company based in values we operate a number of dispensaries throughout california legally and compliantly since january 1 of 2018 and before that as well as part of the the precursor to the current cruiser laws and regulations that govern currently govern legal cannabis retail in the state of california we want to build a company that we can be proud of i'm a father of four i'm an immigrant a solo immigrant to this great country and i really wanted to be able to give back and that was part of my philosophy in building sweet flower so we built this company on four values community engagement so we we listen to our community in every part of our community we have a neighborhood neighborhood advisory board so we work with our community with our uh non-profits and charities in our communities we also listen to our community neighbors so we work with the neighborhood councils in every city that we operate uh i'm available 24 7 as our store managers and we put community liaison uh kind of one of our first and foremost policies very important we're trusted and transparent so we are transparently banked by two fdic insured uh banks we are transparently insured at a federal level uh we bank debit and credit and cash uh we like to bank debit and credit because it takes the cash and credit and credit and credit and credit and credit and credit and credit and credit and out of our system we don't like to have a lot of cash for lots of lots of reasons including security primarily uh on hand i focus on inclusion and diversity we are 80 diverse at the store level we are 90 diverse at the corporate level and lastly public health and safety so i do want to talk a little bit about youth we've served over 600 000 customers since we've been gone we have never served anyone under 21 or under 18 with a medical card in this in this in this in this in this we do two checks of age of majority when someone walks into our stores we do the initial check of age of majority we look for id we scan the id that id goes to the state it goes to department of cannabis control in sacramento and then when we sell someone cannabis we do a second check and that check goes back to the to the dcc the department of cannabis control in sacramento it also goes to metric so metric is a system that is a little bit like kind of the way an airline would talk to the faa so can i take off can i go to 10 000 feet can we go to cruising altitude that's really how i see the metric system so every piece of cannabis that we sell is not only individual it's individually serialized so two pieces of cannabis are not the same this piece will have a different uh skew from this piece even if they're the same product and same manufacturer they are different and every person in this who comes to our stores every customer has a different id that they present and that idea is then logged against metric so we know how much person a bought that day are they over there are they approaching or over uh their daily allowance and metric is governing that and metric is talking to us basically every second of the day if we lose contact with metric we can't sell cannabis we have basically an hour to get that contact back and that doesn't happen we have very high security very robust pipelines of you know flow back and forth to this to the state but you know if that goes down we don't sell um and that's a very important part of how we go about our business so i as a father i'm very focused on preventing stopping any youth access and any secondary sale of product in terms of our ethos focusing on community so since 2018 we've donated just over a quarter of a million dollars i'm not including in here sales taxes or state and local taxes this is a voluntary contribution that we have made to other communities that we serve across across the state in addition thousands of volunteer hours and that's made you know by food truck in uh in victorian county you know we we lead by example so we contribute back to our city by uh both cash you know money from our stores but also in volunteer hours and our employees love that so we give all of our employees a voluntary allotment of 18 hours a year to spend with our families in this way in this way in this way in this way in this way in this way in this way in this way in this way in this way in this way in this way in this way in this way in this way in this way in this way in this way in this way in this way in this way in this way in this way in this way in this way in this way in this way in this way in this way in this way in this way in this way in this way in this way in this way in this way in this way in this way in this way in this way in this way in this way in this way in this way in this way in this way in this way in this way in this way in this way in this way in this way in this way in this way in this way in this way in this way in this way in this way in this way in this way in this way in this way in this way in this way in this way in this way in this way in this way in this way in this way in this way in this way in the City of Chico at Merriam Park. We did some listening. We met a lot of great residents and locals a few weeks ago. And I view this as really our opportunity to become a trusted partner with the city. To me, this is a partnership. We listen to you. We do what you say. And it's very important that you trust us as well. And that's something that we have to earn. So it starts with me and it starts with the local management. And that's why having Colleen on board with us has been so important. We want to be local everywhere we go. As I mentioned, we drive representation. We really focus on diversity. We focus on inclusivity. We also focus on providing opportunity for people. So two-thirds of our shelf space is devoted to legacy growers, people who have been in the cannabis business for a long time, particularly in this part of Northern California. LGBTQ+, female, and men. And BIPOC-owned and founded brands. Very important that we represent and reflect that in our business. As I mentioned, we operate six stores in California currently. We have a management team that has deep operational experience in cannabis. We have over 40 years of combined legal cannabis experience. We currently have about 150, a little over 150 employees across our stores and in our leadership team. As I mentioned, we've donated over a quarter of a million dollars to the cities we serve in voluntary contributions. We've never had a single complaint when we have over 2,000 five-star reviews. In Chico, we've been lucky to meet Colleen and Dan. Dan can't be here tonight. But Colleen is a deeply dedicated local resident, as is Dan. And maybe you'd like to say a few words, Colleen? Sure. Yeah, I am a local resident. I was born and raised in Chico. I've had a business here for over 25 years. My mom and I co-founded Lulu's. We founded Lulu's in Chico. We started in downtown Chico as just a used vintage, I guess you could call it, store. And we kind of changed the brand over time. And we are now a publicly traded company. And we really feel deeply about Chico. Chico is our hometown. I'm a mom. As Tim mentioned, he's a father. When Chico opened up kind of Pandora's box to the potential for cannabis, I wanted to make sure that it was done right. And I felt like with my retail experience, I could really actually come in and do something good for Chico if we're going to do it. Why not make it the best possible? So Lulu's had a pop-up shop on Melrose a while back. And actually, Sweetflower was our neighbor. And so a lot of my employees were going next door, and I couldn't figure out what they were doing. And I asked, and they said, and I thought it was a very beautiful, I actually thought it was like a furniture shop. And I said, well, I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. It's a furniture showroom. I really didn't look at it too much, but I just thought, oh, it's a really pretty space. And I hadn't given it much thought. And they told me it was a dispensary. And we worked, we had our pop-up shop for a couple of weeks. And I just kind of always thought it was a good business. And so when the opportunity came to Chico, I actually reached out to Tim. I did a cold email. He had no idea who he was. But luckily, he found my email. And the rest is history. So for me, it's really important to bring a best in class experience to Chico. and I think if you dig a little deeper on Sweetflower, it's nothing but the best. And so that's really what I want for Chico. Thanks, Colleen. So as I mentioned, community is very important to us. It's really the principle on our founding of why we did this and why my partner and I feel so strongly about Chico and so strongly about working with Colleen and with Dan. So we have an advisory board. We have an investment fund. We focus on volunteerism. We focus on local hiring. If we're successful tonight, we actually have a general manager who's a local and a local team behind her ready to go, and that's something that I'm very passionate about. This is not having people from our other stores come here. We will come here and train. We'll come here and educate. We'll come here and engage. But we really want this to be local. You have my commitment. I will be here a lot. I will be here a lot. I've been here. I've been here a lot already. Colleen laughs that I like to come to Chico and live, but I actually do. I'm from a much smaller town than Chico, and I really enjoy it. But we're very passionate about this. And then local business partnerships, we're already doing that. We're working with local contractors, local furniture builders, local advertising companies, local signage companies. We're hiring locally. I haven't done a number in my head, but I think roughly we've spent over a million dollars locally so far. And we're building this store. And we're very focused and passionate about that. And that's part of what we do everywhere we go, not just in Chico, but everywhere. In terms of looking at the numbers, they're there, and that's a projection that we feel confident about based on what we see in our other stores. But the advisory board, to the earlier question, and Colleen can talk to that a little bit, is being set up, is already set up, and we've got three or four people that we've been talking to who are local, who are passionate about Chico, and who represent, I believe, the best in class charities and nonprofits in the city. Yeah, I personally picked the advisory board, and I tried to find people that had varied backgrounds in local humanitarianism. And so whether they have volunteered in, you know, just long histories of volunteering, or we have people that have been, you know, longtime business owners that also have been really involved in Chico and are Chicoans. We have a veteran who is a part of the Chico community. We have a partner with the Chico Veterans Garden, which we all know that, you know, when you work with the earth and that type of thing, it's very good. Not only is it good for the veterans, but it's good for them to kind of give back to the community, and they also, it's an exciting industry. A lot of veterans come back from the war, and they have a hard time finding jobs. And we've talked about job creation with the Veterans Garden and local Chico team. We've also had multiple talks with the Renewable Garden and the Renewable Center as well, and the North Valley Community Foundation. So I've handpicked all of our advisory committee. We'll be just as I noticed that Embark talked about being transparent and making sure that the money is spent right, and we'll be just as diligent and transparent as well with that. Yeah, on that point, if the city would like to audit or join the advisory board in some way, we'd be delighted to do that. I think it's really important that this is a partnership and seen as such publicly. A little bit about our location. This is the last slide, and then I will close. And I do appreciate your time. So this location is unique. It's purpose-built for cannabis. We were able to build this with Dan, our local partner, from the ground up. So it has best-in-class security. It has a vault, product vault that is a fully enclosed room within our room. Our philosophy, if you look at the two other slides, sorry, photos at the bottom there, that's very consistent with our look and feel across our other storefronts. So we want to produce a beautiful Sephora-like experience that's highly secure in the front and then a vault, Fort Knox, in the back. So, you know, our other storefronts share the same philosophy. It's a security concept that we developed and has been put in practice now for over five years. And, you know, we have an excellent track. We have a record of security and safety. This is highly walkable. It's part of the Merion Park development. I think it's an amazing development. It's on public transportation routes. It's far from sensitive receptors. We did a full walking tour of our neighborhood. But we also, of course, did a full architectural survey and land use survey of the area around us. And there are no sensitive receptors anywhere near this or even kind of pseudo-sensitive receptors. So we're very good at doing that. Our other storefronts are in very major, as Colleen mentioned, Melrose. We have a lot of major commercial developments around us. We are very stringent about access from people who shouldn't be in our stores. So we're very good at discouraging people who may have been out having a drink somewhere else. They can't come in. Obviously, people who are not of age can't come in. So we're very well-trained, well-rehearsed in preventing anyone who shouldn't be in our stores from not being in our stores, period. It's well-parked. I think I counted 42, but I think the city is 49. That's great. Parking stores, including four for cleaning vehicles, two ADA stores. And we have anchored bicycle racks. We believe, obviously, in alternative transportation methods, public transportation, and cycling. It's well-situated. The building itself is standalone. We have a neighbor, but we are standalone. So we can actually virtually control the entire environment. One of our security protocols is a 360-degree AI-powered 24-7 counter-intuitive security protocol. We have a camera system with a speaker, so we can actually talk down to people if they're approaching our store after hours and we don't want them there. So this happens sometimes in Los Angeles. One of our stores has a vagrant issue. We can actually discourage and disperse people who shouldn't be there. Marion Park itself has a 24-7 patrol as well, in addition to our alarm system and our internal and exterior monitoring systems. The store itself has a 24-7 control system. So the store has a lock-up door on the northeast corner. One of the ordinance codes in Chico was that delivery or distribution vehicles should not be visible from the street. So we went one step further. We're actually going to bring in an internal garage, basically, and bring all the product in, roll down the door, and then have people take the product out of distribution vehicles and into our secure product room. So it's an additional security measure, and it's an additional measure to ensure that no one can see product. coming in or out. We read the code, we listened to, I think, the sentiment behind the code, and we felt that that was the appropriate measure to take. And then, of course, it's designed for compliance, operational integrity. We've done this quite a lot. This will be our seventh store, hopefully, if we're successful tonight. And so we're focused on compliance and operational integrity at all parts of the store. It also features noise, light, and nuisance mitigation measures that exceed the Chico Code and all local and state requirements. As I mentioned, we have a 24-7 security system. And then we also have state-of-the-art compliant odor mitigation and waste management practices. I will close, but, again, I believe cannabis operations are a privilege, they're not a right. So I do appreciate your time and attention to us. And I'm happy to answer any questions you have. Thank you very much. Any questions? You do acknowledge that you are breaking the law when you begin selling based on Schedule 1. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Anybody to the right? No? Okay. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you. Do we have any public comment? It doesn't look like it. I'll bring it back to the commission. Close the public hearing and bring it back to the commission. Any motions? Any motions? I'll make a motion. Any motion? I motion that the Planning Commission adopt Resolution 22-XX, Permit 22-07, Sweetfire LLC, subject to the recommendation. I'll make a quick adjustment to that. It looks like we need to say Resolution 22-07. Yep. Yeah. Excess. So we have a motion that the Planning Commission adopt Resolution 22-07, approve it. Okay. So we have a motion by Commissioner Cooper and a second by Vice Chair Ober. Any discussion? I'll oppose this one, this permit, due to the conflict of Schedule 1 of the U.S. Control Substance Act. The City of Chingo should not advocate breaking the law. Thank you. Thank you, Commissioner Wall. And I'll call for the vote. All in favor, signify by saying aye. Aye. Aye. Any opposed? So that motion passes 6-1. Thank you. 5-1 with one recusal. And we will move into... Can we take a break? Oh, yeah. Let's... Let's... Bring Lindsay back. Okay. Kelly, are we... Bruce, I was wondering what you were going to do tonight. Yes. Yes. I asked... I asked you to... You want me to click through? I can go through. Just click right like this. Yes. Click through. Okay. Okay. Ready? I'm ready. Yeah. Thank you, Madam Chair and Commissioners. Bruce Hambo, Principal Planner. We have a series of code amendments before you tonight that are actually in three categories. I'm ready. Okay. So, first, we have to do this for compliance with state housing law. The first piece of this is Senate Bill 9, which is known as the California Home. That's an abbreviation for Housing Opportunities and More Efficiency Act that provides for two-unit housing development and split and urban lot splits. Those are the key components of the mandate. And then, the second piece is the mandatory code amendments we have to do for consistency with state law. The other component that we have here is general code cleanup. These are minor amendments to clarify inconsistencies. And through our experience of working with the code, we've identified glitches and things that we needed to correct and fix. And that's what these involve. They're primarily in the area of noticing some ADU clarifications. And then, some fencing requirements that are also geared toward compliance with state law. If I were to characterize the three most important areas, those are them of the general code cleanup. The last piece of this is in response to a private application for code amendment to legalize card rooms and allow the approval of a card room in the downtown north zone with approval of a use permit. They're allowed in other zones. This just doesn't apply to the downtown north zone. This essentially allows another zone where a card room is permitted with approval of a use permit. Those are the three components of these amendments. So, the first piece of this, and I'm going to go through a little kind of briefly, it's kind of a complicated piece of legislation. But there are two main components to SB 9. The first is called two-unit housing developments. And this definition was included in your proposed amendments. And as defined, it's housing, it's a proposed housing development involving no more than two dwelling units and an eligible single-family residential parcel, whether the proposal adds up to two new housing units or adds one new unit to an existing parcel. That's by definition, and that's consistent with state law. It only applies, SB 9 only applies to two units. It applies in single-family residence zones. So, for us, that's R1 and RS. It does not apply to multifamily zones or commercial zones. There are also limitations where it's prohibited. Environmentally sensitive areas, prime ag land, high fire hazard areas, waste sites. You're not allowed to take anything out of affordable housing productivity. So, it's not, it doesn't allow demolition or alteration of rent-restricted units. Anything that's been protected under the Ellis Act or demolition of a residence that's been occupied by a tenant for the previous three years. So, this applies to the other part, the other component, which is urban lot splits. Same provision. It's only allowed in R1 areas and single-family residential areas. And it has the same prohibitions. Those are the two main features of it. So, I'll get into a little bit more detail. So, the urban lot split provision allows for a maximum, if you will, of up to four units on one single-family lot. You can divide it, and you're able to have two duplexes, or you can have two detached single-family residences, or you can have combinations of a main and a single-family. And an ADU or a main and a junior ADU. Maximum of four. We're recommending the hold of it at just allowing that, because that's what we're obligated to do with state law. I just wanted to point out, though, we may have situations where a person has a house and an ADU, and they want to do an urban lot split. If they create it with the ADU by itself, couldn't be allowed. The ADU would have to be converted. To a main residence. Because you can't have an accessory residence by itself. The ADU would have to be converted to a main residence, which means paying the impact fees for a main residence, because they didn't pay any impact fees for, or they paid reduced or no impact fees for an ADU. And they would have to comply with parking. That would convert the accessory dwelling to a main dwelling. After that, they could add another detached ADU, or they could add a junior within that. That's just one nuance that I'm trying to point out, because it gets a little tricky here. And then the other feature about urban lot splits is we can't ask for any funding in prior improvements. So that means no curb gutter or sidewalk. The tree protection provisions remain in place. But it's pretty handy for a property owner. They essentially need to just prepare a VAP, submit it, and we get it approved. Which saves them a lot of time. And money for the improvements that are normally required of all normal subdivisions, or standard subdivisions. The other feature about urban lot splits, or the minimum lot size is 1,200 square feet. Of which, if you're dividing, you need to have a minimum of 40% of one of the lots. So 40, the other part is 60. And then we have to allow pretty much anything. As long as we have to allow them to be in the same area. And to be able to subdivide a minimum of an 800 square foot residence. So that means you can put, there is no minimum lot size. Well, the minimum lot size is 1,200. But we have to allow them to configure that lot in a way that allows a developable area for 800 square feet. Those are our obligations for state law. So is the place that's 400 square feet pretty consistent? Or something? This is all you're going to build? Or is this just a construction? Well, if you have, if you're, we have to allow them to be able to build 800 square feet on the, if there's. That's going to be less. Yes. No. The minimum lot size is 1,200 square feet. But in configuring, so it's going to have to be at least 1,200 square feet. But we have to make sure that there's enough area, remaining area on the site. Where they can situate an 800 square foot house. Up to 800 square feet. A minimum of 800. A minimum of 800. Right. They have to have 800 square feet too. Right. But to clarify, theoretically, a person could build a smaller house, right, if they chose. But the city has to allow them to be able to build at least one. Yeah. We have to allow that. Anybody can come in and do this. But we have to make sure that they have to be allowed. We have to be able to allow them to build a smaller house. We have to approve it. And it has to be able to, we have to be able to approve an 800 square foot building pad on the lot they're creating. Cool. So. And I ask, there's just a lot of these 400, 500 square foot side units. Are those going to be eligible? Those are automatically, yeah, those can come in. Those are legal non-conforming. Those can come in. I'm talking about when you're creating. Building. Yes. Yeah. And, yeah. Oh. I still think there might be some confusion and I'm just curious to get it clear. I think maybe the point of this section of the law is to make sure that a city doesn't put a bunch of other restrictions like setbacks that make it actually impossible to build a house on a lot. So we're making it, if I'm correct, so that people could theoretically build an 800 square foot residence on each lot in the split. That's right. But someone could still build their tiny or, you know, small flat. Yeah. And they could build a 400 square foot house if they chose, right? Yes. And I'll even add to that. If you've got existing residences, you're allowed to, if they've got substandard setbacks, they can build to the same substandard setback. If they're on the other lot and you're creating, you can build, there are no setbacks. There's a minimum of four foot setback, which is pretty small, but you're able to build, if you've got the same situation on the other lot and you're creating, you're allowed to build. Say you've got, you created a lot, an existing house with a substandard setback and you're creating another one, you're allowed to do the same substandard setback with a new one. Can you give an example of a substandard setback? It's three feet, two feet. Okay. Yeah. So it's just not familiar with the term. Yeah. It could be, you've got a lot of houses built right on the property lines. Garages, garages are a great example. Alley loaded garages are almost. Always tucked in the corner right on the rear and the side property line. Those are like ADUs had to be converted with substandard setbacks. We have to allow those too, but that's getting into a whole other thing about ADUs, but it's the same concept here where you're allowed to do substandard setbacks with the existing residences that you're creating with the normal lot split or if you do a two family housing unit. Thanks Bruce. Yeah. It's. It helps in a way in a way helps in a way helps in a way helps in a way helps in a way helps in a way helps in a way helps in a way helps in a way helps in a way helps in a way helps in a way helps in a way helps in a way helps in a way helps in a way helps in a way helps in a way helps in a way helps in a way helps in a way helps in a way helps in a way helps in a way helps in a way helps in a way helps in a way helps in a way helps in a way helps in a way helps in a way helps in a way helps in a way helps in a way helps in a way triplexes, fourplexes in here of some of these existing neighborhoods. They don't look that different. If you look at some of our old neighborhoods, those already have the same kind of development in there. And so this is what all these, what we're after, what the state's after, we're all trying to get at is this missing middle housing. We're trying to densify all these neighborhoods. You know, a lot of people in the early days, they called it the elimination of single-family residence zoning, which it kind of is. ADUs was the first step in that direction. Now this is taking the more assertive step to densify neighborhoods, allowing duplexes. And so, right, like I said before, we're at standard R1 lot now. You can have up to four units, whereas before it was just one and with ADUs. The second component of these amendments is just general code cleanup. I've identified the major areas. It's in your staff report. Minor changes for definition noticing. Fencing consistency. We had mentioned that electric fencing only permitted commercial industrial areas. It's prohibited in residential areas. That's something we had included in the code. Minor changes in corrections that we just classified as zoning cleanup. It's addressed more thoroughly in your staff report. I'm not going to get into a whole lot of detail unless you have any specific questions. Then the last piece of this is the code amendment for the card rooms. This gives you a brief history back in September 2020. The council voted to agendize a discussion of allowing card rooms in the downtown area in the downtown north zone. And then in June of 2021, the internal they referred it to the Internal Affairs Committee originally. And then in June 2021, the Internal Affairs Committee, met and discussed this and then came to the conclusion that they'd recommend the discussion to the full council. And then in January 4th of 2022, council considered the recommendation from the Internal Affairs Committee, which was to proceed with the code amendment. They voted 7-0 to direct Mr. Scott, the applicant for these code amendments to pursue a code amendment. And then right now, that's what we're following up with with the code amendment. It's a simple, if you can see below on table 4.6, all we are doing with this amendment is adding a UP under downtown north. So that's the simple part of it. It's a lot of action. That's the amount of effort that goes into a code amendment, though. One thing I'd like to repeat or clarify, on the second to last page of your text amendment, Exhibit 1, we have a qualifier that we're adding. The beginning of the sentence begins with a substandard A. I apologize, your exhibit, it doesn't have page numbers. So it's the second to the last page of the strikeout and underlined code section. It's red in mine. It should be red in yours. The sentence begins with a sub A. It begins with a requirement. The requirement for an owner occupancy is defined in section 19.04.020. That's the beginning of that sentence on the top of that second to last page. We're adding a qualifier that just says when the proposal involves a JADU. So we needed to add that in because we're actually not allowed to require the owner occupancy for a two-unit conversion. We are required to, for one, for a junior ADU. That concludes my presentation. Our recommendation is to consider the zoning ordinance amendments regarding state housing laws, general code cleanups, and the code amendment for card rooms to allow card rooms with a use permit in the downtown zoning district to direct any questions to staff and provide comments, hold a public hearing, and then adopt resolution. Thank you. Next is Dr. Crum. Dr Crum is in charge of the board's board board board board board yeah do we have a map uh downtown yeah i looked at it it's it's sixth or seventh i'm almost positive at six and south goes all the way down park though right i mean yeah north goes from six to fifth to fourth right south goes seventh how far south all the way down to maybe that's um i'm not sure anyway that's right i think it goes i think it goes to night night to the river or maybe because i nantucket is the dividing nantuck it's the first one in the downtown south yeah okay they're on sixth okay perfect i had a question on the c the conditional use permit is that required in the other zoning districts for the card room yes okay yeah if you look on that exhibit let me show you on you can see it's in the cc downtown north downtown south commercial services and commercial a regional commercial so they're permitted in other places it just expands the areas where they're allowed for the approval use permit so what they're and um i might have been the only person in this room who was in the commission when this came maybe matt did you say were you here when this came before um but um so what this is specifically asking for is for us to change the code to allow this with a use permit but there's no application before us on a project madam chair we we do have an application that was submitted for a use permit assuming this is approved so we do have an application we're not we can't process it until the amendment goes through but we do have an application by the same person that initiated this amendment okay so there is a difference in Okay. Any other questions? I guess I need a little bit more clarification on, and I'm kind of trying to imagine if we did have a big crowd in the room, some confusion from the public. I'm not quite sure. The first two pieces of this are relatively cleaning up code and bringing us in compliance with state law, et cetera. And that seems pretty kind of, that makes sense that we would need to do that work. The card room being added in as sort of just as if all we're doing is kind of cleaning up existing code doesn't quite make sense to me. So I'm not, I need to understand a little bit better why that, why the third item is being treated almost like all we're doing really is making a change that we sort of need to be making. Any other questions? As opposed to something that seems like public input and some further discussion separate from these other two items might be merited. I understand your concern, but if you look at the history that's up here, this was discussed at the council level, originally agendized. And then they said that they could turn it off right then, but they decided to pursue it further. And they said, well, let's refer it to the Internal Affairs Committee. They can do it. Let's do a deeper dive. So what you've got is the council saying they're okay initiating this code amendment. And that's how it went around. And so it went to the Internal Affairs Committee. The Internal Affairs Committee recommended it to the full council. And the full council voted unanimously to allow them to proceed with the code amendment. And they're doing what the council told them to do or told them they were allowed to do. And so that's kind of the direction that we're under, too. We procedurally just included it because in terms of the amount of the amendment, it just put a UP under the category DS, downtown south zone. That was the extent of the change. And we thought it'd be easier to just group all of these in there. The other two are public amendments. This one's a private amendment. That's correct. Thank you. So what would happen theoretically if the commission voted? Not to amend that. Sure. Would it go back up the chain? It's an interesting question. I'll have to ask Vince on that. But one, if you like, you can separate these and vote on them separately. If somebody has a problem with one of these, we can take one in three different pieces. That was going to be my suggestion. I was hoping we could do that tonight. Sure. And this is just. I don't know what. I mean, I think I know what a card room is, but can you provide some clarity of some other locations we have these? Well, you know, we have one on 20th and Park. Okay. And then I believe there's one. That's what I heard. I haven't been there, but I haven't been to the other one either. But it's legalized card gambling. I haven't been to either one of them. I know what it is. I would. It's easy, though. I love it. I'm busy. I'm busy. Any other questions before we open public hearing? One moment. Okay. Thanks, Bruce. Nicole, do we have any speaker cards? Thank you. Anybody wish to speak on this? Okay. So I will close the public hearing. I think with the discussion with the commission, it would be great. I think. I think if we could take them one by one, perhaps. Does that work? But we don't have sample motions to do that one by one. So we'll have to. We can get there. Yeah. Okay. Does anybody want to tackle that right now? Madam Chair. Yes. If you wanted to, you could. You could just. You could say consider the zoning and subordinates amendments concerning housing laws SB 9 and general code cleanup if you wanted. So you could just strike out different pieces of that as a motion. Okay. Are you okay if I tackle the motion? Sure. I usually don't. Okay. So I move that the planning commission adopt the zoning. And subdivision ordinance amendments regarding state housing laws SB 9. And I'll end it there. I'll second that. Okay. Any discussion? I have just kind of one general comment. And I know these are we're increasing our housing stock and getting that density, which we greatly need. I'm wondering if the end, this is not really in our purview, but I would love to see the city of Chico, because I imagine that there's a lot of communities and municipalities that are dealing with this of what the impact would be of the loss of those development impact fees. And just having some sense from us. You know, we already don't have wonderful streets. We don't have wonderful sidewalks. And then adding this on top of that, you know, looking at being proactive about what is that deficit probably going to be in the next five to 10 years? And what do we need to do as a city to fill that deficit? That is a very common concern among a number of cities, especially with ADUs too, because those don't pay impact fees. They reduce impact fees. And there is a lot of energy on behalf of several cities. And so I'm one of these days it's going to get traction. There's a concern that's shared by quite a few communities. Okay. So we have a motion by Chair Scott and a second by Commissioner Cooper to adopt the zoning and subdivision ordinance amendments regarding state housing laws SB 9. All in favor signify by saying aye. Aye. Any opposed? Great. So that motion carries 7-0. And let's move to the application for Title 19 code amendment. Okay. For the card room. No. We're doing this. Code cleanups. Yeah, this is the code cleanups. Second. Right? Yes. Oh, yeah. Okay. Do you want to do the code cleanups and then the card room? Yeah. Okay. Does anybody want to take that motion? I'll make a motion through the Planning Commission. Recommended the plan. I had it in a minute. I had the Planning Commission approve the general code cleanups. Great. We have a motion from Commissioner Walz. Is there a second? I'll second that. And a second from Commissioner Cooper. Any discussion? All in favor signify by saying aye. Aye. Aye. Any opposed? So that motion carries 7-0. Now we're on to the application for the Title 19 code amendment. I'll move the Planning Commission approve code amendment 22-01 to allow card room use in the downtown north zoning district. I'll second. Do we have a motion and a second? Do we have any discussion? I'll second. I'll start. I agree with Vice Chair Ober. I think the city staff for the efficiency in putting this with these, but I would like to have seen perhaps a different public process with this as far as having, have it agendized on its own. There is a weight that I think that comes with saying that for the public. I don't see an adequate attention to the need from a land use perspective in the application that would urge me to support this. I have serious concerns about whether downtown north is the right location to allow for this. I think that the city has already allowed this by use permit because of parking and uses that are there. There are other places within the city of Chico that card rooms are allowed that I think are more adequate. And I appreciate Chair Scott's kind of leading through because I was struggling with how to describe my wanting to at least deal with this separately tonight. And I think that's stated really well and captures my desire for this to get a little bit more light, if you will. I know that this has been a contentious issue for a long time. And contentious may be a little bit too strong, but there have been challenges raised with this in the past. And so giving the opportunity for those, both the argument in favor of this, but also those who may have some concerns to have a chance to talk through that and address the commission seems to me like the right thing to do. And so I'm interested in what others have to say. But if that means perhaps moving to agendize this at a future meeting, that would be the direction we're tempted to go. In response to that, Richard, I'm like to ask staff, have you had any comments or questions from the public about it? Nobody's here to speak about it. And it was published in the newspaper, I think, on the 22nd or somewhere. We haven't received any public comments on any of the proposed ordinance amendments. Okay. I double-checked a little bit on this because I was like, Carver was bad, no good, right? And I found out sort of who is part of this. Their establishment that they currently have in Chico. And it's a very nice run business. Very classy. The people make a lot of money there. Part of this is to bring people back to downtown after it sort of fizzled a little bit later after COVID and everything. So part of this is to bring some life back. But it is a good person, good organization that they do have an establishment currently in Chico. And so that's, I didn't feel, but I think it's a good organization. I do like to see life come back to Chico. It's a down town because it didn't sort of fizzle. And it does, it would be maybe a nice pickup and bring some more people down that are going to use now a restaurant. Maybe go buy something to do some things. I don't see people throwing dice out in front of it, which was my concern, you know, or smoking cigarettes or whatever. So I would lean towards it because of the person who is running that and the person is a Chico person. And it is, they do have a facility in the center. And that was just my question. So, and this is where I think the clarification on what we're actually doing tonight is, is we don't, the city has an application in front of them. We do not have an application in front of us. What we have is, do we want card rooms in downtown North? Is that an appropriate location for this type of land use? And I don't think it is. That's my question. Is it just for the city? Is there one? Is there a limit? Or is it say we could have 20 and that is a concern to me too? I don't know. Yeah, I think, what's the limit? There's a moratorium on any new licenses. So I believe three is the total limit. For any area in Chico? For any card rooms in Chico, it would be a total of three. I believe that's in Title V. And to clarify all of what Chair Scott said is valid. This would just be adding the use permit possibility. So this would come back to you and you'd have to meet all the use permit findings. You could evaluate parking, site-specific standards at that time as well. And I think that's... And that would get notice to all properties within 500 feet of the specified location, which we don't have at this time. So that would probably engage more community members on that topic specifically. Sorry to interrupt. I'm sorry. I'm talking a lot. I just feel really strongly on this one. Go ahead. I want to hear your strong feelings. But I appreciate the sensitivity to or the appreciation of a particular project that may be coming or it sounds like probably will be coming before us. But what we're actually being asked to do tonight is change zoning, which is not specific to any particular project. The restriction right now on numbers, I appreciate that clarification. But really what we're... It feels to me like we have this historic kind of request that is coming back before us again, before the Commission again. And that's triggering... That particular request is triggering a bigger decision, which is a change of what's allowable in downtown North. And so that's why to me, again, not in any way of comment on this particular, what may be eventually be a particular project, but just on that big of a change, allowing that potential feels to me like public needs to be made aware of that. And I appreciate the comment that we didn't get any public input on tonight's agenda. But that in fact, it's possible that that's because this particular project or this particular item was just a part of a bunch of stuff that looked very routine and just a normal course of business. When in fact, it feels to me like it lines a little, just a little bit outside of that and is worthy of its own focus. What was the Council... How many years ago did this go before the Council and the Internal Affairs? And this was a big discussion item, I believe in 2014. And there was a decision of the Council at that point. There was some similar... There were some similar opinions that this wasn't a need from a land use perspective in the downtown north zone district specifically. So that sat with that being the decision for five, six years. And then the topic was raised again and brought to the Council, which started this new wave of discussion. There seemed to be less opposition at that Council. Yeah. So it was... It went to the Council originally. I mean, most recently. And then it was... It was in September of 2020. Okay. And then it was... At that meeting, it was referred to the Internal Affairs Committee. The Internal Affairs Committee convened in July... In June of 2021. And they heard it out some more and got into it. And then they came to a conclusion and they recommended to the full Council that they go forward with it. And then on January... In January of 2022, the Council directed that the applicant go ahead and submit the application. So that's their indication that they're okay with the amendment. I can also add... Is it... Or is it to follow the process that should be followed, which is to come to the Planning Commission and ask for an amendment? That's true. But I can add this. Whether you recommend approval or denial, it's still going to go to the Council. So they're going to get it... Everything on our agenda these days does that, so... But that answers the question. Because this can be appealed to the Council or no? It goes... It's going to go with this package of amendments. And your vote will... Your recommendation will go with them. And your concerns will be relayed. But then it's still going to be... They'll conduct a hearing. And they'll do the same thing we did. And they can vote to approve... Right. Okay. That was going to be my question. And we've already seen what happened with the hotel and... Anyway, separate story. But the other issue I have is... Has to do with... Because I had a business downtown for 20 plus years. And this is the downtown north and downtown south. I mean, Nantucket is on the corner. The southeast corner of 6th. And if I want to put a card room in the muffler shop across the street, I mean, I can't do it. But I can do it in Nantucket. You know, I just... We're talking... There's the width of a street. You have to get a use permit to do that, though. Pardon? You would have to get a use permit to do that. Right. But I'm just saying... And Nantucket could appeal the outcome of that to the Council. And that's why I feel... There's plenty of safeguards. I feel that it should be a use permit... It should be allowed in either district. That's the point. What we're doing today... Well, tonight it's just making it possible to submit a request for a use permit. And that's why I seconded the motion. And I think that's what... This goes back to... Matt, correct me if I'm wrong. It's about 05 or 06. Right. We went through a flurry of the card room issue downtown here in the north district. And it kind of died at... Yeah, I think it dates back that far because when they consider the land use in the downtown and kind of split them into downtown north and downtown south... The character of downtown north was... It was pretty well developed in... To be fully developed or something into what it is now. Downtown south was still a large mix of use. And one of the main differences between north and south had to do with south having automotive related businesses. And like the muffler shop, that's non-conforming existing use. We had Smythe tire and it was a factor when we... When Mark Abizade expanded Chico Volkswagen in the fact that that was an auto-oriented use, land use, and it was in the downtown south. So from a historic standpoint, they were... There was a difference in their mind between the north and the south on existing uses or potential uses in the future. Is that the way you remember it, Tony? Yeah, that's exactly it. I think on this one from... This is the last thing I'll say. From a land use perspective, we're looking at is this the right place where we would want to require... Where we would allow this use with a use permit. And we allow it in downtown south. We allow it in so many other places. There's ample opportunity. There's ample opportunity to do that. I think we have to go to a worst case scenario of if there are three allowed in the city of Chico and the other two go under, let's just say, do we now have the ability for three to be in downtown north? Those are the type of things when we're making... When we're changing a land use, not looking at an applicant, but when we're changing a land use, we have to consider. Okay. Can all three... Yeah, can all three be in one... Yeah, I don't think there's any prohibition. They can be... I think it's city wide. Think it would be... You can have three retailers next to each other and three restaurants next to each other because they're allowed in that... In that use. In that use. It would probably make it more difficult to make the findings for each subsequent use permit that there's a mix and distribution of uses and other general plan policies to that effect. And I think it's... I'll say again and try not to repeat myself that it's exactly this conversation and the conversation about Nantucket and the muffler shop and if two go under and maybe all three could possibly be... That's the kind of conversation that I feel like the public needs to have access to and weigh in on. So that if tomorrow it's reported that now it's the planning commission or when the council... The council just sort of decided... I can imagine a lot of people being disappointed that they weren't given the opportunity to weigh in on the topic. So we might end up at the same place that my sense is that at least a couple of you would like us to be and that's fine. If that's where we end up being after a public hearing, okay. But my point is just I don't feel that this momentous of a decision based largely on what Tony is describing as potential scenarios as well as the fact that we're not going to deal with this in a way that is in fact in a way that is in fact in a way that is in fact in a way that is in fact in a way that is in fact in a way that is in fact in a way that is in fact in a way that is in fact in a way that is in fact in a way that is in a way that is in fact in a way that is in fact in a way that is in fact in a way that is in fact in a way that is in fact in a way that is in fact in a way that is in fact in a way that is in fact in a way that is in fact in a way that is in fact in a way that is in I mean, it's just like anything else. You know, your restaurants, your bars, your gas stations, your pot shops, whatever. You know, you can't what if. All the opportunities are all possible combinations of things. And it sounds like they've had ample time. It went before council not once, but possibly two or three times in years past. And to that point, we do have multiple bars in downtown. I don't know how a card room use would be any worse. I have some thoughts to share on this that I've been waiting to share. I would really like to know more about the land use implications of a card room, like examples of such. Because I'm really not too familiar with the concept. I don't know how many people that would bring in. I don't know what that even looks like. Other than the Casino 99, which to me looks like a strip mall with a huge parking lot. And I know that's probably not every card room. But that gives me the impression that that doesn't align in my mind with our uses downtown. Our downtown is lively. It's full of restaurants and bars and boutiques and people walking around, biking. And I would like to know if my perception is wrong on what a card room looks like and how it fits in for land use. So that's one thought of mine. I would like to see more info. I do actually feel, you know, we've given the public notice. They can show up and speak on this if they want. They'll also have an opportunity at City Council. I'm not personally concerned with that aspect. But I do think that this might be a little bigger of an issue than something to approve with these other items. I hardly saw it when I looked through the agenda packet. And that's, of course, my issue. But in general, I like it. I like allowing more uses. I like allowing people more choices if they want to pursue that use permit. But I also wouldn't want to open that up for somebody to pay a bunch of money to apply for a use permit that then we decide is not something we want to approve. So I'm very conflicted, is my summary. Does it help you out with, I don't know, with the patenaries? No, I don't. With the patenaries? Yeah. It looks exactly the same as the patenaries of a restaurant or the red book and bar. They're a little more like a barbecue place. So they just didn't really change. But the one over next to the crackers is really nice. Yeah, years ago, we had a card room. I think it may be 15th and Park. There's that shopping center. What's the burger? Angie's. Yeah, Angie's card room. And they wanted to move across the street. There's a little old house there. And the concern we had at that point in time was the little old house didn't have any parking. So. there could be a potential for a lot of people parking in the parking lot and then they would at night possibly cross mid-block and it kind of had a safety problem anyway that one kind of fell by the wayside it'll be really interesting um if this were to like come back in the future to see a study of like parking uh needs at other card rooms in similar situations because that would be a very real concern downtown could be any further discussion we do have a motion on the floor i just it would be i mean isn't there limited limits of how many alcohol licenses can be within first street to eighth street or something so this is that a true thing i don't know i've always heard this i think so i mean that would be something too we could look forward to saying maybe just one in this i just want a clarification did commissioner there maybe second this motion okay chair scott can i just clarify the motion can we repeat that uh yes so we had a motion from commissioner wall to um approve the uh i think he actually said the application number so it's 22 dash zero one i believe um it's kind of cut off on ours but the um um card room amendment and then that was seconded by commissioner daramidi thank you i have a question related to commissioner cooper's question would we be able to limit the number per downtown north i i think that topic is addressed in another area of the municipal code um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um is. And that's, we are planning commission deals in Title 19 and Title 18 zoning and subdivision. If we approve this whole packet of stuff, it just gets shot right up in the council and the council will make the decision either now or later. Yeah, but you're a principal guy, Larry, so you know why some of us might not be okay with that. Well, would you be open to a friendly amendment? Say it. I don't want to read, do I have to repeat the whole recommendation? But basically Mr. Wall's recommendation, but with the caveat that if we can put a limit on the number of card rooms in the north downtown corridor, then that would be our recommendation to council. What would the limit be? Well, if three are allowed, so one. Well, that's all this would provide for anyway, because there's already two in operation. But they're saying if the two went out of business, then they all... How many what-ifs can you play? Well, that's our job. From a planning perspective. Well, that's true. I mean, there's not a lot of locations that a card room could go in the north part of downtown. I mean, you'll be limited to the size. Can I add to this? What Kelly mentioned earlier is that we would be a little concerned about the over-concentration. We would have to get through the barrier of the use permit findings themselves for each one of those and find that there was not an over-concentration and that it's not impacting. I think we'd have a problem. If we started to pack them in any kind of business that was kind of in this sensitive range here. Then I'll remove my friendly amendment. Now let's just go with what we got and see what comes out. Yeah, let's do that. Sounds good, Larry. So all in favor of the motion to approve. Let's see. Cardroom Amendment CA 22-01. Let's do a... Go down the line just so I can have it. Say aye. Aye. Any opposed? No. No. So that carries 5-2. I would like to make one more comment. And I usually do not do this, but I will say. especially compared to the other applications that we saw today. The professionalism of this application, I'm highly disappointed in, and I'm disappointed that there was no applicant here to speak on this item, and I think that goes to just a respect for the Planning Commission when we're making these decisions. So, that's it. Anything else that you have for us, Bruce? Nope. Madam Chair, we're recommending cancel the next meeting. You're following the next meeting will be December 1st. We're going to need to cancel the 17th. I think we sent out an email earlier. And will the first meeting be Valley's Edge? Yes, it will. Okay. So, could we really quickly... is everybody going to be here for that first meeting in December? Yes. Okay. Sounds good. Thank you. We've always been... Yeah. Oh, I love that. That's a good... Good job. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
