 Check, check.  I mean, they're in.  Nothing's on.  All right, good evening.  I will call the regular planning commission meeting of Thursday, August 18th to order,  and we will begin with the pledge.  Salute and pledge.  I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America  and to the republic for which it stands,  one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.  And roll call, please, Nicole.  Commissioner Wall.  Here.  Commissioner Poulin is absent.  Commissioner Goldstein is absent.  Commissioner Dermede.  Present.  Commissioner Cooper.  Here.  Vice Chair Ober.  Here.  Vice Chair Scott.  Present.  Thank you.  Item number two is the consent agenda.  Do we have a motion to approve?  So moved.  Thank you.  And a second?  So we have a motion from Vice Chair Ober and a second from Commissioner Dermede.  All in favor signify by saying aye.  Aye.  Any opposed?  So that motion carries 5-0 with two absent.  Item three, business from the floor.  Members of the board.  Members of the public may address the commission at this time on any matter not already listed  on the agenda with comments being limited to three minutes.  The commission cannot take any action at this meeting on requests made under this section  of the agenda.  Do we have any business from the floor?  Wonderful.  We will move to item four, public hearings.  We have none, but we have item five, regular.  Agenda item 5.1.  And Bruce, I will turn this over to you.  Thank you.  Excuse me.  Excuse me.  Thank you.  This project was denied by your planning commission on July 21st, your last meeting.  At the request of the city attorney,  we are bringing,  we are bringing a resolution back that conforms to your denial to complete the record of proceedings  that has been attached to your staff report.  So the only issue right now tonight is whether or not you believe that resolution that we have drafted  to represent your denial at your last meeting is accurate.  And if there's any fine-tuning or revisions to that resolution,  now is the time to do them.  But they really should reflect what you've already done.  It's,  it's your past meeting,  nothing new.  It's just what you've left,  what you last did and make sure that's accurate.  Um,  other than that,  we're recommending that once you are okay with that resolution,  we adopted and,  um,  and then we,  we move on to the appeal.  This isn't a public hearing.  You could take public comments.  I understand,  but it's not a public hearing.  Okay.  If you have any questions,  I'd be happy to answer them.  Um,  if I could repeat back my understanding of what we're doing,  what we're doing tonight,  and then maybe if you could confirm that,  would that be okay?  Just so everybody can hear.  So the only thing we're doing is we're deliberating on attachment C,  um,  which is,  uh,  the resolution that would,  um,  reflect the planning commission's denial of the project that it's July 21st meeting.  So we're not,  I can take public comment,  but I'm taking public comment only on attachment C,  not on the merits of the project.  That's correct.  Okay.  Any questions the commission has?  Sorry.  Just a procedural question.  What would be the next line if one of the members decided to change his or her vote?  I don't think that's an option because we've already taken action on this.  This is just reflecting what the action that you've already taken.  Um,  in case the city attorney has anything else they'd like to add,  that would be my,  my take on it.  Um,  because we've already had the hearing,  we've already acted on the project.  This is just a resolution.  Well,  we've had the hearing and we,  we've had a resolution and now we're back to do a second bite at the resolution.  I'm not sure I understand.  In fact,  I'm very sure I don't understand why that is a necessary part of the procedure.  The,  the first resolution that you had in your staff report was for approval.  And,  and we hadn't drafted that yet.  So the only resolution we had at the first hearing was for,  was for approval.  That's why we're coming back because that wasn't what the recommendation was originally.  The city attorney has suggested that we come back to perfect the action based on your most recent denial work to more accurately reflect those actions that occurred at church denial on the meeting of the 21st.  Bruce,  could I jump in with what I think?  Might be some clarification.  Um,  so for the applicant to be able to appeal our decision,  it's my understanding that they would need,  some language to protest and we don't have that language in the absence of this resolution.  So they would need to have this to go line by line to say,  this is how the resolution doesn't match up with what they believe.  We don't have that.  Okay.  Thank you.  Is that right?  Yes.  Okay.  Any other questions?  Okay.  Um,  I'm going to do something very rare in my tenure here.  And because we are only looking at attachment C,  I'd like to suggest that we limit public comment to one minute.  How does the commission feel about that?  Okay.  Can we do that?  Nicole?  Okay.  So,  um,  if anybody has any comment on attachment C,  really what we're looking for here is any typos you see,  uh,  anything that doesn't conform with,  uh,  what you felt that the meeting was,  feel free to come up.  Do we have the speaker cards?  We have two.  Okay.  Who's the first one?  Is it Mr.  Wolf? Mark?  Mark Wolf.  And then Jessica Ginola.  Okay.  Great.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I'm Mark Wolf with North Star representing the applicant.  We very respectfully disagree with the findings that are provided in the proposed resolution.  And we continue to support the recommendation that was provided to this commission on July 21st by your professional planning staff.  Um,  while we are, of course,  not happy,  uh,  with the denial of our proposal,  we thank the commission and the staff for their time and their attention to this project.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Uh,  Jessica.  Hi,  commission.  I just wanted to say that I am,  I,  I approve the,  the,  um,  last decision made last time.  And I'm happy to say that I am,  and I,  and I,  I,  um,  hope that,  that it moves forward as is because it seems to reflect the voices of the community.  And,  um,  and that's all.  Thank you.  Okay.  And we'll take that last one.  Mr. Carter.  Welcome.  Good evening, all.  I will be brief.  I represent the California Park Homeowners Association.  We have,  uh,  reviewed,  uh,  the,  uh,  proposed resolution and we agree completely that the,  uh,  staff and recommend that the resolution be approved. Thank you. Thank you. Any further  public comment on attachment C? Okay, with that, I will close the public hearing and bring it back  to the commission. We do have a proposed motion.  Do we?  I think somebody could come up with one. I think I can crack one. Okay, sounds good.  I move adoption of resolution number 22-04, and I'll just read the title. Resolution of the City  of Chico Planning Commission denying use permission 19-25 and architectural review  item 19-22 for a new hotel south of Sierra Sunrise Terrace and northeast of the intersection of Deer  Creek Highway, statewide 32, and Bruce Road. Great.  It's a motion.  Second.  Awesome. So we have a motion and a second to adopt resolution number 22-04, denying use  permit 19-25 and architectural review 19-22 for a new hotel south of Sierra Sunrise Terrace  and northeast of the intersection of Deer Creek Highway and Bruce Road, just in case  you need an APN number 018-230001. Any discussion?  If I can just offer a comment. I think as a lot of people were, there was some confusion about exactly what this procedure was and what triggered it.  And so I reached out to city staff, the clerk's office, as well as the city attorney's office, just to get clarification.  And I'll just summarize that I really appreciate, Bruce, the way you described why we're here and what we can and cannot do here.  It took me a while to understand that, but I think your explanation was quite clear.  And I appreciate that you were able to clarify that for me.  Great. Any other comments?  All righty. So I'll call for the vote. All in favor of the motion on the table, signify by saying aye.  Aye.  All opposed?  No.  No. Did you vote?  You just jumped ahead.  You're an aye.  Okay. Thank you.  So that motion carries 3-2, with 2 absent.  Could I make one clarification?  Yes.  Just you noted that you closed the public hearing, but it wasn't a public hearing.  It was just a public comment.  I don't want anyone to leave thinking that this was a public hearing, but it wasn't like the official public hearing.  Yes. Words very much matter.  They stopped taking public comment.  There was no public hearing.  Thank you.  All righty.  So with that, we will move to reports and communications.  Bruce, do you have anything more for us?  Nothing, Madam Chair.  Okay. And are we planning to have a meeting on Thursday, September 1st?  No, we're not.  We're recommending cancel that.  Tony, do you want to say something?  Oh, yes.  I guess I'd like to say something in terms of communication or whatever.  It regards the letter, July 29th, Mr. Stevens' approval letter to Debbie Presson.  Just as a matter of, I want this in the public record, that I feel this letter was both demeaning to the Commission and obsequious in its tone to the city staff.  I felt offended.  My understanding, one of our roles as commissioners is to represent all the citizens.  Of Chico, his first line in the second paragraph made it sound like it was strictly an emotional decision.  It was not on my part, and I'm sure it was not on any of the other commissioners.  I know a number of us spent hours up there reviewing various things.  Item A of Resolution 2204 talks about the findings that the, were, you know,  the welfare, the health, the well-being.  And I think this goes directly to what we were dealing with here.  This is, it wasn't a black and white decision, and I hope that people understand that, including the applicant.  Secondly, I don't disagree with his sentiment about the skilled experience and uniquely qualified planning department and people in it.  You guys do a fabulous job.  But the tone of that in reference to items above in the paragraph just struck me wrong.  And once again, I personally felt it was inappropriate.  Anyway, so with that being said, thank you.  Thank you.  Anything else?  No?  Okay.  With that, we will adjourn to a later meeting.  Thank you.  Thank you.  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.
