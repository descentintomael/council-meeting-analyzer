And yet you're bringing this before us when you've already broken the rules. The MOU says 830th. What date is this? Anybody here read? No, of course not. Because you're going to scam the system again. You're going to find a way around it and you're going to break the rules again. Just like you've done before. The other thing that goes on in this budget, did you look at the grand jury report talking about Oracle? Did any of you read that? Did you read the BINTF report on that same page? The grand jury. Okay, it's submitted there to the grand jury. Did you look at that? Probably not. The reality is one person holding two jobs that are in conflict, no go. And that's what the grand jury said. And if you look again, and I threw it out here before, Dean, you refuse to look at it, you'll refuse again. I know that. You're such honest people. California Government Code, Section 1099. California Government Code. Read it. And tell me that there's no conflict between the city council person writing the budget for the BINTF, the reason he can't participate tonight, because he wrote that budget. Did you read that? You're not telling the people out here that, are you? Of course not. Why be honest when you can be seen? He was our last speaker. All right, entertain a motion. Just a second. We have a motion from Council Member Morgan, a second from Council Member Tien. You okay with that? All right. I'm going to hear your side. Yeah. I got it. I got both on both sides. All right.

Moving on to business from the floor, members of the public may address the Council at this time on any matter not already listed on the agenda. The Council cannot take any action at this meeting on requests made under this section of the agenda. How many speakers? We have six, actually. And my screen is frozen. So let me just see if I can get it to stop. All right. Let's do 3. Okay. On your own. I'm going to have to time it separately. So if you can go ahead and time them because I can't get it to unfreeze. So our first speaker is James Hutchinson followed by Paula Hare. And if you could please go ahead and stand in the center aisle when I call your name. And I'll let you know when you get close to 2 minutes and 30 seconds. Go back to the first. I want to see Senator Kessler speak. Go ahead. I'm sorry. What? It's Marjorie. No, I said no. The cards are taken and the order received, sir. That's fine. I just said no. He nodded his head no. That's fine. Okay. I visited Murphy Commons this last couple of weeks because of all the construction that is going around there and because I've met people over the years there. They live not far from me. I've talked to those people. They are very, very upset. Except most of them are low-income people who don't want to appear here for fear of repercussions. There would be retaliations. Let's talk about what's happening at Murphy Commons if you don't know. A week ago, last Monday, one of the residents there, several residents reported a similar experience, went out her door to go down the sidewalk to go down and catch her bus to work. She had to walk down the street a ways. When she walks out, there's a lot of people. There's a sign there saying, sidewalk closed. You have to go around. You have to cross over to Marsh Junior High. You have to go down and cross over. Okay. She's sitting there. She's late for work as it is. She's getting close to being late for work as it is. So she says to heck with it. She walks straight through the construction project. They're all pissed at her. She's like, I've got to get to work. It's a Monday. Okay. That's not the only thing that's going on there. You talk about quality of life. Here's what happened today. Between the hours of 8 and 2 to 3, PG&E cut off the power to Murphy Commons. These are people with kids. All right? They've got no power, no entertainment, no electronic babysitter that other people use. They can't play their games, a lot of other stuff. As it is, they're all upset because these two complexes that you should be very much familiar with that you're growing on either side of, both low income, multiple income, multi-unit complexes, these people are putting up with the noise all day long. These people, there's people that have to stay home. There's people that work nights. There's people who work swing shifts. And they're putting up with this noise constantly. And it's going to be going on because some of them are two-stage, one of them is a two-stage development. And they're going to be putting up with this noise. They don't get to go in the normal circumstances. Okay? They're sitting there with a bike path. They're sitting there with a bike path. It's been run right up against their walls. Before it went around with the senior citizen areas going in, part of that was the bike path. It moved the bikes a little bit away from them. Now it goes right up their walls. And they're getting ripped off right and left. Patio furniture. These are poor people. A lot of them are Section 8 or low income qualified renters. Okay? And they're getting their stuff ripped off. And they're afraid to call the police. Again, they're afraid of retaliation. These are not like you. They don't have much. When patio furniture gets ripped off, they can't replace it. They don't have insurance. They've gone to their manager and said, there's a way to put a fence around it. Put a fence around all this other construction. Sir, your time is up. Thank you. Sorry, I didn't have anything to golden off here. So it kind of makes it hard for me to address this problem. I apologize for that. Paula Hare. Paula Hare, followed by Robin Engle. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's done. It's done. It's done. It's done. It's done. It's done. It's done. It's done. It's done. It's done. It's done. It's done. It's done. It's done. It's done. It's done. It's done. It's done. It's done. It's done. It's done. of solid tents now. Where'd it come from? I've seen buses, yellow buses. I've seen white buses. Huge tents on top, filled with people. Where'd it come from? You people say, oh, well, these are homeless people from here. I say, no, they're not. A lot of them aren't. Come from someplace else. Somebody's bringing them here, deliberately. When's that going to be really looked at and a solution for it? Which I doubt there is one. And yeah, you got downtown. I come through here in the morning to go over to the VA to see my doctors. And I see all the trash cans, the big brick ones, out in the middle of the street, tipped upside down. I don't see just one or two. It's three. It's four. It's five. Why cut it? Just about every can in town. Why don't we have a police officer downtown at night? We now seem to have no anything going on downtown at night to stop any of this vandalism. No police officers. What happened to taxpayers' money to pay for somebody to be downtown at night? You need to think about it. You need to think about this. It's serious stuff. You got people out here feeding people right now, hot meals and stuff, and they do it all the time. No licenses, no nothing like that. Which is keeping these people downtown here, causing these problems. Instead of them going and getting some help, or you people getting them into some medical institution because they're too wacky in the head. Causing trouble. You know, I'm not going to say that. What do you want to do? You want to keep putting them in a jail cell? Jail cell isn't for mentally ill people. You already got a problem with that. You got one person being taken away. So, in Marryville. So, are you going to build some kind of hospital out here to put people in? Or are you going to get smart right now and build another camp like you have for the camp downtown? You're going to have to put these people in the pallet shelter. But you're going to need another one because you got four miles of tents. Thank you. Robin Engle followed by Katie Posey. Compassion isn't toxic. Compassion is the one ingredient that has grown and sustained the human species. And rule by force, on the contrary, is very unhealthy. It's destructive to a community. From first-hand accounts and from my understanding, and I don't have the exact numbers right now, but there are far too many open beds in the pallet shelter at the fairgrounds. Something like 50 or more, I believe. And also, though, from first-hand accounts, there is no standard. There's no standard. There's no standardized procedure for doing assessments. I've been a social worker for almost 30 years. Assessments need to include biological, psychological, social, cultural, and other functioning life skills, abilities, etc. And there's a lot more to assessments. They also need to be evidence-based. But from my understanding from people who have been interviewed for a pallet shelter space, they were asked their name and that was it. I have learned from two people who alleged that they were in the same building. And I have learned that because they're gay, they were denied. Which, if that's true, it's obviously illegal. So I hope that's not true. But it does seem to be the case that there is no standardized procedure for assessments. I haven't seen anyone trying to fill beds at the pallet shelter. And I'm wondering if that's because the city wants to simply jump to enforcement, which it's been anxious to do all along and has been doing all along. Down those lines, our police department takes over 50% of our general budget. That's extremely, extremely high. I haven't found a city through weeks or months of research, I haven't found a city that puts more money into its police department from its general budget than Chico does. We don't need elaborate training. We don't need a drone department or supply or a military tank. We also certainly don't need our citizens, eight or more who have been shot and killed by police by many rounds of bullets after they fell to their knees, after they died. Since 2017, Desmond Phillips' death in 2017, we've had at least eight more officer-involved shootings. Seven, Seven, Seven, Seven, Seven, Seven, Seven, Seven, Seven, Seven, Seven, Seven, Seven, Seven, Seven, Seven, Seven, Seven, Seven, Seven, Seven, Seven, Seven, Seven, Seven, if you would just listen. Thank you. Katie Posey, followed by Rob Berry. Good evening, Council. I have two topics to talk about. First, I'd like to bring up the proposed sales tax. This is echoing what some have said at past meetings, but we're all aware of the sales tax on the ballot for the fall. We also know that it's set up so that if it passes, it's the Council who decides where the revenue from that sales tax is spent. If we knew that the revenue was absolutely going to be spent on roads, for example, I might be more apt to vote yes on this. However, due to the fact that we don't know how the Council will spend that money, and it could go to pensions for all we know, it's difficult to justify voting for something like this, especially in light of the rising costs of living. I know that some Council members in the past have mentioned wanting the two-thirds majority for the sales tax increase, and in spite of the fact that you would need more voters, I believe more voters would have seen that as reasonable because... Because then they would know where the money was going to be spent. That's just my two cents if I have any left over after inflation. So moving on, you may or may not be aware that one of our county supervisors had mentioned holding a town hall at a meeting a few months ago, a town hall in the future. This was in relation to topics that those attending the meetings had been eager to voice their opinions about. This is a good idea, holding a town hall or some kind of public forum, and I would ask the Council to seriously consider this for those of us here in Chico. Some Council members are... Some Council members are planning to hold a copy with a Council member, which is wonderful, but I believe there is a need to do something like a town hall or forum with one or two Council members. This is something that could be positive for the relationship between residents of Chico and their Council members. A topic could be chosen. We don't have to look far to know that the topic of the shelters and enforcement might be something of interest to the people to speak more about and to hear Council members speak about. Three minutes at a Council meeting can be helpful, but it's not filling a very real need in our community. That is where something like a town hall or forum could be a solution. A town hall may seem like a scary idea for some, with angry citizens getting out of control and shouting, or people not knowing how to disagree respectfully or take their turns to speak. However, you can establish very clear and simple ground rules for everyone to follow with clear expectations. Failure to follow those rules means people won't be able to participate if it's preventing the town hall from moving forward. I wonder if you might consider something like this in September or October. Yes, we're aware we can voice our opinions and ideas through electronic or public comment or email, and we're aware we can't do that without the support of Council members, but this is not the same as a town hall or forum, as you know. I would urge you to push past the idea that the challenges to facilitating something like this are insurmountable, and consider that you hold the creativity and innovation to establish a structure for meeting this kind of need in the community. There's a strong chance that having a town hall focus on a particular topic with Council members and citizens would have a positive impact on both leadership as well as the community. Thank you. Thank you. Rob Berry, followed by Patrick Newman. That was a good segue. I'm here to make a modest suggestion about the way that you conduct your deliberations. So currently, when an agenda item comes up, your practice is to hear a staff report and then go immediately to public comments. Only when that has finished do you share anything meaningful about your own views, how you weigh the pros and cons, and provide whatever justification you choose about why you vote the way you do. You do not deliberate at all before the public speaking period is exhausted. I think this could be improved with a very modest improvement, and that is, if you would make your deliberations before public comments, then it's more likely that what you hear from this podium would be more relevant and responsive, because they're hearing what your thinking is and then responding to that, rather than just delivering a prepared comment that they did not. It's just a brief, brief, brief, brief, brief, brief, brief, brief, brief, brief, brief, brief, brief, brief, brief, brief, brief, brief, brief, brief, brief, brief, brief, brief, brief, brief, brief, brief, brief, brief, brief, brief, brief, brief, brief, brief, brief, brief, brief, brief, brief, brief, brief, brief, brief, brief, brief, brief, brief, brief, brief, brief, brief, brief, brief, brief, brief, brief, brief, brief, brief, brief, brief, brief, brief, brief, brief, brief, brief, brief, brief, brief, brief, brief, brief, brief, brief, brief, brief, brief, brief, brief, brief, brief, brief, brief, brief, brief, brief, brief, brief, brief, brief, brief, brief, brief, brief, brief, brief, brief, brief, brief, brief, brief, brief, brief, brief, brief, brief item on the agenda, maybe occasionally it's worthwhile to have a representative of a constituency make a presentation and provide an analysis of their own that may reach beyond what staff, you know, analyzes or what assumptions that they make. The result of that would be that your decision would be better informed, the public would be more engaged, and whatever decision you make, whether it's what a particular individual wanted or not, is more likely to have the broader support of the public. At least they understand your thinking, they understand how you tried to trade off the balances and how you reached the conclusion that you did. So my suggestion is if you would just change that one thing, have a preliminary deliberation before public comments, listen to public comments, let them respond to what they hear, and then you have a chance to come back and discuss and you can make a decision. And hold your vote. Nobody's holding you to a particular decision. So thank you for considering that. Thank you. Our last speaker is Patrick Newman. Hi. I think there's always two huge pieces missing in these discussions, and the one huge piece is that we have a 40-year, well, we have a 40-year, well, we have a 40-year, well, we have a 40-year, well, we have a 40-year, well, we have a housing shortage situation, housing crisis situation with a 40-year pedigree, a 40-year history. And if you look up wealth inequality in the United States and do any reading on it, you'll see that there's this wide gap that's getting wider and wider and wider. And so you have this constituency that's falling off one edge of the bell curve. They end up in our streets. We haven't done the job. And the other, I think, big picture that's part of the picture that's missing is that there isn't enough personal contact with these people to really get to know them personally and get to know who they are as people, which informs my thinking a lot because I've now had thousands of interactions with people on the street, literally thousands. And that is a sort of basis for understanding who they are. I don't think that's easily replaced. That work has to be done. Otherwise everything, the context for what you're doing doesn't make any sense. Both of those two components are really important. So last time I was here, Mr. Morgan, I was here for a couple of weeks. I was in the office for a couple of weeks. And, you know, there's a lot of, there's a lot of, there's a lot of, there's a lot of there's a lot of, there's a lot of, there's a lot of, there's a lot of, there's a lot there's a lot of, there's a lot of, there's a lot of, there's a lot there's a lot of, there's a lot of, there's a lot there's a lot of, there's a lot of, there's a lot there's a lot of, there's a lot of, there's a lot there's a lot of, there's a lot of, there's a lot there's a lot of, there's a lot of, there's a lot there's a lot of, there's a lot of, there's a lot there's a lot of, there's a lot of, there's a lot there's a lot Portland or wherever it is. This kind of a comment can only be made without these two pieces because if you look at the fact that this is a national problem that involves a statewide issue, a nationwide issue, and then you get to know these people personally, you can't just say push it somewhere else and you can't think of them as people who should just die in a tent with no water and no shade at 110 degrees. Those things don't add up and I guess for the 10,000th time I'm asking you to look more deeply at what I'm talking about because the information that keeps coming back doesn't jive with what's going on out there. I just visited the pallet shelter and I'd like to talk more about that sometime but I do see that it's had a transformational effect on some people who have been chronically homeless and I've known them for years and that's a really good thing to see. I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to answer that question. What's a shame is that the city had to have its arm twisted to do it. There needs to be more latitude in terms of how we care for these people. Thanks. He was our last speaker. All right, thank you. We'll move on to item four, public hearings. And just so folks understand, I'm going to go through kind of the steps that we take here. First off, we're going to announce our ex parte communications. Then we're going to have a staff report, which is allotted for 15 minutes. Then we'll have council discussions. Then we'll have a public hearing. Then we'll have a public discussion and questions of staff, which is allotted for 10 minutes. And then we have an open public hearing, no more than 50 minutes, which will include 15 minutes from the applicant and additional speakers 30 minutes. And then we have a rebuttal at least three minutes from the applicant. And then we'll close the hearing and then motion and vote determined upon there, but 20 minutes if needed for council discussion. So this is in regards to the council discussion. So I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to go ahead and 4.1 CCB enterprises appeal hearing. So we will start with the announcement of ex parte communications. 4.1 CCB enterprises appeal hearing. So we will start with the announcement of ex parte communications. And I will start by saying that I had a phone conversation with Adrian and I don't last week. I believe it was. So about 10, 15 minutes long. Do we have any others? No? Did you have a conversation with anybody from the appellant? I did have one. I know one of the partners had reached out, but we did not have a conversation because I was working, but I did receive a phone call. None further. Alright, so, then we'll go to staff report for up to 15 minutes. So, hold on just a little bit, forest, gentlemen. This is Dylan. Hello. Hello, everyone. Hello, everyone. Thank goodness. Okay, good evening. So this is for the cannabis appeals for phase three. So just as a refresher, we have four phases to the cannabis application process. That first phase was the application review by city staff and zoning verification. The second phase was the scoring portion of the application process. And the third phase was the city manager's hearing, which is what we're here for tonight, the appeal on that. And the fourth and final phase is the public hearing before the city manager. Per the Chico Municipal Code, appeals on the initial permits are limited to two things. If there was deviations from city procedures that adversely affected the applicant, or if there was a violation of the city's policy, or if the scoring was not justified. If the appeal is upheld, the applicant would move to phase four. And that's that public hearing and final selection by the city manager. And there are currently three applicants that the city manager chose to advance to that phase four. So the city manager's hearing, which is what is being appealed tonight, is guided by the municipal code. And it's where the city manager is to determine the most suitable and complete applications for the city. So the criteria that interim city manager Paul Hahn used during that process consisted of overall community benefits, the community participation in ownership and operations, the geographic dispersal throughout the city, the deliverability, site issues were discussed, financing, and then overall presentation and answers to the questions. So all of the 10 applicants that move forward to phase three were told, and they were able to apply for the final application. And that's the criteria that city manager Paul Hahn would be using when selecting the final applicants to move to the last phase. So CCB Enterprise, this appeals for them. In their appeal, which was attached to the staff report, they listed that the community benefit, the business model location, and the proposed timeframe for business operations, these were in error. They didn't expand in their appeal as to why they were in error, just made a statement that they were in error. They were done in error. Per the code, based on the responses provided during phase three, the city manager shall determine which applicants proceed to phase four. The code also states that the city may reject any applications if it determines that it's in the best interest of the city. Any questions? All right. Questions for Mrs. Dill? Thank you. All right. So any further council discussions at this time? Then we will open the hearing and allow the applicant to speak for 15 minutes. Madam Clerk, if you could set the timer once you see the timer, you guys can go ahead and you can cycle through all of your reps as you see fit. Welcome. I'm sorry. I mean, I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to get through this All right. Well, thank you for your time, Council, for this appeal. We know this has been a long process. We appreciate all the hard work by staff and everyone in answering to all questions. My name is Adrian Heim. This is Chuck Nadeau and Richard Horne. We're here to appeal the decision of CCB Enterprises not moving forward, phase three to phase four in the commercial retail cannabis dispensary application process. We represent Chico Canna and Botanicals, CCB Enterprises. Our local partnership group also includes Richard Horne, Brandon Hankins, that is not here today, owner of our property location, Matt Oberholz, and the owners of Big Sur, Canna, and Botanicals, which is in Carmel-by-the-Sea, California, which is Aram Stoney and John DeFlorio. We have put in a packet there that we've given to all of you the scoring from phase one and phase two. We just wanted to note there that in phase one we did score 95.92% on the application. And then as we moved to phase two, we climbed from 16th up to fourth to a 95.07%. So that's a lot of work. And so we were able to compute that our scoring was the highest of all applicants during phase two of that application phase. The phase three interview with the city manager went wonderful. Really enjoyed meeting that group again. And then Mr. Hahn, the meeting went well. We were complimented on how we did. We did go first. We know this is a very hard task of what to choose. We just believe there's a deeper dive here. There were a couple of different things that came up that were addressed that we feel we would like to elaborate on more. And so from there, we were going to dive into, okay, so we did extensive research, okay, on and review of all the cannabis committee meetings, the people that were a part of the cannabis committee, what the council had brought up with their concerns. Most likely we'll be quoting a lot from what came from Dr. Miller in the cannabis committee. We will also be quoting a lot from Jim Hamlin from the Chico Unified School District. And from there, I'll turn it over to Chuck. Thank you. As we were putting together our team, we took the core principles from the Chico Cannabis Committee meeting starting in 2019, the feedback from the council, and then the RFP process in 2021 to create the ideal solution. We heard loud and clear what the local community thought leaders wanted in their community, and these were the people who the council chose to do the due diligence on what should be the most important when awarding permits for retail cannabis dispensaries. These were representatives of the Chico Unified School District. We also heard from the Chico Unified School District, the Chico Unified School District representatives, representatives from public health, Chico Unified School District, law enforcement, and others. Some of the key findings that kept coming up were the idea of local ownership and people giving the greatest community benefit. One of the most vocal people in the community was Dr. Andy Miller, who was the Butte County public health officer at the time, and is now the medical director for community health at Enloe. He said in multiple meetings, and I quote from the committee meeting notes, Dr. Miller wants to ensure that we dictate that license is a member of the community. He does not want some corporation. He then goes on in another meeting and states, committee member Dr. Miller stated that where is not as important as what and who will be selling. He stated from past experience with alcohol and tobacco sales, local owners are less likely to push the boundaries in their own communities. He goes on to explain, the more localized businesses are more responsive to the community needs and desires. The out of town business owners are more likely to push the boundaries and not be as responsive, and he's seen this in many of his meetings. We also know that Lane McMillan, assistant city attorney, stated that local preference could be set either by incorporating the requirements into the ordinance or through the city's permit process. Dr. Miller stated that for the record, he would want a local preference. I'd like to point out that two out of the three that were selected by the city manager to move forward to phase four are companies from outside the area. For example, responsible and compliant Chico currently has five locations from Fresno, Martinez, South Lake Tahoe, Fairfax, and Emory. Fairfield, and Alameda. Sweetflower has six locations that are all in the LA metro area. These are all out-of-town corporations who are spitting out applications from their marketing teams to get as many locations as possible. We saw this super early on, and so we went the complete opposite route in building our team around community-minded individuals who are willing to invest in this process. We have a 90% ownership team of all super local people who've combined lived in Chico for 168 years. I'm the youngest member of that group with 21 years in Chico, and I finally crossed over to have half my life in Chico. It's all local money that stays within our community. We're local business owners and non-profit volunteers and board members. We have a vested interest in this community and currently employ over 200 people in Chico between our private businesses. We have the business wherewithal and partner with industry experts from Big Sur, Cannon, and Botanicals to give us the technical expertise we needed to be successful from the start. Once we had a great group established, we looked all over Chico to think about what would be the best possible location. And Richard can speak to the location of the building. Before he starts, I think it's really important. There's a letter in your packet from Mike Maloney, the retired chief of police for the city of Chico, 37-year veteran of Northern California law enforcement, and two paragraphs really stick out for me on this. It says, it will be imperative when licensing dispensaries in Chico for principles associated therewith to be of impeccable character with solid business-related acumen. This is why I'm writing now. I'm understanding that we're not going to be able to get a lot of people to agree with this. I'm also aware that Richard Horne is seeking consideration for licensure, and I believe that for the greater good of the community he is exactly the type of individual who should be approved for such. As a principal in a new and controversial industry such as this, Richard brings to the table a solid foundation of character, integrity, and very successful business experience, which I believe would serve him and the city of Chico well in traveling down this new path. As he has a long record of demonstrating these characteristics, I feel confident that Richard Horne's licensure, should such an endeavor, would help to ensure legitimacy of the industry. Hi, I'm Richard Horne. So as we were looking over the locations, we were really looking at the sensitive areas in the buffer zones. So we really wanted to think about an area that was off the beaten path. So we kind of went one block off of a main drag, so it was very convenient by a bus stop, but also an area that I think is going to be a very, very important area for us to be able to address. So we had an opportunity to talk to some of the law enforcement, and they liked the idea of being out in an industrial area. We also would be building a building from scratch. So that gave us an opportunity to work not only with security, but better flow. We could control the parking, maybe adding a sally port for security, fencing the entire parking lot for security. And so we had a lot more control over the building. As far as security, with my relationship with the police department, like I said, we were able to talk to them about a lot of the different things as far as the security end. We really wanted it to be away from anything with youth involved. So we wanted to make sure that there was no group or, you know, any, events that would involve children or, so we felt like that was one of the things that we were really shooting for. As far as building the building, I'm a contractor. Brandon Hankins is also a contractor, and we cover a lot of the trades. We're within a few months of getting final building permits. We've got PG&E on board. The gas plans are done. We're moving forward with it. We're moving forward with it. We're moving forward with it. We're moving forward with it. As we speak, we're looking at about eight months to build the building. So it's within the next year that we would, it's a very modest approach or, you know, timeline. I think we're very confident we can do that. We mentioned this because that was a key element that came up in our interview with City Manager Hahn that we were talking about when would we be we would be ready to go, right? And so based on whenever this process is done, we don't know what that's going to be, October 1st, November 1st, let's say at the earliest. Then when the permits would then be awarded, all those permit winners would then have to get the state licensing, okay? Which applying for that state licensing and what you have to do can take anywhere from six to 12 months, which we've researched, okay? And so from now, 12 months from now, our building is ready to go. Our building can be ready. And so we wanted to make sure that that wasn't an issue as far as timing goes. Okay, I'm going to touch a little bit on a couple of the other key elements with us that had gotten brought up. We're educating the public, right? We intend to have no advertising. There will be no billboards. There will be no ads in newspapers or anything like that, okay? People know how to find it, right? All right. Are... Are... Are there, like, there's a, there's a, there's a, there's a, there's a, there's a, there's a, there's a, there's a, there's a, there's a, there's a, there's a, there's a, there's a, there's a, there's a, there's a, there's a, there's a, there's a, there's a, there's a, there's a, there's a, there's a, there's a, there's a, there's a, there's a, there's a, there's a, there's a, there's a, there's a, there's a, there's a, there's a, there's a, there's a, there's a, there's a, there's a, there's a, there's a, there's a, there's a, there's a, there's a, there's a, there's a, there's a, there's a, there's a, very big. All of us have children. We have kids that went through Chico High, went through PV, that play sports here. I was a part. I founded a club. You can look this club up out of Benicia, California called Friday Night Live. It's a club that promotes activities for alternative activities for drugs and alcohol. So you might ask, well, how can I get involved with something when it comes to cannabis? I'm not a cannabis user. I have kids. I do not profess that my kids use cannabis, but there are so many wonderful benefits of it, which you guys have all heard. And we're talking about getting it off the black market. I'm an athlete myself. I play college baseball. I never chewed tobacco once. It was my choice based on how I was educated around it. Okay. I did. I partnered with the Chico Fire Department here with Rosedale Elementary School. I did. I partnered with the Chico Fire Department here with Rosedale Elementary School. I did. I partnered with the Chico Fire Department here with Rosedale Elementary School on an anti-bullying campaign. It was on Action News. I brought in a local national athlete that won American Ninja Warrior, and he spoke on bullying. Okay. Bullying is a big deal, right? Bullying, you know, you see all this gun violence. A lot of those kids, something happened when it came to bullying. Okay. What we're saying is we're looking out for our youth. Okay. We are all about diverting this from the youth. Okay. I coach at the high schools. You know, we do an athlete committed program. Mr. Morgan, I'm sure you're familiar with the athlete committed. We speak about, you know, not using, you know, drugs and alcohol and being responsible with that. And I'm happy to raise my hand and say that, hey, I own a cannabis dispensary, and this isn't something that, you know, kids should be getting involved in, and we will give them all of those materials. So they understand why not to do that. And we put that in our packet that we provided as far as our executive summary in our last interview. We also put in there something called insta-fake. Okay. And I have not seen an insta-fake. This is your ID. Okay. The way that it happened, okay, is in Carmel, the daughter, right, was saying, hey, dad, there's... students that are going in, they're trying to bring in these fake IDs. So he put in an insta-fake, right? And now these kids can't come in and, you know, buy cannabis that are underage. Okay. We're doing the responsible things. All right. Okay. Lastly, in this last minute and a half, I did not want to, you know, go to this level, but we don't understand, you know, what the determinations came from. Okay. The location in Marion Park is right in the middle of the state of California. So we're going to be doing a lot of work on that. We're going to be doing a lot of work on that. We're going to be doing a lot of work on that. across the street, we're talking 50 feet across from the barn event center, okay, that had the Chico High Prom, the Pleasant Valley High Prom, that just had a silent disco at it. And all I think about is, I mean, I think we can all think about high school, hey, you know, finding that older person that, hey, go buy me some alcohol, right? Well, how easy would it be for someone to, they're at an event, they're at a wedding, they're at some kind of event and they say, hey, my cousin that's 21, go across the street, buy some edibles, bring them over here. Let's have a good time with this. Okay. It's too close proximity. Okay. And then lastly, and there's a couple other things that maybe we'll touch here later. Um, that the one on park Avenue, you have Chico country day school. That's just 1100 feet. It's all in the path of travel. Um, committee member Hamlin stated, um, areas where youthful population hang out should be off limits such as malls and schools. Um, and he also talked about the path of travel. So we appreciate your time. Um, hopeful consideration that we'd be looked at to get back in the mix. All right. Thank you very much. No, Kelsey Morgan has a question. Oh, a question for Mr. Horn. Can you explain your relationship to the police, the Chico police department? And can you be more definitive about a lot of things you've talked about? Um, well, I work with the, I've worked with the SWAT team many times, let them use my property. I, um, work with the willing with cops every year and help sponsor that. I've just had, I have friends with some police officers and just ask their, you know, ideas on areas that might be better than, you know, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, obviously we're outside of those buffer zones. And that was one of the things we wanted to make sure we were clearly outside of those. Thank you. All right. So we'll turn it over to additional speakers at this time. Do we have anyone willing to speak on this? We do. We have three. So the first speaker is Eric Snedeker, followed by Hazel Van Evera. All right. Hello. Good evening. Appreciate your time. My name is Eric Snedeker. I've lived in Chico for over 50 years. I'm a retired educator. I previously worked as director of special ed for Chico Unified Schools. I was a principal in Chico Unified Schools. I was a teacher throughout the Butte County area, and I founded a program called Ability First. Ability First is a sports camp that started in 1985, serving disabled populations throughout Butte County and the service area. I'm here to give my support to the group Chico Canna Botamicals, known as CCB. I've known Chuck and specifically Matt for over 20 years. They're two individuals from the community that have been involved with this project. These guys have been some of the most dependable and rock-solid group of people that I've ever worked with. I've run the Ability First program on their backs for the last two decades. From the very beginning of the cannabis process, all the public input has been community first. Throughout the Cannabis Committee meetings, I've watched, I've read in the papers, and I've seen on the news, and they've talked about local ownership and community benefit. How is it that we've reached the point in this phase that we have gone out of the town's ownership groups, with no... without a track record within the Chico community? Is it really enough to have one or two local people on an advisory board where you can say you checked the box? This group of people literally lives and breathes in Chico, has family here, and they interact with the Chico community. I've known the group, the two individuals specifically, from the beginning and they're stellar to this community. I've given you plenty of information. I've given you plenty of first-hand accounts. I can give you plenty of first-hand accounts. Some probably wouldn't be appropriate here, but the length at which these guys go to helping out the community through their involvement in the Ability First program is outstanding. One time Chuck jumped from being a counselor at the bottom level, pranking 40 kids in wheelchairs and making a wheelchair Christmas tree in the middle of the dorms, to jumping to be the board of directors, celebrating with NACs, and a year having raised $100,000 for a nonprofit organization. Without that effort coming from one individual that then jumped over to many other individuals, has allowed Ability First to be successful in the Chico community for over 38 years. We continue to provide those services. Both Chuck and Matt continue to be a vital part of that. Matt has really changed the trajectory of hundreds of kids and disabled vets' lives since. He's been teaching. He's been helping them to participate in sports. Matt most recently. Matt's time. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Hazel Van Evera followed by Jessica Giannola. Good evening, council members. Thank you for this opportunity. Many, many months ago after the request for applications for commercial cannabis dispensaries came out, I was approached by several groups. Several individuals for some collaboration in the commercial cannabis process. And it wasn't until I met these gentlemen here who approached me through some business connections that I resonated enough with their vision to get involved in this. I've been a Chico resident since 2008. I have family here. I chose Chico to come to and hopefully retire in the next few years. I had a career in public health. I ran the largest AIDS organization in the northwest. And in Chico, I've done many different things, but I was the general manager of the Chico Sports Club. So I have been also in the health field in Chico for many, many years. I really resonated with these gentlemen and their business approach to this project, mainly because they have a concern and care for our Chico community. That's a big thing for me. As being a Chico resident. Being in the nonprofit world, I believe that community is the most important thing in a project like this. They're established leaders and businessmen within our community, as was just listed. And yet, what I focused on was that they have an articulated and well thought out vision and plan of action for this project. I didn't want to get involved in anything that... That I had seen without that kind of real vision that I could hook into. They were studied in their approach, very service oriented, and they've been collaborating with medical professions within the field for quite a while. They've educated themselves regarding the uses of controlled cannabis and have a desire to responsibly educate others about the benefits of cannabis. As we've heard. As related to seniors, in pain management, in mental health, addiction, and health and wellness, much more. They have articulated a desire to educate and responsibly provide a managed product. They're adamant about... That's time. Thank you. Yes, thank you. Jessica Giannola is our last speaker. Thank you, Council. I just know from the beginning of this process, a couple years back, it has remained really unclear, it seems, for the applicants. And each step through the process, they weren't sure what to do or what your requirements were. And so many applicants seem to be denied. And then I've seen these appeals taking place. And I really continue to advocate for our... Our local... Our fellow neighbors that are trying very hard to start a business or extend their business so that they can continue to provide for their family and provide a service for people in Chico. There's a stigma that still remains with cannabis. And it's not just your light up your joint and get high. Cannabis itself offers, like people have said, so many medicinal services. That it's more like... Like we're talking about adding in pharmacies at this point of access points for people who use it. You may choose not to use it, but there are other people that is really their only choice for pain management and other reasons they use them for. So it seems like these applicants have gone above and beyond. These are the type of people we would want to be servicing our area. They're extremely cautious and considerate. They're not just somebody who watched them and said, I want to open a shop. It's they poured out every detail of how careful they're being and how conscious they are of how the impacts of any substance can be on our youth in our area. I would hope that you would reconsider. I realize that maybe mines may have already been set up all along. But if you could just pause for just a moment and reconsider and allowing this appeal to go forward. I would... I would feel better having applicants such as the ones that just spoke in our community versus some other areas that maybe aren't as careful. I think that's about it. But thank you. Thank you. All right. And do the applicants wish to use a three-minute rebuttal time? Yeah. All right. Go ahead. Just wanted to conclude in saying that we did put some other things there in the packet. I think that's about it. Thank you. Thank you, JUDGE. use locations that our attorney did look at. And so we just want to make sure that those are on record for review. In other cities such as Placerville, Redding, South Lake Tahoe, I know some of those have come up. What they do when they get to this final 10 is they have put in, they ranked the final 10, okay? And meaning if they were going to take four, they would put four and then the fifth or the sixth, those would be the first alternates, right? If something were to happen. The public hearing hasn't happened yet for these three that have been advanced to move forward to the next phase. And so depending on what your thoughts are, what any potential new thoughts are from the city manager, the incoming city manager that's going to make the final decision, I'm hoping that what's been spoken today, you know, would resonate with the council, you know, for the consideration to put us in as a fourth, to then be considered as one of those three in case, you know, there is something that comes up. So again, we want it to be, you know, as respectful as we could to the other applicants, because we understand that it's a lot of hard work, right? But we also are, you know, we're parents too, right? And we're citizens and we care about, you know, what these things look like, right? We didn't touch on, you know, the safety. If there were something that were to happen, you know, sorry, Richard did speak about that as far as it came to events. Anyway, I think I'll spare the last one minute and just say thank you again for all your hard work. Thank you. All right. Thank you very much. And we will close public hearing council discussion. We'll start with Council Member Morgan. I believe you have a... Thank you. So... I know two of you. I don't doubt that you're all fairly nice people. I appreciate all of your attempts to get a hold of me during this process. You gave some data on the scoring, which is why you moved forward as far as you did, but not a lot of data. Certainly not any data that showed any prejudice against your application. While you did say your interview with the city manager went well, I don't really know what that means, and that you were complimented. I'd be willing to bet that all the applicants were complimented. It's kind of a polite thing to do after someone's made a presentation to you. When my students give presentations, I tell them good job, but they don't all get A's, and that's only part of the grading criteria. Just like here, I have very little doubt that every applicant would like a chance to explain more as you did, but I didn't hear any further data that would make me go one way or the other, other than I don't know what the criteria was for the city manager, and I know that wasn't released. The Cannabis Committee, and I've said this from the day it was put together, was a joke from day one. They did not give the police department a seat at the table. They were supposed to. It was required by the prior council. PD didn't get the input they should. They actually stopped going to the meetings. Your business partner is from Carmel, but you talk about how local you are. That went back and forth at least five times. You talked about how fast you can get this thing up and going. That's not terribly relevant, at least from my opinion, and I'm always speaking for me. The longer it takes you, the better. You cited Dr. Miller multiple times. Dr. Miller is not part of the decision-making process in any way, shape, or form. You talked about educating the public and doing no advertising. So do you really intend to tell the truth about cannabis use? The stuff from Boston's Children's Hospital, the stuff from Harvard Medical School, the real implications, because nobody in the plight talked about those things, and the Cannabis Committee didn't talk about those things. Everybody said use data-driven decision-making. Nobody talked about real data. Nobody talked about the data. Nobody talked about Oregon and Washington and Colorado and what happens when you open retail cannabis. Nobody. Not just you. None of the applicants. We heard about what other cities do. We knew what the application process was here. I appreciate everything you guys have done in the community, the anti-bullying campaigns, all those things, has nothing to do with your cannabis appeal. Other than you're going to go out and tell everybody, hey, guys, don't use what we're selling. I don't know if that's a really good marketing pitch. Like I said, I'm sure you're all, you're all going to be able to use what we're selling. I'm sure you're all going to be able to use what we're selling. Good gentlemen. I don't see anything in here that makes me want to uphold the appeal, that would make me want to uphold all the appeals. Other than that, we were specific as far as the application was going to go. I believe in the staff. I believe in the way they did things. I think if we end up, if we decide to uphold this appeal, we'll have to uphold all the appeals, and then we'll be starting with people coming back again, and we will never get through this process. Those are my comments. All right. Further comments from council? More discussion? Councilor Kite? A question. Yeah, a couple of questions and comments. Vince, could you address the, there was a letter that was sent by an attorney. Is there anything in there that worries you that the city did not do our job when we were doing the distance from sensitive receptors and all that stuff? Did you analyze the letter and you felt the city's safe? Certainly. Thank you, Vice Mayor Reynolds. Yes, we have advised city staff to be careful with the information that we're sending to the city. We have advised the city staff all along in this process, and we have no concerns about the correspondence that we receive from any attorneys. If we did, I would have brought that to the staff's attention and also to the council's attention. Great. Thank you. Ms. Dove, is this the final, there will be no more appeals after this, correct? This is, are there further appeals coming? So if one of the three at the next phase were to not make it and be confirmed by the city manager, they could technically appeal the next phase. Okay. And then that goes back to a comment from one of the applicants. Is there a way to do a ranking and to say that if something falls through with one of the other three, that this would be the entity that would be considered for that? Or do we have to go open it all back up and start back over? We could do that. I think, you know, there's been a lot of discussion that this is, you know, this is my decision. We had a committee that included Mr. Veague and Billy Aldridge, as well as Angie and myself. So, you know, we all felt very comfortable with the three that were selected. We could, I suspect if you ask us to, we could go back and meet again and discuss a fourth one. I will say that this was a very competitive proposal that they put together, but I think it's also not fair to hear from all the others that are not getting 15 minutes to present to each one of you all their attributes that they had. And many of them have local ownership interests and they have, you know, security issues and were asked very pointed questions by Lieutenant Aldridge about some security issues. And, you know, in my mind and I think in the mind of the panel, there was not a lot of disagreement about the three that survived. If you ask us to go look, and that's, that's what we recommended because that's what the ordinance says is to look at three. So, and we didn't do a ranking per se. I mean, and we were very upfront with every applicant that this was not going to be scored in a numerical way. One of the things we wanted to have was sort of conversations. I'm not even sure how we would compare them because this was not a typical kind of question where everybody was asked the same questions and you could compare answers and score. It was a discussion. We had different conversations with each applicant. And we were able to do that based on some of their concerns and issues that would come up that would might be specific about a site or a security concern at a site or a number of other attributes. So, I think if you ask us, could we come up with who we thought might have been the fourth candidate if we came back together and did that? We might be able to, but we didn't look at four. We looked at three. All right. Okay. That's all I have for right now. Okay. Anyone else? Council Member Brenner? I'm not going to add anything that Council Member Morgan already said. He really stated it very, very well. I appreciate you guys and the work you've done in this community. I truly do. But I think the points that Council Member Morgan made and really the process I think at this point needs to be upheld. I'm going to support upholding that direction that the city manager gave us. All right. Anyone further? Okay. All right. We have a motion to deny the appeal. I'll second that. I'll second from Council Member O'Brien a motion by Council Member Morgan. I actually have a comment too. So, and actually, Madam Clerk, can you help me with this? So, a yes will be a no, correct? So, if you vote to deny the appeal, that means they would not be moving forward, so. Correct. You would uphold staff's recommendation, which was to deny the appeal and uphold the decision of the city manager. Okay. Just want to make sure we're in hopes. A little wonky on that because it's a yes or no. No, I'm just saying it's, I didn't look right at anybody. Because I'm going to state what I'm going to do, which is I'm actually going to vote no because not, you know, a lot of people stood up here and said the very same thing you guys did. I'm going to vote yes for the last round. You know, I've been here. I'm local. You know, I've done these great things. I'm this great, upstanding community member, and I understand that. And, you know, luckily we have a community full of those types of folks. And luckily this process a lot of those folks. My concern and the reason, so I'm not voting against this because of that, because you stated all those reasons. I'm actually going against this because I think one of the applicants is, that is not you. It's too forward-facing. And too close to the school. So, but Madam Clerk, if you'll take the roll. Okay. Council Member Bennett. I am voting in support of the motion, yes. Council Member Brown is absent. Council Member Morgan. Yes. Council Member O'Brien. Yes. Council Member Tandon. Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds. No. Mayor Coolidge. No. It carries four, two with one absence. All right. We'll turn it around. Why don't we take a quick ten minute break, somewhere around that ballpark, and then we'll reatturn after that. . . My picture of you is stumped. You want to smile? . Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. All right. We will reconvene in a discussion with Vice Mayor Reynolds. She has asked that we table her item 5.6 to a future meeting, which is city options within settlement agreement. So we will look at doing that for her suggestion, if there's no objections from the council. So consider that table to a future meeting. So if you were going to speak on that item, just. Be aware that it'll be heard at a future meeting. So moving on to the regular agenda item 5.1 confirmation appointment of city manager report from city attorney. Thank you, mayor Coolidge under articles two and seven of the charter of the city of Chico and California government code sections 34, a 51 through 34, a 59. The city council is empowered to appoint a city manager to direct management. The executive affairs executive fit affairs of the city and to implement the council's policy determinations to meet this requirement. The city council is being presented with the employment agreement for Mark Sorenson, who has been selected to fill the city manager position after recruitment process. In compliance with government code section 54, 9, 53, C, 3, the city attorney shall first orally report a summary of the recommendation for final action related to the. City manager agreement as follows. The city council is proposing to enter an employment agreement with Mark Sorenson and appoint him as city manager with an annual salary of two thousand two hundred and seven thousand dollars, a four hundred dollar a month car allowance and health dental vision life disability pension and deferred compensation and leave fringe benefits. I, as a city attorney hereby recommend that the city council confirm its appointment of Mark Sorenson, as city manager. That concludes my report. All right. Any questions from Council? Move on to speakers. Okay. We have seven. Okay. And so when I call your name, if you could go ahead and step into the middle aisle. James Hutchinson followed by Elizabeth Griffin. I was lucky enough to grow in. Up in a town that was well run by a city manager. Very vicious politicians. The mayor, the city council, the city manager stayed aloof. He was an executive. He did things well come proposition 13 city actually got hurt. Not because it was poorly run because it was too low. Right? I didn't keep raising property taxes. We need that kind of executive buying. My only concern from Sorenson is which Mr. Sorenson shows up. The business leader, the high tech skills on top of things. The man who can run executive things and shown he can do that. Or the politician. That's my concern. And if the politician shows up, we all lose. We lose big. If the executive shows up, the businessman, the man understands high technology, the man who's run, cities before. If he shows up, that's great. I'll take it. But I would like to. That's not going to happen. Then bringing somebody from outside. Somebody new, somebody with different ideas. That's all I ask. Thank you. Elizabeth Griffin, followed by Katie Toma. Good evening, council members. My name is Elizabeth Griffin. And for the past few years, I have, um, avoided getting involved in any sort of political things because I served on the Chico school board for 12 years. So I've had experience in reviewing public workers, um, contracts and agreements for salary and things like that. And, uh, when I read how much this new city manager was going to be making my eyes just popped out of my head. And I'm sure that probably was the situation with a lot of people in Chico. The Chico news and review used to, um, put the salaries out there all the time for all the county workers. But I think that kind of went by the wayside. So it sort of went off the radar, how much people are getting paid. Um, so in Mr. Sorenson's case, he went from earning $106,000 in bigs. And now he's doubling his salary to 200, $2,000. So he's going to be paying over $212,000. Um, this is outrageous. Uh, not only is it his salary, it's his benefits, but also it's his PERS contribution and what you're going to be having to pay. The city is going to be having to pay its citizens are going to have it to be paid for this retirement. And out of the top 50 employees of the city, all but four are either fire department, or city, uh, police, city police officers. They're the top salaries. And I want to bring to your attention. I'm not even sure if you know this, but I pulled, I started doing some research on this and I pulled off this was for 2020. The top paid city person was a fire captain and that fire captain had a base pay of $99,403. And then had overtime pay of $171,000. Um, and then the next day, he was paid $263,000. So total benefits for that person were over $325,000. One person. And city of Chico has about 500 employees. So, um, I'm, I'm curious if you are going to be proposing a, uh, this person get this job for this much money, which is something that maybe you could have taken a stand to have, maybe a little less in salary and benefits to this person since he's taking such a huge jump. Maybe you could have negotiated something a little bit better deal for the city. And then also, you know, for the future, be thinking about how these things are becoming cumulative. This obligation for purrs and these salaries is why our roads are terrible. There's no money for that or the parks. Thank you. Katie Toma, followed by Bob Evans. Good evening, Mayor Coolidge, vice mayor, council, vice mayor, rentals and council. My name is Katie Toma, and I'm the executive director of the Chico Builders Association. I'm here to express the Chico Builders Association support of the selection of Mark Sorensen as the next city of Chico city manager. I reached out to the CBA board for their comments as to Mr. Sorensen's support. They would have been here themselves, but this is a big vacation week. So that's why I'm here on their behalf. So some of the comments that I received back from my board members were first one was great pick. Next one was he understands city government from his experience working on the planning commission and then on the city council for eight years where he was mayor for two of those years. During his tenure as a city council member, Mr. Sorensen served on a variety of committees, including the finance committee. We are especially pleased that Mr. Sorensen understands finances, city finances. Mr. Sorensen is a community minded as demonstrated by his service as a 14 year board member for catalyst domestic violence services by serving on the Chico Chamber Board for nine years and as a longtime member of the Chico Rotary Club. He understands the value of nonprofits that the value that nonprofits bring to our community. Mr. Sorensen understands how the private sector works. As a former business owner of 1214 years. He understands the challenges of running a business of what it takes to make a payroll. What it is to assume the risk is a business owner. He knows it's business that drives our economy. One CBA person said that as a council member, Mr. Sorensen was not beholden to any certain people group, but a person who did his homework and then made an informed vote. On a personal level, I have known Mr. Sorensen for a long time. We both were longtime members of Chico Rotary Club. One of the core tenants of Rotary International is service above self. I believe Mr. Sorensen embodies that this core tenant, and along with the experience of being leading a local municipality for 10 years that is right here in Butte County, being a local business owner serving on a non on nonprofit boards, and his years of serving the city of Chico as a planning commissioner, as a business owner, and a city council member, he is the best choice to serve the city of Chico as our next city manager. Thank you. Bob Evans, followed by Patrick Newman. Evening, council. I'm Bob Evans. And the only reason I came tonight was to shake Mark's hand and congratulate him. Obviously, that's not going to happen. So instead of what I'll do, I'll congratulate the council. I think you guys have picked the best person to run the city going forward. I was also asked to say a few words, and I'll keep them real brief. Katie covered a lot of the same territory I would. But when we served on the council, I don't even remember the year. 2010. Thank you. 2010. Just saying. The city was in real trouble. Through some deceptive finance practices, the city was steadily draining the accounts, the various financial accounts. They drained the operational reserves to almost nothing. They drained all the emergency reserves to almost nothing. And there was only one person who was responsible, who did the digging, who did the homework to expose that and stop that and keep the city from going bankrupt. Because we were. We were well on our way to that position. And that's Mark Sorensen. He's the most thorough guy I know. He does his homework. He's a wonk on the computer. He lives his stuff. And he will serve this city very well. You couldn't have picked a better person. And that's about all I'm going to say, except I also want to thank Paul Hahn for stepping in. You've done an awesome job in the short period. Didn't have to do that. Could have stayed retired. Not wore a suit. But you're here. And for one, I appreciate. I appreciate what you've done for this city. Thank you. Thank you. Patrick Newman, followed by Jessica Giannola. So my knowledge of Mr. Sorensen comes from going to many, many, many council meetings and listening to him and seeing where he falls on the issues and everything else. It's not personal what I'm about to say. Okay. One thing I have. I've said repeatedly here is that the city has become extremely incestuous. That upper management has been here too long. That there's an echo chamber going on. We have an ultra-conservative majority on the council. They talk to each other, apparently. And it's more and more of a bubble where you're not getting fresh insight from outside the area, from outside the community. But it may feel good to keep doing this. But the fact of the matter is that there needs. There needs to be on every level a kind of opening up to new ideas from the outside. So this is the worst possible thing you could do because you're talking about the ultimate insider here. So three major areas. Mr. Sorensen, I believe, was the power behind the throne in hiring Brian Nakamura. Set the city on this trajectory, 10-year trajectory of being an underfunded, least funded city in California. And, by the way, there's a lot of político, político político, político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político político not we have a sales tax. There's been an ideological opposition to having a sales tax, so here we are. People say that coffers are drained by salaries and benefits. No, we're one of the few cities in California that hasn't raised funds. On the homeless issue, Mark Sorensen is retrograde on every part of it. He's defended unconstitutional laws. He's a leader in cutting services to the homeless. So what got us into federal court, the Eastern District Court, as a ward of the Eastern District Court, is largely due to the kind of leadership that people like Mark Sorensen brought to Chico, which was criminalized, criminalized, criminalized, and a conservative judge looked at our laws and said, these are unconstitutional laws. What are we going to do, double down on more of that? Makes no sense. Lastly, Mark Sorensen is under the thumb of developers. And so if we're talking about the green, if we're talking about state-of-the-art compact urban design, that's all out the window. What we get is sprawl, the highest profit sprawl. That's why the development industry is supporting Mark Sorensen in this role. You want free market sprawl in the end of the green line and a non-compact, non-affordable city? There's your direction. Thanks. Jessica Giannola, followed by Robin Engel. Council, I'm going to go first. Our neighbors have brought up some pretty important points regarding Sorensen. I didn't really pay attention to politics all that much when he was here, just right after, when he came introduced. But I have lived here for quite a while now, and I do see the state of our city currently, and it didn't happen overnight. It's happened over rounds of city councils. And spending, prioritizing where our money is going. And one thing would be, I've always been shocked at how much Oram made as a city manager. I was like, unbelievable. I know a lot of that is in fringe benefits, but still that bottom line is so astronomical compared to your average citizen here, or even just, I don't know, the job. I know it's hard, but it just seems like that price tag. I know it's hard to make money for our budget. And what we have to work with in our city is too high. And it would have been nice if there could have been, like someone suggested, some reconsideration as to how much we are paying our city manager, and maybe some other just budgeting period. But that's a concern. Politics is another concern. We know where his politics lie. So I hope that he can do a good job as a city manager and collaborating with the community at large, and keeping our needs in mind, and hopefully, making some good decisions that aren't political-based. Again, we have a lot of needs in this city, and someone else mentioned the taxes. There's always going to be another tax that's proposed to us, and that's just more money out of our pockets, for what should have already been taken care of, and already budgeted for. So, I hope that he's done. He's great that he would have saved the city and pulled us out of a negative, but at what cost? And we have to keep it in mind if we're trading off, putting more money in the bank, but something's suffering, that's going to come back. It's not taken care of. It's still waiting for us to address. So that's just concerns I have with the city manager. I know we need to have one, but how much we're paying and where our money's going is a concern for all of us. Thank you. Robin Engel is our last speaker. I was pretty new to Chico when Mayor Sorensen came on board, but I was here and have a fair knowledge of the history. I believe in, again, rule by compassion and open communication with the people, and I therefore don't support. I support this appointment. Years ago, Sorensen, with several of you who are now on council, back on council or still on council, sued a private citizen for exercising his right, his constitutional right, to free speech and to petition the community. This was the move, the junkyard campaign. A judge took the people's side, and this still cost us because there was no respect for our, our constitutional rights under Sorensen's leadership. There was no respect for the rights of people who didn't agree with him, and therefore this cost the city over $200,000. It also cost the Chico scrap metal, um, $140,000 in defense fees. That is enough reason for me, I'm concerned that my time has already been cut off at times when I mention Sean Morgan's name, or when I say things that, um, that, um, don't sit well with you all because they're true and they're maybe uncomfortable. So I'm very concerned about our rights as free citizens, supposedly, that keep being stripped away from us. And under Sorensen's rule, and that's the direction we're going, we're going to see more of a disparity between the very wealthy and the rest of us, especially the broke and the poor. And we're going to see more lives lost and more unconstitutional cruelty. We'll be inviting more lawsuits if things proceed as they did historically. Thank you. Thank you. She's our last speaker. All right. Thank you. Council discussion. A couple of comments. All right. Over. I don't know if someone else wanted to. Okay. So. I think if everybody here, I probably knew, know Mark Sorensen the best. I don't really want, where's Katie? Katie did a great job. Bob did a great job. Anybody that knows Mark Sorensen would say the same things about him. Some of the things that were brought up by some other people, including the school board lady who helped hire, who's the school superintendent? Kelly Staley, who makes more than our city manager does. So a lot of things were thrown around. Let me tell you what I know about Mark Sorensen. First of all, he's got a photographic memory. Second of all, I don't know everybody in the room, but I can tell you Mark Sorensen is the smartest guy here if he was here. And Bob, the reason he's not here, he had his own city council meeting to be at because he would have been here out of respect. All his years on the planning commission, all his years on council, he can remember every last detail. And when he found out that the city coffers were being drained and the then city manager wouldn't listen to him, he went to the grand jury. You know, what kind of courage it takes as an elected official? Elected official, all you got to do is win a popularity contest. That's all it is. It doesn't mean you're qualified to be a city manager, hire a city manager, run a city, any of those things. He went to the grand jury and said, something here is broken. Then he reached across the aisle to Scott Grundle, who is no conservative thought leader. Said, Scott, something's wrong with the finances of the city. We need to do something. And then Scott and Mark Sorensen worked together to bring in Brian Nakamura, under then Mayor Ann Schwab, also, again, not a conservative thought leader, but a very nice lady. Because they realized things were broken in the city and didn't matter if it's Democrat or Republican. What matters is we need to do the best thing for the city that we could. And they did. Nonpartisan. Left-leaning council. 6-2. Bob Evans was on it. Sorry, 5-2. He knows there's my math. That's why we need Mark Sorensen here. All right. Move forward. Gets in. Comes the mayor. Even before he comes the mayor. We get in. We start moving things. Brian Nakamura takes 13 departments to five. Super, super painful. Then they start rebuilding the city. Primarily through Mark's leadership on the council. Does a great job. He's got private industry experience. He goes down to bigs where he's the public works director. He's the HR director. He's in charge of finance. He's in charge of everything. People are like, well, you can't take a guy like that because he's a public works director. He's a public works director. He's a He's making X and have him make X times two. Well, I'm actually going to quote Mark Sorensen because when we did the contract for Mark Warren 10 years ago, people said, you can't pay this guy this much. This is crazy. This is, you can't pay public employees like that. It's way too much. Mark Sorensen sat right over there and says, you think hiring someone expensive costs a lot. Try hiring a cheap one. See what that costs you. Because then let's give all the money to AGC. Not that I'm opposed to that. As they fix all the things that went wrong. We got to look at the new city council after Mr. Orm resigned. We got to look, we need a new city manager. What are we going to do? So we put out the RFP, the city clerk's office did that. How many applicants? 17? We had 21. 21 applicants. Now, if we had advertised as, hey, let's pick bigs as salary. You want to come run Chico for $100,000? 21 applicants would have been a fat zero. We wanted quality people. 21 applicants outside third party consultant says, here's six. We're going to put out a new city manager. We're going to put out a new city manager. Six we think could do the job. Six. Mark Sorensen's on it. Throw one guy out, he got hired by someone else. All of us, Ms. Brown was there as well, go through interviews, all five of them. All five of them qualified in different ways. Three of them probably really could have done the job. Mark Sorensen comes out on top. Biggest question mark, can he separate the politics from the city? Not only can he separate the politics from the running, the operations of the city, the beautiful part is he's done both. The question I ask every single applicant, can you say no, sorry guys, can you say no to department directors? Because I've worked with a city manager that couldn't. And can you say no to city council members? Because I've worked under a city manager that couldn't. And when that happens, it's a free-for-all. And pretty soon, you've got a really, really, really bad cultural problem. So to bring someone in from some other town, and I'm not going to name all the towns that people came from, but you know some of them, it would have taken 12 to 18 months at best for someone to figure out what's really going on in the city of Chico, what's going on with the settlement agreement, how are we going to replace a police chief and an administrative services director, and what's going on in HR, all these things that we're dealing with right now. One guy. He's got the skill set. He's got the content. He's got the resume. He understands the culture. He's got the respect already of the leadership team. That's how he got here. And if I'm wrong, come back in a year, and we'll talk about it. This is the single best hire the city has made in the last 10 years. That's 10. I'm just kidding. Is that over for now? Oh, probably not. Probably right on. Well, I just wanted to add one quick thing. I did not serve with Mr. Sorensen up here, so I can't speak to serving with him. I will say that we did negotiate. We did negotiate and consider his salary, and he did not get the same benefit package that the previous city manager did. He is actually getting less. So we did take that into consideration, and I think a lot of that money that is paid in overtime in the fire department is also reimbursed, and we keep a good eye on that, too, because when our firefighters go out and fight other fires, we get money back for that, and it helps backfill, and it pays for the backfill of the overtime that people are making, so that's not all general dollars either. So just a couple of things out there, and I would definitely support the appointment. Further comment? Entertain a motion. I'll make a motion to approve the contract for Mark Sorensen. Second. We have a motion and a second. Madam Clerk, take the roll. Councilmember Bennett? Yes. Councilmember Brown is absent. Councilmember Morgan? Yes. Councilmember O'Brien? Yes. Yes. Councilmember Tandon? Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds? Aye. Mayor Coolidge? Aye. Carries 6-0 with one absence. All right. Moving on to item 5.2, confirmation of department head contract, and I believe we have a report from interim director of HR and risk. Amanda Pat. Come on down. Good evening, Mayor Coolidge, Vice Mayor Reynolds, and Vice Mayor Tandon. Yes, Mayor Reynolds, and Council. My name is Amanda Patten. I'm currently staffed as your interim director of human resources and risk management. Tonight, I bring forth to you a deputy director contract. Section 605 of the city charter states that the appointment of department heads are subject to confirmation by Council. We have historically used this practice for deputy directors as well. Council approved amendments to the city's classification plan and the associated budget appendices at the May 17, 2022 meeting. Council meeting. In that classification plan, a newly created position for the deputy director of public works operations and maintenance came to fruition. And the city's incumbent for the position was identified as Skylar Lipsky, who has been with the city's public works department as the public works manager since 2016. So on behalf of the city manager, we make recommendation that in compliance with government code section 54953C3, the city manager shall first orally report a summary of the recommendation for final action related to the deputy director of public works operations and maintenance employment agreement as follows. The city manager is proposing to enter into an employment agreement with Skylar Lipsky as the deputy director of public works operations and maintenance. And the city manager is proposing to appoint Skylar Lipsky with an annual salary of $1,000.00. The city manager is proposing to appoint Skylar Lipsky as the deputy director of public works operations and maintenance. And the city manager is proposing to appoint Skylar Lipsky as the deputy director of public works operations and maintenance.

And the city manager is proposing to appoint Skylar Lipsky as the deputy director of public works operations and maintenance. And the city is proposing to appoint Skylar Lipsky as the deputy director of public works operations operations and maintenance. And the city manager is proposing to appoint Skylar and second. No further discussion. Madam Clerk, do the roll. Council Member Bennett. Yes. Council Member Morgan. Yes. Council Member O'Brien. Yes. Council Member Tandon. Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds. Aye. Mayor Coolidge. Aye. Carry 6-0 with one absence. All right. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. And we will move on to back at it. Confirmation of department head contract.

Again, I am Amanda Patton, the Interim Director of Human Resources and Risk Management. Section 605 of the City Charter states that the appointment of department heads need to be confirmed by Council. We are again doing this for our Deputy Director of Information Systems. Council approve amendments to the fiscal year 21-22 budget appendices at the meeting of February 1, 2022. The amendments brought forth the newly created position of Deputy Director Information Systems and Information Systems Manager Joshua Marquis was appointed to the newly created position on February 13, 2022. On behalf of the City Manager, we make recommendation that in compliance with Government Code Section 549-53-C3, the City Manager shall first orally report a summary of the recommendation for final action related to the Deputy Director of Information Systems employment agreement as follows. The City Manager is proposing to enter into an employment agreement with Joshua Marquis as the Deputy Director of Information Systems, and the City Manager is proposing to appoint Joshua Marquis with an annual salary of $130,000.

I know, almost like a pirate. Yeah. Maybe. No. No. All right. 5.4. Analysis of the Quality of Life Voter Initiative. Mr. Yu. Thank you, Mayor Coolidge. At your meeting of May 17th, you voted to agendize a discussion about the possibility of placing a voter initiative on the November 2022 ballot that would establish the elements of quality of life as safety, cleanliness, beauty, and economic vitality, which would provide a means for citizens and businesses to hold the city accountable. At your June 21st, 2022,! Meeting, Vice Mayor Reynolds brought forward a draft of an ordinance regarding the above described, and the ordinance's proponents are believed to be considering an attempt to place the ordinance on a local election ballot as a voter initiative. As stated by Vice Mayor Reynolds, the proposed ordinance is based on, but not identical to, an ordinance placed on the local November 8th, 2022 ballot in the city of Sacramento. Council requested that I provide analysis. Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee! Committee Committee Committee placed on the local ballot by the City Council and the an ordinance can be placed on the local ballot by the voters if you have before you page 11 of the staff report as I mentioned I'll cut to the chase this is the chase that's page 11 B it's the council initiative procedure if you're looking for a recommendation from the city attorney this would be my recommendation you all have the power to put an ordinance that you feel comfortable with on the ballot my analysis goes into depth about the proposed ordinance that vice mayor Reynolds presented I addressed some of the legal challenges with that what would I be looking for from you today would be direction to carry out the council initiative procedure it's outlined on page 11 it's pursuant to 11 elections code section nine thousand two hundred twenty two and the council would directly place that ordinance on the ballot to be voted upon it as succeeding regular or special city election the process consists of the following steps the city drafts the ordinance the city adopts the ordinance or resolution to be placed on the proposed order and to place it on the next regular regular election and then upon a majority vote of the people the ordinance is enacted accordingly that concludes my report I'm of course available for any of your questions all right questions for mr. viewney I don't have any questions I would make a comment that I would like to continue forward with that and have the council initiative procedure but into place and I will give you a little bit further direction a little bit later but obviously when I hear from the public and get take input but I want to put up front that's but I would intend to is move forward with that item the council initiative procedure is done by next week procedure. Any further questions from Council for Mr. Yuen? Not at this time. Thank you, Mr. Yuen. All right, public comment? We have seven speakers. All right, three minutes. So I'm going to call two names, and if you could please go to the middle aisle. Robin Engel, followed by Katie Posey. I don't favor this voter initiative going to the ballot because we're talking about very abstract, subjective variables, such as, I mean, anything falling under quality of life and safety. For example, there were people across the street providing warm meals to some of our community. I saw that as beautiful. I argued with someone else here who saw it as ugly, and something that shouldn't be done. And so any and all of these variables are very open-ended, yet the way it's written up in such a convoluted, jumbled format that doesn't make sense shows the clear agenda, which was already clear to me. The agenda is to, again, demonize people who don't have homes. Why do we keep pushing on that agenda? We're already... already under lawsuit. We're inviting more lawsuits with this very specific initiative that, again, it criminalizes people for leaving trash or whatever is a human thing to do, but because there aren't enough trash cans available or porta-potties or whatnot, I mean, we're just going into dissecting, again, human beings who are not violating the laws. They are victims of the housing crisis. And you haven't been open to processing this. This is what the courts, what the judges have been telling you. We need to get in line with the laws. We are subject to more and more lawsuits, more and more hundreds of thousands of dollars. And so why open this can of worms up? It makes no sense. What is safe and beautiful to me is not what is safe and beautiful to any other single member of this community, even someone on my own side politically. So this is not the way to put out an initiative. This is not a way to survey people. It is simply a very poorly hidden agenda to further unconstitutional cruelty towards those who don't have housing. Thank you. Thank you. Katie Posey, follow-up. Followed by Rob Berry. Good evening again. So I appreciate the in-depth nature of the analysis of the Quality of Life Voter Initiative. I understand why some areas invite more analysis and discussion than others and should be revisited. And it was stated that any initiative would not be able to operate outside federal law. That's understandable. So that all makes sense. I suppose the question then is what kind of initiative would be used? Certainly, there is a Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee population and also reassure the entire community that they deserve clean parks and waterways and public spaces. If we're only operating from the perspective of, well, we can't do this and we can't do that and that hasn't been done, then I think that's a problem. So we need to return to the idea that there are solutions, but maybe we haven't thought of them yet because we're a unique community with a unique set of needs and challenges. That means there may be unique solutions that could nevertheless operate within the confines of federal law. The hard work, I believe, is taking the time to brainstorm and work on developing solutions that could be implemented, that's the key obviously, and potentially inviting other voices to come to the table. I think we do need to avoid the shutting down of the idea that's embedded in this and consider how we can cultivate a desire among all members of the community to think about what it would mean for the council to consider how to restore and enhance the quality of life. So at the last meeting, and this makes sense, some expressed concern over how to define certain policies that would be effective in the future. So I think we need to take the time to brainstorm about that. But I think that the council is well equipped to go forward with that if you were to come up with another initiative. You could probably provide a definition within the context of that initiative. I'm sure this challenge arises often, and maybe we need a different term, but I'd love to hear some solutions to that predicament. And in light of that, just going forward here, I think that there are two kinds of initiatives that we need to think about. One is that we need to The bottom of page three talked about there not being enough space to house entire unsheltered populations. So one question with that is what will you do if you run out of room? What's the exit strategy for those in the shelters? That's really another issue. But anyways, ending with rather than saying we can't do anything, let's think about the approach. It's difficult to do something like this within the confines of the settlement, but let's look at what we can do. Thank you. Thank you. Rob Berry, followed by Melody Probstall. I think this issue got complicated unnecessarily. I read Mr. Ewing's analysis. It was 14 pages of saying why this initiative could not be done constitutionally, legally, or in concert with the settlement agreement. Last... Meeting. You heard from a number of citizens that helped put this together, this idea. And it was championed by Casey. Casey participated in this. And the point here is that the people that spoke at the last meeting are all in Montana and Oregon enjoying their holiday. They're not here tonight. I don't know how the intent of this initiative can be redirected. And. Properly framed. If the public does not have an opportunity to speak for themselves about what this initiative is intending to do and what we need to accomplish. Now, I agree in one respect with Mr. Ewing, and that is that the initiative that was that was presented was probably too ambitious in terms of trying to define things that were not well defined. And so perhaps there's another process here that we need to engage in to get. The language. But so far tonight. I have yet to hear any suggestions. And my understanding of the motion that was made last week was for a template of some form of a ballot initiative be delivered for tonight's meeting so that that would be the content that we discussed. But all we've heard so far is a discussion of process and how an initiative gets on the ballot and so forth. Yet we're spending very little time actually examining what it. Is this initiative is intended to do. How it's framed and what the people are trying to accomplish by by introducing it. So I don't know when that opportunity is going to come up. But you know. I'm prepared to talk about that, but I can't do it in a three minute period. I hope you provide some opportunity for the community to speak for itself in terms of what it is that is trying to accomplish this. Thank you very much. Thank you. Melody. Postal followed. By. Jessica. Giannola. Good evening. I just wanted to say thank you to Mr. Ewing and his staff. I think that you did a really good job of reviewing and analyzing some important pieces in this proposal initiative. And I you know, I think that there could definitely be some productive discussion about what does quality of life look like? How do we get there? How do we make sure that the community is. Happy and healthy and safe and beautiful. I also want to make sure that we are not. As he said, you know, breaking going against constitutional law against city code against our current agreements in the courts. And also that we are not violating people's rights in terms of ability to have a place to sleep. So I really encourage you to. I don't know if it's a conversation, a bigger conversation. Similar to kind of what Mr. Barry was suggesting that we really define what does this mean and what are we trying to accomplish? Recognizing that. Putting putting people in legal jeopardy for not having a place to live is not the best solution for having quality of life in the community. But I appreciate the concept and thank you for bringing it forward. Thank you, Jessica. Giannola followed by Gina backs. Council. Gosh. So when it comes to this initiative or proposal, like I said last time, as added space, there's some pretty common sense pieces there that I think everybody agrees on. And we all want to have the clean parks and safe neighborhoods, safe streets. We all want that. And that that is, I believe, already. Right. Reflected in our mission statement as a city and as a community. And to take this extra step to have this specific publication put on the voter ballot. It's the pieces in between those common sense that give us pause and concern those parts where there's potential for a neighbor to be pitted against neighbor and opportunity for potentially for harassment at times because it's so. The verb is. So open and so vague that it's open to interpretation and it's not well defined. So we are asking for and I believe we will see if this is approved and passes. We're just looking at future lawsuits that that's more of our tax dollars in the end that we'll have to pay for something like this. But we can still take the meanings behind what this is brought forth. But we want to have more efforts put into making sure our city is safe. And we want to make sure that it's livable and safe for all of our community members. And looking for opportunities where we can do improvements. For accountability. We already have that. We already have that in forms of voting. We have it in forms of recall and extreme situations. I mean, we already have those forms of accountability in place. Having this specific thing voted in again is just going to put, I think, more we're going to be at more risk than benefit when it comes to this. I think it's down to it. Because we can read between the lines. We can see where there's opportunity that are going to occur. And it has to do with our population that's suffering without. And then with the rest of our population that's suffering because their quality of life has been impacted as well. So if we could as a city work with what we have. We have a great template already. We have great values down already. We have, you know, teamwork already here ready to go. And we have a lot of people who are willing to support us. We have a lot of people who are willing to help. And so if we could just redirect some of our efforts, we can solve, I think, a lot of our problems, our problem areas in town that will ripple out. And there's a chain effect when it comes to addressing specific needs that will help resolve all of our issues. Thank you. Thank you. Gina Bax followed by Patrick Newman. Good evening. I'm here to request a town hall for the quality of life initiative presented by Reynolds. a couple of meetings ago, so regular citizens like me can understand the pros and cons of this proposal and work on possible changes based on community input. Thank you. Thank you. Patrick Newman is our last speaker. If I was the cynical type, I might think that this was being put on the ballot as a way to get your constituents motivated to return those ballots for city council positions. In other words, this plays to the whole hysteria, needles, feces, safety kind of mentality, and if it's on the ballot, you're going to draw those voters into the system, into the process. That seems devious and menacing, and manipulative. So on that level, I think there's something we ought to look at politically here about this, but then the other thing is if I go through it inch by inch and read this and then read the analysis, it's so fraught with problems on every level in terms of law, potential litigation, etc., etc., etc. I have to say it reads more like an opinion piece. than it reads to me like law. And if we talk about law, we are probably the most criminalized city in California already. We had the offenses against public property ordinance in 2015, and I remember walking out of the chamber and saying to Mark Sorensen, see you in court. Well, it took us until 2021 to get there, but we ended up in court. We ended up being sort of on probation of the Eastern District Court. Why? Because we pursued this path of trying to criminalize our way out of poverty instead of addressing poverty on a fair and equitable and just basis. That's what's going on here, and I think you pay your city attorney probably pretty well to give you legal advice. I think his legal advice on this is really sound. So we have to go back and say, well, given that we already have the information, we have done a fair, we have done a fair, we have done a fair, we have done a fair, we have done a fair, we have done a fair, we have done a fair, we have done a fair, we have done a fair, we have done a fair, we have done a fair, we have done a fair, we have done a fair, we have done a fair, we have done a fair, we have done a fair, we have done a fair, we have done a fair, we have done a fair, we have done a fair, pointee. He looked at our laws and he said, you guys are coloring outside the lines. This takes us even further in that direction. So on a strategic level, maybe I should be saying, go ahead and do this. Because what you're doing is you're giving material to those who are looking at the system from a constitutional point of view, and you're making Chico even more vulnerable to being attacked on the basis of a kind of hysteria that has to do with safety, but has nothing to do with the Constitution, et cetera. Thank you. Thank you. Last speaker. Council discussion. So I'll start. So the Sacramento Initiative is 16, 8, sorry, 10 pages. And two pages of it is definitions. Every definition from establish, maintain, operate, what a park is, what private property is, what public property is, what a store is, what a street is. So what I brought forward is a lot of things. I brought forward a lot of things. I brought forward a lot of things. I brought forward was a very, very vague framework to give to our legal team to get something started from. It was not all inclusive. It was not all, it did not have everything in it by any means. What I would like to do is to have our staff prepare and bring back. And I want to address one thing. The number one tenet in this is to use all legal means possible to maintain a beautiful quality of life in Chico. All legal means. So therefore, with that being given, nothing illegal can be done on its face. So it will take into consideration the settlement agreement, the Constitution, all these other things. Otherwise, why in the world would we vote for that and put that forward? So my motion would be to direct the city attorney to bring back a council initiative, to initiate the council initiative procedure, the adopted language, and I will email this to you, Debbie, but the adopted language should reaffirm the vision statement of a beautiful place to raise a family, safe place to raise a family, an ideal location for business, and a premier place to live. It should define the vision statement as an expression of the ideal supporting the desire for continually improving quality of life experiences for all Chico residents, not just our house. Further, define the quality of life as consisting of safety, cleanliness, beauty, and economic vitality, and establish the principles, actions, conduct, or mandate which protect these qualities so our city can mitigate conditions or conduct that represent a threat or injury to the goal of the vision and must hold itself accountable to the people. Establish a commission under the city charter whose mission is to ensure that the city's community is safe and secure. And I'm going to ask the city attorney to present his opinion on the proposed proposed action. The motion is to formulate the specific laws, actions, priorities, and procedures that are to become necessary to implement the intent to intention of this. So that is what I would like to direct our city attorney to do and to bring us back something and hopefully have it sooner than the August 2nd meeting so we can debate and discuss and, you know, whatever, get it back to us as soon as possible so we can have public input on that. So I want to thank you for your time. Thank you, Vice Mayor, for bringing this forward. As I mentioned at the last meeting, I do support this in concept. But I wanted to make sure that this was going to pass legal muster and thank you for putting this back on our city attorney and Vince. Thank you for a quick response, very detailed and comprehensive analysis. I appreciate that. And obviously the terms unconstitutional and unlawful got my attention. I think it got everyone's attention. I do not want to support something that really violates the very thing we're trying to uphold. So I agree and support your motion, Vice Mayor Reynolds, in finding language that is going to meet the vigor of our different documents such as the Constitution and the War and Settlement Agreement, but does uphold the principles of what this, I think, is trying to accomplish. So, I am going to second your motion. And, I guess, with that, a caveat, or maybe a question, of you, Vince, do you have enough to move forward with this, or do you need something a little bit more concrete. Thank you, Councilmember, O'Brien. I do have enough, going forward, just briefly, if I can recap, for the council, how this would look, and for the benefit of the public, and, also, for this record. So the council must adopt a resolution calling for the placement of the ordinance on the November 8th, 22 ballot. That's 88 days before the election. That would be on August 12th. So you would be taking action on August 12th. I will get you what your motion is considering before then. The resolution would have the proposed ordinance attached. It would call for placement on the ballot, a consolidation of the elections, and determine who must submit arguments for and against, and direct the city attorney to submit an impartial analysis. I will do all of that before August 12th. And then just based on the administrative record and legislative record of this body, the city of Chico typically does not hold a second meeting in the month of July. Just assuming that that is the case going forward, you would be... You would be looking to approve the resolution and place the ordinance on the ballot at your first meeting in August. That's August 2nd. Again, you will have the document as a council before then. I will caution you not to deliberate amongst yourselves to protect the Brown Act, but you certainly can deliberate one-on-one with me. So if you want to send me emails, call me up, talk to me, text me, whatever, just do it one-on-one, but don't engage in collective action so we can... avoid a serial meeting situation. Assume... And assuming that there's only one council meeting scheduled, if you wanted to take any further changes to the... or make any further changes to the ordinance that I will submit to you before placing on the ballot before the voters, you could have a special meeting and give... and give further direction before August 12th. So I wanted to make sure you understood the timeline and the outline going forward of what you're contemplating here with your motion. So I say yes to your question, Councilmember O'Brien. I do have what I need. Councillor O'Brien most eloquently said everything that I was thinking and wanted to say. I think the concept is great. But I do want to say thank you very much for bringing it forward. Obviously, it needs to be worked on and tweaked. I'm not going to say tweaked. I'm going to say worked on such that it doesn't violate the law, the Constitution or anything else. We can't... We couldn't do that. So I'm going to support it as well. So just one more time, thank you, Vice Mayor. Further comment? No. I actually have a question for Councilmember Morano. So you didn't write it, correct? No. Well, but is it taken all from Sacramento? Sorry. Yes, it is all... Sacramento's actually is much, much more extensive than what I brought forward. They have eight pages of things that... The definitions. But two pages of definitions. Okay. The most important, the outline for it, yes, was taken from the... And they're gathering signatures on it right now? I believe they already have their signatures and it's set for November. Okay. And Mr. Ewing, maybe I missed that in your report. Is that in there where Sacramento is on it or do you know? I do. It's on their ballot. They didn't do the voter initiative. They did the council process that I'm describing to you now that the motion on the floor now is considering or is pending. So... I'm just having a hard time believing that Sacramento had their attorneys write something like this and put it on the ballot. They're... That's why I asked you if you didn't... There's a difference. I will tell you that there's a difference. It's not identical to what was presented. So theirs is on the ballot and it was the council looked at something. They said, okay, we're going to have our city attorney's office draft this up and we'll put it on the ballot. That's what the council did. So it wasn't a voter initiative. There was a threat of a voter initiative that was before the council that basically they kind of were told either you adopt something or we will. And that's when the council sort of reacted that way. Oh. Okay. All right. Yeah. I'm just, you know, having read through this and then read your comments, it seems like it wasn't written by an attorney. So, no, we... What you have, the draft that you... That we analyzed was not the Sacramento document. We've spoken to the Sacramento City Attorney's Office about what they have on the ballot. It's a little different than what I analyzed. And so we've had that conversation. And do they have the $5,000 aspect in it? No. So what's theirs? Well, I mean, it's a longer document. I mean, I'm happy to provide you with another analysis of that. I'd love to see a copy of theirs too while we're looking at this. But no, they don't have the $5,000. Okay. Yeah. I think the biggest problem I have with this is that, A, it's subjective, and B, that the $5,000 seems ridiculous, like the perfect way to bankrupt the city. But... You know, particularly if you can't respond or if there's an emergency or something else going on. It's where a lot of my concern lies. So, I mean, I don't mind pursuing this and having a future statement, you know, future discussion about it. But in terms of him bringing back something, I think we have to tell him what to bring back. And I'm a little bit concerned with the $5,000 aspect in there and without any definition of it. And I think if we discuss that all on the first meeting of August and then try to make that determination that day and put it on the ballot and move forward, that's going to be a lift that's not possible. So, what's your thoughts? Just take off the $5,000 fine. Well... Everything doesn't make sense in any consideration. Okay. So, yes, if just... The most important part is a process for the citizens to be able to file their complaint. Whether there is a fine behind it or not, that is not my largest concern. My largest concern is there is a way for citizens to file a complaint. And mind you, not all complaints are considered the same, right? Something might be able to be addressed in 30 days. Some of them might be 90 days, 120 days and more. And that is also all specified in the Sacramento one. So, there's... So, maybe just get a copy of the Sacramento one. Well, yeah, if I may, Mayor Coolidge, the document that I will bring back to the City Council will be a document that we believe, based on our analysis, passes legal muster. Okay. And so that means complies with federal law, state law, local law, and any settlement agreements that may be in place. Okay. Yeah, I understood that. It's just there were some aspects of like the $5,000, which, you know... Agreed. Yeah. Okay. And so we have a motion on second. Added to that. Council Member Bennett? Yes. Council Member Morgan? Yes. Council Member O'Brien? Yes. Council Member Tandon? Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds? Aye. Mayor Coolidge? Aye. Carries 6-0 with one absence. All right. Okay. All right. So, our last one for tonight will be Item 5.5, Homeless Services. Chair, we're giving fund. And we have a report from Deputy City Manager Jennifer McCarthy. Good evening, Mayor Coolidge, Vice Mayor Reynolds, members of the Council. I'm Jennifer McCarthy, the Deputy City Manager. On May 17th, Council Member Tandon requested that the Council schedule a discussion regarding establishing a community fund to assist with the costs associated with providing services to the homeless. The Council unanimously approved bringing this item forward. And tonight, I will talk to you about some of the details of that program as proposed. As you know, thankfully, Chico is home to some very generous individuals and organizations. And as Council Member Tandon pointed out previously, we have been approached by individuals, by organizations and others that are asking how best to support the city's efforts related to homelessness. In response to that, staff contacted the North Valley Community Foundation to talk about how best to go forward with setting up a charitable giving fund. A copy of the fund agreement was provided in your staff report. The fund would be set up in such a way that members, individuals, or organizations would be able to support the city's efforts to support homelessness. And, as Committee member, Committee member, Committee member, Committee member, Committee member, Committee member, Committee member, Committee member, Committee member, Committee member, Committee member, Committee member, Committee member, Committee member, Committee member, Committee member, Committee member, Committee member, Committee member, Committee member, Committee member, Committee member, Committee member, Committee member, Committee member, Committee member, Committee member, Committee member, Committee member, Committee member, Committee member, the North Valley Community Foundation would handle all of the fund administration at a cost of five percent and that would be five percent of the funds collected so there would be no out-of-pocket expenses from the city if approved staff would work with North Valley Community Foundation to publicize the program get the word out there we would also go ahead and put information on the city's website about how and where individuals could contribute to such a fund so at this point I am happy to answer any questions you might have about the fund in general questions are they negotiable at all on their five percent did you ask them can they do two percent can they do three percent because that's money I am happy to go back and ask that question councilmember Reynolds that is a typical percentage that they charge for their charitable giving funds though but I'm happy to request that right any other thank you thank you we have three speakers Nicole Nava followed by Patrick Newman thank you good evening I really appreciated your comments because one of my questions was was this to defray the cost that some of the city is paying toward the pallet shelter other services because for me it seems prudent that those wanting to give do have a mechanism to give but I wasn't sure what the city's involvement is again it just kind of seemed like we were going in a path that concerned me because it's just like when are we going to be able to talk about getting back to infrastructure and other things rather than just this narrow area and like affordable housing needs attention and a lot of other topics um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um putting into it and then they're going to cut checks to the city to defray or however that works. So I also think it would be prudent to go back to them and ask if they can get in there in the lane with what others charge for similar services. I also am wondering whether there is maybe those people that approach the city, is there something if they have already like non-profit status or something like that could go and actually ask also for grant money to do some specialized thing at the pallet shelter otherwise that would help with the needs of the clientele there. I was able to do a tour recently and I am impressed with what Amber and her staff have been doing there. It was clean, people were calling out to each other and greeting, there were little things like I'm a person I was like hmm there's a generator running all the time if I was a homeless person trying to sleep in the pallet or rest or be in a space to be able to take steps forward. You know that's not great. Is there something we can do about that where it doesn't necessarily cost the city to flip the energy source or anything like that but maybe the community could do it. Maybe that's one area that something like this could do. We want the place to work for everyone. This was done so that we could all have a better quality of life. So I am encouraged that something's happening. And that they're able to kind of keep people there as well and happy to stay there. So I understand that's been going well. Just a quick plug that there also is a fund with NVCF with a bus program already there that the CPD has them administer which I believe is called help. So if people want to replenish that it helps get people reconnected with their loved ones if they live elsewhere and trying to get there. Thanks. Thank you. Patrick Newman followed by Jessica. NOLA? The problem I have with this is it's amorphous. It's like if you, maybe the city attorney answered this question. I don't know the answer to it. But can the city legally set up funds where someone can come to city hall and write a check for a particular department or fund in the city? Maybe that's not a legal thing to do. I don't know the answer to that. But if you're going to set something like this up at North. Valley. Whatever it's called. Set it up so that when someone makes a contribution it's targeted to a specific thing. So they know what they're donating to. When you throw it into a fund where it's some basket and there's some kind of arcane process where somebody behind the scenes at a board decides where it's all going to go. You really don't know what you're giving to. So if you narrowed this down to the pallet shelters and you said okay there's going to be a fund. Okay. North Valley Charitable Foundation. Specifically for the pallet shelter. That would give a donor a clear idea of what they're donating to. And so as they went along. As the reputation and whatever of the place develops. People will have a clear idea whether they're supporting something they support or not. And if they want to put money into that fund. It's a way to fund that particular thing as opposed to putting their money into Torres or some other program. Not clear enough. What's going on here. Too many layers. So that's, that's, right away, I think, is something that should be addressed. The other thing is that, ah, since we're talking about the pallet shelter, and this money does talk about that, um, I did go out there, and, what's transformative about that program is that there's people who have not been able to lock a door for years. who have some sense of security and safety in those spaces. I don't think it's a model program. I think there's problems with it. But for a certain person, that will meet their needs pretty well as housing. And you're probably not going to like hearing that because you're going to think, no, this is a stepping stone. We're supposed to get the picket fence and the job. These are people largely with disabilities who need the most rudimentary housing possible, and this works for that. Having said that, I'll just say one more time, I don't believe in putting a gun to anybody's head. Make these programs good enough so that people want to use them and expand so that you don't have to use coercion, you don't have to use criminalization, you don't have to use all kinds of extraordinary means to get people corralled. People will use these things if they're good, and people on the streets know when something's good. And at the end of the day, there will be people who need more resources to deal with what they've got going on than they've ever had before. And something like that will ever provide. And that's a whole other question, and we're failing on that, too. Thanks. Thank you. Jessica Giannola is our last speaker. Thank you, Council. Just want to thank you for bringing something like this forward. We have a lot of volunteers in the community that has been utilizing their time and limited resources for many years, and any resource, that is shared is appreciated. I did want to also suggest, well, there's a couple of things. There's like a wish list maybe opportunity where maybe that foundation had like a wish list up there where things are needed, specific needs, so people could buy something specific if they felt more like they were participating in that realm by doing that. And I think that's a great point. I would like to see if this is possible, an opportunity for reimbursement for people who are already or in continuing to service our unhoused population with their limited means, whether they need receipts or proof in some manner, whatever it might be, people are using their last dimes to share with someone who has nothing. And if we do have funding that could help compensate so that they, you know, have a chance to get a job, then that's a great opportunity. I don't know. Just so it's kind of easing that burden on each individual, if that's an opportunity with this type of program that you're talking about, this funding donation. I think that's it. Yeah. Just thank you for suggesting it. All right. Council comments or, oh, do we have anyone else? No, we're good. All right. Council comments? I just want to ask a quick question. Could you clarify? Can you clarify on how, like Mr. Patrick asked today, about how do people know what they're donating for? Certainly. Thank you for the question, Councilmember Tandon. The funds can be used for any direct operating costs associated with the pallet shelter or any other site that the city has designated to house the homeless. So, for instance, the Eaton and Cohasset site or the pallet shelter would now be the only two sites that these funds are going to be used for. And then the other two sites that the city has would be associated with because it is city-funded sites. That being said, the city has a fund that has been created that we track all of the expenses associated with this, with our homeless endeavors. We would be providing the North Valley Community Foundation with receipts for specific expenses associated with that. It is not, we will provide information on what an example contribution could go to, if we are to limit it to, if we say it's going to go to food or you say it's going to go to showers, it becomes a really difficult tracking mechanism, especially because this is a charitable giving foundation. So if, so for an example, like, does, will it specify that if you donate $100, it will provide 20 meals? So some kind of quantitative, so when somebody's donating, they know what exactly that money could accomplish? Yes, we can provide examples. So absolutely, on our website, we can say X amount donation could go towards a month's worth of meals for X amount of people, or laundry services for one individual for a year. We can provide those types of examples, and I think that would be very helpful for the public. Thank you. All right, further comment from Council of the question? Well, I'm very happy you brought this forward. I think this is a smart move, and thanks, staff, for working on it. I just wanted to say thank you. Thank you, Committee Committee. Thank you, Committee Committee. Thank you, Committee Committee. Thank you, Committee Committee. Thank you, Committee Committee. Thank you, Committee Committee. Thank you, Committee Committee. Thank you, Committee Committee. Thank you, Committee Committee. Thank you, Committee Committee. Thank you, Committee Committee. Thank you, Committee Committee. Thank you, Committee Committee. Thank you, Committee Committee. Thank you, Committee Committee. Thank you, Committee Committee. Thank you, Committee Committee. Thank you, Committee Committee. Thank you, Committee Committee. Thank you, Committee Committee. Anything added after the agenda? Nothing. Six reports and communications. So included. 6.1, city manager's report. Interim city manager, Hahn. Yes. With your approval of Mr. Sorensen's contract, this is my last meeting. And I just want to say thanks to the council. As a city manager, and I've been doing this for a long time in the county, it is not always where you get a council that has been supportive. Professional, recognizing sort of the role differences between what the city manager has and does and what the council does. And you have been just perfect from my perspective as a council to work with in a professional manner. And I want to say thank you to that. I also want to say thank you to the people that are sitting across the table over there and the ones that are surrounding me here. Anything that has happened good. Anything that has been good in the last three months that I've been here is because of them and these folks around here. You have an incredibly professional staff. They know their stuff. I walked in at a time of a lot of turmoil, and they made me feel welcome. Gave me a lot of support to catch up. And I just want to say thank you. And if Mr. Sorensen has the support of the council like I have had, and the staff like I've had, the city is going to be in good hands. So thank you. Thank you. All right. Item 6.2, council member requests. Pursuant to AP and B-1010, council members may request any item at this meeting. The agenda is a future meeting. After sitting with the item, the majority of council is needed. In order for staff to agendize, council members may also submit requests in writing. Do we have any? Going once, going twice. All right. Monthly financial and budgetary reports are included. And with that, we will adjourn this meeting. Council, we had closed session earlier. So we will adjourn. Adjourn. Come on. Thank you very much. Yes. Thank you. Thank you. Sorry for the payout. Already in the bag.
