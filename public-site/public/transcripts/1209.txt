First up would be chair and do I have any nominations for that position? Yes, Mr. Chairman, I would like to nominate vice chair Tony Scott to serve as our new chair. Thank you. Any other nominations? I would like to nominate I would nominate, let' s see, how about Maggie as our vice chair? Is that a nomination? Yes. Okay. Any other nominations for vice chair? Seeing none, the nominations will be closed. Clerk, would you do a roll call vote? This will be confirming both the chair and the vice chair. The chair will be Tony Scott and the vice chair will be Maggie Scarpa. Commissioner Wolfe? Aye. Commissioner Wall? Aye. Commissioner Sharp? Aye. Aye. Aye. Commissioner Scott? Aye. Commissioner Scarpa? Aye. Commissioner Loffins? Aye. Okay, we have two new commissioners. Commission chair and vice chair. Time to change seats here. Oh, I can say her. You got it. Okay, I' m a little rusty though. So, I would like to nominate the collection of the architectural review and historic preservation board subcommittee. And how many do we need on that? Two. Okay, any nominations for that? Because I believe commissioner Wolfe is already seated on that and you need to just replace two people. So, we' re going to still have you stay on that, is that correct? That would be my pleasure. Okay. Okay. So, we need two nominations? You do need two. And if you nominate a couple and then you just do a roll call vote, you could have individuals volunteer for it or you can just appoint. Okay. Do you have any nominations? I would nominate commissioner Loffins. Okay, commissioner Loffins. Does that sound okay? I missed what it was. The architectural review and historic preservation board. And then I' ll nominate commissioner Wall. Okay. Any additional nominations? So, we' ll close the nominations and go do we need to have a vote on that? If you could. Okay, so let' s have a roll call vote, please. Commissioner Wolfe? Aye. Commissioner Sharp? Aye. Commissioner Scott? Aye. Commissioner Scarpa? Aye. Commissioner Loffins? Aye. Great. So, we' ll move to item two, the consent agenda. All matters listed under the consent agenda are considered routine and will be enacted by one motion. Do I have a motion to approve? Move to approve. Second. We have a motion commissioner Wolfe and a second by commissioner Wall. All in favor signify by saying aye. Aye. Any opposed? So, that motion carries six-zero with one absence. Item three, public comments. Members of the public may address the commission at this time on any matter not already listed on the agenda with comments being limited to three minutes. The commission cannot take action at this meeting on requests made under this section of the agenda. Do we have any public comments? We do not. Great. Okay. Item four, public hearings and I will ask for ex parte communications if we have any on item 4.1 or 4.2 and I' ll start to my left. No. No. No. No. No. No. All right. So, we have none. So, item 4.1, parcel map 24-03. And plan development permit 24-01. And I' ll turn it over to city staff. Good evening. Just give me one moment to get this up. All right. Good evening, everyone. My name is Molly and I will be the staff member presenting the staff report tonight. The applicant requested that the request approval of a plan development permit and a parcel map to divide an approximately 1.4 acre site into three parcels for residential development. The site is located on the northwest corner of intersection of cactus avenue and rusty lane. The site is designated low density residential in the general plan land use diagram and is zoned low density residential with an airport overflight zone C and SD design standards for cactus avenue. The site is located on the northwest corner of A plan development permit is a specific requirement of the SD7 overlay zone. The parcel map would subdivide the site into three parcels each taking access from private rusty lane. The required improvements include construction of a new rolled curb, gutter, and sidewalk and a parkway strip along the north side of rusty lane. Although note number 6 on the map indicates that no subdivision modifications are proposed, the map does request a subdivision modification be a modification of subdivision improvement standards to forgo the installation of sidewalk and parkway strip on the south side of rusty lane. The conceptual architecture design of the homes is derived from contemporary farmhouse with a modern palette of contrasting neutral colors to be consistent with the surrounding architectural design. Roofs are composition shingles and the developer has proposed the homes to be built as a single story residential. The project is categorically exempt from environmental review pursuant to section 1533 of California environmental quality act infill development projects and with that staff recommends adoption of resolution number 2502 approving parcel map 2503 and plan development permit 2401 subject to the conditions in the staff report. We would like to recognize the I' m happy to answer any questions. any questions from the commission? I have one, yes. Maybe this would be for you. The st overlay requires the street lights be low level. You can see them out there right now. I don' t know if there will be any street lights in this subdivision. I didn' t see any. m sure that whatever street lights might be installed would be consistent with that requirement. they' re listed in the subdivision report the requirements for street lights. They' ll follow the specifications of the title 18 standards. Specifically if there' s a requirement for them to be specific to that overlay we' ll follow those requirements. I would maybe then suggest just put a comma on that condition. And as consistent with the st7 overlay zoning requirements. I' m sorry I' ll work that into a motion later. Any other questions? Okay. Thank you. And we will open the public hearing and begin with the applicant. Do we have any questions? Any public comments? I do not. Do not? All right. I will close public hearing. Bring it back to the commission. Any motions? Questions? Looks like a very straight forward parcel map. Unless any commissioners have any further questions or comments I would move to adopt the resolution with the change to the condition with respect to street lights that the street lights be designed to be consistent with the st7 overlay zoning requirements. I' ll second. Before we jump into discussion I have an issue with the omission of the sidewalks. But would we be can we discuss it now or would we need a motion to discuss? We can discuss that right now. Okay. I don' t really like the proposed modification to omit the sidewalk. Sidewalk is a dedicated space for pedestrians. It improves accessibility and mobility. It can improve aesthetics for a neighborhood as well as potentially let' s see. It potentially create more opportunities for social interaction. Specifically I' m really interested in the safety and the accessibility. m not sure if I can support the proposed modification to omit the sidewalk. I do have a motion or an amended motion to remove the requested omission. That' s why I wanted to talk about motion before we go into yours. I see. Okay. Perhaps we could get some comment from staff on that as to the basis for the. As those additional parcels there is a direct condition of this parcel map to install sidewalk that' s not on their development. Additionally the neighbors who do own those three lots did not want sidewalk. That was actually a comment of the neighborhood meeting. They just wanted the world curb and would like to install that as they' re futurely sold or developed. I' ll also note that it' s at the end of a cul-de-sac. The! develop our standards but we can require the future parcels to develop or install that. I do believe our standards say sidewalk or parkway ship on either side. If I' m not mistaken. in this case that doesn' t include these parcels or the parcel involved is constructing standards on the side of the street per the city requirement? the subject parcel map is constructing their city standard frontage. I' m trying to address the concern commissioner scarpa had we were deviating from our standards by eliminating the sidewalk. I think what I' m hearing is we' re not. I might defer to mike but I don' t think we necessarily are as we' re looking at it for this subject map. thank you. it' s a unique situation because rusty lane is entirely substandard and they wouldn' t be able to build their frontage as they would normally be able to increase the size of an existing county road and build the sidewalk on their side. In this case the entire street is missing so they have to build the entire street section to make the project work only they' re asking to omit the sidewalk sidewalks that are accommodated by the sidewalk they have on their own side. It' s an exception to the standards but it' s an acceptable one because we know we can get that future sidewalk in the future if property on the south does the same thing. We' re not trying to give up on sidewalks here we' re just saying this is the right amount of sidewalk for this project. thank you. I' m okay with that. I just live in an area without sidewalks and it can be frustrating and there' s issues with accessibility. re okay with it the way it' s being proposed here. commissioner wolf could you restate the motion? yes. I move to approve with the modification of the subdivision report condition concerning streetlights just to add the phrase streetlights to be designed consistent with the st7 overlay requirements. number 25-02 approving parcel map 24-03 and plan development permit 24-01 subject to the attached conditions and the additional condition that the streetlights are consistent with the st07 overlay. all right. any further discussion? this is considered infill is it not? no. it is. it is? okay. all in favor no roll call. sorry. commissioner wolf. aye. commissioner wall. aye. commissioner sharp. aye. commissioner laffins. aye. vice chair scarpa. aye. chair scott. aye. thank you. thank you. we'll move to item 4.2 code amendment 24-02 general plan amendment 22-01. rezone 22-01. and architectural review 22-03. before we jump into the staff report, just want to make everybody aware I am a lease holder within the state of california. area for my office, for my business. I did confer with the deputy city attorney on this matter. I believe that I can render an opinion on this that is unbiased. although I am within 500 feet I don't own the property and really have no vested interest in the outcome. I believe that I can render an thank you. I will turn it over to you. thank you chair scott and members of the planning commission. my name is tina wilson and I am the project planner for this particular item, item 4.2. and I will jump right in. this is the project site. it is located on the southwest corner of series and lassen avenues. it is designated office mixed use in the general plan. it has multiple zoning. it is office residential or. and then it has multiple overlays. it is airport overflight b1 mostly but also b2. and I will get into that. I will jump right in. this is a fairly large slide here showing the surrounding area. I will bring your attention to the gray area. that is the airport. area of mainly the runway. that is the pink area. that is all or. and then you will see the project site. it is that corner there. again the two acre parcel. so the project proposal is the hubbard apartments. it is a code amendment 2402. general plan amendment 2201. rezone. architectural review. the commission is considering an application for building a multi-family housing development consisting of 39 dwelling units. two acre parcel. it is located on the southwest side of the airport. it is about 1.2 miles from the airport runway. this is the main runway of the chico regional airport. here is another slide. that is showing the compatibility zones of the airport. now the main issue here is we are trying to be consistent with the butte county airport land use compatibility plan. we are trying to be consistent with the podem effectively. effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively 0.2 dwelling units in the B2, not 19.5 dwelling units per acre. So it's way beyond the density that's allowed. These areas are showing that these are geographical areas for the airport. Area A, these are areas for safety for the airport. B1, B2, C1, D, they're geographical areas for safety, for noise, risk areas for the airport. This is for land use compatibility. We analyze these areas for different uses and how close different uses can be to the airport. In analyzing this particular project, the applicant in the project description has proposed to eliminate most of our overlay zones for airport safety. Completely eliminating the airport environs and airport overlay zones, not just for this project, but this would affect all... all of the projects completely. For any project. We wouldn't have these safety areas anymore. Not just for this project. Again, this is for safety. This is what we're considering tonight. So this is from our airport layout plan. City's airport layout plan. In black and white. On the slide, you'll see the project site. And again in yellow, the area A. And then you can see B1 and orange B2. So I want to give you a sense of the timeline of this project. It's been around a while. The applicant submitted a zoning verification letter back in 2021. We strive to process applications and get to this point. Recommending approval. It's very rare that we recommend denial of projects. We try to recommend approval of projects. The applicant submitted general plan amendment rezone and use permit. Actually, we had some city code amendments. City initiated code amendments that rendered the use permit portion no longer even... We actually took the use permit out of this application. It wasn't needed anymore because we had other code amendments. I don't need to really get into that in detail. But suffice it to say, the use permit's not even part of the project anymore. It's just a general plan amendment rezone and architectural review. We're trying to understand from the applicant what they're trying to get at. Because the general plan and rezone, what they're trying to convey to us, we couldn't even get there with the density. It just didn't make sense. And so then the project description of just eliminating our overlay zone completely for airport environs and airport overflight, you'll see the 10-page project description just deleting the overlay zones. Okay. And so that was in April of 2024 that we finally had this project description. So we moved forward to the airport land use commission in September of 2024, then the airport commission in October of 2024. We received a letter from Caltrans Aeronautics that is attached to the staff report strongly recommending that the city deny this project. And now here we are at the planning commission. And here we are. The community development director and Chico Airport Commission recommend that the planning commission hold a public hearing and adopt resolution number 2501, recommending that the city council deny code amendment 2402, general plan amendment rezone 2201, and architectural review 2203. I do want to note that we did not receive any public comments on this project. We did receive some questions that we did respond to, but no public comments. I'm happy to answer any questions that you might have. Are there any questions from the commission for staff? Commissioner Wolff? Yes, I would have a question, Tina, not so much for you, but I see our airport manager is here with us this evening. And perhaps, Tom, could you just give us a perspective on this project? How this project might affect airport operations and our opportunities for securing air service in the future? I'd be happy to comment on that. First of all, like I say, the fantastic job that the staff has done on presenting this to you on reasons why this is just not a good idea to move forward with. Our airport, it's not going to stay stagnant. It's going to be one that's going to continue to grow. It has grown. Operations are increasing. We've increased the amount of businesses that are operating. We're bringing out of there tankers that fly large jets that will be filled with retardant at times and water at times heavy. And it's a safety risk as a potential. I'm not saying anything is going to happen, but there's always that possibility. And increasing the amount of residents that are living within a potential hazardous area is just not a good plan. In addition to that, we are bringing air service back. It's not a matter of if it's coming. It's a matter of when. And our goal is to have it be very soon. And we will continue to do that. And we will continue to do that. And we will continue to do that. And we will continue to do that. Thank you. And maybe a follow-up question on the planning side of things. I know the city worked for a long time developing a uniform consistency with the ALUC plan. And that really streamlined the project review process. And if we were to go back to the past, and make this change to the code, that would all go away, as I understand it. And we'd have to go back project by project to ALUC and go through all that process on a one by one basis. Is that right? That's correct. Thank you. I do have one question, and I'm not sure who is the best to answer it. Maybe if anyone could go into detail about the noise and safety risks. I'm a little bit familiar about airport land use compatibility. But I'm not sure if anyone is familiar with it. But I wanted to know a little bit more about the safety risks. And like I said, I've looked it up, but I'm no expert. I'm no expert. I'd be happy to chime in on that. I'd be happy to chime in on that. Noise, so this area is right underneath the flight path approach and take off path for the airport. Noise, so this area is right underneath the flight path approach and take off path for the airport. We already get complaints about noise at times. We already get complaints about noise at times. And there are rules that pilots have. Sometimes they don't always follow them. But we work on that to reduce noise for the community. And especially a growing community as Chico is. Now if you have a problem with the airport, effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively the airport. The airport is not a likelihood but accidents do happen. Generally when accidents happen in aviation it' s on take off and landing and sometimes aircraft land short and sometimes they take off and engine fails and they can' t get back to the runway and they' going to put it down in an area where it' s going to be the least populated area and populated or at least congested and areas where homes are not the best. thank you. you' re welcome. any other questions? thanks tina. we will open the public hearing and we will begin with the Scott hubbard. good morning councilors. I believe I would like to be the second person to wish you congratulations too. in a nutshell as tina indicated there are multiple airport zones. a, b1, b2, c and d. they are based on the size of the airport and the number of flights. bigger airports bigger zones. for example, orville municipal has a smaller zone than LAX. so when chico right now, chico has a flight total of 32,000 I'm going to round it up. 32,000 flights per year. when there was a when we had commercial air traffic here and I'm fully supportive of bringing united back. I was a 1k member flew out of here four or five times a week. I love 1k. when united was here we had 43,000. we had a total of 33,000 flights a year. right now we are at 32. we will probably be back up to 43,000 once the once the commercial comes back. by comparison, sacramento, international sacramento, two terminals, international flights, 12 carriers. 300 flights a day. that one is about 100,000 flights per year. roughly twice as big as chico on the airport. when they crafted the boundaries for b1 and b2, aluck assumed there would be 140,000 flights into chico every year. 50% more than sacramento right now. three times more than when chico was its busiest. and four times more than what it is right now. now, we are at effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively just should. They made projections. They drafted boundaries that were too big for the size of the airport. And so that's why this is going. And Tina has worked with us. We tried. And I don't want to gut the entire ALUC. I would much rather just do a stipulation with the city. Other cities have done it. San Luis Obispo comes to mind. So is Irvine. This happens a lot. And property owners just do stipulations so that their particular parcel is adjusted. And that's my ultimate goal. So how I get there, I don't care. But sooner or later, it's got to be adjusted. It just does. And that's all, though. Unless you have any questions, I'll submit. Any questions for the applicant? Thank you. Thank you. Any other public comment? Norm Rosen is our last speaker. Welcome. Thank you. I've never been able to address the Planning Commission. So thanks for having me. My name is Norm Rosen. I am a pilot that flies in and out of Chico for several years. And I also was chairman of the Airport Land Use Commission in the early 2000s when we created the BCD zones. So I can speak a little bit about the comments that Scott just made. Scott? Scott. Scott. The B zones and the A zones are in areas where aircraft are below the traffic pattern level. So the traffic pattern at Chico for smaller aircraft is 1,000 feet above the ground. So it's 1,200 feet because the airport elevation is about 200 or 200 and something. The B zones are specific, if you look, to the traffic pattern and the altitude in the traffic pattern. And then that relates to both noise and safety. As Tom said, the majority of accidents at airports or in aviation in general are on the approach ends and the takeoff ends. So you're either landing and coming down at low power settings or you're taking off at high power settings. Those are when pilots have the most issues because they're doing a lot of stuff. They're dropping flaps, raising flaps, changing engine settings. And they're at low altitude. So if something happens, they don't have a lot of time or altitude to play with. So the safety zones at Chico were based on the current traffic at the time we did it, which was in about early 2000s, late 1990s. We had Aero Union at the time flying out, so we had more airport operations than we do now. But we just brought in Aero Flight, and they're going to be flying their Q400. And they're super scoopers and all of that. So the airport traffic is going to be pretty equivalent. And it was never based on 140,000. I don't know where that figure came. We would never have looked ahead and thought we were going to have more traffic than SAC International. But even based on the traffic that we had at the time and the accident scatter report for the airport and the Part 150 noise study that was done, it was all based on the airport. And projected activity. But not 140,000. So I guess what I'm saying is that the B zones and the A zones are there based on kind of what is going on now with again the extra flights we're going to get someday for commercial. And also the flights that Aero Flight's going to have for firefighting. And with that I'd just like to say the reason I came is to support the airport. And it's a good thing. s a bad idea to put residential especially high density residential in the flight path it' s both dangerous and noisy and when I was on the airport land use commission we got lots of noise complaints from both ends of the runway as it was and that' s what we' re trying to protect is our valuable asset that we have here in the airport. thank you. can I ask you a quick question you mentioned the altitude if you were flying over this property what would your approximate altitude be with all of your experience coming in and out? the pattern altitude like I said is about 1,000 feet above the ground and over this part of in this path as far as landing goes you' re below 1,000 probably between 6 and 800. it is a little bit more difficult to get to the ground varies according to the aircraft and the winds and all of that but you' re definitely in the B zone is going to be below the traffic pattern altitude and that is 1,000 feet and that' s why it' s noisier so if you looked at the noise study you' ll see that as you come down especially because the takeoff noise is greater because everyone' s at full power that noise if you measured it as a color density it would be a lot more noise density. it' s very dense and then gradually fades and in this part of the traffic pattern it' s still pretty bright color and I don' t know if you guys got to look at noise studies but they' re really quite interesting and they follow the traffic pattern for the airport and when I was on the airport land use commission people would come and say can' t you just move the pattern over can' t you move it and you can' t your infrastructure is the runway everything is predicated around that and the FAA has standard patterns and you can' t vary those patterns so you' re kind of stuck and the airport is so valuable you really don' t want to mess with it. can I ask one more follow-up question too at 600 to 800 feet when you' re a pilot and let' s just say there are 34 extra units what can you see from that can you see kids playing with flashlights or headlights? you can see people at that when you' re getting down to 600 feet you can see people you can see everybody pretty close it' s not like that' s really very high it' s not and the pilot though is not looking at that he' s looking at the runway and doing his pilot stuff adjusting his power settings adding some flaps he' s doing things or on takeoff he' s looking at his gauges making sure his oil pressure is fine making sure both engines or one engine are running correctly so they' re very busy that' s why if there is a phase of flight where accidents happen it' s going to be on approach and it' s going to be on takeoff. thank you any other questions commissioner scarpa? I do have one thing to add I pulled up the butte county airport land use commission plan and b1 is only 200 to 400 feet above runway elevation where b2 is 600 plus. that could be okay thank you very much. thank you. any other public comments? no. anybody here want to say anything? okay so we will close the public hearing and bring it back to the commission. any discussion? we' re very quiet today. well I' go ahead and jump in. it' s a tough one because we definitely need the housing this is exactly the kind of housing we do need. unfortunately this site isn' t the right one for it and the kinds of changes that would be necessary to allow it are really great and would be problematic to say the least and could compromise our ability to make the most of this tremendous got in the form of the airport. I can' t see supporting these changes. I also echo that sentiment before looking at what zone the airport zone it was I was generally looking to support it but there' s a couple of issues that I see is the inconsistencies with the airport land use compatibility plan and the city' s general plan where every project after this would have to go to the butte county airport land use commission as well as noise isn' t my primary concern we do have housing along the railroad but safety is a really big thing for me which could include aircraft accidents obstruction hazards other things and potentially emergency response access. I' m feeling the same way. any other comments? it is interesting when you look at this map that if there' because this is an accurate arrow going right towards the subject property that does seem obviously unsafe but I find it interesting that I don' t know 50 yards away to the west is another apartment complex high density. Just more of a comment because it is maybe these this guidelines were not in place at the time of the building I think they were built because I believe those have been there since the 1980' s. tough one. it' s a tough one. I do have one other small thing and it' s more longer range planning maybe this parcel should' be zoned office mixed use or office residential it doesn' t really seem like residential is something that this parcel or the surrounding one should be. I also looked it up b2 is incompatible with multi-family residential and apartments. That' s sort of an off thing. any motions? I' m ready. I' ll say a couple of things first. this project is the wrong project in the wrong place. It doesn' t go along with any aloc dictation. s not a good place at all. s just a bad place to put a project of this nature. With that I' ll move to the planning commission adopt resolution 2501 recommending that the city council deny code amendment 24-02 general plan amendment and rezone 22-01 and architectural review 22-03. a second? I' ll second. all right. So we have a motion from commissioner wall and a second from commissioner laffins that the planning commission adopt resolution number 25-01 recommending that the city council deny code amendment 24-02 general plan amendment rezone 22-01 and architectural review 22-03. Any further comments? All right. Roll call vote. commissioner wolf? aye. commissioner wall? aye. commissioner sharp? aye. commissioner laffins? aye. vice chair scarpa? aye. chair scott? aye. so that motion passes 6-0 with one absence. regular agenda there' s none. reports and communications? do you have anything for us, mike? yes. just briefly, I want to welcome and congratulate the newly appointed planning commissioners and the reappointed planning commissioners. I' ll reach out to the arhpb members separately in a future e-mail. I want to make sure everybody' s aware of an e-mail that I did send out to all of you and many others about the extension of the time to comment on the barber yard specific plan environmental impact report. that' s going to run now until march 7th. thank you. there' s a couple more weeks. the deadline was today. but another couple of weeks. if anybody has submitted letters, they can submit another letter. they have another couple of weeks. that' ll be coming to the planning commission in a few months. and we anticipate your next meeting is going to be march 20th. and that concludes my report. thanks. mike, are you aware, I should have asked when debbie was here, but is there any sort of formal recognition that commissioner poland and commissioner cooper will receive now that they' ve stepped off? I will get with debbie and get back to you on that. all right. thanks. adjournment. yay. we did it. our first meeting. congratulations. thank you. . . . . .
