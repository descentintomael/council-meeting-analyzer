I am pleased to be here tonight to present on a project that has long been identified as a priority for the city and the fire department dating back to 2003 when then former chief Steve brown initiated the planning process for two new stations. one of which would have been built at hicks avenue and eaton road where this project station six is anticipated to be located. tonight I will provide background and contact information on the impacts for why the new station is critically needed in this section of town and for the fire department as a whole. our consultant mike scott is here tonight and he and his team from rrm design group were retained to facilitate the design process and to draft the final feasibility report you received yesterday. mike is here tonight to expand on key elements to the report describing the design process. detailing the safety and functional features incorporated into the station design. explaining different options the team evaluated. reviewing the cost estimates for each design. talking about the alternative designs and the challenges they present. we also have jacques voss the city fire department who will he is the city's facility manager who may be able to answer questions that mike nor I may be able to answer. so as background today station six is an even greater priority than it was in 2003. and in fact it is one of two of our highest strategic priorities. we have a long term plan for we consider an immediate improvement to our response model. station six is a longer term and longer time frame for us to get it built and staffed. both strategic priorities are essential for addressing the issues that adversely impact our community and will improve the safety and well-being of our response times due to the geographic response gaps notably in the northern areas of the city. and it will add much needed capacity to our response model for small and large emergencies alike and where the department is critically deficient in. so when we look at the change in our community as council members I know you are acutely aware how our city has changed from 2000 to today. one of the most startling changes is the extraordinary growth the community has experienced over almost 25 years. much of that has been within the northern sections of chico and the northern parts of the state where annexation and development have occurred both on the east and west side of the eaton corridor. as you can see our population in 2000 was 60,000 and now we are up to 110 as of january 1st, 2024. an 81% increase in our population in that period of time. it is pretty extraordinary when you look at it that way. likewise with population growth also usually comes or is correlated to increased service demands and the fire department is also impacted by that as well. in 2005 we ran 7500 calls and then last year in 2024 we doubled that to 15,000 calls for service. 100% increase in that period of time. that puts a lot of stress and demand on our people and our community. resources generally speaking. prior to the 2008 financial collapse we had six stations staffed. cal fire had three stations that also contributed to the response model and we were at 22 firefighters per shift. during that period of time chief brown was in the process of starting the construction of the fire department. and today we are down two stations where when we closed station 3 and station 6 due to the financial calamity. and likewise cal fire shuttered its station at 42 where it had been a significant response unit for the city. and we are down to 17 firefighters plus one battalion chief. what that has done is it has created a big gap in the service available to the upper part of our city. and our time analysis indicates that the red areas in the circles and the ovals indicate response or drive times that are four minutes or above where the blacks are over six minutes. that is not inclusive of the time it takes to dispatch the call and the time it takes to dispatch the call. and we are down to the north area where we have! effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively City staff. I'll now just walk through the process that we have gone through with the Fire Department and the City and show you where we're at today. First of all, we started off with a design committee that had the members from the City Fire Department and members of City staff and then members from the RM team. The graphic on the right shows you what we call a space needs outline that identifies the size and number of each spaces needed in a facility such as a fire station to give us a grand total square footage. We then take that and we looked at the site and made sure, first of all, that that size station could fit with the circulation that fire trucks need to come in safely and out safely on a site. That's the number one thing we look at is safe response for the community when firefighters are responding. We then looked at the needs of the site, looking at the rear apron that is secure by fencing, where firefighters can park and the apparatus can return, a front apron that responds far enough away from the corner where the roundabout is, and recognizing certain site features like existing overhead power lines that we need to address. As we look at the design of the station, there's some main components of a fire station that we have colored in red and blue. We have a fire station that we have colored in red and blue. We have effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively their kitchen dining day room is then into the green area where the firefighter dorm rooms and sleeping uh are sleeping rooms and uh restrooms are and then the yellow is the exercise room where the firefighters do their uh their personal fitness uh one thing to note is uh the trends for fire station design today is to make sure that the the sleeping quarters and restroom facilities are inclusive so that it uh regardless of what the gender orientation of a firefighter is there's privacy uh and that that provides inclusivity and privacy for long term for the fire department different from the old dorm style fire stations that we might have recognized something that is also uh very important and a very large trend for fire station design today is protecting the firefighters from the harmful carcinogens that they face in their job making sure they don't bring those back into the firehouse where they sleep so we have we we call this the hot zone design where we have um um! uh the red area is where you park your apparatus uh and the green area the clean zone is where the firefighters live and the very important thing is that between those two areas there's these two vestibules that we've coated in yellow they're positively pressured so all the air is always flowing from the clean side of the house into the hot area where we call it hot because that's where the fire trucks are and the equipment is that have uh some of those uh the soot that might have come back uh from the call firefighters are cleaning that off and they're going to be able to get effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively! effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively build process so we're preparing bridging documents that will be then be given to a design build team so we looked at three different character image boards the first one being a craftsman style the second one being a more civic style a little more downtown you'll see some materials that are more consistent with downtown and forms and then a modern style that is more reflective you might recognize some of the some pictures from some of the developments in that region and so looking at those three styles we then took the floor plan that we created and and just did a massing model without color added but just a massing that this will be used to give the design build teams as they move forward options is for them to present to the city when they're presenting their their designs at the next step then based on the size of the fire station we've been tracking a project budget that looks like this one and then we're going to be looking at the design of the podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem and I reviewed those with the cost estimator to bring you the cost of what the station would be as the full design. This base option that we have shows those hard costs at the beginning of the building and site improvements with the soft cost of things like construction management and owner systems and the escalation from now up until it's ready to be built. The overall full design is about $24 million which is consistent with what we're seeing throughout California of fire stations being between $12 and $1500 per square foot when you count building and site costs. We recognize fire stations because they're essential services buildings are expensive to build. Part of which is their The cost savings are 50% stronger than any other building and so when a large earthquake happens these facilities will still be standing to serve the community. With that the fire chief and the design committee and the city we looked at some options of some possible cost savings to present to you. As we look at those cost savings that includes both building and site cost savings. We first looked at some savings on the site. Things that effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively And then reducing some of our firefighter parking and our drive areas as we reduce some of the building size that's related. So the first option for the building is because when the fire station is first built, it will be occupied not by the full amount of bunk rooms that we have. It will have one company with reserve apparatus. So the two company model with four extra bunk rooms and one restroom, the blue box on the top, we could look at phasing that in and the station was designed to add that in at a later date. And then also the turnout lockers along with that can be reduced. And so that brings the cost down in this option to about 2.1 or 2.8 million. The site options along with that. Would would apply to each of these options. Then looking at option two, we looked at the same reductions. However, with those, we also looked at reducing the station by one bay and reducing the day room and the exercise room. This would bring our cost for this option down to 18.4 million. As we look at option two, three and four, we're reducing the apparatus bay. And it should be noted. That reducing the bay does reduce ability to respond and ability to have apparatus in the base. It's with every fire department we work with the storing fire trucks are over a million dollars today and we don't want those sitting outside. So having the space to store them and protect them is a great long term investment for the city. Um, so looking at option three, that is a further reduction to the second bay to be a bay and a half. And that brings us down to 17.5 million. And then option for going all the way to eliminating two bays so that there would only be one bay on the station at the beginning. That brings you down to 16.4. Again, the reduction of the base is not optimal, but we wanted to show that we're investigating those options and then we can to bring you the evaluation of what's what's possible. We thought it would be good. Uh, it's always good to just bring up the fact that. You know, we know that escalation is five considered 5% a year. Right now, which is actually better than it has been. We were tracking about seven and then for the recent inflation time period, we were over 10. Uh, if just as we were looking at when this can happen, uh, and as we move forward with a plan for this project to be funded. Uh, as escalation move forward at 5% today's cost for the overall project was 24 million a year later. it goes up to 25.3 million if we wait two years that's now 26.7 and then three years is 27.9 so time um and we're just track that's just a simple five percent a year that our cost estimators are telling that we can expect and so many many municipalities like us to provide that information so they can recognize that as we look at different options they do have cost if we push building building things out further so i am here to answer any questions uh both for myself or the chief all right thank you council member questions council member van alberbeck uh thank you uh first actually two questions uh the is the roundabout big enough for the equipment that you guys are going to use out there i'll let the chief confirm that one but um i believe so we go around it uh frequently uh we would like the straight shot but um okay i didn't ruined it for us all right um and then the other is just briefly uh 12 to 1500 a square foot is uh a lot of money for something that's half a garage i mean i realize you get you you've got there's more to it than that but you're not conditioning the equipment space right um typically we do have heaters but not air conditioning in apparatus space okay um and that's a good good question portions of the fire station are they're not it's not all the same per square foot but that's kind of an average cost for the overall station the kitchen and bathrooms are the most expensive portions and the apparatus space and support spaces are less expensive than say the the bunk rooms where you would have a little more interior like finishes but we uh where that number comes from is tracked from uh recent bids in different parts of california and we do make sure to weigh those based on the number of people that are in the off the areas were not as expensive as the bay area but were definitely more expensive than you know say madera in the middle of the valley.! I think we have a lot of discussion about what' s going to happen nobody knows for sure but it looks like the north area of chico is probably a very dramatic growth area for the future. Which of the stations should be considered as the number one option considering it' s going to be a long time before another station is built it' s very expensive I wish we could build them all right now but which one chief I' d like to hear from you I would go for the optimal but I think the option number one is very doable and allows us to expand it down the road one of our biggest challenges is bay space so when we start to eliminate that which is actually a fairly costly endeavor the problem with it is to add on to that has some significant engineering and cost that will be exorbitantly higher than if we just added on at this juncture. We would like to see that done. The other thing that Michael and I talked about stations are generally built for a 50 year livability but that number has been going up substantially as construction methods materials and the codes themselves that they' re requiring these facilities to be built at a really high standard. So we' re looking at something that can last half a century or more. Our old stations station one and station two were built in the early 1960' s and they were not built to that standard but we' ve had them that long and we' re still utilizing them. thank you. anybody down? council member o'brien. just to confirm chief standards this is the optimal spot that you would place a station at? the run of the city is this the optimal spot? yes. it would be. in fact interestingly enough when we ran the numbers those maps that we showed you when you put station six you eliminate a significant amount of red and it was identified under steve brown that that was one of two stations. the other one interestingly enough council member holly had asked about was the response on the west side of the railroad tracks and there was a station that would have been built at 8th and north. so those would be projects we would want to evaluate. and it' s important to understand that while we' re looking at this project in particular as a feasibility study it will serve as a foundation for station two as well. which would be another one that needs to be considered when we' re looking at how we' re going to fund this. in addition to that my colleague on the police station one and station two would be a the west side is looking at doing a feasibility study for a new police fire station. add that into your budget. police station which is clearly not big enough and suitable enough for their needs as well. so we have a number of large projects that will have to be addressed in the coming years. so west of the tracks certainly is a concern for several of us for very significant reasons. but when chief brown did his study that was before the huge influx of building that has taken place in the north area of our city. so that makes that even more important right now. looking at the general plan. Mr. vick can talk about that in more depth. but it appears there are areas north of eaton road along hicks that have potential for development. the airport could be conceived of that as well. the 80 acres on eaton road across from amber lynn. so there' s quite a bit of land up there that' s still available to build on. so i would anticipate as years come those will be likely candidates for expanded development. yes. absolutely. thank you. all right. ms. howley. thank you. effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively going forward into the 90s. And we have a cooperative agreement for automatic aid. So they were running a significant number of their calls were running the city calls. So they've under the stress of the financial crisis of 2008, they shuttered that engine and redeployed those resources elsewhere. Thank you. All right. I think that's it. Thank you. Just out of curiosity, do you know in 2008 when that station was proposed, what the budget was for it then? If I remember right, I want to say it was like 10 million. I don't have that number. I can get it for you. I've got the books. Steve was very meticulous and he had binders. So I guess I really look at it. I think that escalation of the 5% to 7% a year is super important to remember. Yeah, so that 5% irrespective of what we do or don't do, we'll continue to increase that cost exponentially. We're not going to see the cost go down unless something really catastrophic happens. And then we won't be building a fire station anyways. We won't be building a fire station anyways. Thank you. All right. Thank you for the presentation. All right. Closed session announcement.

E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E essential to fulfilling our mission of providing the highest quality emergency services to the Chico community. Chico has grown significantly in recent years through annexations, plan developments, and from welcoming our neighbors in their time of need. There's been new residential development throughout the city to accommodate this increase in population. However, our fire department's staffing and infrastructure has not kept pace with this growth. Currently, when a citizen in North Chico calls 901, the closest fire engine responds from Fire Station 2, directly across from Anuel Hospital. This means there are additional minutes of drive time to all types of emergency incidents in this district, whether they be fires, vehicle accidents, or medical aids, among others. An example of this occurred last week during evening rush hour when Engine 2 was dispatched to a medical aid in the DeGarmo Park area involving CPR. Once dispatched, it took five minutes of driving from Station 2 to reach the intersection of Eaton Road and Esplanade. An additional minute from Eaton Road to Arroyo. and arrive at the location of the call. Every second counts in an emergency, and Station 6 would provide a strategic advantage when responding to emergency incidents, allowing us to have a meaningful impact faster, and it is necessary to achieve adequate emergency response times in this district. While we encourage ongoing discussions about funding opportunities for Station 6 and necessary facility repairs in the future, our membership also recognizes that increasing the staffing of our department remains the top priority, and it would have a direct effect on day-to-day operations immediately. Both locally and across the state, agencies have acknowledged the need for more firefighters to appropriately respond to the scale and complexity of the incidents we face today. When the Butte County Measure H initiative was passed, Butte County CAL FIRE was immediately funded to boost staffing with an additional firefighter on each county engine. Despite passing our own Measure H initiative, we are still working to improve the quality of our fire. Prior to this, the citizens of Chico haven't seen a comparable increase in the staffing of our own fire department. Increasing our staffing would enable us to reopen Engine Company 1, operating out of Station 1 downtown. It prioritizes public safety in our historic downtown, the recently annexed Chapman Town district, and the proposed Barber Yard development. Providing this depth for our department has an immediate and tangible impact on the safety of our fire department. It strengthens our ability to respond to large-scale incidents like the Park and Bidwell Mansion fires. As members of the department and community, we recognize that the priorities outlined by Chief Stenridge provide the resources we need to serve our neighbors in their time of need. Thank you for your time, continued commitment to public safety, and I'm happy to answer any questions. Thank you. Thank you. Mike Johnson followed by Bo Powell. Thank you, Mike. Well, good evening, Madam Mayor, Council Members. Congratulations to Chief Stenridge, the team at RRM, the team at the department, city staff that put together that brief. Long time coming, and it's really gratifying, frankly, to see that the council is giving this the attention it's needed for a long time. Obviously, there's going to be a lot of funding questions about this. Even the least expensive option is going to be very expensive, and where do you take from robbing Peter to pay Paul to make that happen? So whether it's going to be through the budget alone, with the bond measures or whatever the routes you folks need to find this, there's always the human cost. As many of you know, when we raised some of these this last fall in the public zeitgeist, response times were a big issue. Myself, my mother had a stroke in Sacramento during the fall, and thankfully she was very close to Kaiser. Made me wonder at that time, what would have happened to the costs that we're not tracking, you know, that was mentioned here earlier by Firefighter Healy, that what are we looking at in terms of the human cost, the response times? What are we seeing for people that are actually losing their lives that we're not tracking because of some of the difficulties we're facing? What are we seeing for people that are actually losing their lives that we're not tracking? And then the other thing is, you know, the other thing that we have with AMR and their own agreements about, you know, the way that we track these metrics, what are we looking at for the injuries that could have been made less severe versus life-changing? Those are the costs that you folks are in an unavailable position to have to decide on how best to do this. At least you're doing it. At least you brought this up. Thank you so much for agendizing this, so much for putting the time in to get this up to bat. And now we see where you can take it from here. So you have our support, and we certainly want to see it happen. So thank you so much. Thank you. Bo Powell, followed by Grace Marvin. Yeah, I'd just like to say thank you to the firefighters and everything. They came out to my mom's out there, Stanley, or off Dayton Road, the mobile home park, to help my stepfather quite a few times before he died. He used to be the original guy, leader, or representative for the Army. He effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively years later I came back up here and the wages here were a third of what I made down there. But I wanted to get out of the city. My marriage fell apart so I went to CLIC for help. And I got court orders to try to protect my children from a convicted child molester up in Stern City and I couldn't get the sheriffs to enforce court orders. So I went back to CLIC and they explained to me that they can't help anybody if the opposite person or entity is the federal government, the state, the city, the county, they can't help you. And I thought to myself, boy, what an open door for corruption. 006 E podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem!! podem The firemen's brave children let them do first responders. Well, we need those families to stick up for their family members. I don't know if firefighters are handicapped from law enforcement from saying things about the city council selling them down the river, but their families sure aren't. Or Chico State—I mean, Audrey, whatever her name was, Denny, after they legalized spraying them, a Chico State ag teacher runs for Congress. Why would an organic rice grower, Doug LaMalfa, facilitate spraying cops and firemen? That's time. Thank you, Mr. Powell. AMY GOODMAN- Grace Marvin, followed by Sarah. Cynthia Prynne. CYNTHIA PRYNNE, Yes, please. I want to mention two things. One is a managed campground. It has come up often, and I want you to know that we keep thinking about it and worrying about it. Recently, a lot of citizens have been concerned about fires in the park and other danger. Well, this would be a wonderful way to positively help people. If we found a managed campground, we would be able to help people. The idea is that it's a managed campground that was fenced in, that had a manager that provided safety, basic needs for the people, and would allow them to have transportation through buses and so forth to get to where they want to go. It would relieve so much—many problems that the city has with the homeless and more specifically, the homeless have. Now, the other thing that I wanted to mention, please, was the community growth forum that's been going on for several weeks now. And I've attended several of them. I didn't today. My husband did, however, and I heard about it later on Ecotopia. And what I'd like to mention about that is that we need to be planning for infill. We need to address climate change and other issues and not close our eyes to it because this is going to be hitting us more and more. So our housing needs, it would be best be filled to the degree we can within downtown Chico and walkable neighborhoods with greenery. And the possibility of people getting to school and getting to work through mass transportation. And there's some of that is in the planning right now. And I think that we should promote that more and more. These are the basic points that I want to make. The managed campground is essential for our homeless people. And let's get with it. Let's vote on it and have something done about it. And then also, you might want to go to the forum that is going to be taking place on February 27th, at which time there will be many speakers at the Chico Women's Center from 6 to 8 p.m. talking about how to grow our community in very sensible, intelligent ways. And I heard a preview about that earlier. And I think that's going to be a very, very important part of our community. And I think that's going to be very, very important part of our community. And I think that's going to be very, very important part of our community. And I think that's going to be very, very important part of our community. And I think that's going to be very, very important part of our community. And I think that's going to be very, very important part of our community. And I think that's going to be very, very important part of our community. And I think that's going to be very, very important part of our community. And I think that's going to be very, very important part of our community. And I think that's going to be very, very important part of our community. And I think that's going to be very, very important part of our community. And I think that's going to be very, very important part of our community. and this is this is i'm telling this story because i want you to know chico raised me right because i bought that sweet little home for myself while i attended chico state for graduate school but since 2000 my home has served as a home for others um three local hard-working families um the most has been there since 2010 so we're small-time landlords and we even allow pets so fast forward to last september um it was during and just after the park fire and we made contact with our tenants and said have you guys checked your air filters because they're going to need to be changed and i said if you can't afford them we'll come over and we'd like to inspect them um after you've changed them so we did that in the fall we did that in 2018 we do that because we think about these things well the reason i'm bringing it up is at the january 28th meeting you were talking about a rental registry or some kind of thing and i kind of landlord tracking. And, you know, I contact my tenants because I feel like it's common sense and it's the right thing to do. But I bring it up because apparently it's not just common sense and not everybody does it. One of my staff members has been battling allergies since the fall. And I mean, we all do, right? It's Chico. But we closed our office and for a week and a half, he had to stay at home and it got worse. So he came back and we kind of realized it got better. I said, I wonder if it's not my, your house. Well, he moved into his house in September. So I said, have you checked your air filters? And he pulled them out and they were so filthy. It was clear. It was at least a contributing factor. He cleaned them and he's been breathing a lot cleaner. So the reason that I bring this up is I wonder, would a rental registry be able to help with some kind of outreach in times of fire response and recovery? Um, or, or would, would code enforcement, uh, you know, actually effectively help, um, somebody who's renting and has just moved in unknowingly to a house that has dirty filters, be able to help them not have allergies. So thank you so much. Thank you. Jared Geiser followed by Addison Winslow. Good evening council and staff and everyone else watching this meeting. Um, I also want to bring up the managed campground. Um, effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively that moving camps from one place to another hasn't done anything to solve our problem, and that we need to find something that will solve our problem. And I think a sanctioned campground is a pretty cheap first attempt at solving this problem. And I think that it needs to be done with basic sanitation facilities, including bathrooms and showers and drinking water and very critical hand-washing stations separate than drinking water. I recall there being some health issues at the last camp, and there was only one water spigot for 50 people. I go camping, and if I'm sharing a water spigot with, like, five people, one time I saw someone washing their feet in it, and it was like, oh, that's kind of gross. But no one's washing their hands after using the restroom in there. And, you know, we need drinking water that's sanitary at this managed campground. I'd also like to address the growth committee, and I've detailed my concerns in a letter to the city of Chico, 1st of January, the 30th, and then a follow-up sent February 3rd to the full council and city attorney and Ms. Presson. And I have yet to receive a formal response to the concerns that I registered regarding the biased conduct that I witnessed at this growth committee and regarding the complaint about this committee undermining the city of Chico general plan and the city of Chico planning commission, which has financial conflict of interest requirements of its members. And I... I think that the members of this growth committee that are looking at the city's planning documents that were publicly shaped, and they're looking at how to edit them to better serve their financial interests, I think people in this committee need to have the same financial conflict of interest requirements as our planning commissioners. But quite frankly, I think the business needs to be sent to the planning commission. And so I request a response to my letter. Thank you. Thank you. And then Addison Winslow is our last speaker. Hey, thanks to everybody for your comments. I just had a little update on something I didn't have another opportunity to share. It was a parliamentary issue that we had another meeting. It's kind of been a theme of my tenure on council. So we had a discussion in January on electoral reform. There were a number of proposals, but one of them that received the most attention was a nonpartisan redistricting commission that would remove partisan considerations from the drawing of districts so that the council is appropriately representative of the community and not locked into place by a strategic place that happened just after a census. In that discussion, we had no fewer than three council members, expressed that they had an issue with it, taking it too seriously right now because it's a timing thing, that that's so far off the next census, and so why would we be discussing this now? So we took a vote on getting some feedback from staff on all three items, and it failed, and I made a follow-up motion in response to what I heard, suggesting that we table the topic of the redistricting commission to a date closer to the next census. And that's when we came in with the parliamentary objection, saying this isn't a valid motion. First, it was that we need to automatically move on because one motion failed, and then it was that this is too close to the other motion, and this is in effect a reconsideration, and this can only be done a year after, and all these things. We discussed that for several minutes, and then we ultimately just moved on. So about a year and a half ago, with comparable issues about processes, the city hired a couple experts in municipal law and process. They came in and they gave us a training, answered some of our questions, made me feel better about the whole process. I took them up on their offer to reach out with further questions, and I explained the whole situation to them. I talked to them via email, talked to them on the phone, and the response that I got was that the decision that we made to disqualify the motion was totally, absolutely wrong. Passing that motion and tabling the discussion would have produced a totally different outcome. It wasn't a reconsideration. It was the logical next step in the progress towards finding resolution as a deliberative body. Those were good lawyer words, I thought. If this was just the first or the second or the third time that something like this had happened, I wouldn't make a big fuss about it, but it's not. That was mostly... It was the first time with a new council. It is a substantially new council, and I want to believe that this is the last time that we'd have an issue like that. I think the least that we can do is maintain a legitimate public decision-making process. If you oppose something, just hear out the arguments and vote against it, and stop with the cockamamie parliamentary objections. All right. Is that our last speaker? Okay. Thank you. Item 5.1, consideration of closing of the South Park. Peterson Drive, Lower Bidwell Park to vehicular traffic on the weekends. Mr. Gustafson. Weekends and national holidays. Sorry. Thank you, Vice Mayor, Mayor, and council members. Appreciate the opportunity to speak to you tonight. I'll just pull this up. So yeah, this item is consideration of closing both South Park Drive and Peterson Memorial Drive to vehicular traffic. That was brought up by council last June on weekends and national holidays. Kind of a quick overview. We're going to look at the headway transportation report that was conducted in Lower Park in 2023. The Bidwell Park and Playground Commission considered and looked at this, even held a special meeting on site, multiple meetings in 2023, and then landed on a preferred alternative for the reconstruction of South Park Drive. We're going to look at that roadway reconstruction zone, construction schedule, which is exciting, and is coming up very, very soon. City council direction from June, and then a staff recommendation that we're going to land on tonight. So the Park Commission started the traffic circulation and safety discussion really in 2023 regarding Lower Park. At the time, staffing bandwidth was pretty limited from a traffic engineering standpoint, so we contracted with a transportation company called Headway Transportation. And they had kind of three main objectives to look at the Lower Park interior roads. The first one was review key conflict areas for overall circulation and travel safety, evaluate existing transportation facilities. Secondly, review parking and access points on Velland-Brosia and Woodland Avenue outside of the park. And then lastly, provide potential improvement options for traffic management, bicycle and pedestrian access, and of course, overall circulation. So these were just, the headway report, and an exhibit to the staff report. So we just kind of pulled out some of their overarching observation and recommendations. Went from reducing the speed from 25 to 15 miles per hour, which is done. I'm going to jump down here to kind of the end, which is really relevant for tonight's conversation. Construct a side path on South Park Drive from the 4th Street entry to Caper Acres, expanding vehicle parking at one mile and on Velland-Brosia Way. Construct a multi-use path between Peterson Memorial Way and the one mile bridge, which is kind of an interesting suggestion, considering some additional vehicle entrance and exit points. And then, of course, closing South Park to vehicular traffic between El Monte and Centennial, which would include relocating some existing ADA parking facilities onto East 8th Street. So this is a kind of an overview map of, it's figure five in the headway report, that basically just kind of outlines all of their suggestions and recommendations. And these, of course, aren't items that we would, or could do all at once. This is basically just a roadmap for us, you know, over the next five to eight years on how to manage the interior circulation scenario in the park. So due to the forthcoming pavement projects, both on Peterson and South Park, the Park Commission really focused on considering the following. They started to really narrow down the recommendations of that headway report from 2023. The first one, the headway report, is to start with establishing the circulation pattern of facilities, figure two of the headway report. Constructing a side path on South Park Drive, again, fourth street entry to Cape Reagors, which is figure three. Constructing pedestrian crosswalks and ADA accessible ramps on fourth street, Woodland Avenue and South Park Drive intersections. Expanding vehicle parking at the one mile parking lot on Vandenbergia Way. And then, of course, prohibiting vehicular traffic on South Park Drive between El Monte and the park. So the Park Commission discussed this at multiple meetings, including they held an on-site meeting with local stakeholders and adjacent neighbors to the park. It was well attended. I think there was about 30 people there or so in the audience. And the discussion really, again, focused on that South Park Drive potential vehicular, pedestrian, bicyclist conflicts. Engineering staff was on site and did an excellent job kind of assisting through that discussion. Actually walked South Park Drive through the, you know, from the one mile area all the way to Cape Reagors. And with the whole group, it was kind of cool to see and looked at, kind of considered the alternatives, the four alternatives that the headway report suggested. And then ultimately landed on one. So the four that were suggested was an attached side path using an elevated rumble strip to provide a separate two-way bike pedestrian path. Secondly, a separate side path using an elevated rumble strip. And then a five-foot striped buffer. Thirdly, a shared street alternative where bikes and pedestrians have a two-way path of travel. And then, of course, vehicles traveling one way. And then fourth, a multi-use path alternative where bikes and peds share two-way lanes of travel and vehicles are prohibited. So these are the animations on those four alternatives that the Park Commission discussed, specifically on that on-site meeting. This is the first one. Again, the attached side path. So it shows bi-directional pedestrian and bicycle traffic. And then still vehicle traffic one way with a rumble strip separation or delineation. Second one is a separated side path with a five-foot buffer in between. Third, shared street alternative, which again, just kind of two-way traffic for pedestrians and bicyclists with no delineation from vehicular traffic. And then the shared, just a pedestrian, bicycle, directional, bi-directional with no vehicular traffic on the street. So the Park Commission and the stakeholders preferred that alternative one, which is an attached side path, so it has vehicles going one way and then bicyclists and pedestrians are attached but bi-directional, and it's separate or delineated from a one-foot rumble strip. So the second one is a shared pedestrian bicycle So this is kind of the direction of the Park Commission for engineering then to take and start to design of South Park Drive rehabilitation. We've obviously determined that both South Park Drive and Peterson Memorial Drive needs full rehabilitation. As we all know, the asphalt has degraded completely and needs to be completely removed and repaved. So this is the opportune time to do this and that's what really triggered the Park Commission to focus on this particular area versus all the recommendations in the headway reports. So it kind of excelled or accelerated these discussions. So we landed on alternative one, which would ultimately widen the existing road. I think it's the existing South Park Drive in that area is 18 feet and of course you could see the figures there. It would not substantially but add some width to the current configuration. So any time you add or change things, you're taking more space. It triggers the road. E E E E E E E E E E E E E summer of 2026 due to the alternative we' re considering in south park drive it triggers environmental and full design so it takes some time to do that so we intend to reconstruct that in summer of 2026 but the design is supposed to be done early this summer and then peterson is replacement in kind so it' s scheduled for reconstruction this summer in 2025. During those discussions the park commission really also kind of wanted to tackle the potential vehicle closure item but at the time we kind of recommended let' s let engineering complete the design of south park drive before considering vehicle closures and that was just the thought that it might eliminate some of those conflicts I think that we' re all concerned about. However we certainly appreciate council' s intent to make the park safer and we could certainly close either interior park or exterior park at any time if it' s the will of the council. So recently the June meeting of 2024 council directed staff to review the results of the 2023 headway report in the context of closing both roads to vehicular traffic on weekends and holidays and bring back recommendations and that' s what we' re here for tonight. So we re-reviewed the headway report and kind of landed on the headway report actually also kind of recommends closing south park drive leaving a portion of it open from basically the nature center to and then exit on el monte and we' ll kind of talk about that at the next slide. But they also suggest leaving peterson memorial drive open and so we kind of reviewed the report had a very robust discussion at the staff level and kind of brought back these seven items for council to consider. And looking at our calls for service and the complaints that we do get from most of the complaints are about e-bikes and scooters and dogs off leash very minimal on vehicle complaints or vehicular conflicts with pedestrians but it does happen but most of our complaints are from e-bikes. There are 27 desirable first come first serve creek site picnic sites on peterson drive that are many times accessible by vehicle. Peterson drive also provides weddings family reunions and other large gatherings where sometimes people are relying on vehicles to get supplies and stuff there for whatever event they' re having. Peterson drive currently doesn' t open to vehicles until 11 a.m. every day which already provides the public time to enjoy the park without conflicts or vehicles in the early morning hours. We kind of felt on this that I know the intent from council was we could close it weekends and holidays we kind of feel like when there' s different days of openings and closures it kind of creates some confusion so our suggestion was if we' re going to close it let' s close it and either keep it closed or open seven days per week. And then also this is a staff perspective of not having vehicle traffic on both roads may increase the undesirable behavior and encourage inappropriate use of interior park facilities. Staff feel that sometimes we' The folks that are driving through the park are in many cases our eyes and ears and see inappropriate activity or behavior and often times call it in so losing that vehicular access staff had a position we rely on some of that vehicle traffic to call situations in that we could respond to so that was something to consider as well. So this is what staff is suggesting and this figure is out of the headway report it' s figure two and I believe there' e some pointer options here so what they suggested was of course here' s the four straight entrance the one mile entrance and of course keeping vehicles there to access caper acres and this is where engineering is designing the side path alternative for the full roadway reconstruction and the other thing that we're construction but they also suggested keeping vehicles accessible from basically cedar grove or the nature center entrance adjacent to east 8th street here and then to exit on to el monte there are a few picnic sites here along south park drive in discussions with my colleague on the engineering side of public works there' s some hesitation to create another outlet on el monte that would create a four-way stop there and would have some impacts on east 8th and of course el monte so there' s some hesitation to do that at this time. So that' s where staff has landed is we would recommend keeping based on these seven things to consider we recommend closing all of south park drive from caper acres all the way to manzanita to vehicular traffic seven days per week and then leaving peterson drive open to vehicular traffic seven days per week. So that lands us on my recommendation is council to consider only closing south park drive to vehicular traffic from caper acres to centennial avenue and leaving peterson memorial drive open to vehicular traffic seven days per week for a six-month trial. I can take any questions. thank you very much do we have any questions? Mr. Mr. van over. as part of the repaving in south park and peterson I was walking through the park last week not the previous week and the weekend before that is after the high water and there was a fair amount of water that got on particularly peterson but also south park so is there a plan maybe a question for you brendan to raise the road bed even two or three inches or is it to be at the same grade it is now? currently we do not have any plans to raise the road bed but we do have a have a plan to raise the elevation of the path itself. that would significantly increase the cost. maybe not. quite a bit of material when it' s several miles long and you get 12 14 feet wide but we are trying to use best practices and some sustainable practices of not grinding up material having to haul it off site so doing the in place recycling type of concept so we are trying to use best practices sometimes by nature it will slightly come up. council member wenzel. there is a lot of stuff going on here. two different streets. just for south park drive I wonder I got my opinion is the rumble strip is unpleasant and usually seen in urban settings and the idea of sidelining people and bikes on the one stretch of it we currently see the tweed ride and everybody takes the road and it is a little bit of a! I think that is a good point. certainly that could be an option I think it might raise some costs in the current design that we are going through now. we could certainly add entrances and exits to those areas but I think it might change the overall design and add some costs to the overall project. it would negate widening it because you would be using the path for people. yeah. next member goldstein. follow-up question somewhat on that. my first question was about the cost of doing the environmental review and if we didn' t widen the right-of-way would we not have to do that? correct. also if we were to say improve access points without letting through traffic happen would that also trigger the environmental review? that likely would if we' re adding access points to and from because there is a take if you will a point. my colleague in engineering likely could answer that specifically but I believe it would trigger a full eir review. any time you' re working typically within the already built environment it' s an exemption. those types of projects a lot streamlined in terms of the environmental review process so any time you' re working outside of the existing footprint you' re doing analysis and evaluations and biologist reports on what wetlands might be in those areas or disturbances. as part of that portion from the entry at cypress up to caper acres we were looking at modified entrance point to caper acres so there' s bidirectional access to the parking lot as opposed to its current configuration where you have to head eastbound and use that basically that exit only and the intent behind that s a to alleviate or incentivize folks to use woodland as opposed to the park to access caper acres by having bidirectional ingress and egress to the parking lot. thanks. any ballpark estimate of how much the environmental review costs for this type of project? that' s a hard thing to nail down it' s not just the direct cost there' s indirect cost by adding that in the complexity of environmental whether it' s an exemption or initial study that would be a cost-efficient environment. that are really practical for those those type of projects. Again those type of projects won' t trigger an e ir but can delay a project. we heard from the fire department on the cost escalations year by year. just the time it takes typically again for those environment processes usually pushes out construction of the project which can also add to cost. thank you. that' s all. vice mayor bennett? committee and analysis of what you were asked to do originally I think you did a great job the outcomes a little bit different than what we were thinking at the time but facts override suggestions and thoughts we may have and I think you' ve gone through the facts very well. I want to thank you for that. The most peterson drive were scared and unhappy that they were going to lose the ability to use peterson drive to get to the picnic sites and all that. More than any other comments I received were a fear of losing that access. I listen to the people I would like to make decisions based on the input from our citizens. I' m leaning in your direction but we' ll wait and see transparency for the vote and I thank you for the conversation about this we talked about it somewhat earlier. Again thank you. just one second councilman holly did you want to say anything no go ahead Mr. van over. on June 4 last year we had a council meeting and the council meeting was to look at the headway report which is an excellent report and the other was to close peterson and south park drive on weekends and holidays for six months after implementation prohibitionary period. Then staff was going to come back. Now because there were a number of amendments and I did a lousy job of drafting the motion there was no I did and it was a little bit of a mess. I did not have a that' s why there' s all this confusion. We' re here seven months later. I don' t want to blame anybody. However the council very explicitly said and voted on and approved closing south park and centennial I' m sorry south park and peterson memorial on the weekends and holidays for six month probationary period. It is not the right decision to do that. I would like to say council we don' t think you made the right decision we want to do something else that is not what the staff does. You were asked to tell us how to do it not whether to do it. We have a new council here and they may decide they want to do something else and that' s their will but I think we need to clear up the ambiguity and so Madam Mayor I' m asking that we have two motions. we need to take public comment. m sorry I' I' I appreciate the report and headway report is great. There' e couple of things I object to but basically I think we should do it. I would like you to be able to come back with that so we can integrate at least some of that into the current budget cycle. council member lowens I had one quick thing before we go to public comment. thank you for clarifying the history of that. I' m pretty sure this is true upper park road is closed Sunday and Monday and that' s the case for the foreseeable future that' s not scheduled to end. we intend to post campfire or park fire and now the roadway being reconstructed in council previous direction on a parking fee in upper park we intend to bring back some recommendations to that in the spring months. So I' m potentially subject to change but that' s certainly the I had one quick thing to add before we go to public comment. My question is on I hate to open pandora' s box here but are you going to do any kind of a tree survey before you start construction? I' ve seen us so many times go in and build beautiful roads and then all of a sudden later we realize we need to maintain and roadway and now we' re taking heavy equipment in on the new roads. Is there anything to look at that because I know there' s a lot of trees that need to be addressed? I think that was the sensitivity to widening this a certain amount and I know engineering staff is looking at ways to maybe meander to save trees that' s our intent. We have urban forest master plan several decades and then we have added use of the park and traffic circulation plan that calls for widening infrastructure inside the park so always competing interest and I think it' s staff' s job to find the best way to find balance there and that' s what we' re doing is finding ways to widen the road maybe meander a little bit and incorporate the suggestions without taking any trees if we possibly could but I think some will have to come out due to widening the road so that' s absolutely be identified through the design process and part of the whole project. Okay great. And then Ms. Preston maybe before we go back to making a motion I don' t know I would like to be reminded of what the exact motion was seven months ago because I don' t remember that that' s been around but maybe we can look that up after we take public comment. Okay. I can tell you right now. Why am I not surprised? So according to the approved minutes a motion was made by council member van overbeck seconded by mayor coolidge to direct staff to review the results from the headway transportation and survey report from 2023 and come back with recommendations in the context of closing the roads being discussed on national holidays Saturdays and Sundays period. And then there was a friendly amendment that the closures that the road that the closures approved the council would conduct a six-month review after that we would review it six months later after the recommendations were brought back. Did I hear that? All right. Okay, we have two speakers. Jared Geiser, followed by Jeff Carter. All right. Good evening, Council. I originally intended to speak about requesting that you close vehicular access to both sides of the park, but then after hearing about the road widening, I'm actually more concerned with that now. So I urge you, no road widening, please. You know, we don't need to pave any more acres of paradise. We just don't. Lower Park's a little too narrow as it is, in my opinion. I don't think we need to take more of that land away. And as I mentioned initially, I think both roads should be closed to vehicular traffic. We just don't need to have people driving through the park. You know, if you go to Disneyland, you can park right on the outside, and then people can traverse it with their wheelchairs. Their mobility. Their mobility devices. And it works really well. And so, and also it's worth noting that Valambroja and East 8th Street already allow for vehicle users to drive up and down the full length of the park. And then one other little thing about cars in the park. Sometimes I'll lead nature walks through Lower Bidwell, and sometimes we have to, you know, move all the students to the side, get in a single file, and let this big truck go past us. And there's just a safety concern for allowing these vehicles to be in paths that families will go on, and that school groups will use. So another consideration. And so yeah, I hope that, I think option four was the better option, where it didn't allow vehicles to use the park, and didn't require the road widening. So it would also perhaps require less environmental review. Or perhaps no environmental review if the road isn't being widened. I'm not sure about that. One last thing to point out is Great Horned Owls nesting adjacent to Peterson Memorial Drive, near where Madrone runs in. So something to consider. And please don't take more of their habitat for pavement. Thank you. Thank you. Jeff Carter is our last speaker. Mayor Reynolds, Council Members, Jeff Carter, I reside at 600 Parkwood Drive. Having grown up in Chico, I can tell you that Chico was both Disneyland and Smithsonian to those of us fortunate enough to have grown up in Chico, and to be able to go exploring and to visit routinely, daily. I also remember fondly drives through Bidwell Park in the fall time, after going up to Paradise to get some apples, of course, and then coming down and taking a family drive when family drives are fun, and just marveling at Bidwell Park. I can tell you that when I was a kid, I was a big fan of Bidwell Park. When I was fortunate enough to return to Chico to make my living, and a home on Parkwood Drive, which backs onto South Park Drive, became available, even though I couldn't afford it, I wasn't going to let it go by. And I've raised my family there. I've shared many good neighbors, and I can tell you that in my informal polling of my neighbors, we are all in favor of the Stafford. We have a lot of recommendations. The portion of South Park Drive beyond El Monte Avenue east, heading until Centennial, as all of you know, is rather narrow, and at times quite curvy, and bordered very closely by, there's a huge sycamore right outside of my fence. It just glows at night when there's a full moon. And it's a marvel for me to be able to go to bed and look up at that sycamore and see it. But also, also, like, I'm a big fan of the South Park Drive, and I think it's a barrier for smooth flow of traffic. And I can tell you, having lost two and a half segments of my fence on Bidwell Park in the fall when a car had to avoid the sycamore to get by, if you want to know where I live, I have the two-tone fence, the new wood for two sections and the old wood for the rest of the fence. But I think that closing South Park Drive to traffic, particularly if it were to exit down El Monte, would make great safety considerations while retaining the park available to pedestrians and bicyclists. So I encourage you to accept the staff recommendations, and I applaud you for taking this revisit of a little child's Smithsonian and Disneyland and keeping it for my family and my grandchildren and my heirs to come. So thank you very much. Thank you. All right. Further discussion or consider a motion? Well, I had some further thought on the South Park Drive topic. You know, I was thinking, how do we not have cars driving parallel to Woodland and being funneled all the way from 4th Street to across there, but still give access to the Cape Erickson? It sounds like that two-way traffic thing is actually kind of the idea, so you could still close off traffic there. The fact that the majority of it maintain two-way at the end, and you wouldn't have to add access points while keeping that. And I think that's my preferred alternative. I just want to say that. All right. I think I saw— So is that two-way bike traffic and pedestrian traffic, not two-way car traffic, right? Well, no. To access the Cape Erickson parking lot it would say that people can come in— Oh, okay. And then go out the same way. And so that we still keep the majority of the stretch from one-mile parking lot all the way to there— Got it. —free of cars. Council member Holly Thank You miss mayor to be quite honest. I'm struggling to see really a an issue with closing South Park Drive, and I know that was this test recommendation, but in addition to that Peterson Memorial Drive As an end-all be-all some of the issues in my opinion were a tad speculative for example eliminating undesirable behavior in the park there's still a lot of People going in and out by foot and by bike and I think we have a pretty strong neighborhood network that would continue reporting As well as that bi-directional entrance into caper acres it seems like we can find some solutions to allow people as Well to those desirable picnic areas that we have all along Peterson Memorial Drive somehow We have alambroja we have woodland and East 8th Street, which almost always have available parking So maybe finding some solutions for ad a accessible walkways going in from those streets could be an option but if The council's on board. I would like to hear some responses I do think it would be wise to at least have a trial period for closing Peterson Memorial Maybe we could align it with Sunday Monday for upper park And this could always come back to review I'm not going to die on this hill, but I do think it could at least be reviewed The last thing I want to note is after reviewing the staff report I do think a lot of my safety concerns were alleviated from that 48-hour traffic survey and I really appreciate that But the effects of the degradation of the roads are just so heavily impacted by cars a as well as exhausting a human health hazard. Certain people with certain conditions, asthma is one of them, can be very reactive to that. So I just want to be mindful of how broad of a topic this is. Council Member Goldstein. Thanks. Yeah, in general, I support our parks being natural spaces where we can go to avoid being in traffic and to avoid breathing in particulate matter and spend time in nature. And I've also heard concerns from communities about everybody being able to access the park. And I really think that we as a city have the ability to figure out how to make sure that everybody can access our park. And that can be an ongoing conversation. I also, I participate in things like the tweed ride, which is a great way to get started. And I really think that we as a city have the ability to group ride and I have been on a group ride and I have been on bird watching walks with one of our audience members who spoke and there are so many uses of the park that conflict with cars and so I think we should at least give it a try whether that looks like a trial period of full closure everywhere or perhaps pieces perhaps days of the week I' m very flexible on what this looks like but I definitely support giving community to be widened so we don' t have to deal with environmental review and potential for having to remove trees and things like that. I' m going to throw my two cents worth out there before we go any further I would definitely support closing south park drive but I would not support closing peterson at this point. I think what we can actually go do for free of which these people have no money anyways is to take the bus and go into the park and have a picnic and be able to access and get to benches and things at that point while I do think we can get there eventually to have a d a access and different accessibility taken care of it' s not there now so until we take care of that I think it would be full hearty to close off the park to those people that do enjoy support that they have no traffic and enjoy the no traffic on that side that' s what I would support. if I may comment as well. there are a ton of competing interests I get that and I want to commend director augustus and taking all that into consideration and your job as a director from my standpoint is to give us your support that you receive and that' s what we receive and I appreciate that so thank you for that. whatever we do I' m willing to go with your recommendation one but do that as you note for a six month period let' s try something and see if it works if it doesn' t we can recalibrate and try something else I don' t want to get locked in anything I want to try something I think this is a good compromise and I know you took all those interests in mind and gave us your best recommendation and I appreciate that and that' s what I' d like to can I address some of council member holly' s issues and your issue too. there would be nothing that would prevent people that had a wedding at site 37 for example or your child get a permit for the bus and they go in and use it. all these things have exceptions to driving these emergency vehicles. this is a safety issue. we saw in chief standards' presentation how fast the town is growing. on weekends and holidays we have a lot of traffic in the park and that' s why it' s weekends and holidays and not Sundays and Mondays. at some point we don' t have to wait for some kid to get hit on a bike to decide to put a stop sign at an intersection. the same thing will happen here. you see families out riding their bikes you have the little kid with the training wheels that' s weaving all over. at some point somebody' s going to get hurt and we can wait until that happens or we can do this now. I' ve never been in a major urban park in the united states or anywhere else where people drive through on the principal walking and cycling paths. it' s just not done. I would like to make a motion. Again I would remind everybody the previous council not this council. This council could do something else. gave instruction to public works to come back and figure out how to close south park drive and peterson memorial on the weekends and holidays for six month period. I would like to make a motion. two motions. to separate the headway transportation review from the closure. closure and the first motion is to have staff return at the march 18 council meeting how they will implement the closing of peter' s memorial south park drives on weekends and holidays for six months after implementation after which the council could review the results. second the motion. I was going to suggest that it' s worth breaking up south park drive and peter' s memorial drive because I feel it' s been enough in the conversation and as for closing that one on weekends it' s going into construction soon. peter' s 1 is peter' s memorial drive is going into construction soon the other is in design. Sort of these different phases of it and I think giving direction on the south park design and then direction on the considerations of closure of peter' s memorial. south park isn' t going to start this summer for the next six months? peter' s 1 is going to I think the peter' s 1 is going peter' s 1 is going to the peter' s 1 memorial is planned to likely begin in july and it will be closed during construction. that' s six months from now. july is about five months from now. six months from now. depending on how quick you can come back with. it will probably be about a six to eight week time frame for construction to occur. maybe we is there going to be any people going to be able to either ride their bikes no it will be closed to all resident citizen access just from a pure safety standpoint. there' s going to be big pieces of equipment pulverizing cement treating stabilizing and then ultimately paving that will be carrying truck loads of asphalt compaction equipment. during the construction phase it will be closed down to the public. okay. so can i change my motion? i accept that. i was going to actually ask you to restate it. okay good. thank you. okay. i would like staff to return at the march 18 council meeting with how they will implement the closing of peter' s 1 memorial south park drives on weekends and holidays until construction commences on peter' s 1 memorial drive. after which the council would review the review. okay. i second that. i just want to say i would like to make a follow-up motion after this to give explicit direction on the design of south park drive because that' s in progress right now the design. i want to make sure we' re able to say if we have agreement on the direction on that. i question. not on the agenda is it? yeah. and i also question whether i mean i think it' s something in internal affairs i will look at not the whole council. i mean it' s a legitimate question. i' m not arguing that but i don' t feel like i have enough understanding of the tradeoffs to tell engineering how they should do this. we were given four alternatives and they went with the recommendation they got from the parks commission. so i think picking a different one ourselves is reasonable. that' s fine but i think this isn' t the place to do it. thank you. let' s go to our next let' s go to our next let' s go to our next consideration. let' s go to our next let' s go to our next consideration. let' s go to our next consideration. let' s go to our next let' s go to our next let' s go to our next let' s go to our next consideration. let' s go to our next let' s go to our next let' s go to our next consideration. let' s go to our next consideration. let' s go to our next consideration. let' s go to our next consideration. let' s go to our next consideration. the road and the road is widening and I think it would be worth saying I' correct? I' m not mistaken you were saying the park recommendation was the rumble strip separating vehicle traffic from multi-use path and that would involve widening south park? to clarify at that meeting we didn' t have enough information so the discussion was on the road and the road the discussion at the bidwell parks and playground commission was we as engineering staff would do further analysis because in order to achieve that rumble strip widened segment especially for the portion from cypress to the one mile parking lot we' going to have to diverge the path away from the vehicular roadway to navigate through some trees we didn' t want to take down. we wanted to make sure we were very clear in the details that would be impacted as well as consider realigning that access point to the caper acres parking lot. all that to say the discussion at the bidwell parks and playground commission was to perform that level of design detail and then go back to them which we have yet to do. but also to make sure that we overall they were supportive of that concept. I think my confusion was preferred alternative but this is from the headway. the traffic engineers preferred a rumble strip in the middle of widening south park drive. I would like to make a motion that we support the multi youth pass alternative with vehicle traffic prohibited except what' s minimal to maintain vehicle access to parking lots on south park drive. council. take a motion. Mr. Gustafson. I' ll add that regardless this is still including vehicular access from also fourth street to caper acres because that' s currently caper acres only access right now if we don' t add any entrances or exits. keep in mind regardless of what we do this is still allowing vehicles from basically cypress to caper acres for access unless we add entrances and exit points. what I was suggesting was along the lines of the two-way traffic off of woodland to caper acres so people can enter and exit via the same exit but closing it off from fourth street to the one mile entrance with the stop sign and then from there to there to caper acres. that' s correct and that' s something that engineers have to take into consideration in the design. I' d make a recommendation to come back with a more firm look at it. I want to clarify one thing and reach out with the city attorney. our agenda item 5.1 is consideration of closing of south park peterson drive lower bidwell park. we have a motion to approve that item. we received some other information on some other things that may happen but my understanding is that' s going to be coming back. if somebody wanted to have a comment on these other things that we' re talking about they wouldn' t know that' s what' s going to be on the agenda tonight because we' re only talking about vehicular traffic on the weekends and national holidays. I want to make sure we' re staying within the realm of what we put on the agenda and that we shouldn' t wait until what' s coming back from staff until we have those conversations. Mr. Lamb. thank you. I think that the discussion regarding various options for closure and impacts to closure I think that' s within the parameters. I' m sorry I don' t have all the details to understand if that' s what this discussion entails or whether adding entrances impacts the project design which maybe be broader than what this original discussion was about. so that' s anyways. it' s in the report. I mean it' s not effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively! effectively effectively effectively lot and park commissioner let' let our park commissioners and our pending commissioners do their jobs and then let' have the conversation at that time when we know what we' actually being presented with that' s my recommendation. you' re welcome to make a motion. I will make a motion that we have staff come back with options to close the traffic on south park drive and how to best preserve access to the parking lots. second. do we have a time frame on when that would be? I was certainly hoping he would come along with the other item if possible if not I will trust brendan on it not to drag his feet. sounds good. we have a motion and a second. okay. councilmember goldstein. aye. councilmember burke. councilmember holly. yes. councilmember o'brien. no. councilmember van overbeck. yes. councilmember winslow. yes. vice mayor bennett. no. mayor reynolds. aye. carries 5-2. all right. let' s take a quick break and we' ll come back and finish up. E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E Thank you. Good. All right. Sorry for the little bit of a long break. We went a little bit longer on the first part. But we'll get done as quick as we can. 5.2, strategic planning update. Ms. Presson. Thank you, Mayor Reynolds and Council. This is just a quick update. As you'll recall, the last two council meetings, January 28th and February 4th, you discussed the budget timeline. The council expressed the desire to perhaps identify different priorities as well as really get into that discussion before the budget was finalized. The council landed. The council landed at the last meeting on having the afternoon session at the second meeting in May. And then directed the mayor to come up with an idea on strategic planning as the majority of the council thought that that would be a good idea. With the hope that having the strategic planning would allow for the council to identify their priorities and be able to help guide us through the budget process. So the council. So mayor. Reynolds and. Both my deputy director and myself met with a local consultant and identified the possibility of the strategic planning session, which I thought was quite different from the ones that we've held in the past. And the reason being is that they proposed individual interviews with each council member individual, not individual, but with a group for the department head interviews, being able to talk about what we're going through and doing. And. effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively an impartial third party come in and help conduct that meeting is beneficial but the the main thing that i believe will be very beneficial will be a final document prepared by the consultant incorporating all of the priorities having council identify those and being able to have a strategic planning document that we can use as a guide and so i'll turn it over to the mayor all right so that's where we left off my recommendation would be that we look at doing it we had talked about possibly maybe doing it on a tuesday since that's a normal council meeting but on an off tuesday or any other evening during the week but i think evenings to make it best available for public i think saturdays are nice but it just it's not usually attended i think the last time we did it on a saturday we had three people there or two people there it wasn't very i mean we did great as a council but it's not usually attended i think the last time we did it on a saturday we but i don't think the public had the opportunity so i think an evening time is what i would recommend and i was looking at doing it hopefully in the next couple of weeks since we need to get the information back to and have it way before we do our strategic plan or our budget process so open it up to any questions or we can talk about some dates that may work for everybody i have a question thinking uh mayor um time i think he said three four hours so we were looking at possibly tuesday the 25th from like a five or four five six four to eight something like that five to eight five to nine or any other that was just one date that happened to come up so oh sorry i'm looking at the wrong we were looking into march right we were looking in march but um so if we're going to do it in obviously um conference room one because the growth and development committee meets in there on our regular days on the first and third Tuesday, then we would have the 11th of March. We would have the 25th of March, which are off Tuesdays, and we have them blocked out so that we keep those reserved for you. It was thought perhaps the five o'clock start time or 530 and be able to go. Again, remember the consultants are already going to be working with the council individual and meeting with each of you to talk to you about your priorities and what your goals are for the community. So that part will already be done, and you'll have a document to begin with when we start the regular session. Mr. Van Overbeck, sorry. I had a question for the clerk. So Debbie, the consultant you've identified to run the meetings, do they have experience with the meetings? I don't know if you've had any experience with the meetings. I don't know if you've had any experience doing this kind of strategic planning for municipalities, or is it mainly private sector? Yes, I think it was contained in the information that they sent us, but a myriad of local agencies and other entities. Great. All right. So does the 11th or the 25th work for anyone or everyone, or do we need to go to a Tuesday? I can do the 11th of March. The 25th, I'm likely unavailable. Same with me. Same. 11th is good. 11th is good? 11th is good? I could do the 11th. Oh, my goodness. Hold on. Be still my heart. We agreed on something. So do we need a motion for that, or can we just direct? No, we'll just bring it to the schedule. Okay. So the 11th it is. We will email out the time for sure, but expect the five-ish range, give or take a half an hour on each side. We'll confirm with the consultant what time he's available at. And then check your emails. He will be reaching out to everyone individually before then to set up times to discuss with you. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Sorry, do we have any speakers on that? No. Okay. 5.3, Council Member Winslow, improvements for the street sweeping and leaf pickup. I'm glad we still got two hours left because I got a lot to stand for sweeping. Okay. Kind of kidding. I had a really good time researching all this and looking at ways to improve the program. As a step back, there was a couple reasons why I wanted to bring up this conversation in general. There's only one thing that I'm really seeking firm direction on and I think it's worth considering other things in the future. But it's that for over a month at a time often we'll have bike lanes that are used every day by people would be used every day that are full of leaves. I think it makes sense that we would try to keep those a little cleaner and that it's within our own capacity to do that. Which I was encouraged by meeting with staff that is the case. Others is that street sweeping and leaf pickup, these are two similar programs they operate at different times of the year except recently I learned as we've been better staffed with public works we actually have a street sweeper following leaf pickup. Those do happen concurrently but generally leaf pickup is just in the fall. Then street sweeping happens the rest of the year on a two week schedule. They go around the whole city. Whenever you have cars brought in, you have to park on the street. They can't get access very thoroughly. That means that stuff that sits on the street washes down the storm drains. This can clog storm drains. Perhaps more importantly it pollutes the waterways. Stuff gets down there. If you' re not able to access that curb then you don' t get it there. I had the concept that in a lot of cities when you have populated areas and lots of cars on the street you will put in temporary parking restrictions saying for a couple hours on this day once every couple weeks or whatever you don' t park here so the street sweeper can go in and actually do more parking. That' s a good thing. we try to make sure we have a lot of parking space. So people just move their car and sometimes move it right back. I had the concept this would also increase efficiency a lot if we try to place like south campus where you have a lot of broken glass sometimes remnants of burned couches maybe other things. That' re in the gutter there. There' s so many cars parked there. I was thinking with a lot of the street sweeper needing to dip out and dip in in order to get down to the curb it would take a lot longer and it would be faster if you could just drive straight down the curb. The only reason I found that was incorrect is because we had a lot of parking spaces. So we had a lot of parking spaces in the south campus because they virtually cannot sweep the street at all. They can' t access the curb because it' s all parked out. So that' s something I think we can improve. Also we learned as we' ve grown as a city our street sweep schedule has been difficult to maintain. In the future we' re going to grow a lot more not just outwardly but it' s when we upgrade streets like in the avenues in chapman town where you currently don' t have paid parking we don' t street sweep that we' re going to add those. Those are all new streets that will be added to our schedule and it' s hard to maintain the schedule we have. We may have to go back and do some more parking. So we' might want to consider moving in some places to a less frequent schedule. With some of these with better cooperation with homeowners or residents in areas and with some parking restrictions in particular areas where you have more difficulty with that I think we can do a much more efficient and thorough job of street sweeping. If you can read in the report the one thing I would like to give direction on is to prioritize sweeping the bike lanes to make sure they' re clear and add to that and I would like to add to that is just a thorough conversation to staff about some improvements to the programs. Questions or comments? does anybody have a question for Mr. Wenzel? Mr. Van overback? are there some operational efficiencies you think you could gain by being able to have people move their cars so the sweeper could make a straight shot? I' m also persuaded by the argument that the city is not a city of s a lot of pollutants associated with cars. The ground up tire rubber brake fluid all that stuff you can pick up more of it and so as to get in the creeks but the operational efficiency thing seems that it could be a benefit. we certainly benefit from having a clean curve face to sweep against and get those areas and currently now we get most of the city pretty well but there' s some areas where we have to move our cars. effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively the driveway is full both sides of the street are full so it's virtually we're just driving down the center lane not sweeping the gutter pan we do try to sweep those areas um aggressively uh during the summer or excuse me the the christmas break um in december when students are gone and that's pretty effective and then also in the summer months too to keep the south campus area clean but when when students are here it's it's virtually impossible to do so so i think there would be a benefit likely in some of those particular zones if you will south campus for example the challenge is is where do those cars go um on the alternating days because currently both sides of the street um are impacted by parking yeah i've kind of opened up a conversation with the university about that and and they expressed interest in engaging in a similar concern of like well where are the cars going to go um and that that's a difficult one you wouldn't do the entire neighborhood obviously and that there's kind of a butterfly effect on the schedule if you're only doing some streets in one area which is why it's it's broader you wouldn't do the entire neighborhood obviously and that there's kind of a butterfly effect on the conversation not something for us to just like execute roll on one consideration i had about that area in particular is on the weekends um parking is free in the chico state parking structures um and so if we were able to have that area be covered in the weekend then that would be a place that people could all put their cars all right do we have any speakers on this we have four all right three minutes each okay i'll call the first two bruce mclean followed by cynthia perrin and if you could go ahead and line up in the middle aisle thank you hi uh bruce mclean um i am a cyclist i cycle a lot i was very surprised to see that there was a discussion about leaf cleanup because i live on forest avenue and to get to the park i have to drive down it and a couple of weeks ago there were two real mountains of leaves in the podem podem podem bike path, so I had to drive in the road. I stay out of the road. I respect the fact that cars are in the road, and that it's safer for me if I stay in the bike lane. So I don't like to do it, but I did it. And then the next time I drove by there, the leaves were gone. And then I saw that there was this discussion, so I want to say congratulations. And I'd like to hear some ways in which the leaves can be picked up sooner. I mean, obviously, after somebody's gone into trouble of raking them, it's better to pick them up when they're in piles before they start to blow around again. But while they're in piles and they're in my lane for cycling, then they're a real disturbance. So please let us know what kind of changes can be made to improve the collection of leaves. Thanks. Thank you. Cynthia Perrine, followed by Jesse Horgan. Thank you. And it is Cynthia Perrine, rhymes with wine. Just get that straight. My daughter, Charlotte, says thank you for putting this on the agenda. She was the one who stepped forward and spoke at a prior meeting about some of the things she and her friends have experienced on bicycling on the street. So I really appreciate that. And there's more than a leaf pickup schedule here. And I just wanted to say I have lived in several towns in California and in North Carolina with universities. And they made us move our cars. And we dealt with it. And it works. And the streets are cleaner. And you don't get as many flat tires. And your creeks are cleaner because the oil doesn't go into the creeks. So it's kind of a win-win. It's not going to be easy to change people's attitudes about it. But that's what we're here for. So I just wanted to mention that those leaf piles, as Bruce mentioned, they get in these piles in the bike lanes. And then they become an attractive nuisance. So something that really needs to be addressed, and this is through code enforcement, is that I've seen multiple landscapers dumping their lawn clippings onto leaf piles without regard, also blowing debris off of things with no regard for these storm drains and where they're located. So construction, people have to hire stormwater pollution prevention specialists to come in and make sure that they're abiding by the rules. And I don't understand why landscapers aren't held to the same standard. So this is a second item, if the leaves are there. I actually haven't started watching so much in the off seasons, but I'm going to. And I'll be back to talk about if I see if it's the leaf piles that make the landscapers throw their lawn clippings in the street, or if they just always throw their lawn clippings in the street. Thank you very much. Thank you. Jesse Horgan, followed by Adam Fideli. Hello. I live on East 8th Street, and I wanted to echo the previous comments about Forest Drive. I bicycle on Forest Drive to get to the pharmacy and do shopping. I've noticed some of our neighbors coming from Bruce Drive, they have their kids ride along Forest Street to get to the junior high school. So we want to reduce emissions, pollutions, and traffic. So we want to reduce emissions, pollutions, and traffic. So we want to reduce emissions, pollutions, and traffic. So we want to reduce emissions, podem effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively a big push to encourage students to ride their bike to campus rather than driving. Also a push to get students to not bring a car to Chico if they're coming to use public transportation back and forth and bicycle while they're in the city. So anything we can do to make the south of campus easier to ride a bike on will help with that push, reduce traffic, reduce emissions, help the city meet its goals mandated by the state. So I would support the use of the parking structures on the weekend. That's a thing that I encourage the city council and city staff to talk with the university about. I will be happy to be a contact point for that discussion. We are seeing a large increase in e-bikes and scooter traffic this year, as more students purchase them and then they ride them, especially on Ivy, to get to campus. There are safety concerns with the speed that e-bikes and scooters can go along the street and then go into a pile of leaves that could prioritize clearing first. So happy to discuss with this further with anyone who has questions, but thank you. Thank you. Adam Fideli. Evening, everybody. Just a quick comment. I live in old Chico, in south Chico. So the infrastructure being the shape that it's in, when the random leaf piles that can't get picked up or don't get addressed somehow turn into soil about now and then start blocking the minimal storm, the drainage flow that we have. So then we get flooding in streets. So what I would suggest is that after we get done with leaf pickup, that we add a bonus round where public works could come through, grab as much as they can, maybe have extra guys out with shovels and smaller trucks to just clean up the storm drain path real quick or get the mud away from the curb at least so water can flow. Because leaf pickups, that's a great thing. All of us in the older parts of town will love it. But a maintenance round after it's done, I think would be helpful. Thanks. Thank you. Who's our last speaker? All right. Any further council discussion? Mr. O'Brienton? No, I just appreciate you bringing this up. I think there's a lot of issues there that we might be able to do better. And some of these issues do have some relevance to our I think there's a lot of issues there that we might be able to do better. And some of these issues do have some relevance to our recent flooding and such. I think this is a very appropriate conversation. So thanks for bringing it to our attention. Council Member Lozado. No further comments. I'll make the motion that I put in the report here, which is the one action item is moved to direct staff to prioritize safety and utility of bicycle facilities in the street sweeping leaf pickup schedule. But also direct staff to return to council with proposals for updating the street sweeping and leaf pickup programs, including selective parking restrictions, increased public outreach, and!<|haw|> podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem! podem podem podem podem! podem podem podem podem I think it' s a major change for your staff and a huge problem. we prioritize some corridors now that have a high frequency of bicycle traffic we could certainly add some of those and have a higher frequency of pickup during leaf season to mitigate the leaves that are there for some time. on a side note it' s mandatory that everybody has a green waste at their house correct? correct. I don' t ever put leaves on the street they all go in my green waste so I' m just curious. I had a similar concern I wasn' t sure how far you were pushing this in creating a challenge for Mr. Gustafson so thank you for the clarification baby steps I think to get on this and I' m fully in support of any safety measures for bicyclists I think that' great. thank you. we have a motion to second. councilmember goldstein. aye. councilmember holly. yes. councilmember o'brien. yes. councilmember van overbeck. yes. councilmember winslow. yes. vice mayor bennett. yes. mayor reynolds. aye. carries 7-0. reports and communications the following reports and communication items are provided for the council's information no action can be taken on items under this section unless the council agrees to include it on a subsequent agenda. city manager' s report. no report. councilmember requests. I do have a request. Madam mayor. if I may. I would like to have a discussion on the merits of having card lease manage and operate some of our city parks. I will keep the parameters broad for discussion' sake. although I do have some specific parks in mind. card is in the recreation business and they do a great job managing their parks. I think that' s a good thing. I think it has a lot of potential and certainly worthy of discussion. I' ll second that. okay. councilmember goldstein. aye. councilmember holly. yes. councilmember o'brien. yes. councilmember van overbeck. yes. councilmember winslow. yes. vice mayor bennett. yes. mayor reynolds. aye. carries 7-0. all right. any other requests. i want to. there' s this. talking about improved services and public works and we' re able to improve street sweeping leak pick up because of our measure h 2022. other measure h. the county measure h just passed is going to come into effect. I had some conversation. I was thinking about the tax sharing agreements that we have between the city and the county. and they date back to a different period when certain circumstances are different. I wonder if it' s worth us revisiting some of those. I just want a motion to have a discussion on tax sharing agreements between the city and the county. thank you. thank you. seconded. okay. council member goldstein. aye. council member holly. yes. council member o'brien. yes. council member van overbeck. yeah. i' m not sure what we' re going to accomplish by this but yes. council member winslow. i don' t know either and yes. mayor bennett. i' m extremely familiar with this particular item from many many years ago. So a conversation is fine, but I don't think it's gonna go very far Yeah, just gonna say I don't know how much control we actually have over it But I'm willing to hear and have the conversation. Okay, it carries seven zero Right any others? All right. We are adjourned
