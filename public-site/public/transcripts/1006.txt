And if the second person who I call can go ahead and get lined up as well.  So Nicole Nava and then Jeff Creed.  Good evening, one and all.  So tonight I am here to speak to you about a follow-up on getting some addiction services and mental health going and getting your support with the resolution.  I haven't heard from any of you.  I suspect some of you concur that it is needed.  It would be super great.  If one of you could take the reins on just doing a quick little resolution email that you all could sign and send over in support to Assemblyman Gallagher,  to Assemblyman Kevin Kiley, and to Congressman LaMalfa and Senator Nielsen.  I already did the legwork by sending some stuff over,  and I'm trying to get meetings with the Budget and Finance Committee to try to get some mandates and some funding.  I realize it's not a City Council funding situation.  I know you guys are in a position to manage this, but throwing your support would be huge.  Because, of course, the City is in the County.  The County is providing us some of the services, right?  We need more.  We need a lot more.  And I know you guys have been working very hard to figure out and land on a solution.  But this is just something.  It's going down a road to get some help sooner rather than later, I hope.  You've got some things up tonight I'll be back to speak about.  Because I just still am concerned about the safety of citizens.  I'm concerned about the safety of the public.  I'm concerned about the safety of the homeless people.  I am concerned about the safety of the community at large, which folds in the homeless people.  We've had a man who was murdered, and that is not good.  And I'm sorry for the loss of him, for his friends and his family.  We had someone die today.  And it is just heartbreaking that we cannot move forward and get to a safer place for all of us.  I am concerned that we are now in a situation where we cannot get any updates at all  about what's going on.  And that we might be presented with some solution that will put the City of Chico on the hook  for upfront and ongoing costs that we will not be able to maintain.  We have a city that is degrading in front of us as far as things.  We listened to Mr. Ottoboni and others that have come up to talk to us.  We've listened to your finance director.  And we understand that there's a lot this city needs.  And you're going to be asking us to put something on the measure tonight, which I won't go into yet.  But how can we do that?  How can we get even a solution that we're supposed to keep paying for  if we don't even have anything that is taking care of our city's infrastructure?  Thank you that you're taking care of some potholes and roadways.  Things are looking great.  Some of those, though, were grant situations and other things.  I'd like to see what our city can do.  Maybe some ideas for quick wins when you are enforcing things.  Get a quick dashboard.  This many calls.  This many things were resolved.  This many are still outstanding.  That seems like it wouldn't take that long.  And it would gain the trust of the city to know so that when you do this big ask and it comes vote time,  people can feel comfortable voting yes.  Thank you so much for your time tonight.  Jeff Creed followed by Rick Shanks.  So the council voted in to create change in Chico.  It's been almost a year.  I would ask what change do you think you've created that was actually positive?  I'd ask you, you know, I'm not seeing a lot of changes on the street that I would call positive.  I'm not seeing any changes in literature from any of you that I would call positive.  I'm not seeing any plan for change forward.  I'm not seeing any progress moving the needle forward on anything.  Sure, you've got a couple of little pet projects where you're trying to tune a specific thing to do a bad task a little bit better.  But I'm not seeing any core changes.  And, you know, you've got, what, a year before elections hit again and throw this into chaos again?  So what I would ask, and I think anybody who wants to see or feel any form of confidence in this committee,  in this council would agree with me, is I'd like to see you all go home and pen out your top five objectives for the next year  and how to actually get them done.  Not some, you know, oh, I plan on clearing the parks.  Because we've seen how the big, you know, publicity gathering agendas fail repeatedly.  I was going through Facebook and I remember standing in the plaza for lunch.  And at least a couple of you sitting up there were in the plaza how many years ago saying,  hey, we're going to take back the plaza, we're going to make the plaza clean.  You know, the lunch in the plaza faded away because it got no tracks.  It was a mess.  There was no traction in this building, right?  People showed up every week, twice a week.  But in the end, it didn't make a difference, did it?  It got no traction.  And the people sitting up there that showed up, I'd ask you, you know, how do you feel about the time and effort you spent?  How do you feel about the time and effort others spent?  So if you want time and effort from your citizens, if you want money from your citizens, if you want support from your citizens,  if you want civil discourse,  you have to earn that respect.  And you earn respect through being competent.  You earn respect by having a pragmatic plan that they can see, feel, and touch and understand.  And if you're not up to the task, then why did you run for office?  If you didn't come in with a list of objectives that you could say, this is how I get it done, this is what I need to get it done,  why did you even put your name on the sheet?  Why did you even sign up?  A lot of you are real quiet, and a lot of you don't like to say things publicly between council meetings.  As we've learned, that can be kind of dangerous when you step over the lines.  But community support isn't earned from silence and sneaking things through the agenda.  Open, honest actions earn support, respect.  I'd like to see some of that, Florence.  Rick Shanks, followed by Norris.  Thank you, Nolan.  And I apologize if I mess up your last name a little.  Good evening.  I'm here tonight just mainly to discuss how the homeless situation affects my life, my family's life, and my business.  I'm a business owner in Chico.  I was born and raised in Chico.  I've been here all my life.  I moved away because it was a small town.  And I said, I don't think I'm ever coming back.  Moved away.  Was part of a successful business in the Bay Area.  And we decided to come back to Chico because Chico's where you want to live.  So the respect part of the individual who spoke in front of me, I 100% agree.  I'll flip it to the other side, though.  You know, part of our problem with our homeless people out there is there's a respect part of that equation that's not present.  And there's also part of that equation that people don't want help.  And people that do want help, I want to put together a plan, and you guys are part of that, to help us do that, to help the people that want help.  The people that don't want help, well, that's another story.  So how does this situation in the population affect my life?  My personal life has been hugely impacted by the homeless population.  Downtown is no longer really an option for me.  I care not to come down here because of the pressures that are here with the people that are down here.  An example is that on one occasion my wife and my daughter were downtown enjoying some coffee and some tea together at a local restaurant.  And a homeless individual walked up to them and looked at my daughter and said, I want your drink.  And my daughter said, no, I'm sorry, you can't have my drink.  And there was a presence there that was an uncomfortable presence until they had to ask this individual to leave.  And at that point the individual grabbed a handful of sugar packets and threw it at them.  And saundered off.  Okay, that is just an unfortunate part of why people don't come to downtown Chico anymore.  The parks are another area that we used to enjoy and ride our bikes and jog and horseback ride and enjoy time in the water.  You guys have heard this over and over again.  We don't go to the parks anymore.  We don't want our animals drinking out of the water for obvious reasons.  We don't want to walk down there and worry about what we're going to step on.  You guys have heard all this.  We don't want to walk down there.  We don't want to walk down there.  It's because of who we might encounter.  It's very uncomfortable pressure that's part of that equation.  We don't want that.  My professional life has also been impacted.  You know, homeless people sleeping on my job sites.  Losing tools, tools stolen that I have to worry about.  Having to put up a fence is a common place now to protect my tools, the people I work for.  Those are things that we shouldn't have to worry about.  On a final note, a client of mine moved to Chico and built a very nice house.  He left the Bay Area because he wanted to come to this community and enjoy what we offer.  He told me last week that the homeless situation here is worse now than when he left the Bay Area.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I just want to put a plan together that we can all work together on.  So Nolan Loop, followed by Angela Redston.  Good evening.  Sorry, I just came from work.  I'm a little ill-prepared.  I just wanted to address the council.  I moved here coming up on five years ago to finish college, got my bachelor's.  I now work at an accounting firm here in Chico.  My wife trains horses out of the stable off of Dayton Road.  We decided to buy a house out in the Heron Jokes neighborhood, which many of you might know is near Tiger Ponds, which you also might know.  We bought a year and a half ago, and it was beautiful.  My wife likes to run.  I like to ride my bikes.  I worked at a local bike shop here for the whole time I was in college.  We can't do that anymore.  My wife, being small as she is, tries to go down and run through Tiger Ponds.  A couple months ago, came back with a needle in her shoe.  Fantastic.  Luckily, it didn't get into her foot.  I go down there.  I tried.  I get mugged, or they tried to.  I was on my bike.  So luckily, I was a little faster than they were.  She goes down there and gets threatened.  There's a well-known man down there we call him Mr. Alaska.  He says, I will effing kill you if I see you again.  It's the middle of the day.  I can't go down to the gorgeous wildlife preserve, by the way, that Tiger Ponds is, and enjoy what I paid good money and worked from turning in cancer gas money to home ownership.  I can't enjoy the fruits of those labor.  I had a choice between staying here in Chico, which is a beautiful town, or moving to where I would rather be in Colorado.  I decided to stay here because I really like Chico.  Biggest regret in my life.  Something, this progression, and unfortunately, due to that order, I know that there's not a lot that can be done while that injunction is in place.  But any kind of progress would be fantastic.  And I know Nicole mentioned earlier, health services for those that want them, necessary.  For those that don't, that's unacceptable.  You can't have something like that allowed.  You can't let chaos rule the streets.  And as he said before me, downtown's not an option for me.  I don't come here.  It's just not worth the hassle of getting, you know, either attempted to be mugged or anything like that.  It's just the only time I'm going to come downtown in every two weeks to address you folks.  Something needs to be done because this has basically ruined my entire, you know, first home ownership.  It's beautiful.  It's great.  I have no desire to stay here.  But unfortunately, I got two years until I can sell a house without dealing with massive tax ramifications.  So sorry for my ramblings.  Thank you for your time.  Thank you.  Thank you.  are holding the city hostage is offensive and furthers from the truth.  The fact is, it's the City Council and the City Management that are holding the  city hostage by not doing anything to help our unhoused citizens and instead  block every attempt by others who are working towards solutions. And folks have  just before have talked about a plan and that's what we need. More troubling  to me is when Morgan spoke about our unhoused citizens as those who don't  contribute to society, as if the unhoused don't deserve to be cared for.  One of the principles I believe in is the inherited worth and dignity of every  person without stipulation. What I believe is that we need to find ways to  care for all, including those who are permanent or temporarily unable to care  for themselves, including those who are born into this world unable to care for  themselves, people who become disabled, individuals who fall into addiction,  people who become disabled, individuals who fall into addiction,  the unhoused, and on and on. And I'm not the only one that feels this way. To quote  Mother Teresa, if sometimes our poor people have had to die of starvation, it  is not that God didn't care for them, but because you and I didn't give. We're not  instruments of love in the hands of God to give them bread, to give them clothing,  because we did not recognize them.  When once more Christ came in disguise, disguised in the hungry man, the lonely  man, the homeless child, and seeking for shelter. And from the book of Psalms,  defend the poor, the fatherless, to do justice to the afflicted and the needy.  I believe at the very minimum this council should censor Morgan for his  disparaging comments.  Matt Galloway followed by Chris  Patrick Newman.  Good evening, council. Thanks for the opportunity to speak this evening. My name is Matt Galloway,  long-time resident of Chico. I'm a local architect, local business owner, and local property owner.  Actually, the property that I own is at the corner of Park and Myers, which is about 100 yards from Comanche Creek.  And to call that situation chaos would be an understatement at this point. I think one thing that we need to do is to  make an made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made  to get to her front door and she wasn't sure what was going to happen. There's  this element of surprise that can happen and I can tell you speaking on behalf of  my employees and the people who are employed at places that we own that it's  no longer a question about what can happen. We've had instances with people  with with rocks thrown through windshields on our property. We've had  instances with people picking up steel pipes and chasing employees across the  parking lot. There's so many different anecdotal stories that we could tell.  It's not a question of if anymore, it's a question of how bad is it going to  become. And we as a city have a minimum obligation to take care of our citizens  and our employees and if we can't do that we're going to lose people. I'm in a  unique position as an architect in town where I see people who are considering  coming to Chico, who are considering investing in our community, who are  considering bringing jobs to our town.  That could potentially help people off the street. I know a number of my  colleagues who have actually employed people off the street and in their  places of business. We're compassionate. The situation at Comanche's Creek is not  compassionate. By nobody's definition could that situation be compassionate  and I feel compelled tonight to come forward and plead to this group,  a group of very creative people, to come up with a way. I realize that the  The injunction is in place.  But honestly, we're in a position where we're going to lose some very key businesses  if we have not already lost them.  And I've heard some very disheartening and heartbreaking conversations from my clients  who have decided to choose other cities other than Chico because there is a choice.  And that truly is heartbreaking.  So I implore you to think about that situation and hopefully come up with a plan.  Thank you.  Patrick Newman, followed by Jessica Giannola.  The biggest threat to Chico is that there's a revenue shortfall that's like a cancer on the city.  It's been destroying it for 10 years.  That's the biggest threat to Chico.  I just talked to a friend of mine who lives on Sunset over in the avenues.  A house just got listed there, if she was correct, for $500,000.  Point being, it's not like real estate is not in demand in this community.  The whole idea that somehow there's going to be this mass exodus doesn't sound bad to me, but it's a fiction.  The thing about homeless direct contact, these kinds of stories.  I was in the park today with my dog.  I walked by a homeless man who was camping there.  I had a small issue with him.  I kept walking.  I mean, it was polite.  But I had an issue.  I won't go into it.  I thought about it for a while.  I went back.  And I talked to him.  And we actually had an amazingly good conversation.  And I have these conversations all the time with people on the streets.  The reason I have those kinds of conversations is because I approach them with respect.  I try to engage them and understand them.  I make friends with them before we can become enemies.  I can tell you.  I can tell you from hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of contacts.  This is not an impossible thing to do.  So I didn't come up here to talk about pushing back on the demonization narrative.  I never get to the stuff that my three minutes is supposed to cover.  But that's what I'm doing right now.  And the other thing to think about when we present these narratives that put homeless people in the worst possible light,  running across parking lots with pipes and all this.  Okay.  In a destabilized community that's this deprived,  and this stressed,  doesn't sleep,  you're going to bring out the worst possible characteristics in people.  That's the first part.  The second part is that,  of course,  when you have an immediate experience like that,  that's so personal,  it's hard to dial back from the big reality of what's going on here.  And I've come here many,  many times and talked about,  I mean,  I'm 65 years old.  I've been watching this 40 year trajectory on this subject for a long time.  And I've followed it.  And I followed it more exponentially,  more in the last 10 years.  But the problem is deep.  It's systemic.  It has to do with the way we distribute wealth in America.  It has to do with the way that we distribute housing in America.  If you go talk to Ed Mayer,  I've mentioned his name here many times.  He'll tell you that County is five to 6,000 minutes short on affordable housing.  This problem is rampant.  It's epidemic throughout the entire West Coast and many other parts of the United States until we get real about that.  Yeah.  We're going to have people in our public spaces and you can't fix it.  No matter how much people talk,  you can be more humane about how you deal with it.  And you can't fix it.  Jessica is our last speaker.  We did receive one additional card,  but it was that it was too late for the card.  I can.  So I just want to start with supporting Nicole's request that she's made quite a few times that the city does.  Get involved with even a letter of support for something that we have a common request for additional services for mental health services.  There's lots of things that we need help with,  but that's one.  And I think that most of us can agree on it.  So if there's something the city can do,  yes,  we would like more support.  I think that we should do that.  Another area that I hear us quite a few of us agreeing on is the fact that nobody wants people living on the sidewalks or in the parks.  There's different reasons,  different values,  but we can agree on that.  And so I think the resolution that gets people out of the parks,  say,  temporary shelters to transitional housing,  low income housing,  those steps that helps solve a common problem and would help lessen the anger.  I look forward to the day we can come here and I don't look up to see faces that look like you're being tortured because I know this isn't a fun process,  but we're here because.  I'm not.  We all have concerns and we're talking to you who do have a level of control over some of the things that happen that can fix these issues.  Another thing that you can have control over is the narrative that's put out there.  I know that that things are said that are really shocking and they do affect people's behavior.  And sometimes that results in people being killed because people hearing that message,  they don't necessarily understand what's happening.  The.  Rules of the government involved in problem solution,  and they feel like action guns assaults are what needs to be done.  We can't fix it.  Let's just pull it out of people or hit him out of whatever it might be.  But the things that you say can incite that even if you don't realize it,  they can't.  So I just want to empower you guys to be more careful about what we're saying when the committee is listening,  because we're always listening.  We're always watching.  So the,  I know that the shelter,  the BMX sites been proposed.  I did hear argument that we shouldn't be considering it because the previous council member had voted that we not discuss that.  But considering that person's not on here because they probably lived in reading,  I think that one's next.  So we should be considering the BMX site and I'm asking if the city,  I know that the 30,  the end of the year has been asked that the people move from the city.  So I,  if conversations can happen,  seeing people involved are more willing to move out sooner considering winter is coming and we can move those pallet shelters pretty quick.  I was there at that site took 10 minutes to get it up.  And I think that before winter hits,  and it's going to be cold and wet,  just seeing if they're willing to do that and everybody's,  we're all paying the price in this,  but lives and then problem solving.  Thank you.  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  Move on to item four,  which is public hearings,  a public hearing of the 2021 consolidated annual performance and evaluation for the federal community block grant and home investment partnership.  And I believe it's Mary Joe Lonzo.  Hey,  there she is.  Hi,  good evening.  Mayor,  vice mayor and council members.  I'm Mary Jo.  Lonzo housing specialist with the city.  And before you tonight to do a short presentation on our.  A HUD consolidated plan,  which is a condition of receiving federal funding through the U.  S.  Department of housing and urban development.  HUD and we're required to put this together yearly.  It's referred to the caper.  So that's how I'll be referring to it tonight.  The purpose of the capers to report.  On the progress and carrying out the city's five year strategic plan for both CDBG and home programs as well as reporting on specific achievements.  Of the city's annual action plan and actions to further fair housing.  The highlight of this funding is the continued increase and the low and moderate income small businesses.  Who are receiving training and counseling services offered through butte colleges small business development center.  Okay.  The program last year far exceeded the goal and successfully provided counseling to 272 businesses.  102 of those were newly assisted during fiscal year 20.  The City Sewer Assistance Program funded the connection of seven low-income households to City Sewer,  and funding allowed infrastructure improvements to support the development of six Habitat for Humanity homes on Mulberry Street.  Although organizations continue to feel the effects of the ongoing pandemic,  many were able to leverage this funding with other sources of funding to continue to provide services to our most vulnerable populations.  Public services funding was provided to Chico Meals on Wheels and Peg Taylor Center to keep seniors and disabled safe and at home during COVID.  Public service funding also went to CHAT, Esplanade House, and Catalyst to continue their emergency services.  The program also provided support to the City of San Diego,  which has been able to provide support to the City of San Diego's emergency sheltering and transitional housing assistance programs.  Some of these organizations also received an allocation of CDBG-CV funding,  which is to be used specifically to prevent and respond to COVID.  These program funds and the accomplishments are not included in this year's report, but will be reported on at a later date.  Through a partnership with the Housing Authority and participating social workers,  social service providers, 21 households were successfully assisted through the tenant-based rental assistance program known as TEBRHA.  Home and CDBG funding is also going towards the construction of 100 affordable units designated for seniors and disabled adults at Creekside Place Apartments.  Construction on this project began in May.  As mentioned earlier, the number of businesses requesting assistance increased as well as the demand for public services, which either met or exceeded our goals.  Code enforcement cases increased and such enforcement, coupled with other city improvements and services, is expected to arrest the decline in the area.  Due to COVID, the services provided through CDBG and home programs were impacted by COVID, and T-Bird was very close to meeting their annual goal.  Service providers also experienced delays in moving residents into permanent homes due to low vacancy rates.  And we continue to see moderate demand in the sewer connection program and continue to connect the low-income residents in both the nitrate and non-nitrate areas.  CDBG funded three fair housing workshops that were attended by 104 individuals.  The city continues to provide fair housing referrals to local, state, and federal investigative authorities, and we publish information on our website and imprinted brochures regarding fair housing policies.  In closing, the full CAPER report was included in tonight's agenda packet and was made available on the city's website.  A public notice was published in the Enterprise Record on September 4, which encouraged public comments on the document through tonight's public hearing.  At this time, no comments have been received, but if any are received tonight, they will be incorporated into the report that will be submitted to HUD.  Upon close of this public hearing, it is requested that Council approve the submission of the report to HUD.  This concludes my report, and I'm happy to answer any questions.  Thank you.  Any other questions that you may have?  All right. Questions?  None?  Thank you.  How many speakers?  No speakers on this item?  Okay. So we'll open the public hearing, close the public hearing, and will the Council?  Move to approve.  I'll second that.  I have a motion by Vice Mayor Reynolds.  Second by Alonzo T.  Council Member Bennett?  Aye.  Council Member Brown?  Aye.  Council Member Morgan?  Yes.  Council Member O'Brien?  Yes.  Council Member Tandon?  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds?  Aye.  Mayor Coolidge?  Aye.  Carries 7-0.  Thank you, Council Member.  All right.  Okay.  So, and you need five minutes, correct, Debbie, before we move on?  Um.  Actually, if I can just bring up the computer for this next item, I think.  Okay.  Why don't we just take a three-minute recess?  Okay.  That's fine.  Thank you.  All right.  We'll readjourn.  Or un-recess.  And there are...  I'm sorry.  So it's been a struggle.  We have some people listening.  Thank you.  All right.  Moving on to the regular agenda item 5.1, consideration and approval of supplemental  appropriation budget modification for the ice skating ring funding transfer capital  project to a newly created city recreation fund.  And we will start with Mr. Murdoch.  Good evening, Mayor, Vice Mayor, Council Members.  Just to introduce myself.  My name is Bob Murdoch.  I've been appointed by the city manager as the interim public works director for engineering.  I'm here on an interim basis while human resources goes through a search process to identify  a permanent candidate, permanent replacement for Mr. Otovani.  So I'm lucky to be able to talk about the ice rink first as my first item.  This is...  The item before you actually was held over from the last meeting.  The item itself is really targeted to the city.  It really deals with a financial action that really moved funding, budgeted funding from  one account to the other, but it spurred a conversation about the ice rink project itself.  There were some number of questions and requests for clarification of information related to  revenues and expenditures.  So in response, I did prepare a memo.  You have it before you.  And I hope that it answers and provides the information you were looking for with that.  That concludes what I plan to say.  So you're happy to answer any questions.  All right.  Questions?  Yeah.  I have a few questions.  I know that you're kind of taking over this issue from Mr. Otovani.  So if Mr. Arm, if this is more appropriate for you, let me know.  But I believe last time it was stated that the budget numbers, revenues, and expenses  was for a two-year period.  Is that correct?  Or is it just for the upcoming year?  The budget numbers, revenues, and expenses was for a two-year period.  The budget numbers I provided were for one year.  Okay.  Okay.  So I wanted to be very clear that that's the revenue.  One season of the ice rink.  And expenditures were anticipated for this one year.  If the council decides to do it again, you know, next year, I would anticipate there  would be some savings because some of the stuff we've already spent, but probably not  a lot.  Sure.  And it was mentioned that we, in the report, that we got inquiries for sponsorship with  one being at the $10,000 range.  Is it your expectation that if we kick off marketing sponsorship levels now?  That we'll reach the estimated nearly $300,000 in sponsorships that we're looking for?  Since that's the biggest revenue resource.  I was just curious.  I believe that the revenue estimate for sponsorships is conservative.  We did it based on the rink contractor's experience in other locations.  I can tell you that we've gotten a number of inquiries every day about sponsorship,  even though we're not doing any outreach.  In fact, we have Summit Funding who wants to be a title sponsor at the level of $30,000.  Already telling us that's what they want to do.  I'd say as of right now, sponsorships are somewhere in the range of $60,000 with no  outreach and no effort.  It's just basically word of mouth.  So I would say that's a good estimate of revenue.  Great.  And just one last question.  I poked around this last week, but I didn't feel like I got a clear answer.  So forgive me for re-asking, but this project appears to have taken quite a bit of staff  time in addition to the budget request early this year.  Who added it to the budget?  And can you explain that?  Explain a little bit of what led up to that?  Are you asking about the staff time or the overall project?  Yeah, the staff time that has been dedicated to the project.  It wasn't directed by council, and so I was just curious kind of where this came from.  Well, my understanding of the history of the project is funding for the project was requested  for the last several years.  It wasn't ultimately approved two previous years.  In this fiscal year's budget, it was requested and approved as part of the budget.  So as with any project...  Once it's approved, staff moves forward.  And part of the funding request or the money budgeted was not only for the contract for  Ice America, and it was also for staff time to be able to manage that.  So the approval was obtained through the budget process and the annual budget being approved  and the money being budgeted for that particular project.  So what was the process for this project being added to the budget in the first place?  My understanding was just part of the budget.  So it was just part of the budget.  So it was just part of the budget proposal along with a number of other projects, whether  it be a different capital or the roads or anything else, and it was just one of those  projects that was part of the list of projects being proposed and ultimately approved.  Yeah, roads are pretty standard fare.  And IceRink is a brand new project, and given that this wasn't a council-driven project,  I've just been kind of curious where it originated.  My understanding is that staff at the time looked at it, saw it as an opportunity to  bring people downtown as an event.  And that's what it was.  And that's why it had come forward for several years but not approved, but ultimately it  was.  So I can't, that's the only answer.  Let me help you out with that, Bob.  I think that's good.  This has been an item that's been on my desk every year for the past few years.  Staff has thought it would be a great idea.  I never brought it forward to council with the exception of this past fiscal year that  we're currently in, only for the simple fact that at the beginning when it was first proposed,  realizing the campfire had occurred, I know that there was some sensitivity there and  I'm like, well, let's not go there.  Because that just, it's not very kind on that end.  And then the next year is like, okay, maybe now is getting closer to a time because from  staff's perspective, and it was two-fold, one, to create another recreational amenity  for Chico residents.  That is really an attraction for cities across the state.  It's an attraction for anyone who's made an effort to make an effort to make an effort  to make an effort to make an effort to make an effort to make an effort to make an effort  to make an effort to make an effort to make an effort to make an effort to make an effort  to make an effort to make an effort to make an effort to make an effort to make an effort  to make an effort to make an effort to make an effort to make an effort to make an effort.  present this and so director otto boney in his uh presentation uh it was one of the slides  highlighted slides of and this is another wonderful thing that's coming and um and that's  how it got into the budget is it was approved in the budget process so it was created and driven  by staff leap of faith that the council would support that moving forward absolutely city  staff's constantly looking for ways to encourage economic development and particularly in difficult  times coming off of covid to spur the economy even more this was this was one that just made  sense for staff thanks for the clarity absolutely right any other questions mr morgan yeah i just i  want a clarification so we have spent if i'm reading it correctly and i might not be on ice  america we've given them uh roughly 100 grand to this point we're obligated i think we've probably  given them about 70 000 or so but i think we're obligated into the contract for the remainder  up  up  to the 99 000 number so the expense oh so two years would be did you say this was two years or  one year no this is one year so it says expenses ice america contract 217 yes we've spent almost  100 yeah we've obligated for about half of it yes okay when you say obligated if we stop do we  have to keep paying them no well that number is we've sat down with ice america and that is the  number based on the contract and what they've spent so far that they've spent so far that they  would expect to be made whole okay and and this is for the purchase of the rink and the ice floor  and floor insulation all these things that we own through no they own but they've made they've made  um agreements for rental they've bought materials for the ice rink okay and so they would build the  ice rink and then ultimately when they're done they would take it away okay it's those materials  that gets the crux of my question and this is what i asked two weeks ago my concern is given the  injunction on the city now despite all the excitement about the ice rink there's a whole  lot of people that aren't coming anywhere near downtown with good reason and what do we now if  the money's spent it's a sunk cost go ahead and see what happens but if it's not my question is  what if we punt and we wait until the injunction is gone and we can queen city plaza to the extent  that we'd like to and everybody that is currently there has somewhere else to go that they'd like to  make an injunction made an injunction made an injunction made an injunction made an injunction  made an injunction made an injunction made an injunction made an injunction made an injunction  made an injunction made an injunction made an injunction made an injunction made an injunction  made an injunction made an injunction made an injunction made an injunction made an injunction  made an injunction made an injunction made an injunction made an injunction made an injunction  made an injunction made an injunction made an injunction made an injunction made an injunction  made an injunction made an injunction made an injunction made an injunction made an injunction  cost we will pay that perfect answer I'm not like it but it was I understood thank you all right  other questions all right I have a couple so we had this in the budget presentation in June correct  I mean I remember it I think everybody else should remember it and we discussed it and approved it  I think pretty overwhelmingly so I don't even know if we but I know it was part of the presentation  so so it was part of the presentation at that time you know I can tell you that I don't ice  skate at all I fall but that's the extent of my ice skating experience but I have taken my kids  to the ice rink in Mount Shasta, Paradise, Sacramento and San Francisco  you  as part of a trip there and some of those were day trips but they all included a restaurant or  something along those lines how many other cities do we know of at least in northern  California that have ice rinks I know Anderson just approved one  I think northern California was somewhere around 25  30 okay so a substantial number  so it's not a rare occurrence it's a common occurrence all right thank you  and no further questions all right how many speakers do we have we have 15  all right let's do three let's do two minutes okay Nicole Nava followed by Melanie Bassett  hello so I'm really torn on this one as I noted before and I just want to  highlight that this is the reality I got here tonight went to try to sit everything was all  sticky and flies were everywhere I didn't feel comfortable or safe I I feel like the structures  that are all the way around the plaza would preclude a lot of the people who've already  spoken and saying they don't feel like they want to bring their families from doing so it's  difficult you I see in the picture it looks like they'll be you know wall of course the  force will force her to walk her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her her  And I understand that those folks are suffering from their own things, but that doesn't negate the fact that it is not safe for everyone.  So I would just echo what people have kind of had thematically through this evening, that it would be who of you to figure out a way to get folks to where they can be elsewhere so that it can be a safe experience for everyone.  And I don't know what that looks like.  I don't know if that looks like getting with the providers to do something at the shelters temporarily during that time frame or something.  But there must be something everybody can land on if you proceed down this path.  For me, I feel like it's probably best to wait, given what's going on, which is unfortunate.  I think it would be a magical, wonderful thing for a lot of things.  And I think kids see things differently and probably enjoy that once you make it through some things of maybe feeling uncomfortable.  I think it would be great for revenue.  I can understand how downtown business owners would be enthused about having people coming because after you gather, you tend to go for drinks and food and stuff.  So it would be good.  For stimulating our economy here, which is sorely needed.  So hard task for you.  Melanie Bassett, followed by Chris Daniels.  Good evening.  I'm Melanie Bassett, executive director of the Downtown Chico Business Association.  And I've been working with Public Works probably four or five years on this idea.  It's a really exciting idea.  In my mind, the city plaza was built for this kind of thing, right?  So I do strongly urge the council members to support the Chico Ice Rink and the plaza.  It's for all of Chico.  It's for the region.  Moving this forward.  It will provide a significant boost to our downtown and the city as a whole.  It will provide a much-needed return to the economic and civic vitality of our community.  It's been a difficult time for Chico, okay, over the last few years.  We've suffered through the isolation of the pandemic and a seemingly endless blanket of smoke through hot summers.  We need something that brings us together and holds Chico together.  Tom Dee and I conducted several business walks downtown.  Everyone that we spoke to was so excited about this idea.  And not a negative note was expressed, surprisingly.  But many expressed interest in sponsorships.  I mean, people were really jazzed about the idea.  And I think the rink will provide a needed lift.  We anticipate that people will come out to the venue numerous times over the course of the eight-week run.  It's especially appealing to families and children, teens and adults.  Young adults.  A chance for some wholesome hometown fun and good cheer.  We need joy in our downtown.  It's an opportunity to visit and partake in all that our downtown has to offer.  So shake off the doldrums.  Reconnect to the community.  It will bring a little sparkle back to our city and the community.  Thank you.  Chris Daniels, followed by Kate Layden.  Good evening. Hi there.  My name is Chris Daniels, and I'm from Kirk's Jewelry right here downtown.  I just wanted to let you know that I strongly support the idea of the ice skating rink in the downtown plaza.  It's what it was built for, to bring people downtown and be part of the community.  We've been in business downtown for over 40 years,  and I think this is the best and most positive thing to happen downtown since I've been around.  I know there's many concerns and needs in our community,  and I know that we have received funding to address a lot of those needs.  I know it must be difficult, but I just ask that you continue that hard work,  but also give us the opportunity to have this rink downtown that would bring so much joy and excitement to the families.  I know there's issues. I'm there every day.  I walk the streets. I love our downtown.  But there's more good than bad, and if we all need to remember that and keep going forward and finding solutions.  So, again, I thank you.  I highly hope that you will consider this and keep the rink going forward.  Thank you for your time.  Kate Leiden, followed by Charles Withoon.  Speaking as a citizen, I can't say it any better than Melanie just said it.  So, I'll just agree with what Melanie said.  This is an investment in our downtown.  There are risks.  Yes, people may not come, but what if they do?  How great would that be?  So, I strongly support this.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Charles Withoon, followed by Angela Resdin.  Mayor, Council, staff, thank you.  I appreciate your job is difficult, boring at times, I'm sure,  and you're asked to make some tough decisions.  This is your moment.  My neighbor's well went dry about three weeks ago.  Another neighbor's well, he called me up.  My well is sputtering.  Another neighbor, we asked him for 100 gallons.  He said, I don't think I can spare 100 gallons out of my well.  Lake Oroville is the lowest I can remember ever being.  Groundwater levels are the lowest they have been.  And we're told by scientists, isn't it ironic that the next item on the agenda  talks about climate change?  And we're told by scientists that this climate action that's going on  is accelerating faster than we thought it was.  And when it was your chance to set an example for our children  in the midst of probably the worst drought in our lifetime,  you can choose whether or not to have an optional use for a thousand gallons of water.  Um...  Um...  Um...  Um...  We recommend that we put off the ice rink until the drought breaks.  Thank you.  Angela Resden, followed by Patrick Newman.  Good evening again.  I spoke to you guys about this last time,  and my concern also was about the water uses  and the optics of what it sends the message about us using this water at this time.  I've also been asked to volunteer at the water distribution  that's happening on Monday, Wednesday, and Saturday in this town  for people that don't have water,  that they have to come and get that.  water. What I'm asking you to consider is to use reclaimed water. Why are we going  to be using fresh drinking water for something like this when we have a water  treatment plant in town where we could probably do something? So I'm asking you  to consider using another alternative source of water. Patrick Newman followed  by Carol Bingman. First of all I think it's in the policy on speaking that it's  is that just business from the floor where it's 45 minutes max? Okay I stand  correct. Two minutes. Okay I know it's tedious to listen to everyone and so giving us that  extra minute is probably pretty painful. It seemed to me that what the question  was asked by the council was what would it take to get out of this contract in  terms of a negotiation with the provider? Okay I see the skates and  helmets and all stuff have been  taken. What would it take to get out of this contract?  Obviously a lot of that stuff that's been purchased can can be used by  state America or what it's called for another project. So I wonder if a real  negotiation happened there where there was really like what what can we really  do here to get out of this at the least cost? Somehow I doubt that.  Secondly I don't look at this I mean water yes, energy yes, these are serious  issues. More serious is the fact that I have this perverse idea that there's a  lot of people who are really hurting  and without a porous public space those people suffer much much more and so yes  we can all talk about the suffering we experience in our homes and all this is  the kind of suffering that you get to know when you spend hours and hours and  hours with these people getting to know them personally. So our downtown as much  as it may be uncomfortable for us this is a place this is a resource that  people who we've dumped on the streets have access to now and when you take out  access away,  know that you are inflicting more suffering on people. Know this and let's  not push the elephant in the room off into the corner here and not talk about  why this is being done. It's being done largely to own the plaza back. It doesn't have to be owned back.  Come to the plaza, get to know people, make it a public space for everybody.  It's people choosing not to go there because of fear that's unfounded that destroys it. Thank you.  Carol Bingman followed by Will Brady.  This is my first time to ever have this offer this ability to speak to the  council.  I would like to begin by telling you that my age is 85,  and I can remember very vividly of when I was a teenager,  and even when my children were small,  that we went ice skating.  And I read the article in the paper, yesterday's paper,  I've got it in the car, I forgot to bring it in with me.  But if there was an ice skating rink here,  I would be one of the first people to get on the rink.  I wouldn't be able to do figure skating.  Figure skating would be out of the question.  But it's just something that really thrilled me in my youth,  and I would love to have it here in Chico.  This would be great.  Thank you.  Will Brady followed by Jessica Giannola.  That is a tough act to follow.  New council members, nice to see you.  I just kind of want to address this as,  I've been asked by friends of mine to come and speak to it.  I kind of want the council to battle against  the reflexive aspects of an optic-based item such as this.  This is going to provide things for downtown.  There are sunk costs already into it.  If it's gonna cost 100,000, 200,000,  or $1,000 to finish it off,  and we lose, say, 25,000,  but we bring $1 million to downtown  in related business spending, then it's worth doing.  It's a mathematical discussion, simply.  You can bring somebody an experience in downtown,  which we lack something to do downtown.  I've been looking to build a bowling alley  down here for five years.  We just need things to do, and this could be a first step.  If it goes well, you buy the aluminum stuff that we need.  We keep it at the DPW yard.  Then we can do it every year,  and it can become a revenue generator for generations.  So I think if you look at this simply,  it's just something to do in the downtown.  It could be a unifying thing.  I think everyone has to simply get away from reflexively  saying, well, we could use it better for something else,  but this is earmarked for recreation.  This is recreation.  Let's do something different.  Let's reflexively,  push against the idea that we have to always have  that position that is against people we might disagree  with sometimes, or that it has to go towards somebody's  pet project.  I think we can solve this easily.  And I recommend everyone try ice skating.  I grew up with it in Boston, and it's really a good time.  Let's get a little shirts versus skins out there or something.  It's going to be warm.  But if the thing works as it should,  we could have a good game out there, a little hockey.  Let's go, Mark.  Let's do it.  Let's do it.  Jessica Giannola, followed by Jeff Creed.  OK.  I'll just start out with the reasons why not to.  Just because they have to be said, COVID is so bad right now.  I just would, we have to, I know some people don't believe it,  but it is a real concern.  And so that's a factor when you're  thinking of group events.  Another thing is that we have to be careful.  We have a housing crisis.  It's not going to go away.  We're going to keep saying it every opportunity we have.  We have a housing crisis.  It's serious and severe.  Another thing that I think is really, really important  with this kind of project is we have a water crisis, a major one.  We have, like mentioned before, wells going dry all the way  to the coast.  It's been happening the last couple of years.  And it's just been moving, moving, moving.  Our water is disappearing.  Our groundwater is disappearing.  September 28.  The board of supervisors, they have a meeting.  I encourage all citizens to attend that one.  Because our water is about ready to be sold off to one boat, one acre ruling.  So water, we just don't have it right now, the energy putting into it.  Maybe in the future.  Maybe when we have enough rainfall and groundwater replenished.  If the goal, I suggest a compromise.  If the goal is bringing people downtown, there's absolutely nothing wrong with that.  Why don't we think of some other ideas as a community?  Just sitting here.  I'm not sure.  I'm thinking, OK, what if we had like Christmas carols?  If we had music events downtown.  If we had competitions.  We could have decorating cookies or wreaths or ornaments.  Whole dramas, whole plays.  Have booths with DIY kits.  I mean, those are things that are fun.  And those are things you could still have downtown.  You could still generate a revenue.  You can have people participating.  I think people are really wanting to get back to some old school things,  connect with the family with things that maybe they did as kids.  So that's a good thing.  So that's an idea that people can still have downtown involvement,  still make a little bit of money, and then put off some of these other things for the future.  Jeff Creed, followed by David Hellimi.  You know, I often get told I'm too negative.  I kind of see the subject as a case of bad management by the city.  I mean, sure, this was a great idea and it is a great idea, but timing. Timing is a great idea.  everything and why wasn't a flag thrown up and said hey we have this project coming and you know  it doesn't look like it's going to be a good time why you know and that's not necessarily your job  up there as counselors reading your email right it's the job of the management of the city to kind  of point and shoot to hey this could be a pitfall this could be a bad idea you know should we  reassess this and call attention to those issues and i'm not going to harp on the management too  much further on this issue but i think you get my point that this is just another nail in that  coffin of bad management by the city and it's not even the staffers right the staffers are doing  their job they're pushing it up it's a great idea it could could be a money maker but you know we'll  see as far as downtown you know i was listening to these comments and you know some of them are  funny you know downtown's more good than bad you know i don't know where that came from but  uh  it probably was we don't like it to be but i don't see that when i come downtown as a consumer i don't  see that when i come downtown to go to a restaurant you know when i come downtown on a saturday  afternoon i walk by a trash can with trash all over at eight in the morning it's still there at  12 in the morning and the lid's bent over just waiting to catch somebody that nice flat lid's  bent over at nine degrees all sticky and nasty just waiting to catch somebody walk by we go and  have coffee have a little  diner and an ice cream made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made  Good evening, council members and city staff.  I've had my retail business in downtown Chico for over 40 years,  and I invested my first property several years before that 40 years.  I'm on the pivot board, and I've served on the DCBA board for over 20 years.  In short, downtown Chico is a big part of my life, and it's very important to me.  And I can tell you that I agree with the previous speaker in one sense,  that timing is everything.  It is time for this body to give downtown Chico some help.  Having an ice rink in downtown Plaza will be a very positive and welcome news  that will encourage people to come downtown who normally don't.  Additionally,  populating our plaza would also take care of other current problems.  This is something that by all accounts will be self-sufficient.  You heard that our planning sponsors in the wings waiting to underwrite some of the expenses.  And it was budgeted for last June, so I'm not sure what else we can wait for.  I also think having an ice rink in Chico and one in Paradise,  actually the synergy between the two can bring new focus to ice skating,  and may even turn out to have tournaments and championships where it could benefit both markets.  In any case, I respectfully state that this is Chico City Council,  and it's duty-bound to do what's right for Chico.  And in this case, we are not in a position to do anything new.  We are in a place for downtown, which is the heart and soul of the city.  And I can tell you that having an ice rink here before the Christmas season will be a positive boost.  Much needed. Thank you.  Our last speaker is Mike Trollander.  Hello Council and staff. I'm Mike Trollander.  I went back to my emails from 2006, because I knew that we were going to have a lot of events.  And we, as community members, approached Greg Jones, city manager, about this idea.  So your plaza was reinvented and turned out in November 2006,  and we sat down with Greg Jones in December 2006, community members, not downtown members only,  community members, to pitch this idea of an ice rink.  We have been pushing this along for year after year after year.  New staff comes. They think it's their idea.  New council members come. They think it's their idea.  Somebody pushed this idea before me. I know I picked it up from somebody else.  This community has been asking for this for a long time.  This isn't a downtown issue. This is a community issue.  Help us keep our community together. Help us be what we need to be.  Let's not ship our people off to San Francisco, to other places.  Let's not send them to cities and their cars and all over the place.  Let's do it here.  This is the culture we're trying to create for our children and for our families.  So please, take a minute.  And there's room for the homeless and the skating rink.  There's room for everybody in this town.  So please, let's do what it takes to do something for us.  So that's my comments. Thank you.  All right. Any council comments?  I've got just two, maybe.  Bob, I appreciate you got my question answered from last time.  Originally, I probably would have asked to move this.  I do have a question for the city attorney in a minute.  The money spent, as far as...  There was one comment from someone that I respect but don't always agree with  about the whole point of this was to move the homeless out of City Plaza.  And I think Mr. Trollander, who is someone else I generally respect and don't always agree with,  pointed out this has been coming up for years and years and years and years.  So the idea that this was brought up to move the city, the homeless, out of the plazas,  as far as...  And Mr. Brady spoke well of the idea of the sales tax and generating more money.  Whatever site or whatever ends up happening that lifts this injunction  that we create somewhere for the homeless to go is going to cost money.  So economic development is necessary.  There's only so many things we can do.  So for those reasons, I am likely to support this this year.  I'm a little nervous about how it turns out.  And my question for the city attorney is,  to what extent...  I see they've got $30,000 in security listed as an expense.  To what extent does whoever's operating the ice rink have the right to enforce security in City Plaza?  Because I sincerely doubt Chico PD is going to do it  for some of the same reasons that I will be talking less in the future.  Thank you, Council Member Morgan.  That analysis of where the enforcement were to occur  would have to be undertaken in light of the injunction  and of course in light of the Martin case,  if we're talking about persons who are unsheltered.  Now, walkways, public ways where people need to have sidewalks clear  to gain access to the facility, things like that,  can be enforced and policed, if you will,  consistent with Martin and also consistent with the preliminary injunction.  As you saw recently, Public Works did a cleanup of the plaza.  That's an example of what I just talked about.  The city still maintains the right to do facilities work and clean up  and to clear its public ways.  However, there's a balancing analysis that must occur  with every proposed clearing and enforcement effort.  But generally speaking, public ways, right of ways, sidewalks, and so forth  can be cleared, but we do have to keep the preliminary injunction in mind  and also the Martin case.  All right, other Council comments?  Council Member O'Brien.  So, when I was considering what the challenging issues  this Council may end up tackling, I got to tell you,  a nice rink was not enough.  It's not one of them.  On one hand, I understand the downtown's need for some wins,  a community that needs some wins.  I get that.  On the other hand, for me,  having a community in close proximity to Paradise  with a really similar project, obviously,  that was a tough one for me because they were nearly burnt to the ground.  And so I am sensitive to that.  I know people in this room, including myself,  I've supported them in unprecedented ways.  But ultimately, while I would have preferred a different project,  I think that would have been the way to go.  This is where we're at.  We're obligated 100 grand at this point.  And our downtown and our community needs some wins.  And I got to tell you, the one person that swayed me,  the one individual that swayed me was 85-year-old Carol Bingman.  If she is willing to get out on ice skates at 85,  far be it for me to withhold that from her and her downtown.  So I'm going to support this.  All right. Anyone else?  I just want to make a quick comment that I was reading through all my notes  of what I had prewritten on how I was not going to support this  when I got here today,  just because I was worried about everything that we were under right now  and that it was insensitive to certain needs maybe or this, that, and the other.  But I have been absolutely turned around by what I've heard tonight.  So for all of you that come down here today,  I'm going to come down here and say council never listens to anything.  I could read you all my notes, but I'm not going to bore you with it.  But the one thing I will say is I'm so excited about how many people  want to support Paradise,  and I hope that they will all be back here when we talk about doing the sewer project,  which is going to be even more amazing for supporting Paradise in re-going.  So with that, I look forward to voting for an ice skating rink for downtown Chico.  All right. Other comments?  I'll make the comment.  So I think it's kind of a no-brainer to not lose 100 grand  and instead break even and do something good for our community.  So with that, I'll make a motion to approve.  Second.  Second from Councilmember Tandon.  Madam Clerk.  I'm sorry.  Can't keep up with my computer.  I apologize.  Councilmember Bennett.  This is a motion.  This has been a difficult decision,  and some very, very good points have been presented to us by the public,  and especially from Councilmember O'Brien with his comments.  I feel an obligation to support the people of Chico,  an obligation to support the downtown business community,  so I am going to vote yes.  Okay. Thank you.  Councilmember Brown.  Lots of ways to support downtown Chico,  and I'm incredibly open to them and also pleased with the enthusiasm,  but this is certainly bad for our neighbors up the hill  and a little bit environmentally tone deaf, so no.  Councilmember Morgan.  Yes.  Councilmember O'Brien.  Yes.  Councilmember Tandon.  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds.  Aye.  Mayor Coolidge.  Aye.  Carries 6-1.  All right.  And we will move on to,  item 5.2,  the appointment process for the Climate Action Commission.  And I believe we're going to turn that over to you,  Clerk Presson.  Okay. Thank you.  And I'll try not to adjust all the computers while I'm doing this.  Ms. Presson.  Yes.  Before you start your report,  can I just say I would like to withdraw my nomination  before you get that far?  Okay.  Thank you.  All right.  So at this meeting,  you're being asked, Council,  to finish up the 2020 biennial recruitment  by making appointments to the Climate Action Commission.  It is the last of our six advisory bodies  that we had to delay the appointment processes.  And so what you have before you are four open positions.  Now those run concurrently with the new Councilmember positions.  And with our policy as outlined in AP and P-10-1,  the incoming Councilmembers,  which occurred in the 2020 election,  and then with our appointments in July and August,  because of the seven-member membership makeup of this commission,  each of the incoming, the four Councilmembers,  get to select an appointee.  It has to be confirmed by the full body.  We also have one additional committee member,  which is the Councilmember for the Climate Action Commission,  who is currently on vacancy,  and that has a term remaining on it of two years.  So at this time,  I didn't receive all the nomination forms,  and this was very different from past processes  only because of the timing.  So I apologize for any confusion on that.  But the Council does have the recruitment ballot  slash nomination form in front of you.  If you could mark off the individual selected  by Councilmember Morgan on your form.  And I guess maybe the Council could have a conversation  about what you want to do,  because we have four individual appointments  confirmed by the full body,  and then we have one position that requires a balloting process  and is appointed by the full body.  So I'll turn it back over to the Council for any questions  and how to do that.  And I guess that's how you want to proceed  now that we,  I think we only have one nominee at this point.  So I'll turn it back over to you.  All right.  Thank you.  And should we just,  do we have public speakers on this side?  Actually, I think we have one.  Okay.  Patrick Newman.  Why don't we do that?  Okay.  And that will be three minutes.  Okay.  Thank you.  So, spend a few hundred hours with people on the plaza,  get to know them,  and then tell me it's a fraud  when you see the impacts of things like this.  I understand, I understand.  But I don't intend to break a rule here,  so it's okay.  I did break a rule.  I know.  I'm happy about this newspaper article about you  and the faculty meeting.  Cool.  I am going to.  I am going to.  Okay.  Thank you.  So, as to this commission,  I think it should be disbanded, frankly.  And the reason why is because it's environmental ritualism.  First of all, I don't believe that this council  takes climate change seriously.  And so we're talking about four years  of not taking it seriously, at least.  Probably six.  So what do we have this environmental ritual going on for,  other than a place or a kind of statement  that people can make as they interact  and interact with each other?  I think it's important to talk about climate change  and the ways we might nuance our city's policies around it.  It's nonsensical.  When I think about people that I've known  on the climate commission,  and I think about the tough issues,  I've never seen any of them have the courage  to come in here and say anything about it.  Something like airport expansion,  which is obviously environmentally problematic.  If you go through the numbers and just look at the way  we can transport people from Chico to the nearest airport  for flights they don't need to take,  the least environmentally sane way to do that  is to have a hub here.  And I'm happy to go through those numbers  with anybody who wants to do that.  So time and time again, there's tough things about,  I mean, we've got, we as individuals in the United States,  per capita,  we've got to use five earths.  You can look this up.  The resources that we're extracting from the environment  and the impact that we're having  are taking five earths.  If everybody in the world lived like we do,  it wouldn't be sustainable for more than, you know, a few years.  This means that in order to get anywhere near  a sustainable level in terms of the way we live,  we'd have to reduce our impacts and our consumption by 80%.  The only thing I've ever seen that made that kind of dent  is COVID, when everybody stopped flying.  So we're not going to have an honest conversation about this.  We're not going to have an honest conversation  about what we need to do to really change the way we live in Chico.  On all the levels, we need to change it.  So what's the point of this thing?  It's kind of like it's there, so it keeps getting perpetuated,  but I don't see anything honest coming out of it.  Thank you.  Thank you.  So I guess I would just ask the count,  you know, what are your thoughts on this commission?  And we have held over the membership.  So the AP&P 10 indicates that commissioners  or board members serve until they're replaced.  And so you've got some people who have been on there for quite some time,  several of them who reapplied,  and so they're still interested in serving.  But you do have a vacancy.  It's a 6-0 commission right now.  And, you know, we, back in June,  I believe we had the airport commission summary  as well as the climate action summary  and overview of ARHPB and the rules and responsibilities.  And so I think I guess I would ask,  because I think it will help me clarify  what kind of a ballot I place before you right now.  Sure.  All right.  Council comments?  I do.  Can I have a question for staff?  I don't know who this is to.  So, Mr. Newman, I will listen to your comments  and ask what would it look like to disband?  And what other items, what other things do we do?  I know that we have, I think,  a sustainability aspect in our general plan,  a sustainability access in many other plans.  This is not the only place where we talk about sustainability.  So can somebody address how else we can do that?  Absolutely.  I'll have Mr. Director Veague speak to that.  So, yes, sustainability is,  capital S, sustainability is all throughout our general plan, of course.  The Climate Action Commission's focus is on reducing greenhouse gas emissions  and adaptation and resiliency to climate change.  That's their focus.  It's not all things sustainable.  It's very narrowly focused.  They were a commission created by the council.  They were a commission created by the council.  They were initially to help prepare and adopt a climate action plan,  and they've made a recommendation on an update  that will be coming to council soon.  And then to further monitor, implement, measure the success,  and they're there to give guidance and direction,  not direction, guidance and recommendations to the council  on issues, again, very narrowly focused on greenhouse gas emission reductions  and then climate change.  adaptation, and resilience.  And there are things coming our way.  This isn't something, of course, created here locally, right?  This is a global issue, but also a state-directed.  There are requirements.  Our goals are to be in line with the state's goals.  And then the Climate Action Plan, in fact, becomes an important tool,  an economic development tool, in that we can tear off of it,  and it supports allowing projects to move forward,  and we can make them non-residential.  And then there's also edicts coming down to make updates and amendments  to our general plan and our safety element to address climate change  and to be giving ourselves guidance on things that will make us more adaptive  and resilient to climate change.  They were also, their goal is to focus on those types of issues as well.  I just had a follow-up to that, so to keep you on hot seat here, Director B.  Um.  So.  So.  No pun intended.  How many, so do all cities have a Climate Action Commission, or is it rare?  What's your, because I haven't researched this, I don't really know.  No, it's not a requirement at all.  There are a number of communities that do.  I would say, you know, north of Sacramento, there probably aren't a lot,  but Chico has a lot of things north of Sacramento that a lot of communities don't.  But they're the kind of, either a group in an ad hoc form like our sustainability task force used to be,  or a formal commission that's found in a number of communities throughout California.  So, and you said that they're presenting the Climate Action Plan soon, right?  And they've done extensive work on that from what I've understood.  They've made a recommendation at their last meeting to adopt the Climate Action Plan update,  as it's currently proposed, as well as to adopt a negative declaration per CEQA,  and that will come to Council.  Okay.  And then how often do we, or have they presented that, or how often do we update it,  or how often does that occur?  There's a direction in the CAP update, you know, to kind of do a re-measure success  and determine whether or not any significant changes need to be made, like, within the next five years.  But there's also the goal and efforts of implementing the Climate Action Plan.  To our credit, a lot of the changes that we've made,  a lot of the, a lot of heavy-hitting actions are already taking place by the City.  You've got departments that are leading Eric's shop with public works,  things they're doing with the PG&E turnkey program,  the effort with the County on the Community Choice Aggregation.  There's a lot of big-ticket items that are already underway.  But there are a lot of other aspects that can be pursued.  Education, outreach are always opportunities for the Commission as well.  Okay.  All right.  Other questions?  So, I'll ask a follow-up to my question then.  So, if it was just a temporary commission, like, that we had operate every,  I mean, I know I've seen agendas with them that, you know, has been canceled out now and then.  You know, that happens with a lot of our commissions.  But what, how often would we need that commission if we were to?  It's interesting.  So, the City has had, in some form or another,  for the last 15-plus years, a sustainability task force initially.  They kind of did things that were capital-S sustainable,  just things that plastic bag bans, things like that as well.  Then that ad hoc committee kind of dissipated,  and then it was resurrected with more of a focus on greenhouse gas emissions.  Those were ad hoc committees to the Council.  And it was only in the last two years that the Climate Action Commission became a standing commission  with the same kind of authority.  And within the code, like the Planning Commission, Architectural Review Board,  Airport Commission, things like that.  So, previously, they were meeting about nine times a year  when I was staffed to them as an ad hoc committee, a sustainability task force.  They are now currently meeting once a month.  So, that's somewhere between nine times and 12 times a month.  A year.  Is what they've been meeting over the last 10-plus years.  All right. Thank you.  Council comment or direction?  So, it sounds to me like if we turned this into a committee  that needed to meet our certain goals as a city,  we could potentially save some staff time,  and then maybe recruitment might actually have a little bit more interest,  because it sounds like obviously we're having a hard time with recruitment on this committee.  So, that would be a staff savings time, obviously, if we went from nine meetings to 12,  and we may not even need the full nine.  It would depend on how often you wanted the committee to meet  or if the committee would just, the ad hoc would meet when needed,  when staff felt that there was an item coming before you.  I staffed the first sustainability task force that had 15 members or 16 members years ago.  And, again, it evolved.  And, you know, as the needs change for the city,  you as a council get to decide where you want your resources to go.  So, but we would definitely, if you, we wouldn't have to do a recruitment,  because if it was an ad hoc, then the council could make a selection and appoint.  So, there would be those costs that would be saved in terms of a recruitment.  I'm not sure if Director Vig knows, are those meetings televised?  No, the meetings are recorded.  Recorded.  Okay, so there's a cost there for those meetings.  We're not doing any meetings to bring in our videographer to come in and take the,  but apparently they're not being televised.  Well, currently we're recording them on Zoom.  Oh, okay.  So, your meetings are still Zoom?  Yes, we're doing them virtually in the name of sustainability.  So, it's just whatever the council feels it would like to do.  All right, further comment?  I appreciate what Master Chief just said, and to get this going,  I will make a motion that we make that committee, an ad hoc committee,  reporting to staff when staff thinks they need to hear from them.  And if that's once a month, that's fine.  And if it's once every 12 months, that's fine.  All right, we have a motion.  Do we have a second?  Seconding.  I have a request.  I think nobody came into this particular agenda item thinking that the Climate Action Commission  was going to be disbanded.  My request is that if that's the intention of council,  to change the official commission status of this group,  then we should have it on a future agenda so that the public has time to participate.  So, in order to disband it, it will require an ordinance to remove it from the agenda.  And that's what we're doing.  And the Chico Municipal Code.  And so there would be two hearings on that where the public could weigh in on that.  Just to let you know that that's, they were created by ordinance,  they would have to be disbanded the same way.  Just to be clear, my motion didn't call for disbanding.  Well, to take it from a formal commission to an ad hoc, you would have to disband it.  Oh, you do?  Well, then I guess I did.  That's what that is.  Thanks.  All right.  We have a motion and a second.  Madam Clerk?  Council Member Bennett?  Continue.  Yes.  So, it's yes to Council Member Morgan's motion to disband?  Is that?  No.  So, technically the motion is to disband and bring back as an ad hoc.  As an ad hoc.  Correct.  So, it's important we understand what the motion says.  No.  Okay.  Council Member Brown?  Shouldn't be surprised, but I am, and no.  Council Member Morgan?  Yes.  Council Member O'Brien?  Yes.  Council Member Tandon?  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds?  Aye.  Mayor Coolidge?  Aye.  Carries 5-2.  All right.  With that, we're going to take a 10-minute break.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  You're good.  Okay, item 5.3, potential revenue measure.  Mr. Mark Horne.  Yes, honorable mayor, members of the city council, vice mayor, thank you very much.  The recommendation before you tonight is to authorize the preparation of documents  needed to allow for a 1% general sales tax to be added  to the city's revenue measure.  to the 2022 general election.  By authorizing this work, staff will take the time necessary to work with the city attorney  and his office to bring back the authorizing resolution and attachments thereto,  collaborate with the city clerk's office to determine the specific costs  associated with placing the measure on the ballot, and evaluate  any costs associated with educating the public on the measure.  This topic can be very politically polarizing.  When I look at the facts, though,  as I understand them, and reflect upon the anger that is regularly voiced by citizens related to their desire for higher levels of service and improved public properties, it's staff's responsibility to bring an honest and legally viable solution to the council for consideration.  Two key points as to why this is a feasible consideration.  First point, the demands on current city resources are extraordinary.  And for a full-service city the size of Chico to be as much a concern as the rest of the city is, is a huge risk.  proactive as both citizens and the city council desire it to be, an additional and reliable  revenue stream is necessary. Point number two, the city has made a concerted effort to right the  financial ship and has proven that it can live within its financial means. A historic reminder  to bolster this second point, I distinctly recall back in 2016, and I know many of you do as well,  when the California State Auditor identified one of six cities in the state of California, Chico  being one of those six, to be placed on a watch list and audited. State Auditor deemed Chico, along  with others, financially at-risk cities. By the time the State Auditor had flagged Chico, this new  city manager and a new executive team had been assembled already moving forward with fixing the  foundational financial problems that had brought the city to the brink of bankruptcy. From being  one of those,  top six cities, to annually racing towards being financially stable and responsible, the city has  jumped all the way back from that top six identified to number 175 last year, and I anticipate we'll  even further back, and being back is a good thing in this area, in the state. An amazing resolve,  an amazing turnaround, and staff is very proud. A simple reality is that the state of California,  in its  made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made made  go directly to those public safety departments. And it's not just that, but Chico has found that  there is an enormous yearning to ensure public infrastructure, our roadways, our bridges, our  parks, are rightfully maintained and enhanced, as the city cannot solely rely upon the development  sector to cover the costs of all of our new roadway improvements. Chico is the largest city  north of Sacramento. Chico is the 60th largest city in the state of California. There's 482  cities in the state of California. We're the 60th largest. But the city is attempting to remain  small, as many other cities have reinvested in their community to keep up with the growing demands.  The increasing societal pressures, we see many of them as unfunded mandates from the state of  California, and particularly in Chico's case, population growth.  Once a city's population hits a certain point, there's no going back. Looking at cities with the  population range of Chico, the majority have an add-on sales tax. The tax is usually somewhere  between a quarter and one and a half percent. When you get into some areas of the state,  tax rates get even higher. In all, the state has jurisdictions with at least 25 different sales tax  rates. Locally, some folks like to tell me, and I hear it all the time, but our local cities in  Butte County are the most taxed. And that's because of the tax rates. And that's because of the  tax rates. And that's because of the tax rates. And that's because of the tax rates. And that's because  they're doing just fine. They might be, and lo and behold, Oroville does have an add-on sales tax.  Paradise does have an add-on sales tax. Oroville's is a percent, Paradise a half a percent.  And then there's a lot of people in the community that say, Chico is such a wonderful university  town, but man, I wish we were more like Davis, or more like San Luis Obispo. Well, why can't we be  more like them, is what I usually hear. Davis has a one percent add-on sales tax,  and San Luis Obispo, one and a half percent add-on sales tax. And the far north state region,  Anderson, Dunsmuir, Mount Shasta, Wairika, they all have add-on sales taxes, so it's not foreign  to the far north state. As you may recall, staff previously brought this item forward to the prior  city council, but we didn't garner the five votes necessary to move forward to the ballot in 2020.  This time, I believe there is even more of a need to genuinely consider authorizing this effort,  as I know the needs are getting more and more dire. From losing qualified staff regularly to  continually being berated for not being as proactive on essential city services, 2022  may be the right year to deliver on this staff request. Also, let me be clear, this is not the  city council voting in favor of a sales tax. This is the city council allowing the Chico citizens  to vote if they're going to vote for a sales tax. So, I'm not going to be a  party leader in favor of a sales tax. There's a big difference there. Bottom line, a one percent  general sales tax would generate approximately 24 to 27 million dollars a year. Proceeds would  be utilized for overall city services. That would include police, that would include fire, and parks,  and streets, and all of those things that we do to serve the community. Final approval of this tax  would require an affirmative vote of a majority of the voters. And this is my favorite part of the  bill, and this is one of the things why it excites me beyond measure. All of those added sales tax  dollars go right back to the city. It doesn't go to the state of California, doesn't go to the county,  doesn't go to anybody else, the university, the school district. It goes directly to the city so  that they can reinvest it into the community. My ultimate goal as city manager is to enable city  departments to deliver excellent proactive services that will enhance this city's quality of life  and its citizens.  As directed by this esteemed body before me, although it should be said that this tax,  should the council place it on the ballot, and should the population vote in favor of it,  is not a panacea. It's not going to fix everything. There's still going to be debates over where these  funds should go. But as you can see in the staff report, I've listed in there kind of a 10-year  span of citywide resource needs as prognosticated by the department directors, and it will not be  fully covered by this 1% sales tax. However, staff believes that the city's
