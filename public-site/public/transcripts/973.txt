 Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right.  We're going to start with proclamation.  And do we have someone here?  Or is it going to be on Zoom for our first one?  Zoom.  On Zoom?  Good afternoon, Alexa.  Can you hear us?  Can you hear us okay?  Hi.  I think we can hear you.  Can she hear us?  If you can hear us, give us a thumbs up.  That's a no.  We can hear you,  but she can't hear us, I think.  So, Stina, you have mute over here.  I don't know if that's part of it.  Oh. Okay, so try that now.  We'll do that now.  Can you hear us now?  Give us a thumbs up if you can.  All right.  There we go.  So, you can bring your son in for the...  All right.  Good.  Good.  Well, welcome.  Thanks for being here on behalf of Aaron Rodgers.  Obviously, this would be better in the form of a question  because he did such a great job hosting Jeopardy  a couple of weeks ago.  So, but I'll read this out,  and then please extend our many thanks to him as well.  So, whereas Aaron Rodgers grew up in Chico,  attended Pleasant Valley High School,  and after graduation played football at Butte College,  transferring to Cal Berkeley,  where he finished his stellar collegiate career  before being drafted in the first round of the 2005 NFL draft,  and whereas Aaron Rodgers' proven focus, determination,  and hard work have allowed his talents to be witnessed  at the highest levels of athletics,  amassing 4,285 completions,  51,245 yards passing,  and 412 touchdowns and counting,  resulting in being voted three-time and current NFL MVP.  And whereas Aaron Rodgers has been a significant contributor  to the various projects and relief efforts in our community  and continues to give back to our community  and support our local citizens and business owners,  and whereas Aaron Rodgers'  generosity has been a significant contribution  and whereas 80 locally-owned small businesses in Butte County  have received financial assistance  from the Aaron Rodgers Small Business COVID-19 Fund  at the North Valley Community Foundation,  and whereas Aaron Rodgers not only makes large donations to the fund,  his guest hosting of the game show Jeopardy!  resulted in an additional donation of $236,725  to the Small Business Fund, and whereas Aaron Rodgers' generosity  has been evident in his continuous support of Chico,  the Chico community with athletic donations,  his role as a founding partner in the Butte Strong Fund,  significant donations to Campfire Relief and Recovery Fund,  and various other recovery efforts.  Now therefore, be it resolved on behalf of the City Council  that we hereby recognize and express our gratitude  to Aaron Rodgers for his support and generosity  that he continues to show for the Chico community.  The City of Chico,  recognizes and values his ongoing commitment  to supporting and improving the quality of life in Chico  and the surrounding communities.  Aaron Rodgers will always hold MVP status  with the City of Chico as his kind-heartedness  and weighty contributions have made immense impacts  within our community.  And please extend our thanks to him wholeheartedly.  I just wanted to share  with you today,  he is our Chief Chiefys Chiefys  Thank you so much for being here today.  Of course.  All right.  All right, thank you, Alexa.  Okay, and the NorCal Cyber Mayor's Cup,  that will actually be presented,  we have a proclamation for them,  but we'll be presenting that at the June 1st meeting.  So, and a note about public participation,  we do have business from the floor,  but that will come at our six o'clock meeting.  So if you're here for business of the floor,  you'll be waiting a long time through a budget hearing.  So if you want to come for that,  you can come back at six o'clock.  So public participation,  this meeting is being conducted in accordance  with executive order N-29-20,  public participation and attendance at the meeting.  Masks are required.  Citizens will be allowed to attend the meeting in person  with attendance.  Limited to 50% capacity and designated seating.  Face masks are required in order to attend the meeting  and address the council and the council chamber.  For those not wishing to wear a mask,  a podium will be set up outside.  Audio will be available for those choosing not to sit  within the council chamber.  Anyone wishing to address the council on any item  on the agenda should complete a speaker card  that can be found at the back of the room  and turned into the city clerk.  Public participation prior to the meeting,  the Engage Chico Civic Engagement Program  was available for citizen input  on the individual agenda items prior to the meeting.  Engage Chico commenting closed at 11 a.m.  because we started at one o'clock today  instead of our regular 4.30, I believe it is.  Remote public participation during the meeting.  The public may view the meeting on Comcast Channel 11  or streaming video found on the city's website.  And we will start with item 1.7, budget presentations.  Turn over to our esteemed city manager.  Yes, I'm the city manager.  Honorable Mayor, members of the council,  thank you very much.  I will say that it's a little awkward  presenting a budget with a mask on  simply for the fact that the visuals,  the optics don't look very good.  It seems like we're hiding something.  And if anything, this city has been stellar  at the transparency, the level of commitment  to ensuring that all of the information  that is available remains available.  And I hope you could all hear me.  So I know the city clerk was just making sure  that it was working correctly.  As you'll find, we are going to have a theme for this year.  And so you may all remember it.  Well, some of you may remember this.  Looks good in this one.  Roger.  BCS arm switches on.  OK, is it good?  Landing rocker arm switches on.  Here comes the throttle.  Second breaker's in.  We have separation.  Inboard now.  Boards are on.  Coming forward with the side stick.  Looks good.  Roger.  I've got a blowout.  Number three.  Pitcher pitch to zero.  Pitch is out again.  Hold out for two.  Direction out.  Soft trip selected.  Emergency.  Flight comment.  She's holding.  She's breaking up.  She's breaking up.  Steve Austin, astronaut.  A man barely alive.  Gentlemen, we can rebuild him.  We have the technology.  We have the capability to make the world's first bionic.  Man.  He.  Steve Austin will be that man.  Better than he was before.  Better.  Stronger.  Faster.  That's going back to my childhood.  Tammy has no idea what that is.  Right, right.  So I think we've got a few that will remember that,  others that may not.  But we are entitling this the $8 million man,  and I'll explain a little more later as to why we're doing that.  But I really believe it's a wonderful visual as it  relates to what you're doing as a city council.  You are rebuilding this city.  And it's taking a little bit more time than you're doing.  years to get where we are now it's going to take time to get us to where you want it to be as well  so with that what you're going to find is that through this presentation you will have each  portion of the rebuild of this organization visualized through this sculpture and i really  want to commend and scott may commend them but some of our i.t staff that donated their time  actually a spouse of one of our i.t staff to actually put this graphic together which is just  fantastic you see the varying parts and yes you are designated in here as well the city council's  the brain you're the one who makes the decisions who are thoughtful in making policy decisions  on where we're heading so it's important that i acknowledge that in addition the city clerk  is the mouth now somebody could probably take that the wrong way but she listens and hears and takes  in all the information that's given through vocal through through typing and she has to be the mouth  of the city council and she's a very responsible person she's a very responsible person she's a very  of the city to share what actually occurred  at each meeting.  She keeps the public record, so we are grateful for her.  And the city attorney is the chest plate, the chest area.  He is there to help protect the city  from any legal issues that may arise.  And so he's represented as well.  But what you're gonna find is that we're gonna focus  on the operational departments.  And the city manager in my position deemed the hands,  because we have to touch every aspect of the organization  to put the pieces into place to achieve your policy  directive as a city council.  And so my goal is to make sure that whatever those budget  desires that you have are adequately placed  so that we can achieve a high level of success.  So with that, I'm gonna share a little bit about,  and for those council members that have been on here,  they're used to my opening budget speeches,  so bear with me.  Recently, the media reported the top seven issues  that divide our society.  Climate change, environmental protections,  guns, military, immigration, education,  and healthcare costs.  Add to these divisive issues the dramatic upheaval  in numerous metropolitan cities,  and it's easy to add race and ethnicity  to this entire paradigm of issues  where there is significant consternation.  These issues finally come to the table, and I think it's  And I think it's important to remind our way  into local politics,  which tend to bring those extreme divisions  to a municipal level,  which is not a surprise,  but can often enable a locally elected body  to lose focus on issues that they have true legislative  authority over and can effectively change.  Candidly, when city staff receive phone calls from citizens,  they simply want to keep the sewer flowing  in the right direction.  They desire accountability in the rest of criminals in our  community.  They want staff to fill the pothole  that stands between them and their destination.  They want to have a clean and safe park to enjoy.  They want a ready and well-trained team  to extinguish fires, rescue those in need,  and be prepared for the next emergency.  And they want to know that as growth continues,  public infrastructure can support such growth,  and that the current infrastructure  is not only properly built, but properly maintained.  Oh, and there's also a true desire that those who are  employed within that local agency be honest,  trustworthy, responsive, and financially astute.  Yes, the citizenry have high expectations,  and why shouldn't they?  With the right focus and resources,  we can achieve a high level of success  on all of those fronts.  It's my impression that this city council desires  to get back to the basics,  reflecting the numerous calls staff received  from our residents.  To make this community shine brightly and bring back a level  of pride that is healthy and desired  by those who call Chico home.  Rather than being polarized by national politics,  which often creates an uncivil environment,  Chico needs to lead the North State in reestablishing  the quality of life that is at the heart and the soul  of this incredible community.  My role as city manager, along with my staff,  we have an ethical and necessary part to play  to bring forward an annual budget that reflects  recommendations,  to implement what I believe to be the city council's vision.  What staff is here to do is to stand behind the will  of the council, regardless of political leanings,  to ethically and legally implement those policy objectives.  Staff has and needs to stay in our lane,  not pretending that we are the policy makers.  So we will be pressing forward with a planning effort,  which will help inform and guide staff and the community  on the critical path forward as envisioned by this city council.  You'll hear more about that from Deputy City Manager McCarthy  later on today.  In the meantime, you will be able to hear and give feedback  to the draft budget that staff believe reflects the next steps  in fulfilling your vision as we understand it to be.  With the ever mounting reality that public organizations  face growing financial constraints  and increase public scrutiny,  it's important to reflect upon a brief recent history  to establish why the theme,  the $8 million man is being used this year.  In a nutshell, the city faced insolvency.  We took extraordinary measures to slash budgetary expenditures  and reduce the number of city employees to course correct.  Put in place necessary budget policies  and fixed a dire deficit situation swiftly,  at least in terms of a government timeline.  And rebuilt reserves to boot.  And now we are truly in the midst of rebuilding this city.  So take a moment, just a moment,  to enjoy the fruits of that intense labor,  which was born over the past number of years,  even through numerous devastating calamities  that occurred around us.  But to realize that the burden is now placed  on this city council,  as the labor market has outpaced our agency  and time has created the reality  that many basic elements of service provision  to the community have been put on hold  while the financial puzzle  was foundationally put back together again.  The community has suffered,  due to the lack of resources being deployed.  The employees have sacrificed,  no cost of living increases for most of the city employees  for a decade plus.  And city councils, candidly, have taken a beating  because of the constraints on resource availability.  Bottom line is that a city of our size  typically has additional funding coming in through a tax.  That's just the reality in the state of California.  To enhance service delivery,  but the city has had to show its willingness  to make the difficult cuts and rebuild its foundation,  responsibly before, I believe,  this community would even want to consider  a local tax initiative.  So here we are today,  where you will hear from operating departments  with professional and very hardworking staff.  They're leaders within this community  who will shepherd us, this city council, this city,  into the better days ahead in the city of Chico.  It's my hope that this effort will create a calm environment  to enable understanding, conversation,  and transparency concerning  the path to getting this community  to where the city council believes it needs to be.  Our goal is to continue the momentum  toward making this city better, stronger, faster,  but in city terms, safer, cleaner, and more responsive.  With that, let me introduce someone  that I greatly respect, trust, and admire,  and I'm gonna have Administrative Services Director Dow  take it from here.  Scott?  Oh, I could have showed you.  I'm the Director of the General Fund Change and Fund Balance,  so it's an incredible leap.  So with that, Scott, take it away.  All right, thank you, sir.  What a fantastic opening speech.  I thought that was great and pictured everything,  put in a good perspective for us.  So for those of you that don't remember  the $6 million man, I do.  I grew up with that.  I thought he was the coolest thing on TV.  I mean, able to run super fast,  and able to go and do superhuman things.  And so I'm the Administrative Services Director, so,  I'm the Administrative Services Director, so, I'm the Administrative Services Director, so,  I'm the I here.  Not me personally, but our department is the I.  So what happens with the I now?  Bear with me, here's another sound effect from the TV show  that every time you watch the TV show  and he was spying, doing his super I stuff,  I just thought that was cool.  So anyway, that's what I grew up with,  and so whenever you think about ASD now,  you can think of the I going,  with that sound effect.  So as we go through this,  my portion is a little bit longer  than some of the other directors,  because I'm going to try to give you an overall insight  of what the city's looking like right now,  where we're headed from a financial standpoint,  and kind of lay the table for everyone else  that's going to speak here today.  So each of the departments is going to kind of share with you  their mission statement, and we'll kind of go through it,  and kind of go forward with that as our starting point  for each of the departments going forward.  As we do for our portion from the ASD department,  I'm going to give you an introduction.  I'm going to talk about budget policies.  Now, in the past, we haven't really spent a whole lot of time  talking about budget policies,  but there'll be some give and take,  some interaction that I'll be looking forward  from getting your perspective  on some current budget processes and policies that are there,  that I would like to,  that I would like to see your direction on.  So with that, a little later on after me,  Amanda McCarr is going to share something,  and the people here that are going to be sharing  are instrumental to our budget team.  They have just done a fantastic job,  and Amanda will share here in a few moments.  She just kind of took her job as an accounting technician  to the next level by doing something  that the city has never done before.  So we'll share with that.  Keep you on the edge of your chairs for that.  Then Barbara Martin will come up and talk about our,  our five year projection in city debt.  Catherine Mathis, our accounting manager,  will come and talk about revenues.  Ben Ayn will come back again.  Yay.  Everyone needs some caffeine or something.  Yeah.  Woo, woo, woo.  I did one of these things earlier today,  and the staff, I was going, woo, woo, woo.  And staff heard it and said, what are you doing?  I go, don't you remember Arsenio Hall?  And probably some of you are like, huh?  Anyway, he used to do this, read the crowd up.  So I'll, uh, do this.  I'll do my best to maintain a little calmer,  demure personality here.  But I do want to thank all the budget team that's here.  Casey Chappo's over there.  His name's not up here, but he was instrumental  in doing some work.  And Barbara Martin, he's here,  our deputy director of finance.  Becky Fairbanks put these binders together.  Did a lot of hard work.  And Catherine Mathis is here, and Amanda is here.  So you get to see their faces here.  And then Casey's here.  And then my sister-in-law put all these graphics together,  which you think, oh, it's just easy to clip art.  It's not.  This was all custom for us, so we appreciate that here  as we go forward.  So I thought it would be fun to read through,  starting on page one today, and kind of go through that  for our new directors.  And no, I'm not seeing any nodding heads going, yes,  please do that.  So I'll summarize some things for you here.  So our budget is, our fiscal year end is from July.  It's not June 1st through June 30th of each year.  It's a fiscal year.  It's not a calendar year.  So as we talk about, as Mark was alluding to,  how we are doing financially, we're  going to talk about revenues and expenses a little bit here  today by some of the other staff members.  But really, when you think about things, more revenue,  you can have expenses.  But you usually want more revenue than expenses. Why?  Because if you're upside down, that causes the problem where  we were at eight years ago.  And then it takes a lot harder work on everyone's part  to kind of flip that back around.  So we're in a position now, we're not out making money,  millions of dollars, just trying to take everything  from everyone.  But we're just trying to really physically plan ahead.  So we do that by conservatively budgeting.  So we try the best that we can to look at the revenues  that we project to come in.  But I tell you, I'm not going to overly estimate.  Why?  Because if I get overly, or when I say I mean our department,  gets overly excited about revenues,  that sometimes doesn't come apart.  For example, last year, we had a very good projection  of sales tax revenue going forward.  What happens, COVID hit.  I was so glad that we didn't overextend ourselves.  Expenses, the same thing.  We have to be conservative on expenses.  So we do budget fully what we expect the expenses to be.  Now, a lot of times, we don't hear  And so we hit that mark.  Okay?  But we have to be thankful and think through that quite a bit.  Cash flows, we're always looking at cash flows.  You've got to have that cash flow there in a positive light.  So in talking where Mark was giving the example,  I wasn't here at the time, but my understanding was,  and I think Mr. Morgan was here, but that December of that year,  the city had about $5 million in cash.  And it was very desperate.  It was like, are we going to be able to meet payroll?  I'm happy to say that here in June,  we're anticipating having $139 million available to us.  Now, again, all these are allocated for certain purposes and stuff.  Again, public watching, we're not just taking money,  just, you know, hand over fist.  We've got projects lined up that you're going to hear about,  those funds you're going to go to.  But it shows how council had to give direction to kind of change things.  So, you know, we're going to have to be careful.  Show our  So, in summary, we're in a good place.  We're not in a great place.  We're in a good place.  We're in a far better place than we were before.  So let's talk about some of those things if we could.  So anything foundational here starts with policies.  And a few years ago there weren't any policies.  And so over time we've developed those in conjunction with council.  So I have to walk through and just give you a disclaimer,  not a disclaimer, but just an informational item.  We're going to talk about budget policies here.  In front of you, what was in your budget binder  was a copy of the budget policies as if all the changes were accepted.  Well, that's hard to sit there and go, hey, here's what we're proposing to change.  So in front of you is another.  Section there.  That's the blue line or red line version.  And I want to go over some of those with you today to highlight those changes.  You're also going to have inside there another one called the investment policy.  Now, this part, this one is key here.  The investment policy in your binder is last year's policy.  The one in front of you is this year's policy.  So sorry for that confusion.  But we want to let you know about that.  That's so that we can incorporate it in the final correctly.  So these are the areas that we're heading down.  Are you excited?  Okay, good.  All right.  So if you've got your binder, page 277 is where we're going to take a look at.  And this is also in your budget policy section here.  Let me get the page here.  It starts BP7.  So that might be the easiest part is the secondary one that is BP7.  And in our binders, this is called guiding principles for budget development.  I call them the 12 commandments just because it's easy for me to remember.  But these are the principles that have been utilized.  By staff to create and construct your budget.  So I think it's very helpful information.  So you can look at two separate places if you want to for this.  So I've got a summary up here on the screen.  So the first one is, we really want to ensure a livable community.  So a balance between public safety infrastructure and quality of life services is required to ensure a livable community.  Now, if you have anything you want to change here,  this is where the interaction starts.  This is where the interaction is going to come in.  If you go, this doesn't make sense, this is where I would appreciate any feedback that you've got.  But I want to make sure that we're on the same page because I think this is really critical.  So that sounds good.  Number two, a budget must be sustainable into the future.  Eight years ago, it was not.  So we want to make sure we're able to be balanced, not with one-time fixes,  such as transfers of reserves or set-asides.  So that's a good policy.  That seems good to me.  I think we would be in agreement with that.  Item three, reducing funding for capital projects or eliminating projects from the capital improvement program  in order to support operating activities, sacrifices, and communities' long-term interest.  So the concept with that, which we started to think about that out loud when COVID hit last year.  And Director Audubon, he was like, whoa, this would not be good.  And it was not.  It was the last thing that we had on our item, on our sheet.  So if we're running out of money, one of the things you don't want to do is start robbing for capital projects,  especially those that are up and running.  So that's part of our policy here.  So next item, continuous investment in technology, systems, and equipment is needed to improve organizational efficiency.  One of the things I remember when I did come here under Mark's leadership was, hey, we need to embrace technology,  because council said we need to embrace technology.  So one of the items that I always think about is a simple example was in our finance department.  If you wanted to get a business license, you had to physically come down to City Hall and fill out the paperwork.  One of the first assignments I was given was, let's figure out how to do this online.  So that's an example, and this is citywide.  We're embracing technology as never before.  You'll hear here in a few moments some of the strides that we've made in some of these areas.  The next item, make sure I'm good.  So which Mark alluded to earlier is reasonable compensation levels.  We want to minimize staff turnover and maintain city productivity.  As we're seeing, and Director Cannon can probably tell you,  and I can probably attest to better than anyone,  is the state of how the certain positions have just been outpaced by other organizations.  We can't keep or retain some staff because our salaries have been diminished in certain ways.  So these are areas that will be brought up and discussed accordingly.  So let's actually, last one, number six on this page here,  is augment city resources and seek out new resources.  So we're looking at additional revenue sources.  So always be on the lookout.  Are there grants available?  Are there other developmental related income that we can search for?  Your city staff is really looking into that all the time.  We're searching for those other options.  Or is there a better way to do things?  Next item, reduce the need for program reductions, maximize cost recovery.  So there are programs that we go out to the community and assess a fee for.  Why?  Because we're trying to make sure that we're cost neutral on that.  So the cost that the city staff have to do is reimbursed and covered by the fee that's associated with it.  Strengthen cities' economic base through development.  I think we agree development is a good thing with proper oversight and everything.  So it's an appropriate thing to be looking at and be cognizant of.  Number nine, services and programs serving limited needs.  The limited number of participants should be reviewed for reductions or referred to the private sector.  Again, looking at those, let me give you an example.  So about two to three years ago, we recognized that there were a lot of short-term rentals, Airbnb-type activity here in the city.  We didn't know how much was out there.  Now, our code allowed for us to tax those individuals because they're taxing.  Now, our advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising advertising  and that's about $140,000 a year.  Now, I would anticipate that to be even higher.  That's a police officer.  Right there, we were looking for something,  trying to be as efficient as possible.  So we applaud being able to do that.  Director Cannon probably doesn't care about this one,  about reducing the risk to the city on anything like that.  Of course, that's paramount important.  So we're always looking at things they're doing  that will avoid lawsuits or anything like that.  Ensure administrative accountability with strong and strong controls.  We talked about having our audit,  having people looking over our shoulders.  For instance, someone comes in at our front counter.  We've got some of our front counter revenue experts here today.  Joey and Mike are here.  And I invited them to come  because they don't get a chance to come and see and interact with you  because they're out helping the public.  But if they just took cash and then put it right in here,  right here, I'm showing them.  That would not be a good thing.  So we have developed controls  associated with that.  Not one person takes everything, does everything.  Multiple people have control there.  We're always thinking along those lines  to have good internal control.  And last but not least is  we have to be looking at our long-term liabilities  versus our current operations.  And this is critical because in the future here,  there's been discussion at the finance committee  about talking about different issuance obligations.  We've talked about pension obligation bonds.  We're talking about issuing bonds for road improvements.  This will be very important.  So you have to be able, if you've got the debt,  you've got to be able to make sure  you're able to make those future payments.  So that's what we're talking about.  So I want to pause.  That's the foundation of how this budget's been prepared.  Is it a yay, thumbs up, or hey, this needs to be scrapped?  Thumbs up.  Thank you, Council Member Huber.  Appreciate it.  Appreciate the thumbs up.  That's good.  I'll take that as a good thing.  Okay.  So I thought that was important.  We usually don't spend the time to do that,  but I thought it was important to lay a foundation.  And for the community, though, we're transparent,  and we're not just shooting off from the side of our hip or anything.  We're really focused in this.  All right.  So I tried to get you to interact with me on that one.  This next one, you're going to have to.  All right.  So drum roll.  And forgive me, I have a little bit.  All right.  I know it's a budget session, so we've got to do something to kind of keep you a little more engaged,  especially about now in the afternoon after a nice lunch.  Okay.  So this is the marked-up version here.  So item D1C.  It's BP-9 on here.  All right.  So it's in blue.  So in the past, at the end of the year,  if we had what we call a surplus,  and a surplus means the revenue exceeded all the related expenses and transfers out,  we would come back and decide,  probably we'd come back and talk with council or the city manager  and kind of talk through some things to decide really how we would,  you know, allocate those.  You can see the crossed-out section is,  boy, I need another prescription of glasses.  Can one of you guys hold this out for me further here so I can read it?  You can see, not anticipate during the fiscal year,  but be primarily dedicated to funding significant long-term liabilities,  replenishing reserve and internal service funds to establish targets.  That is rather generic, but full of power.  What we're proposing to do is to quantify that.  All right.  And we're going to do that in a little stronger wording.  So what we're saying is if there's a surplus, and let's say, for example,  there's a $4 million surplus at the end of the year,  and we don't know that, we usually close our years out probably,  final numbers are about October.  And so here's what we would do.  If there's $4 million under this proposed policy,  we would take 50% of that, or $2 million,  and put it into our Section 115 trust for pensions.  Okay?  Long-term liability, you'll hear about that.  We all know about $146 million.  We would set this aside to pay future benefits, retirement payments on that.  Why is that important?  If, and this is a big if, understand, I'm saying if,  we decide to go down the road to issuing pension obligation bonds,  there will be a process of going and having an outside group,  look over our shoulder and give us a rating, investment rating.  One of the things that they are looking at is saying,  how are you dealing with your pension obligation?  This would be great to show that, hey, if we have excess revenues,  we are putting it to this area.  So the others, there's 25% of this would be allocated to roads.  We all agree that our roads need assistance.  Director Ottoboni really didn't want this in here,  but we kind of talked him into it and said, this is probably a good provision.  You can't see, he's probably smiling under that mask there.  No, I see, he's, yeah, what?  Then the other 25% would be split up to what we have are replacement funds.  There's five different replacement funds.  What's a replacement fund?  Well, you originally buy a piece of equipment,  five years down the road, what do you need to do?  You need to replace it.  So we have funds set aside to do exactly that.  I'm being honest with you, those replacement funds are not adequate to where they're at.  Director Gustafson verifies that because he's dealing with the fleet,  and he's dealing with the maintenance of buildings, and those are two of them.  The others would be there's one for fire, there's one for police equipment,  and then there's one for our IT replacement.  So this is the concept of what we're proposing is this is how those would be allocated.  So at the end of the year,  we would automatically reallocate it based on this.  So in there, we also spend some time telling you how a surplus is calculated.  We're trying to be very specific here so it's not left at the end of the year going,  well, this isn't included, or this is, or this is not.  So that's what that next paragraph is.  It's staying there.  That's the first one.  Everyone okay with that one?  You want me to go to the second one or any questions?  Okay.  Second one, yes, sir.  So Director Dowell, doesn't preallocating out 100% of any surpluses take away some flexibility in case of contingencies?  Well, a contingency, we have our emergency reserves that are fully funded.  So there would be your contingency that you could actually pull funds back.  We could come back if we're in a desperate situation and come back and say,  Council, we're in a desperate situation.  We need to pull funds from the emergency.  So that's one of the reasons why we feel comfortable with this proposal at this time.  Great.  Okay.  D4, removal of emergency fund mandated or mandatory payments.  You may look under the new set, and there's no D4 that talks anything about emergency funds  because we're removing that.  And what happened is under the old section there,  doggone these glasses.  Okay.  D, DP12, we're striking all that out because what we did is we had a plan to get our emergency reserves up to a certain level.  Last year, we were able to bring them all the way up to that level with what we need them to be.  And so this is no longer required.  This is one of those moments where we can go, yay, good job.  We're happy.  And the public, you should be happy that we're at that place.  This is really a milestone for the city, and we should rejoice in that.  It's a good idea.  So we're continuing to follow this emergency guideline here.  In fact, E4-1 and on DP16 and 17.  So what we are doing now is we have two, and this relates to the general fund.  We have an operating reserve,  which is used as a target for those things.  And this kind of alludes to Council Member Huber's question as well,  is having an operating reserve just available should things go awry that we would hit first before we hit emergency reserves is the target of this.  And so this states that 7.5% of general and park operating expenditures would go to the park.  So this is a target.  So then we express and say how the measurement would be.  So the concept with this would be how do you figure out when that 7.5% is?  You would go back to your last closed year.  So the example, June 30, 2020, is where we're targeting for this year.  And that takes 7.5% of those expenditures, and that's what your target would be.  So we're doing that for that item as well as the emergency reserve, which is on the next page, which is at 20%.  So just trying to figure out.  I'm going to pause to make sure because if I'm not here next year or Mark's not here next year, we're not planning to go anywhere.  I'm not planning to go anywhere.  But we have it dedicated here in writing.  And then Section 1.1B, City Council Health Insurance.  I don't know if you have any questions on that, but Mrs. Cannon is here.  I just wanted to let you know, since that affects you directly, it kind of quantifies, I think.  We can look at that if you'd like.  Section 1.1B, it's BP 36 and 37.  There's a long section there.  Jamie, did you want to come up and address that?  Or are there any particular questions on this?  There's going to be.  What's that?  There's going to be.  I'm sure.  Let me have.  Let's see if.  My question is more of a legal question than a budget question.  Because we were told by Human Resources and the prior city attorney that it wasn't legal for the city to be giving health benefits to the city council.  So I'm surprised to see this under a budget item.  So what I was informed by the city attorney's office at that time, Mr. Jarrett's firm, was that the city council benefits had to be commensurate with the highest level of benefits offered to a community.  So he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed he claimed  benefit structure as city council members has to be commensurate with that level.  Because it was $2 and $4, it was a disparity  and was not legal. That makes more sense. Thank you.  Mr. Dow, I have a quick question.  Yes. E.4Q,  public infrastructure replacement.  It looks like the language has changed from  waste hauler franchise fees less $350,000  for the police street crimes unit to fund for  943. Yes. Can you explain that change really quickly?  So in the past,  let's see, I can give you a full history here.  Let me see if I can give you history and maybe it will process as we go along.  So a few years ago, I'm thinking this may have been three,  Mayor Coolidge was involved with this.  I don't know if you remember this at the time,  but we started to get the franchise fees from the waste hauler.  So we used to get a certain amount from it.  It was a very small amount that was retained in the general fund.  So when we got the first batch of revenue that was coming,  we compared that that was roughly 24% of that amount.  So the general fund amount that is retained there  is at 24%. So whatever comes in, 24% is retained.  I think it's 24%.  So it's 24% on here is retained in the general fund.  The remaining over that top went to the infrastructure fund.  What had happened is during that time,  then it was decided that $350,000  should be taken off of that amount that was going to the infrastructure  to be retained for, I think it's a street crimes unit.  Now my understanding is now that that is being,  you know,  removed and it's just going to be the straight percentages.  So that extra revenue is not retained for the street crimes unit.  It's going back to roads.  It's going back to the original proposal.  Thank you.  Okay.  You're making me work on that one.  I had to recall my memory there.  That was good.  That was good.  Thank you.  And so, all right.  The last one, this is going to be fun.  Section J.  Hopefully you're looking at section J here.  And again, I'm sorry for,  taking so much time.  But I think from where I sit,  these are important that we get clarified.  So section J is an area that is in the budget,  but we really need it.  These are continuing and long range council policy decisions  that have been quantified.  And we have not, as far as I know,  spent much time going back and saying,  council, is this what you're in agreement with?  Would you like us to continue?  Going forward with this.  So if I can, bear with me,  we'd like to just kind of go through these.  And if there's a decision that you'd like to change these,  this would be appropriate for,  to go forward and make those changes.  So the first item is CDBG program eligible  neighborhood improvement program.  Continue to utilize community development block grant  program funds for public improvements in neighborhoods  that meet the income eligibility requirements as defined by,  by the department of HUD projects will be selected by council on an  annual basis as part of the annual plan process for CDBG  based on project priorities established through the capital improvement  program.  A lot of words there.  And I talked with manager,  Marie Demers kind of about this particular item.  And she said from her position,  this says probably doesn't need to be stated here because it,  it is taken care of through the capital projects each year.  So just so you know on that it's highlighted here as a priority.  So a prior council thought significantly that it needed to be highlighted.  So if you want to keep it there, no problem.  If you want to make a change, we could change that.  Contracting for services J2 were feasible and cost-effective contract and  private enterprise for city materials, supplies, and service requirements.  Pursuant to this section of the community code utilize public and private,  nonprofit California corporation operating workshops,  serving the handicap for the foregoing whenever possible.  Prior to awarding a bid for a service proposed to be contracted,  notified the city council of the proposed award.  A lot of wording there talking about contracting for services.  Is this something you would like to continue or I'm seeing some positive  statements there.  Development.  Fees establish appropriate development fees to fund new or expanded public  facilities improvements which are required because of new development.  That one right now is pretty standard for what we do.  The next item fair trade products support fair trade and commit to serving  certified fair trade products when purchasing food and beverages whenever  such products are available and comparably priced to non-certified products.  Is this something that you would like to continue or we can change that if you like.  I wouldn't mind us seeing going for best price on number four.  Just a quick clarification.  It seems that the way that this is written is if it's comparable fair trade would be  prioritized.  If it's not then best price would be prioritized.  Is that accurate?  That's the way I read it is as available.  Sometimes things are available.  As available and affordable is what I'm reading.  So I'm happy to stay with that.  Were you done?  I just think that the water bottles, I'd like to see a return on some water bottles  at various meetings.  Sometimes it's very inconvenient not to have them and I know it's in there or at least  it's a public service.  Particularly that we don't have bottles of water.  Can you specify, like, council chambers, bottles of water, rather than these containers?  Yeah, it's actually a policy that we don't have bottles of water.  I just think it's a little ridiculous sometimes, because not necessarily at these meetings  but other meetings, it would make a lot more sense, make it a lot easier on staff.  It's a budget policy.  It is.  I'm all for getting rid of that.  respectfully I don't agree  so  we're jumping all the way to the last item  we can do that so I would assume everything's  okay with the other ones  but that's 7C  single serving  water bottles it says  except in cases where potable water  is not easily available  where there are no reasonable alternatives  to assess safe drinking water  and where a lack of potable water  poses health or safety concerns for city employees  the use of city funds to purchase  single serving plastic water bottles  is prohibited such prohibition  shall apply to city funded or  sponsored events  yeah my thought on it was just  I think we waste more money  in staff time than we do just purchasing  bottles  might be a lot easier  rather than getting  personal opinion  if the more sustainable choice is to just have people  work a little harder for their water rather than getting a single serve water bottle  let's do that  I think staff members  spending 20 minutes on  water each meeting is  one that could spend three  it would be a lot better way to go  thank you  thank you  thank you  thank you  thank you  thank you  if council desires to modify that  then just go ahead and make a motion  and take a vote  and we'll see  alright can we just do that during the hearing  sure  yeah  yeah  I just  make a motion  make the modification  so we can have single serving bottle water  when it makes more sense  financially  so are you  actually striking the budget policy  and allowing it to go forward, or you want it specified that?  Okay, striking it.  All right, thank you.  Okay, Council Member Brown?  No.  Council Member Denley?  Aye.  Council Member Huber?  No.  Council Member Morgan?  Yes.  Council Member Tandon?  You know, I'm not a big fan of the single-use water bottle,  but under the circumstances, I mean, like it says,  when necessary, we all use it.  So I would say I'm not in support of having single-use water bottles.  Okay.  Vice Mayor Reynolds?  Aye.  Mayor Coolidge?  Aye.  Carries 4-3 to strike that.  Okay, so we'll make that change.  Anything else here that you've cruised through that you feel,  you'd like to keep or change?  There's a couple of sustainability city facilities and vehicles.  Any others?  Okay.  So we're good.  Perfect.  Thank you.  Those, again, haven't been updated in a while, so I wanted to see.  Mr. Dowell, I do have one quick question.  Sure.  Under J.2, the contracting for services,  I don't know that this is the right place.  I don't know where and why and how we do it,  but if we are going to contract with a, say, nonprofit or an entity  and or award CBDG funds to them,  where would we set a policy saying that there needs to be a bare minimum standard  of where that nonprofit and or group that we're giving money to would,  they would need to have a bare minimum standard of, i.e.,  having their nonprofit status,  having their nonprofit status be approved and in good standings?  Are they up to date on their taxes?  Are we checking any of those things before we do?  So my understanding is we are, as those are part of,  this is the policy, but there are procedures that they have to follow.  A lot of those are there.  I know that a few years ago when we would do some audits of some of the CDBG funding internally,  those were some of the checklists that we would have to go through.  Okay.  Those are some things.  So I know that those are there.  I don't know.  They're not quantified in a policy other than the fact that we need to follow  all federal and state guidelines accordingly.  Yeah, I think it's contained within each of the individual contracts.  So for whatever that's worth.  Thank you.  All right.  Scott, can I ask one more question before you move on to investment and debt policies?  And this might not be something that needs to be put in here.  We talk a lot about fiscal impact to the general fund.  Is there anywhere in our budget?  Is there any budget policies that says staff reports need to report impact on any fund?  There is a physical portion there on the staff report that is supposed to list that out.  Whether it's general fund or other.  What's that?  Whether it's general fund or other.  It should.  Now, there's no policy that states that, but we can certainly make a recommendation that on all staff reports it shows that.  I would like to make that motion.  Okay.  Second.  And just to be clear, it's not because I think anybody's trying to fool anyone, but it just seems like it's something that should happen.  If it's not in the policy, it can slip by.  Okay.  So it was a motion by Council Member Morgan, seconded by Mayor Coolidge, to include a policy that requires fiscal impact to include all funds affected on staff reports.  Council Member Brown.  Aye.  Council Member Denley.  Aye.  Council Member Huber.  Yes.  Council Member Morgan.  Yes.  Council Member Tandon.  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds.  Yes.  Mayor Coolidge.  Aye.  Carries 7-0.  Thank you.  Anything remaining on the budget policies, questions, anything for me?  If not, we're going to go to the investment policy.  And this one has been vetted with the Finance Committee.  So we have our last.  I believe we went through and the Finance Committee did a review with questions on that.  Again, I'm sorry.  We had to get you a separate copy here that kind of shows everything.  So a little background, just a brief background on this.  Last year, we hadn't updated this policy in about seven or eight years.  We came back with a major revision.  And afterwards, we went and we submitted it to a statewide organization, California Immunization.  And we submitted it to the municipal treasurer's association for an award and certification.  We missed it by that much.  Missed it by five points.  I was not a happy camper.  I wanted that award.  So here's what we did.  This year, we drafted it as you see here.  And we submitted it and said if council agrees to this, not to hold you to anything.  But under this format, if it's approved, would we get that certification?  And we did.  We were told yes.  So it's just, from my perception, it's great to have things certified.  It looks like we're doing things according to state guidelines, that we're doing them according to industry standards.  I think it's a good idea to have those reviewed from time to time.  But you're under no obligation to follow that.  I just think it's kind of a nice piece of the puzzle there.  So I won't go through any of the details.  The major change was on page 10, where we...  We set down and incorporated a performance standard and recorded what that would be.  Talking about market yield, talking about marking to market.  And this has been very helpful, this policy, as the city, as I mentioned earlier, our cash flow has hit record highs.  And so what happens is we've had some excess cash to invest.  And this has been a great guideline because we're able to follow that, following state guidelines.  And we've been able to maximize our return and do far better.  Now, again, I wish the returns were much better.  But everyone is familiar with rate of return.  When I get excited that I can get a CD for 0.5%, that's 0.5.  And I tell my staff, hey, I got one for 0.5 today.  And it's sad from an investment standpoint.  But this has opened up some other doors that we're able to follow.  Any questions on that?  Okay, thank you.  And the last policy is the debt policy.  No changes to that.  What that was is that was an AP&P that we had internally.  We're bringing it back to put it in our policy so we have all these major policies together.  So thank you for your help with that.  I appreciate it.  I know that was tough.  That was painful.  But you're awesome.  So thank you for that.  If you'll allow me to, we had a $6 million man.  But I was reminded by my staff that there was a better show that came out later.  Can we hold that thought for just one minute?  Sure.  We had a request to take a short break.  Okay, sure.  We're going to take a short break at this time.  And then we'll come back for the bionic woman.  Okay.  Which was another one of my favorite shows.

So with that I think it's a great introduction here.  If my friend will work with me here.  Okay.  We're going to be having what I call the bionic women of our budget come up and I say that in all  earnest as a positive thing. These ladies are going to be presenting are wonderful  and do an awesome job for us here at the city. So the first one up is Amanda McCar.  Thank you.  Hello.  So I'm here to deliver good news. So I'll start off with congratulations.  The Government Finance Officers Association has awarded us with their distinguished  budget presentation award for fiscal year 2021.  For those of you who don't know the Government Finance Officers Association  commonly referred to as GFOA at least in the finance department  is a government finance association that is responsible for the  financial and financial services of the United States.  The GFOA is a body of finance officers around the U.S. that provide best practices and professional  development to government agencies. For many years now the city has received a similar  award for our annual comprehensive financial reporting but this is the first time in known  history that we saw or received the budget award.  So in order to receive the budget award the city must satisfy nationally recognized guidelines  for effective budget presentation.  Things we've done. We have started including more narratives to tell our story versus providing  just the data. We've been incorporating department goals within our budget, explained our processes  and how things work a little bit more. We've been working to improve our capital section  by highlighting the major projects and the works and have included photos to bring the  capital section alive a little bit. We've added timelines and overviews for the various  sections of the budget to give the reader a general big picture idea of what is included  in the document. Although we were successful in obtaining the award we will need to make  further modifications if we want to continue to get it. They've restructured their budget  award program and have added additional requirements for the city to continue to get the award.  So they've modernized their criteria. We can now, they're now accepting hyperlinks that  we can link out to our  budget policies and our investment policies to make this document a little bit shorter.  But most importantly they're putting huge emphasis on strategic planning and detailed  performance measures to tie to citywide planning. So having strategic planning and performance  measures in place were optional before but now in order to get the award it's mandatory.  So the city will need to do a little bit of work in that area.  We need to identify or update our priorities and spell out our plans to address them.  These goals or priorities should be community driven, citywide goals that ideally won't  change too much from year to year. Once those have been established or updated, we will  be able to build off that foundation and create an action plan down to the department level  where we can track progress from year to year. Simply put, we need, the budget needs to show  our plans and the steps we're taking each year to get there so i won't dive into too much detail as  i know jennifer our deputy city manager will be speaking to you about that a little bit later  so by by following anyway our goal is to make the budget information that is presented clear  cohesive and meaningful we want to illustrate the strategic priorities of our city and ensure that  it is easy to follow for the reader we want your average citizen to be able to pick up or click on  the budget and get an idea of what is important to the leaders and community of chico without  having to decipher 500 pages and paint their own pictures so although there is still work to be  done we believe obtaining the award was a significant achievement for the city and that  should be celebrated with that i will hand it over to barbara to talk about our budget  our five year projections and city debt.  Thank you, thank you Amanda,  and she really has been the core  of making this budget award worthy,  so I do want to echo the sentiments  that she's done an incredible work in that regard.  And with that, I need to change modes here,  and hopefully not ruin everything.  Okay, five year projections.  Now, when we last talked about this in March,  Mr. Dahl gave you a comprehensive look  at the five year projection.  Things have changed since then.  I think that one thing that we have learned  that is consistent over the last few years especially  is that change is the one constant thing.  So as we continue to work on this,  we continue to receive new economic news,  we continue to try to project things in a reasonable way,  but as Mr. Dahl said earlier, a conservative projection.  And with that, I will give you some highlights  about some of the changes that we have in the budget  in terms of the five year projection.  Can you all see that okay?  I want to be able to come up up.  Okay, when we last had the five year projection presented to,  we were estimating that revenues would be about $60.9 million  at the end of this fiscal year, 2021.  As you can see, we've had an increase in that projection  through the end of the year.  Latest estimates, we're looking at about a $600,000 increase  in sales tax, and then about a $300,000 increase  from initial projections in property tax.  So that has been included in this projection.  And then moving on into next year,  we were originally looking at just over,  or just under $60 million for revenue.  And as you can see, we're looking at about a 62.3 balance  in revenue going into the end of next year.  And this is taking sales tax,  we're anticipating about a 3% increase  from where we're at this year,  and then property tax, a 2% increase.  And then TOT, we're looking at a bigger increase at about 17%,  because we're looking that the pandemic will subside  and that,  the hotels will get back to somewhat of a normal course  of business.  So those are all factors that have brought the new projections  in revenue.  One thing that's a little bit different on here is it only  shows that a change from last year is a 0.8%.  The thing that's making that look a little bit skewed is  that this $2.7 million revenue piece that's right here includes  the CARES Act funding that we got this year.  So it's higher than what a normal year would be.  So going forward, that's taken  out.  So as you can see going forward,  we're looking at about a 3% growth in the following year,  and then 2% going in the years outward.  What this isn't contemplating is any kind of compaction  that may happen through inflation or something like that.  So we kind of have to keep that in the back of our minds.  As of right now, that's not in the projections,  but who knows what will happen going down the road.  Now, moving on to expenditures, everything that's in,  the 21-22 expenditures here is what's reflected in what is  before you in the proposed budget.  So all of the additions and requests are included in there.  Just to be clear, that's the second column to the right?  Yeah. Yeah.  Sorry. Sorry.  You can't see the title anymore, but yes, this is 21-22 here.  This is where we're looking to end in 2021.  As you can see, for the five years, our net operations before capital expenditures,  we're looking at a $2.7 million increase in the next five years.  It's pretty consistent.  We're looking at about a $6 million plus side,  just on the operational side.  All of the salaries and benefits includes anticipated increases  as we go along, including the payment to PERS that is going  to increase over the next few years.  So we do have a good surplus in that regard.  The other piece to this, though, is the next page,  which is the  capital improvements.  So all of these numbers are related to what's in our current 10-year CIP,  the capital improvement plan, and what we're expected in the out years.  This fluctuates a lot, just depending on what projects are out there  and timing and things like that.  And then also our other finances, sources and uses, which is our transfers,  which I'll talk about in a minute.  One thing I did want to note on the last page is the debt service line.  You'll see that we have a $500,000 payment this year,  debt service, and then it all goes to zeros.  That's not a reduction in debt service.  We are changing the way we are accounting for it,  and it's going to be its own account.  So what is happening is you'll see it in transfers  from 21-22 going forward.  You'll see that on the next page.  So with that, we're looking at changes in our operating expenditures  of about 2% every year, and like I said, revenues 3-2%  in the next five years.  Now, looking at the  transfers.  In the years past, we've had a focus on emergency reserve transfers,  making sure that we are, our goal of getting to the operating reserve of 20%.  The reserves, the transfers that you see here are to maintain that in the out years.  So we will continue to have that 20% reserve based on operating expenditure costs  of the prior year, as Mr. Dowell described in the budget policies.  One thing that we are  adding here is a million dollar transfer to our section 115 trust plan.  The intention here is to use that as another tool that we have  to help fund our pension liabilities.  As you know, those costs are going to increase over the next seven years or so,  up until, actually, up until 2030, which is 10 years, will be the peak.  Right now, this year, we have about a $10.6 million payment for the unfunded liability.  By 2030, that will be just over $15 million.  So this is one of the ways to put some money away that's at a better return that we can use down the road to soften the blow of that payment going forward.  And then the next line there is the debt service payment that we were talking about this year.  It's the same.  $21.22 is the same as $20.21.  You'll see that there's an increase here in the next years.  We're anticipating a new lease for some public safety radios that will come on board, and that will take effect in the out years here.  So we wanted to reflect that in the projection going forward.  And then we will continue to support some of the other funds that need continuous support throughout the city of note.  We still have a transfer to the airport fund going forward.  And then also the private development fund.  Since we are at a 90% cost recovery in those funds, we're continuing to anticipate to pay into those funds going forward.  Now, the emergency reserve is fully funded.  So now we can focus on our replacement funds.  We have these different funds, technology replacement, fleet replacement, facilities maintenance, et cetera, that need our help.  Over the past years, they've been...  Transferred to and supported as much as we can.  But now, as we have more ability to do so, we're going to do that and support those funds so that we can replenish those replacement funds and do the projects that we need to do to keep our city running efficiently and up to standard.  And then finally, this public infrastructure replacement fund is the transfer into public infrastructure for the waste hauler franchise fees that go in every year that we talked about earlier.  And with that, we anticipate that our ending cash balances in the general fund will continue to be right along where we desire it to be in terms of an operating reserve.  This line here is where we anticipate we want to be at the 7.5% of operations.  And this is where we're keeping it going forward.  So a quick question, if I can.  Yeah.  Can you scroll back down?  Sure.  So in terms of the other...  Financing uses.  So which one of those are new to the budget?  Well, none are new.  There may be more funding going towards certain things.  Okay.  But none of them are a new category then?  No.  None are new categories as of right now.  The only thing that's really new is the reclassification of the debt.  So we do have this new debt service fund.  That makes sense.  Okay.  Perfect.  Yeah.  Any other questions about that five-year?  Okay.  Great.  I will move on back to this side if I do it right.  Okay.  Talk a little bit about our city debt.  We have three categories where we're actually paying out money that have debt service payments,  kind of the things specific to the city.  The general fund has leases for the various equipment.  We have leases for the equipment.  This is that $500,000 cost that we have currently.  You'll see when all of these end.  As that goes on, the costs will go down.  And then we have bonds that were issued through the sewer fund.  You all saw that come through.  We refinanced them this year.  And that ends in 2930.  And that's an obligation of the sewer enterprise itself.  And then finally, we have the successor agency debt, which are refinanced bonds through the  former redevelopment agency.  That's not city per se, but it's former tax increment of the city.  That's an obligation that is part of the budget.  It's the very last pages of your budget that is part of approval that we go through every year.  So to reiterate, the general fund has $500,000 annually in payments.  And right now, at the end of 21-22, there will be a $1.5 million balance of those obligations.  And all of those leases will be over by 25-26.  And then the sewer funds, those annual payments are about $2.4 million annually.  They'll have about $16.2 million balance at the end of next fiscal year.  And those will be done by 29-30.  And then finally, the successor agency has $6.1 million every year.  They'll be done by 20-32, and the balance is $53.3 million.  And again, those are supplied by our recognized obligation schedules that come from the  sewer.  So that's the first item that we're going to talk about.  Now, the biggest debt item that is upon the city is our unfunded accrued liability with CalPERS.  As of this next year, we'll be giving payments for the miscellaneous plan of just over $5 million,  and then of the safety plan, just over $5.5 million.  And you can see what the balances are at the end of next fiscal year, $66.5 million and $78.7 million.  Now, these costs do ramp up.  The peak of the payments come in 2030, so they're not even part of the five-year projection yet.  You don't see the maximum there yet.  And like I said, that's just over $15 million that will be owed at that peak time.  So that's kind of what we're gearing for is when those costs will be at their most extreme,  and then they'll start tapering off again.  And once we get through that hump and it starts to decline,  theoretically, the UAL will be paid off by 2043.  And then it will just be the normal cost that we have for each of the plans.  Now, this is all kind of contingent on returns from CalPERS, et cetera, that we've all talked about before.  Last year for 2020, which is what our next actuarial report will be based on,  the investment returns were 4.7 percent instead of the anticipated,  anticipated 7 percent.  So that could adversely affect the payments a little bit.  But on the other hand, as of the end of March,  their investment returns were sitting at about 15 percent for this year.  So that's positive.  So we'll see where that kind of evens out going forward.  So with that, I will take any questions about any of the stuff that I went over.  Great.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Good afternoon.  I'm Catherine Mathis, the accounting manager for the city.  And today I'm going to discuss general fund revenues.  General fund revenues are all general purpose for the most part in the city.  And most some, let me start again.  Catch my breath.  All government entities have to have a general fund.  And all general purpose revenue has to be deposited in the general fund.  General purpose revenue is a revenue available to spend without any restriction.  These are the categories of revenue we receive in our general fund.  Taxes, which includes sales taxes, property taxes, utility user taxes.  Licenses and permits is a really small source of revenue for us.  It includes things like permits to have a parade downtown or have a banner over Main Street.  Intergovernmental revenues.  Those are primarily reimbursements or grant proceeds.  We don't have a lot of those in the general fund.  Those typically go into the special revenue funds.  Charges for service.  Those we discussed at the last city council meeting.  Those are most of our items on the fee schedule.  So that would be, for example, having your fingerprints taken at the police department.  You would pay a charge for service for that.  Fines and forfeitures.  We don't have a lot of revenue from that.  But we do have a lot of fines and forfeitures listed in our fee schedule.  Those are punitive.  They're not really revenue generators for us.  And then uses of money and property.  That would be income that we earn from our assets.  So interest income or rent income.  Something that we earn from sourcing our assets.  The two main sources of revenue into our general fund are sales tax and property tax.  Sales tax is number one and property tax is number two.  Sales tax, I think we all know we pay it when we make a purchase of a tangible item.  And I have on the little chart, it's a little bit smaller than I wish it was.  But at the point of sale, the retailer will collect their own amount that they're selling the item for.  And then seven and a quarter percent, which is the sales tax.  That 100% gets paid to the state.  And the state withholds all of it except 1%, which they pay to the cities.  A lot of cities, including our city, have agreements with the county to share our sales tax revenue with them.  We have an agreement with Butte County to share.  And we have a property tax agreement that we entered into back when the North Valley Plaza Mall was annexing into the city of Chico.  So the county was having to give up property taxes.  So we in turn agreed to give them some of the sales tax we would be earning from the mall.  And then the portion of the sales tax that comes to us is 1%.  The difference goes to the state.  And some of that comes back to us in transparency.  And that's the amount of revenues.  But most of it stays at the county or the state level.  3.9 goes to the state and the rest goes to the counties.  The next largest source of revenue for us is property tax.  So we receive three types of property tax.  We receive secured property tax, which is a property tax on real estate within the city limits.  Unsecured property tax, which is the property tax on tangible goods that aren't connected to the ground,  such as business equipment or airplanes.  And then unitary tax, which is the tax that's a per unit tax.  And that's on items such as a railroad that pass through different taxing agencies.  So the railroad might go through Oroville and Chico.  So the state actually determines how much per unit property tax gets paid to each city.  And that's not calculated at the county level.  That's calculated by the state.  So per mile or per foot if it's a pipeline or a canal, something like that.  The other portion of the property tax we receive is VLF in lieu.  And this is vehicle license in lieu.  This was back in the early 2000s.  The state changed the amount that you pay on your DMV renewal for property tax.  You used to go to the state and then it would come back to us.  They ended up doing a swap with the counties.  So the counties began giving us part of property tax and the state kept the DMV fees.  So it's...  It's called vehicle license in lieu.  It grows at the same rate that property taxes grow within the city limits.  So it's actually about 50% of our property tax comes from that.  And that is a little bit over 8 million this year.  I think it's close to 9 million.  Yeah, it's 8.9 million.  Then we have...  Let's see.  Utility user tax.  This is a 5% tax on consumption.  It's...  Primarily collected by the providers such as PG&E or Cal Water.  We receive most of those monthly.  And we do have some private utility users that pay us individually but not really very material amounts.  Transient occupancy tax.  That's a 10% tax that visitors pay for the privilege of staying within the city of Chico.  That's collected by the hotels or the Airbnb owners.  And those are also paid to us monthly.  Franchise fees are about $3.7 million in revenue.  Ms. Martin discussed the waste hauler earlier.  That's one of them.  And then we also have franchise fees with PG&E and for gas and electric and Cal Water.  I think I have one there.  So that's for the privilege of being able to install power lines or pipelines in the right of way, public right of way.  And then intergovernmental revenues for the city of Chico aren't...  Not really materialized.  Not really material in the general fund.  So those are primarily reimbursements.  Say if we help Cal Fire fight a fire and they reimburse us for our expenses, that shows up in this revenue area.  And then business license tax.  It's not a material tax.  The rate hasn't been changed since the 70s.  That's about $278,000 of our revenue.  And that's my section.  Thank you.  Are there any questions on revenue?  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  Thank you, Bionic Women of the Budget.  I thought they did a great job in sharing information.  So I appreciate all their work and everything behind the scenes and in front as you shared.  So at break, when you have break, one of the traditions that we've always done is to provide pie.  So Council Member Morgan, we have apple pie this year.  I know that's one of your favorites.  So it may be back there.  So he's already going for the pie.  And then we have cherry pie.  So please enjoy that.  We know this is a long day, but hopefully you can enjoy that.  If you want to know the story behind pie, talk to me later.  I'll share it.  There's a certain story about that.  Okay.  So this time that we spent together has been really talking about the city overall and primarily the general fund.  So thank you for bearing with us on that.  Now we're going to transition into talking about each individual department.  So again, the bionic eye was ASD.  And you can read through this slide later on tonight if you need to fall asleep.  But it really tells you a lot about what we're doing.  So ASD is primary finance and IT.  So our funding primarily were from the general fund.  We have the IES group, which is funded through an internal service fund,  which means they bill the other departments for the work that they do.  And then those other departments.  So our total budget is $4.4 million.  Personnel cost, that's $2.6 million.  We have 22 positions.  And included in that is one new position for a purchasing manager.  That says purchasing manger.  But it's going to be a purchasing manager.  That would be some kind of manger is all I can tell you.  But it is a purchasing manager position.  Why is that important?  Well, right now,  we are decentralized.  That means each department is responsible for purchasing their own equipment,  supplies, projects.  What if we had one that was able to keep up on all the latest trends,  keep up on all the cooperative agreements and all the piggyback agreements,  look for the best buys and help the other departments out?  That's what the goal of this position is.  My personal opinion is this position will pay for itself in one year  just by finding the best buyers.  And that's going to be the best purchase prices available.  So we're looking forward to that.  That position is scheduled to come online January 1st, if you approve.  With that, I want to shift over and have Josh McKee come and speak about IT.  They are kind of the unsung heroes sometimes.  Very important.  So Josh, come on up and share with us your accomplished position.  Good afternoon, counsel.  My name is Josh Markey.  I'm the Information Systems Manager for the City of Chico.  I've got a long list of IT accomplishments in the last couple of years,  but I just wanted to highlight some of them.  I do have a fun picture of the server room at the police department.  That's one of our projects that we're particularly proud of.  I don't know if it looks all that exciting, but all the IT people love it.  It signifies quite a change with the city, and we're very proud to continue improving it.  So,  I've been with the city a little over two years.  In that time, we've had a lot of turnover with retirements.  The city's been really investing in its IT infrastructure and its staff.  And we've really started to develop a revolutionary team.  I'm very proud of them.  We get a lot of good feedback from directors.  I wish they could all be here today, but they're out doing stuff, fixing things.  So, you just have me and a couple of senior staff who are hiding in the back.  So,  One of the things we changed was we used to be 8 to 5 office hours,  and that didn't work all that well for some of our public safety staff who come on at 6 am, 6 pm.  So, we've allowed some of our staff who like to come in early.  They come in at 6 am, 5 am, sometimes even 4 am.  And then some of our staff like to stay a little bit later.  So, we are now providing 6 am to 6 pm coverage,  and then we obviously support public safety.  So, we are at 24 hours.  We have a 24 hour operation.  And some of that new flexibility allows my staff to, you know, flex their hours,  meet a graveyard shift at the police department,  meet fire at a fire station after hours,  and kind of, you know, roll with the punches.  We've replaced our virtual infrastructure.  That's a particularly exciting one.  It keeps all of our storage and compute operating efficiently and quickly for dispatch or other city functions.  We've implemented a next gen threat prevention solution,  basically antivirus, but with a lot more depth of reporting and action.  We've replaced, made a significant replacement to our network and our Wi-Fi infrastructure.  I know some of you guys have benefited recently from the Wi-Fi at City Hall and from the council chambers.  We've taken advantage of a new network provider,  so your Wi-Fi now appears to be much faster, because it is.  And hopefully,  it'll be more reliable as well.  Like I mentioned, the server room remodel.  That was a fun one last year.  We've also implemented a public safety radio program.  Donato Pepe, who's in the audience, who's waving at you,  he's a new addition to the city.  He really represents a huge investment of the city's time and money,  putting staff towards our public safety radios,  which are critical for our public safety staff.  Staying safe and doing good.  And being able to communicate, especially during a disaster.  We, as everyone else experienced, had a sudden shift in work culture.  A bunch of people went home and worked from home.  And the ability and the opportunity to change that model  and the software and hardware that was required was a significant ask.  And there was a lot of staff time spent every waking moment,  especially around March, trying to get that to happen effectively.  We implemented a proactive system monitoring reporting system,  so that we could hopefully get the notice that something was down  before staff members come in.  Even though we do have that staff member who likes to come in at 6 in the morning,  sometimes no one notices that the permit systems have an issue  or the financial management systems have an issue.  So implementing a system to actually be checking that,  and sending an email or a phone call to a staff member to,  hey, there's something wrong.  Let's take a look at it before we have 40 city staff in and unable to work effectively.  We implemented a remote management and support infrastructure tool  that's been really big for us.  In fact, earlier when you saw a little pop-up window on the Zoom screen,  I was able to, from my phone, go in and click no on that from the audience,  so that we didn't have to physically go somewhere.  And obviously with COVID, that's been really effective for my staff  to be able to be home or on the road or at a fire station  and still respond to a phone call.  We implemented a new identity and multi-factor authentication platform.  I think you guys all were affected by that, some of you more than others.  A lot of that change has been quick.  Sometimes we've experienced some of the,  the pain of that change,  but it's something that's really important for the cities,  managing our risk and hopefully preventing the city  from being a victim of ransomware or data loss.  And then, as I mentioned earlier,  we implemented a geographically diverse internet provider.  Our area, Butte County in general,  and all of Northern California for that matter,  suffers from a lack of connectivity options.  And so through a community meeting that we were having with a bunch of IT people,  we identified a provider that Chico State had,  and we were able to get them connected to City Hall.  And now the city has three internet providers that hopefully during the,  if there is another disaster,  hopefully our connectivity and our ability to communicate will be greatly improved.  And then I didn't want to miss one of our favorite programs for all the city staff.  Our security awareness and training platform that sends out phishing emails routinely  to help educate staff about best practices and what's a safe email to open and what's not.  So future projects.  I don't want to just talk about what we've done.  We have a couple of fun things coming up.  As mentioned earlier, there's a public safety radio handheld replacement lease that we are hoping to replace all of our,  our antiquated public safety handheld radios and radios in the car  to better allow our public safety staff to interact with, you know, the sheriff's office or Paradise  or whoever else is asking for aid.  Or if we are asking for aid, they'll be able to come down and communicate with us effectively.  We also have some money that was put aside for our microwave network infrastructure  that will also help augment that ability to communicate during an outage.  We are highly dependent right now on providers to provide that communication method.  And this microwave network will allow us to be somewhat self-sufficient  and hopefully still communicate during a large-scale disaster.  We have a lot of cameras throughout the city for, you know, looking at parking structure or the plaza.  But what we do not have is a platform and a single,  framework and hardware model that we effectively have put out.  So we are looking at all of our platforms, all of our hardware,  and we're trying to come up with a single, easy-to-use platform that's effective and cost-effective especially.  We have the option of doing an access control solution, so our door card access.  We currently use a lot of keys, which are problematic.  If someone loses a key, there's a lot of cost to re-key doors.  And it will also give us the ability to do some hands-free stuff in the future for something like COVID,  if it were to continue to be an issue.  And then last but not least, we have hardware replacement and refresh.  I know everyone's excited about that, but that's something that me and my staff are excited about.  Without further ado, is there any questions that I can answer or comments?  Question?  Thank you very much.  Excellent. Thank you.  I am so excited about that IT team.  They have done a fabulous job, and it just makes me very happy.  When you think of all that they had to do with COVID last year and getting immediately 50, 60 users working from home was fantastic.  So I'm a proud papa, if I can say that.  Finance accomplishments, again, we kind of talked about that,  but the surrogate refinancing was a big thing that we did last year,  and getting to work remotely.  And then also a lot of work has gone into researching the pension obligation bonds for where they're at.  As we walk forward in the future, we'll be working with the purchasing manager.  One of the items that I think is of interest is right now when we pay a vendor,  we pay with a physical check.  We're looking now to pay that electronically through ACH.  So accounting manager Mathis has done a great job, and this has taken about a year to get to that process.  But we think going back to internal controls and stuff like that,  the city will be in a safer place.  We remove a lot of fraud issues, so we're very proud to move forward with that.  Also, we're continuing the pension obligation bond discussion and bringing that forward.  Of note, June 8th, we will be having a public forum about pension obligation bonds here in this room.  We will tape that session.  We will put it on the internet.  So all full transparency.  People are invited to come, talk about it, as council members are also offered to come as well.  So June 8th, we are looking at that.  Again, you know that we're going through a legal process that we expect to be finished probably in July or August.  And then we will be able to come back and say, what would you like to do?  So a lot of moving parts there going forward.  And then if I could, I'm trying to finish up by 3 o'clock, and it shows I've got two minutes.  And I'm going to go ahead and do that.  This next one I'm so excited about, though.  Maybe it might take three minutes or four minutes.  But what about the concept of a citywide broadband?  Many of you know that a few weeks ago we came before you, the Douglas Maltin's office was asking for proposals.  One of those proposals was to create broadband in the Chapman-Mulberry area.  Why is this such a revolutionary idea?  We're used to internet.  But this is no slam on our current providers.  But there's improvement that can take place.  Speed, as we've found with what we've been dealing with, speed hasn't been fully accurate.  And so what we've been doing is we're starting to research this concept.  And we were at a conference recently, and a presentation was made, and they talked specifically about Chico.  And they said Chico was in danger of becoming a dark city.  Now what does that mean?  A dark city is one that has not embraced high-speed, reliable fiber internet.  So as staff, we've talked about this, and we don't want to be that dark city.  We want to see our businesses flourish.  We want to see our students flourish with accurate, quick internet.  So just briefly, we've talked about that.  Wouldn't it be fantastic if we could start the process here in the Chico?  And then we can go back to the next two to three years to see that become a reality.  So what we're doing is looking at currently the speed that you may purchase is maybe 100 megabytes.  We talk about megabytes, and that's the speed.  So 100 megabytes up.  I'm sorry, let's make it 100 megabytes down.  You're downloading.  And then sometimes you can get 25 megabytes up, which would be very fast.  I pay for that right now, and I don't honestly get that all the time.  Maybe you're like me.  But we're looking at 1,000 up and down as a minimum for everyone.  Can you imagine how that would transform our community?  We could attract businesses from everywhere because they would want to be here in Chico,  and we've got great, reliable internet.  So here's what we're doing.  Staff is working on a plan right now, a broadband plan,  and we're working with staff members.  And eventually community members and talk about how this plan would work.  Then we would come back to council, or we're shooting for in the fall,  and say, what do you think about this?  So I'm just trying to kind of whet your appetite here for something and to think about it.  And so as we're looking at that, the concept, one of the concepts we're looking at that I kind of thought was totally cool, all right?  And to be honest with you, when we went through and asked for letters of support,  for doing this concept in our Chapman-Mulberry area, you know what we got?  We got over 50 letters of support from citizens and businesses.  And we did that in relatively quick fashion.  I think we did six to eight days or maybe 10 days.  It was phenomenal to hear people's comments about we love this idea because we see a need.  Let me just conclude here with just one of the things that I wanted to say.  One of the things that we're looking at that we think is a possibility.  So on this little spreadsheet, there's three concepts or three ideas of what makes up your monthly fee.  One is the infrastructure.  An entity has to put in the lines.  There's a big cost to do anything capital related to that.  There's also the maintenance of those lines.  And then there's also doing the work for allowing the Internet process and providers to do their work.  So right now, and I'm kind of using my personal insight.  For example, I pay about $85 a month and the speed is 100 megabytes per second down.  Now in reality, when I do my speed test on a good day, again, this is no slam on any provider.  We're wanting, we in fact want to have interaction with our providers because we think a partnership would be a good idea.  But on a good day, I might get 50.  And that's a good day.  But what if the city decided and went down the route of creating a utility?  We have a sewer utility.  What if it was the city utility for broadband?  We would pay for the infrastructure, which we'd have to work, there are a lot of details to work out.  But work through that.  But the infrastructure in this case might be $20 a month.  The maintenance of that might be $15 a month.  And these are some cost estimates that we've put together with our consultant.  And in the end, what would happen is if you got all this structure there and the fiber there,  the providers could come in and there would become a marketplace for them.  And the individual residents would be able to pick who their providers are.  There would be more than one or two providers.  You may have providers all over the country wanting to provide an internet service  because all of the structure and the capital is right there.  In this case, maybe that cost might be $45 a month.  A great reduction to the average user.  And then, the way we would do the billing is if the infrastructure is paid off,  someone could pay off the infrastructure, it almost could be like a sewer and loo type thing  where you're putting that on their property taxes.  Once that's paid off, look, your bill goes down to $25.  So what we were coming to when we came to the city, we were coming to the city, we were coming to the city,  we came back and we're looking at the Chapman Mulberry area,  was we were looking and saying, hey, federal government, would you cover the cost for the infrastructure?  So the average user would be paying $25 a month for a thousand megabytes per speed up and down.  So anyway, thank you for letting me just share that.  That is just a vision in its infancy, but I think it's something that is exciting  and here we have an opportunity to be part of.  So that Chico will be a city of light with high speed, reliable, low cost broadband for all.  I pledge allegiance to the flag.  That's one of those patriotic moments there.  With that, thank you for your listening to us.  That concludes my comments as the I working for you.  And I gladly pass it on to our human resource.  Mr. Dowell, I just have one more question.  Yes.  Can you give a super brief explanation of why they said we would be the dark city  and can you also just say any surrounding areas that maybe have done something like this,  like Reading, New City, anywhere?  So they're using dark city as saying if you're not providing high speed internet,  businesses will not come and the businesses that you have will leave.  That was this conference.  And then Reading has gone through and we're working with the same contractor that Reading did,  and we may not adopt anything that Reading did.  In fact, this is a proposal, a plan, a general plan for us.  And that's why we want to come back and say, hey, here are the options.  Which option do you think is the best plan?  So thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Good afternoon.  Welcome to the foot.  You know, when city manager Orem brought this idea forward and said,  that HR was going to be the feet, I was at first a wee bit offended.  But then I thought about it and thought, this $8 million man's foundation is his feet,  like all of us.  And then I think of the city of Chico and our employees, and our employees are our foundation.  So then I thought, okay, this works.  I'm into it.  So quickly, this is our mission statement in front of you, and I'm not going to read it to you.  You all have the slides.  We are funded by the general fund as well as through that internal service fund.  By our budget changes, we have four employees total in human resources and risk management  that support our total employee count of just over about 405.  Now, this is kind of a list of what we do.  But to put it simply, HR manages the employee's life cycle.  We recruit for quality talents.  We onboard them.  We train them.  We help them with performance management.  And eventually, we help them move on, whether that's retirement, what have you.  In HR, we administer all of our expenses.  We have extensive benefit and health programs, including safety, workers' compensation, et cetera.  We manage all of our employee-employer relation agreements.  As you know, we have 10 official bargaining units for 400 employees.  It's quite a bit of work.  We also ensure labor law compliance.  We offer robust training programs in terms of desktop training, live trainings through  Lieber-Cassidy-Whitmore, as well as all the onsite safety programs that we do throughout the various departments.  And then, HR has the most important feature, in my opinion, one leg of it at least, which  is getting our people paid.  So that is key for why people want to talk to us.  And I said it earlier this spring, and I'll say it again.  We are the resource for our humans.  That's what HR does.  And with HR, we help everyone with their questions and issues about career advancement, whether  they need help with a worker's compensation claim or an issue with their health benefits.  They come to us for divorce, marriage, whatever.  We help them with their marriage births.  We kind of tongue-in-cheek joke that we are free marriage family therapists on the regular.  And the only reason that exists for us is because our employees trust us.  Our employees feel comfortable and able to come into human resources, and we're not just, you know, that joke you see on TV.  It's a really great environment.  On the risk side of the house, we process all of the tort claims against the City of Chico.  In addition, our function is to contractually transfer the risk that comes to Chico, meaning every lease agreement, every permit,  every contract that comes across the City of Chico's desk comes through risk management to ensure that we have the appropriate insurance provisions in place  that in the event something goes bad, we are not liable.  That is one of our key focuses.  In addition, we thoroughly work with the City Attorney's Office with our bigger claims that come into the City.  In the six years I've been here, some of my proudest accomplishments of our department have been process improvements.  We've moved to a fully paperless recruitment process.  Our applicants comply from anywhere in the world, submit information.  With the change of the pandemic, we did interviews completely remote and paperless.  So it's been a really great process.  In addition, we moved to a paperless evaluation system, which is huge.  It allows our folks to move back and forth electronically without having to do physical paper or having to file it.  It's just, it makes everything a bit faster.  Another big thing I'm quite proud of is with those ten bargaining units,  we've been able to successfully make it work.  We've been able to negotiate with each of those groups to have employees pay a portion of the employer's cost for CalPERS.  You have seen all of our agreements come forward to you.  One of our groups pays as much as 6.68% of the employer's cost, in addition to their own costs.  So that's a huge accomplishment, and kudos to our employees.  In closing, what's next for HR and risk management?  We are working towards an electronic personnel filing system,  so we would do away with physical hard copy personnel files.  If you've ever been into the Human Resources Office, we have a room about a quarter of this size,  and it's nothing but paper.  So our goal is to eliminate that.  In addition, we will be moving forward with our classification study.  We just had our kickoff meetings with all of our groups,  which is the partial citywide classification study,  with hopes to have everyone appropriately classified.  I am short and sweet when I enter my slides,  kind of showing you the life cycle here.  Key achievements, I spoke to most of those.  And then we'll move to our next department.  Unless I can help answer any questions.  Great. Thank you all.  Thank you.  Welcome, Chief.  Good afternoon.  It's a pleasure to be here, and I'm honored to be presenting the right hand,  or right arm, I guess, of the bionic man.  And I'm very proud to be speaking before and presenting the budget  on behalf of the men and women of Chico Fire.  It's an amazing group of people.  I won't read the mission statement,  but suffice it to say they come to work every day prepared to keep our community safe  and provide the most professional and compassionate care possible.  My glasses are fogging up.  We are general funded, but we do have some revenues that come in from fees for service,  for plan review, code enforcement, new development.  This year we did receive one additional FD,  and I'll talk about that in a moment.  And so we are allocated 62 positions, but one position we're not going to staff.  We're going to utilize that funding in a different manner.  I'll go on that.  Central services are what you would imagine.  Primarily our primary responsibility is to respond to emergencies,  and that goes range and gamut from everything from fires, EMS, rescues,  and everything in between.  We also are responsible for emergency management, disaster,  large-scale pre-incident planning, code enforcement, and public education.  So this last year was a very productive year for us.  We were able to maintain 16 firefighters per day,  but for a period of time during COVID when we dropped below our 40 personnel available to staff,  we were unable to maintain that number.  So we dropped down to 15, and 14 was our lowest threshold.  But that 16 number is important because it allows us to keep four on the truck  and put into service an additional fire engine.  So right now we have five apparatus that respond to and cover the city,  so four engines and one ladder truck.  Additionally, we added management capacity in what had been a very dysfunctional system  with division chiefs also doubling up as battalion chiefs,  overseeing a shift.  Now we have dedicated shift battalion chiefs, and it has made a huge difference.  They are operationally focused, and their responsibility is to oversee that shift  for everything operational.  We also completed a CAL FIRE computer-aided dispatch integration with Chico Fire.  That has been successful, and so much so that we initiated a CAD-to-CAD interface  with BeautyMS and Chico Fire as well.  It shortens our response times because it allows each agency to pull resources  and request them and dispatch them automatically without having to go through the phone.  It enhances our data transfer and collection,  and so it's been a very vital and important aspect of our evolution.  I do want to thank IES for helping.  It's a very complicated and long process, so they did a fabulous job.  I'm happy to say that we are now in the process of navigating through, as did James Bennett,  who works for PD and does the CAD administration there.  And the gift that keeps on giving, Station 1 remodel.  This has been a long process, but we're nearing the end.  Phase 3 should start at the first of the fiscal year, shortly thereafter,  and that's for the BC corners, but most of the rest of the station has been remodeled  and crews are back in and living in it.  We were successful in securing two grants,  one for the drone that we use for locating lost people in the park  and to locate fire when we can't locate it ourselves.  We also instituted several programs to create better efficiency with our fire prevention bureau.  These included fire protection tracking and notification process  that allowed us to go to a third-party vendor and they send out all the notifications,  they track all the inspection cycles and allow us to do other things  and then they take care of all that on our behalf.  And then you'll hear more about this today.  We instituted the false fire alarm program that tracks and collects all the false fire alarms  and then sends out notifications on our behalf.  The fire training center.  We added a monumental piece of training prop, which is our burn box.  It's a Connex box that is adapted to allow us to burn.  And so our high-risk, low-frequency event, the one that is most dangerous for us,  allows us to do it for the first time ever within the city,  which means we don't have to have crews go out of the city  or have to wait for a building to come available to burn it.  So this allows us to continually practice a series of tasks that are necessary to put out a fire.  Conducted our first fire captain leadership academy, which I think was very successful.  It allowed us to develop a baseline for our captains moving into the position  as they transition into that from firefighter or engineer.  And so it's a good starting point to build on for future years.  And then finally, thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you, Council Member Denlay, for attending the Citizens Academy,  as well as City Manager Orem.  It was another successful event, and I'd encourage any of you to join us next year when we do it.  So future projects for this next fiscal year include evaluating and instituting,  or possibly instituting, advanced life support, ALS, and Chico's service model.  I'll be presenting on that later this afternoon.  We also need to shore up our fire prevention bureau.  Unfortunately, what I've had to do to maintain 16 a day and that fifth piece of apparatus  is to utilize the funds for specialists, or it will be this year.  Last year it was for this last fiscal year, and the previous was using the funding from fire prevention officer  that Tony Lindsey was able to do as a job share.  Now that he's gone, I'm going to be able to do that.  I've had to hire a new fire prevention officer to onboard here soon.  So we're using that funding now to make sure we end allocating it towards our minimum staffing.  Institute the training captain.  That's the new FTE.  Strengthen our Company One volunteer program.  As our older members are starting to retire out, we don't have a lot of volunteers that are coming in,  so we need to bolster that program to effectively support the fire department.  We want to complete the Beauty MS Chico Fire Cat-to-Cat, put into service a new air light truck,  and you'll see the rest of them.  I won't continue to bore you with those details.  And then our longer term goals is continue to look for ways to staff to address the increasing service demands  we have in the city, not only with respect to the number of calls, but a growing community as well.  The population and then the diverse risks that we have to attend to on a day-to-day basis.  We do want to remodel Station 2.  It was built in the early 1960s.  And then look for funding to build a new station in what I call the donut hole or the black hole of the north end of our district or city,  up off of Eaton and Hicks.  And request funding for the new rescue.  It's come to near its end of life,  and we've got to be prepared to do that.  We've got to transition into a newer rig that can handle the demands of the rescue team.  Fund an FTE to maintain our emergency management program.  Unfortunately, this is significantly deficient in our organization.  We just don't have the capacity to put the attention we need to to comprehensively develop plans,  exercise them, and coordinate with all the agencies we need to to make it work, a robust system.  Put into place a comprehensive plan.  We've got to build a comprehensive and robust wellness program.  Expand our education and outreach to the community.  And then finally, look for ways, partnership opportunities for EMS, dispatching, internships,  things that can bolster our department while also engendering a good collaborative ability to collaborate within our community.  And that is the end of my presentation.  Are there any questions?  No.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Welcome Chief.  Good afternoon, Mayor, Vice Mayor, Council.  Thank you for the opportunity.  I believe the police department has the left arm, and if I'm not mistaken, I thought the $8 million man was left handed.  Just a little police fire thing, loosen up the mood a little bit.  First of all, I can't tell you how much I love you.  I can tell you how incredibly proud I am to stand up here as a police chief representing the amazing men and women of the Chico Police Department.  I don't think I have to tell anybody on the dais today what your police department's gone through over the course of the last year.  Yet they continue to rise to the level, providing excellent police service to our community, and I'm incredibly proud of them.  So our mission is to create a safer Chico, improve quality of life, partnering with our community, and providing dedicated service to our community.  I think we do that on a daily basis.  Obviously, your police department is a general fund department and the largest department in the city organization with 168.91.  I think I'm the .91 on the numbers there.  But as you can see, that's our total budget requested and predominantly personnel costs associated with that.  So the police department, obviously, I think we all know what the police department does and has been doing for this past year.  We've been doing a lot of work to support this community over time.  In addition to that, the police department also has animal services.  And so animal services just does a fantastic job providing a service to our community when it comes to our animals.  We all live here in Chico and know how important our animals are to our community.  So they do a fantastic job.  Tracy Moore, the manager of animal services, does just a fantastic job.  There's a list of services that they provide.  Again, their vision is creating a safe community for both people and animals.  Some of their highlights and key achievements from over the 2021 year so far is they've received the $60,000 in grant funding,  which purchased an animal evacuation trailer.  And it also created an on-site surgery suite for them to conduct spay and neuters right on scene at the Chico facility.  So that's great.  In addition, animal shelters.  And so the animal shelters are continuously receiving support from the community.  And they received $32,000 in donations, which help support their medical efforts and animal care.  So this is kind of, as you can tell, a lot of things that we do as a group effort in collaboration.  So you've already heard about this amazing server room.  Definite collaboration and working together for our facility.  As you know, the police department, our staff, and the police department, are doing a lot of work to help.  And our facility has been around a long time.  It's one of the older facilities in the organization.  And so we're trying to get the upgrades to it and get the technology where it needs to be.  So some of the things we saw coming out of that this last year is a new armory.  Certainly the dispatch remodel.  Some of you have got to go in and see the technology there.  Just absolutely amazing.  We created a new records department next door at the Chico Police Department annex, formerly known as the Highway Patrol Building.  It's also created a new security system.  And so we're going to be doing a lot of work on that.  And so we're going to be doing a lot of work on the training room, obviously the server room.  And the thing I'm probably most grateful for is the microwave radio project that Information Systems are currently building.  It's going to get all of your police, fire, public works, and all of your entities with safe radio communications.  Our lives, fire lives, live off that radio.  And so to finally see that and the interoperability that it's going to offer this city to work with,  all of the county and regional partners, is going to be really exciting.  And I think it's going to be fantastic.  So I appreciate the support in that.  Some of our achievements, you know, I just was up here a few meetings ago talking about the Unmanned Aerial System Program,  which are actually funded by your citizens.  But definitely got the project up and going.  So I was proud to do that.  We are currently preparing a presentation for council to talk about the Police Community Advisory Board.  That is my advisory board as a chief.  And I'm really excited at the direction that that's going.  And we hope to have a presentation for you.  To show you what that potentially looks like.  You know, with COVID, there's a whole laundry list of things that when I took the role in August that I had planned to get done.  And really kind of been in more of a stabilization mode.  But we have some really great projects coming ahead, such as our community-oriented policing project.  And we did create our peer support team with a focus on mental and physical wellness.  That's being done.  And we have current members right now receiving that type of training to supply that support to our community.  And we have a lot of staff and personnel.  And then just some of the fun things that we've been involved in.  We hosted a drive-through, toy drive that we partnered this year with Salvation Army.  Able to raise a lot of gifts for underprivileged children in our community.  Really proud to be a part of that.  Again, just some of the programs we continue to work on.  Our Chico Police K9, speaking of animals, is these handlers and these animals are absolutely amazing.  They provide an incredible service to the community.  Not in a small way.  Not only in an enforcement role, but an educational and a community policing role as well.  So we've got that.  And probably one of the things we've really been focused on in looking at the national narrative and what's going on with law enforcement  is our social media and relations team.  And it really is time for your police department to show this community who we are as an organization.  But most importantly, who we are as people, as police officers and community members.  And the more you do that, I think the more...  relationships we're going to build in the community.  And I appreciate the efforts that are going on there.  So again, with council approval, one of the things that I experienced the last few years  was as we went through the recession, trying to keep boots on the ground,  we really, really reduced command level decision makers and took those positions away.  It created a very linear department.  Not a lot of oversight and accountability.  But it's what we needed to do.  As a community.  And as a community, you get through probably a very tough time.  As we've done that, Mark Worm, council, you've been very supportive in recognizing that oversight,  that accountability that needs to be built into the organization.  So we've been able to do that.  And for the first time since I've been at Chico Police Department,  25, 26 years now, we now have full command oversight of the entire organization.  Which means there is a management or executive level that oversees every function of the police department.  Even your support services.  That's really, really important because this is a team effort.  And it's just not cops out on the street 24-7 operation.  So I appreciate the support there.  One of the things we also did in this restructure is seeing and hearing about how important training is.  The level of training and the things that are going to be required coming towards us that we recognize.  As we started out.  And we're well on our way to building an actual training unit.  I'll talk a little bit more of that in the next slide.  But essentially, we put...  sworn oversight of our training unit which encompasses a sergeant right now, administrative assistant.  But we're looking to build that out.  To have our own robust training unit.  So we're not sending people and sending money to people that go to San Diego.  We want to be the host.  We want to be in the region, a leader in training.  And have best practice.  Probably the most important situation for me in this COVID was counsel your ability to unfreeze frozen positions.  That was prudent going into this.  But I just appreciate the fact that luckily we're in a position that we are.  And you were in a position to unfreeze those positions.  So I continue to try to create...  Get those staffing levels up.  Provide excellent police service to the community.  And with that comes a lot of recruitment efforts.  There's no doubt it's a difficult time in law enforcement right now in recruiting.  But for us, we'll continue to lead from the front.  Lead by example.  Knowing that...  There are good men and women out there that want to serve their community.  And we'll be there to accept them when they do.  So a few things that you're going to see on our budget request.  Evidence supervisor.  One of the things we're doing is we're eventually moving evidence system next door.  Evidence system is one of the biggest liabilities that the police department has.  And so to have that supervision and oversight of that, especially as it's moving to a campus next door.  I really know that's...  That's important.  Along with that, evidence clerk.  And certainly two public safety dispatchers.  And then we're requesting additional salary and benefit funding to cover any additional staffing that comes up over the next fiscal year as we see and evaluate where we're at as an organization.  A couple operating budget requests.  You'll see...  One of the things that you see is your information systems is doing such an incredible job overseeing all the technology and all the...  The...  The departments.  We're going to take some of that money that we maintain as per maintenance agreement, move it over to their account.  It's just more appropriate for them to do that.  With us, we have some additional body cam storage fees that are coming our way.  With all the hiring and recruiting that we're doing, we needed to increase our background investigator fund.  So you see that on there.  And one of the things I'm really excited about as we talk about technology is our body cams and our tasers.  We're going to be using them.  One thing that we're going to focus on right now, our body cam, is ourysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysys  the TASER system will recognize that you're deploying a TASER, it'll automatically turn it on,  and then the two will talk to each other for data storage, labeling, dates, times, and everything.  So much more efficient and really starting to focus on providing real valuable tools  when we talk about less lethal use of force, so I'm excited about that.  I continued on, one of the things that council did with the last council was  they had set aside funding specifically for crisis intervention training,  and the goal was to get your police department all to have the 40-hour CIT, crisis intervention training,  and because of that and because of the data that we provided, it also incurred overtime.  That's usually the most expensive part.  Training is backfilling when somebody's not there.  The exciting part about this is when I talked to council,  my goal was to create our own 40-hour CIT commission on post certified course right here.  We're well on our way.  That has been submitted.  We are working with post, and my goal is to have this training done by the end of the year.  In addition to that, I want to be a leading agency and provide that training to other agencies  in the region.  Because we network with them so much, I want to standardize training so we all get the same training,  so we're responding accordingly in the same ways with the same tools and the same thought processes in our head.  So I'm really, really proud of our training staff that are actually building that training  and are going to provide that not only to all your staff that are in the field at the Chico Police Department,  but to other agencies in the county and the region as well.  Would that be a revenue source then if you would train Saipu County?  Or a surrounding agency?  Would we charge them for that?  Potentially.  That's something we've got to work out because it's a post certified course.  And so typically what happens is when you host that, post comes in and says, okay, you're  hosting it.  They'll give you more seats in the class for free.  Well, if we're already doing it, that's something that we're thinking about of how do we do  that to increase our training revenue if we're hosting for other agencies.  So I'll report back when we get a little closer.  Thank you.  And I'll make sure and work that out with post.  But very, very exciting news.  And then one other thing we've been asking for a long time, just haven't been able to get it,  but one of the OSHA requirements for your law enforcement is to have operating gas masks.  They've been obsolete for a long time.  And those could be used in any type of critical incident or even crowd control.  So there's something that as a chief I need to try to get those resources and equipment to them to make sure we're meeting those standards.  So excited about that as well.  With that, that's police department's presentation.  I have take any questions if you have them.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Good afternoon, mayor, vice mayor, and council.  As the community development director, I have the honor and responsibility of overseeing the city's planning, building, housing, code enforcement, and GIS divisions.  So again, apparently we're the bionic ears of the city.  And so I want to show you how this works from a 1980 episode of the Bionic Gears.  I'm a bionic woman.  It's better if we make it look like an accident.  Look out.  Okay.  So I think you'll all agree with this incredibly awesome power.  It's a wonder we even need to have community engagement or public meetings.  So again.  Trying to keep up with Mr. Dowell on the bionic connection here.  So in the interest of time, I'm going to just kind of skip over our admission.  I think you're fairly clear on the functions and work that we do.  The planning division is primarily funded by the private development enterprise fund with support from the general fund.  The housing division in the alternative is solely funded by non-general fund sources including federal housing and urban development funds, the affordable housing fund, and also fees collected.  Total budget request is approximately $3,082,000 with personnel costs representing approximately $1,388,000.  The general fund represents approximately 28% of the operating budget of these two divisions and equates to approximately 1.6 of the city's total general fund operating budget.  Currently, planning and housing have 13 positions.  I want to highlight what you get for that general fund investment.  We utilize it to be directly available to the community every day.  We have planner on day who's available, phone, or walk in at any time.  But there are also council priorities.  There are state mandates as well as the need for regional collaboration.  And I highlight this regularly.  That's that I believe we are still in post-campfire mode.  And the need for coordination and planning with local, state, and federal partners regarding housing and economic development remain top priorities.  So at its core, the planning division seeks to implement the general plan.  And apply the city's development standards to proposed priorities.  And then we have the planning committee.  And the planning committee is the one that is responsible for the planning and planning projects that ultimately help the city meet its jobs and housing needs.  This is done by maintaining the general plan as well as the municipal code.  And then applying those documents to development proposals.  In addition to serving the city council, I think you're aware we serve a number of commissions and boards including the planning commission,  architectural review and historic preservation board, the map advisory committee, the zoning administrator, as well as the newly formed climate action commission.  As you can imagine, this requires significant coordination including agenda management, applicant communication, engagement of all city departments,  board and commission communication, public noticing, community engagement, and ultimately the most important part,  and that's providing an open and transparent decision making process.  For housing, affordable housing is the primary focus.  The city receives funds from the federal department of housing and urban development.  And staff coordinates with affordable housing developers to develop the housing plan.  As well as the management, management, management, management, management, management, management, management, management, management, management, management, management, management, management, management, management, management, management, management, management, management, management, management, management, management, management, management, management, management, management, management, management, management, management, management, management, management, management, management, management, management, management, management, management, management, management, management, management, management, management, management, management, management, management, management, management, management, management, management, management, management, management, management, management, management, management, management, management, management, management, management, management, management, management, management, management, management, management, management, management, management, management, management, management, management, management, management, management, management, management, management, management, management, management, management, management, management, management, management, management, management, management, management, management, management, management, management, management  whether it's staff answering questions from the public,  field crews maintaining city facilities and infrastructure,  or updating 911 dispatch information  for the police and fire.  GIS is also critical in providing information  to our partners like Chico Unified, Cal Water,  PG&E, Census 2020 to support their master planning efforts.  Now I just want to give some highlights  from both planning and housing.  I will highlight, first of all,  the development activity remains extremely high.  And we expect more of the same in the upcoming years.  The demand for both single family  and multi-family housing is strong,  and the first of the city's special planning areas,  the Valleys Edge project,  will be working its way through the entitlement process  and coming to council later this year.  In 2020 alone, there were planning approvals  for 265 single family units, 526 multi-family,  as well as 50 accessory dwelling units.  Long range planning also is at an all time high.  As the department continues  to promote free accessory dwelling unit building plans,  coordinate land use and infrastructure planning  in partnership with Butte County staff  on one of the city's other special planning areas,  the North Chico special planning area.  We maximize community engagement  on the climate action plan update.  We pursue series of, we're pursuing a series  of municipal code and general plan amendments  to streamline housing production.  And the good news is most of this is being done,  maximizing and utilizing state grants up to $600,000.  On another front, the Chapman and Mulberry neighborhoods  were incorporated in the city last year  and a schedule for annexing the four remaining county islands  and ultimately consolidating the city's boundaries  and providing the efficient delivery of city services  is being developed with Butte County LAFCO.  The planning team also seeks to be proactive  in response to ever emerging emergencies.  Most recently through developing temporary  outdoor dining allowances in response to the state's  COVID-19 restrictions that allowed our local businesses  to continue operating under very difficult situations.  So again, there's not much on the slide,  but I'm going to give you a mouthful regarding housing  because they have their hands full.  In addition to ongoing federal and state housing program  implementation and compliance,  there are a number of new highlights on affordable housing.  Due to the Camp Fire, approximately 40 million  in annual federal disaster tax credits were made available  for affordable multi-development in Butte County alone.  We have referred to it as the affordable housing gold rush.  The credits were allocated by the state  and projects could be awarded up to $5 million in credits.  There were seven applications for projects in Chico alone.  I know most of you are aware of the 101 unit Creekside  and the 106 unit North Creek Crossing projects,  which were both linked to the 22 million infill  infrastructure grant the city was awarded  for the Bruce Road improvements.  You've also received updates on the exciting  1297 Park Avenue redevelopment, previously the Jesus Center,  that will provide 58 units for households with special needs.  This will add a new !  In addition to those efforts, four new projects quickly,  very quickly came together and required an all hands on deck  approach from multiple city departments,  housing serving as the lead.  If all those projects received credits,  if all the projects that did receive credits get built  over the next couple of years,  that would equate to a total of 734 new affordable units  being available.  Honestly, this shows me that if money is made available,  affordable units can get built.  Just last week, it was announced that another  $1 million in affordable units would be built in Chico.  Another $17 million in tax credits will be available  for Butte County projects, which again, means more housing.  The Housing Division is also seeking to utilize  other funding sources to assist in additional  affordable housing production.  Due to the Camp Fire, CDBG disaster relief funds  will be available to Chico within the next several months  to be utilized over the next five years.  Chico will be allocated over $32 million  for multifamily projects to serve primarily low  to moderate income housing.  Additionally, it's estimated  that a portion of the $61 million  that Butte County will receive will also be used  within the city limits due to the availability  of our existing infrastructure.  We were also recently informed the city will receive  federal home funds through the American Rescue Plan  legislation in the amount of 1.9 million,  although there are no details at this point  for how those are to be exactly utilized.  Add to that the permanent local housing allocation fund  from the state, which comes from a fee  on all residential real estate transactions,  and we'll see another $390,000 annually allocated to the city.  We'll see that the $390,000 is used to support  is also being allocated annually to be used  to leverage other affordable housing projects.  Another major planning effort is also in full swing,  as we are eight months into the complex  state-required housing element update.  This planning effort requires knowledge  of quickly evolving state requirements,  as well as thoughtful community engagement.  The plan will be coming to the council sometime  in early 2022.  I want to highlight that both for planning and housing  and all the activity I just shared,  we seek to use consultant services to respond  to the peaks and valleys before us.  I've kind of bifurcated this based on our previous  two departments, so I'm now going to speak a little bit  to building and code enforcement.  The building division is entirely funded  by private development, while code enforcement  is primarily funded by the general fund.  The requested $414,000 of general fund equates  to .8% of the total citywide general fund.  Currently, there's 19 positions in those two divisions.  The building division, as many of you know,  is responsible for forming architectural  and structural plan checks and scheduling and performing  building inspections, while code enforcement plays  an important role in maintaining and improving  the community's well-being by responding  to resident concerns and addressing complaints  before they fester into larger problems.  Effective code enforcement not only combats blight,  impacting property values and community identity,  but also supports and enhances quality of life  by maintaining and cultivating a clean, safe environment  and a healthy living and working conditions.  Before I get into the building activity,  I'd like to share some impressive code enforcement stats.  In 2020 alone, there were over 1,800 code cases opened,  including over 540 COVID-related cases.  95% of these cases were closed  based on voluntary compliance.  That incredible volume was accomplished  with just three code enforcement officers  and doesn't acknowledge the incredible  annual community benefits associated  with other larger community-wide benefit programs  like Weed Abatement and Drop and Dash.  Now back to the building division.  From one emergency to the next, building continues to see,  steady growth in both residential  and commercial development,  and seeks to utilize new technology  to keep up with the growing pace.  Staff continues to learn how to better harness the power  of the new online permit tracking system, TrackIt,  which provides real-time project tracking for our customers  and field personnel and streamlines inspections.  Further, digitizing and archiving decades worth  of old hard files will make critical information  more readily available to the community,  as well as expedite the incredible work that's being done.  We've also been able to use the  the sustainable amount of time spent  on public records requests.  You might think that City Hall being closed  might have slowed down development review,  but last year alone, 311 single-family units,  191 multifamily, and 31 commercial structures  were permitted out of the building department,  or division.  As of early April, another 541 multifamily units  were under building review,  and 618 multifamily units were under construction.  I want to provide just a little bit more context here.  Over the past five years alone,  there has been a 45% increase in the number  of new construction building permits issued.  So, what does all this activity tell us?  Well, for me, it means we need more bionic years.  First, we're going to restructure the two  community development departments into a single department,  and I'm bringing on a deputy director slash building official  who will oversee building and code enforcement.  His start date is June 2nd.  I'm also requesting two new positions,  as well as an hourly specialist  that will be working with the City Hall  and a new assignment professional to assist housing  with the significant infusion of affordable housing funding.  We don't want to leave any of the money out there on the table.  The requested code enforcement supervisor  will increase the capacity of the division  and allow for greater proactive enforcement,  which I believe is a clear council priority.  By way of background for GIS,  GIS staffing levels went from two full-time analysts  and one technician  to its present one analyst position,  which represents a 60% decrease in staffing levels.  So, I'm going to be working with the City Hall  and the City Hall's department  Data is only good if it's current and accurate.  Database creation, updating, and quality control  has unquestionably been jeopardized  over the past 10 years.  This concern is shared across all city departments.  It results in reduced efficiency  in the field for city crews,  and it needs to be a priority.  Adding a GIS analyst is an investment  in the city's future, as well as its fiscal well-being.  I'd like to quickly just finish by sharing  that the Community Development Department  has incredibly dedicated and professional staff,  and it's an honor for me to serve among them.  That concludes my presentation.  All right.  Thank you.  We are actually going to take a 10-minute break.  So, appreciate that.  Thank you.  All right.  Here we go.  The left leg?  Right leg?  Looks like the right leg.  All right.  Go for it, right leg.  Thank you, honorable mayor, vice mayor, and council.  It's a pleasure to speak to you tonight,  and my honor to represent the women and men  of Public Works Operations and Maintenance  and present the highlights of the fiscal year  21-22 budget.  So, appreciate the opportunity to speak to you.  Thank you for the opportunity to be here.  Our mission is to maintain safe, reliable,  modern infrastructure and services  for the greater Chico community.  Again, to maintain safe, reliable, modern infrastructure  and services for the greater Chico community.  We have multiple funding sources,  some from general fund,  some capital project funds,  enterprise funds,  airport enterprise fund,  and the sewer enterprise fund,  special revenue funds, such as Chico Maintenance Districts,  and internal services funds.  So, a total budget requested is a little over $19,000.  with total personnel costs a little over $9 million.  Our current number of positions is 79.  So, areas of responsibility.  I kind of like this slide.  It really shows how diverse  Public Works Operations and Maintenance are.  Very wide range of things we maintain  and things we do on a daily basis  and problems we solve.  We kind of consider ourselves problem solvers  in many ways,  and some of the calls we get on a daily basis  surround a lot of problems  and issues that we see out in the right of way.  So, we have fleet facilities, street cleaning,  right of way maintenance, traffic safety,  parks, open spaces, street trees,  storm drain maintenance, sewer collection system,  wastewater treatment plant,  airport operations, and we also support  the Butte Choice Energy Authority and VINA GSA.  Central services provided.  All of our operations and maintenance  services are considered essential.  We kind of have a common theme  of that age old saying  if not us, then who?  And if not now, then when?  So, we have a common theme  and take a lot of pride in that.  So, we'll kind of get right into this  and work through this pretty quickly.  Theme in my presentation,  you'll see some of the highlights  and my colleagues as well,  some of the highlights and accomplishments  that we're proud of this year  and then what this fiscal year  21-22 budget does for us.  So, City Fleet Operations.  Fleet provides asset management  for the City's fleet of 357 vehicles and equipment.  Really, five and a half.  The fleet supervisor is really  gauged to work, or deployed to work  50% admin time and  50% actually turning wrenches.  So, that leaves our fleet ratio  per mechanic about 65 vehicles  per mechanic.  Industry standard is about 40 vehicles per mechanic.  So, we're really at that critical mass point.  We really can't add another fleet  asset without adding mechanic staff.  We've had some critical vacancies  this year too that we've had to navigate through  that presented quite a few challenges, but extremely  proud of our fleet staff and they do a heck of a job  and have done really well maintaining  the City's fleet.  So, of course, we perform maintenance, repairs,  field distribution, procurement, surplus services  and regulatory compliance.  One of the main components of the fleet  division is managing the fleet replacement schedule.  It's Capital Project 533.  One thing I do want to touch on  is this year we had  3.1 million in scheduled needs.  So, we have a very large  asset management system that  estimates when fleet assets  are due for replacement. It's based on a number of  things. Technology, safety,  maintenance costs, so on and so forth.  And so, we constantly manipulate  that asset management system.  And this year, scheduled needs  are 3.1 million and this proposed budget  is 1.7 million. And that's great.  We're very pleased with that. However,  we have some very critical  needs in the next couple of years.  We have two Type 1 fire apparatus  that are scheduled for next year.  They're about 740,000 apiece. We also have  one ladder truck that's scheduled the year after.  And then, of course, multiple patrol cars.  So, we're going to get by this year, but we really need  to focus on fleet replacement in the  coming years. And I really appreciate  Scott's D1 budget  policy because that will go hand in hand with  making sure we have an ample  fleet replacement fund available to meet our needs.  What this budget  does, it hires a dedicated  fleet manager. Years ago,  back in 2015, when we kind of restructured  the public works  department into one large department  consolidated multiple and then kind of  split public works into two arms, or  actually legs, if you will, in this instance.  Engineering  and operations  and maintenance. And part of that  reorganization, I still continue to do  day-to-day fleet manager duties.  And it's to the point where it's just not sustainable anymore.  So, several years we've been really analyzing and looking  at hiring a dedicated fleet manager.  And it's really appropriate to maintain  the city's fleet, this diversity,  the number of fleet vehicles that serve  a citizenry of over  100,000 people. So, we're very excited.  We're excited to have a dedicated fleet manager that will do  those day-to-day activities  that are so crucial to providing fleet services.  Airport. Similarly,  as you know,  the airport manager position was  frozen in the hiring freeze. So, we're really  excited to have that unfrozen and fill  that position not long ago. And  something we're really proud of in the airport  operations is our Taxiway A  reconstruction project.  As you know, we received funding from the  FAA.  We were able to do that last year to do phase two.  However, by the time we received that funding,  it was well into the fall months and we kind of missed the  summer construction schedule.  So, we were cued in the first portion of this  year's construction schedule.  And we recently got word that we were awarded phase three  as well.  So, that's a $6.5 million project that's going on  right now at the airport. And it's a lot of  commotion,  big heavy equipment's operating out there.  It's really fun to see.  We were also able to position the airport  in a way that we received 100%  funding. Typically in our AIP program,  our airport improvement program,  we receive grant funding of 90% for  a lot of these projects that are identified.  And then we have to come up with a 10% local match.  In both of these instances, we were able to  receive 100% funding from the federal  government through the FAA, which saved  about $658,000 in general  fund local match obligations.  So, what  this budget does, it continues the airport  manager position that performs all of  those critical needs on a daily basis.  And one of the things obviously we're going to focus on  is commercial air service pursuit. Before the  COVID pandemic, we're pretty  moving pretty quickly  with a lot of conversations with some commercial  carriers. And then the pandemic hit and  completely changed the aviation  industry. So we're still analyzing  that. It's returning.  Last we looked, flights and capacity are up  about 50% from what they were, but it's rapidly  climbing. So we're going to continue to focus on that.  Really look at our air service revenue  guarantee and really start the community engagement  process. So we're ready once that market returns  and we start to see some  action there.  Facilities.  A lot of people don't know this, but we manage  just about 400,000 square feet  of usable indoor space  with a very  minor crew. And so they do a  fantastic job. Also, a lot  of the airport facilities that are also considered  facilities out there from a brick and mortar  standpoint are under the facilities division.  And there's a lot of collaboration between our airport  staff and our facility staff. Some of the  highlights and accomplishments from this year, we  replaced two large HVAC  units on top of City Hall  and all of the automated controls.  And we've replaced the  City Hall boiler pumps and  we've completed phase two  of Fire Station 1 remodel,  which is the staff living quarters  and common areas Chief Standridge had  mentioned earlier.  What this budget does for facilities,  we're collaborating  with the IT, or IS department  to introduce a mock alert system  at Fire Station 1, which is a  state of the art dispatch  system that will alert staff  there when they receive an appropriate dispatch  call. We're also  completing phase three,  which is the battalion chief quarters depicted  in that top picture at Fire Station  1. And the  phasing of the remodel of Fire Station 1 has been  challenging. And we've  just been able to do  each phase as we have resources  or as resources allow. So  we're looking forward to finalizing  phase three, which is really the living quarters  of Fire Station 1. There will be a minor  phase four, which is the apparatus based up,  but we're really looking forward to finalizing the  living quarters for Fire Station 1. We're conducting  a lot of fiber pools to get ready for  that connectivity discussion that we're having  and really pull our buildings together  to increase the speed and reliability  of our existing internet service.  We're implementing some facilities management software.  We've purchased  a software set called Facilities Dude,  which is really an asset management system,  asset management software,  excuse me, for facilities.  And we just  purchased the base model several years ago,  but we're really looking at expanding that and doing  full facility assessments with  a team of engineers from the  management software company  and really getting full assessments of our  facilities and looking at replacement  funds moving forward. So that's an exciting  add to this budget.  And of course we're in the middle of doing a PD  generator replacement as well.  So some of the objectives in the facilities division  will just continue to make our existing infrastructure  last, modernize  and automate operating systems,  and increase infrastructure resiliency  and business continuity.  Our wastewater treatment plant,  it's always exciting to talk about the wastewater  treatment plant. One of my favorite places  to be in the city.  It's a spot where  centuries old technology  meets modern infrastructure.  So we really enjoy our time out there.  We treat 2.2 billion gallons of water annually,  which equates to about 6 million gallons per day  on average.  Some of the exciting  accomplishments this fiscal year,  we replaced our aeration basin number four,  the final aeration basin  with new diffuser pads.  We're recertifying our  outfall diffuser lease with the state  in Sacramento River. We actually won  project of the year with  Wastewater Digest magazine.  If none of you get  Wastewater Digest magazine, I could set you up  with a subscription. There's some exciting stuff  in there. But yeah, we won  project of the year, which was exciting for our  automatic ammonia control system that we  deployed several years ago, but we continue  to adjust and fine tune it.  Originally it was projected to save about  $130,000 annually in electricity  costs, and we're anywhere  between $200,000 and $300,000 depending on  some of the other variables,  heat, that type of thing. But we're saving between  $200,000 and $300,000 a year on that. So fantastic  project that we've got some recognition for.  What this budget does for the  wastewater treatment plant, we're replacing all of our  PLC-5 units,  which is a lot of automation.  I know you've heard this before, but we run  the wastewater treatment plant with a very lean staffing  model. The only way we're able to get by  doing that is deploying  a lot of automation and technology.  So we're continuing that objective and that effort.  We're replacing our aeration  blowers as part of the PG&E  SST program,  phase one, and we're excited about that.  Which will assist in a targeting savings  of about  $235,000 in that particular portion  of the plant. So exciting stuff  that is going to  produce a cost savings and also reduce  maintenance life cycle costs over the term  of those assets.  What this budget  does, and this is kind of a little sneak peek  to June 1st when we  plan to present and have council  consider phase two of the  PG&E SST program.  We're continuing those efforts and the phase  two component will really have a high level  solar installation plan.  So we're excited to bring that to you, just a sneak peek  of what's to come on June 1st.  The Parks Division,  we manage over 6400  acres of parks and  greenways and open spaces.  And I think everybody's pretty familiar with  exactly what that division does.  Some accomplishments this year where we  got a vegetation management  plan paid for by  a grant and approved by both the Park Commission  and Council. And we're already implementing  some of those projects. We had a great collaboration  yesterday with Chico Fire doing some  prescribed burns in the park.  So a great plan to have in place.  That really gives us a vegetation  management prescription for every single area  of park and open space in the city of  Chico. We're neck deep in the  Upper Park Road project and looking forward  to getting through the environmental review process  there and deploying that soon.  And we also finalized a  10 mile house road fuel reduction  project that did vegetation management  on about 50 feet on either side  of that road all the way down the road from  Highway 32. So  fantastic and real significant vegetation  management plan project that  we were able to accomplish.  So what this  budget does for the park division,  it allocates about $75,000 for goats  and other vegetation management projects and initiatives.  About $327,000  to address a handful of  bank erosion sites on Big Chico Creek.  There's a handful of bank erosion  that's starting to impact infrastructure  both city, university, and  other areas that we're deploying  a plan to help with that.  $108,000 that was  previously approved for the  parking fee implementation infrastructure  and some additional funding to make  repairs to Sycamore Pool along  with a handful of part-time hourly  staff to help augment our services.  And this  slide, what this budget does is  one of my favorite slides because it really  showcases, and we'll see a little bit later too  what this crew does, but  really showcases what the dedicated  three person clean up crew does. So this  budget continues those efforts  and these three staff members have just done  a fantastic job over the last several months.  They've removed 90 tons  of debris from the  City of Chico city limits since  February 1st. 90 tons  are 770 cubic yards.  They're just a fantastic crew.  They're excited to get out there every day  and clean up the city  and they really like what they  do and they're just a great crew to be around. So  extremely pleased and thank the  City Manager's leadership and Council's approval  to get that crew in place. It was  kind of mid-budget but we're excited that this budget  will continue that crew. And they're really a rotating  resource. They not  only pick up debris and trash but they also  augment other Public Works O&M services.  You can see they remove graffiti,  they pick up other items, they do some  vegetation management removal for us. So they  do a lot of items other than  just picking up trash.  The Tree Division, we have  35, a little over  35,000 city owned trees that the  Tree Division manages.  And one accomplishment this  year, we kind of augment  city staff along with a  contractor staff. So we have kind of a  hybrid system. Small city crew  and then we deploy a lot of resources to local  outside contractors for tree  pruning and removals and things like that.  So this year we were able to  reduce our service requests  in the Tree Division down about 15%.  So over 30% of  our O&M service requests are  tree related and that's  down from 45%  just last year and the year before.  This year we completed, excuse me,  a city wide tree inventory  and tree management software upgrade.  We completed a downtown full  grid prune in the downtown corridor.  We kind of took advantage of the  COVID scenario and the COVID  pandemic with unfortunately some of  those local businesses were closed  temporarily so we tried to get in  there as quickly as possible to do  a lot of pruning when traffic was  less and things like that. So we took  advantage of that as best we could.  We completed a Park Avenue-Bulberry  tree management software upgrade  and then we planted 200 trees  with some local non-profits and other  agencies. So 200 trees  were planted this year by and managed  by our city street tree  division. So quite an accomplishment.  So this budget for the Tree Division  it adds about $82,000  of corridor tree maintenance  in Capital Project 503-02.  $45,000  in park trees.  So that's park specific trees inside  Bidwell Park in Capital Project  503-05. And then  $50,000 in increased overall  outside contractor assistance. So again  using a city staff  approach and a contractor approach  the hybrid function really works well for us  and we'll continue those efforts.  So our streets  division. We maintain over  300 miles of streets  and along with those other items  that are listed below that council  is most aware of.  One of the highlights that I'd  like to focus on is our sidewalk  repair project 503-88.  This was initiated  in 2018. It's just been a  fantastic project. We've repaired  a lot of sidewalk around town  specifically that are impacted  by city street trees. So  22,000 square feet has been replaced  since this Capital Project inception in  2018. I think a lot of people  don't know that our municipal code  puts the responsibility  of sidewalk maintenance on the adjacent property.  So we're a property owner like most municipalities.  However, when a city street tree  causes some of those impacts or  damage, we're there to help and do  everything we can with the budget that's allowed.  So it's just been a fantastic project that's yielded  some very positive results and really reduced  our risk and liability some tripping falls  and things of that nature.  We'll continue  our street maintenance project  and we're building that project up to deploy  some surface treatments in residential  neighborhoods. We're aligning with our  pavement management plan which  we're extremely excited about and my colleague  Director Auduboni will probably talk a little bit more  about that. Some exciting stuff that's  coming out of our pavement management plan.  The right people, the right software,  and we're really looking to collaborate  and deploy those efforts in the next couple of years.  Our Traffic Safety Division,  I wanted to highlight this division because they've been  working extremely hard. They manage and maintain  over 4,800 street lights,  107 traffic signals, and  17,000 signs.  And we've really put a lot of  effort into this division  in the last year as far as  striping and thermoplastic striping.  So they've performed and added  striping and upgraded  striping in a lot of our  intersections and pedestrian  areas you can see around town. So they've just  done a fantastic job and I really applaud  their efforts this last year.  One of our other  successes is our retro reflectivity  replacement project, Capital Project  50227.  This is intended to replace old  signs to meet new and upgraded Federal  Highway Administration retro  reflectivity standards. So signs  that, you know, and especially warning  signs that need to be reflective  at night.  And there was some,  quite a bit of regulation and some pretty strict timelines  to get those done. Those timelines have since  relaxed a little bit, but we're well  on our way to completion, about 80%  complete to  exchanging all of the city warning  signs to retro reflectivity  signs.  And then of course our  sewer collection division  that cleans the  sewer collection system annually,  fantastic job and they're nearly 100%  clean. So they've cleaned every  single section of sewer pipe  in the city that's city owned, city main  lines on an annual basis.  So fantastic job by those folks and I also  applaud their efforts.  So what this budget  does for our  traffic divisions  is it's adding a senior maintenance work  worker that's a utilities locator.  And this is crucial for  us, especially in a city of our size.  Historically, we were  not members of USA North, which is  really a clearing house for  all underground utilities  identification processes.  So contractors  would call  USA North, we're not a member so they were  required to make a second call  and call us. And it was just a really irresponsible  approach. So we're really excited to be  now a member of USA North.  And to become a member, we really  had to have a dedicated utilities marker  staff person because we anticipate close  to 4,500 requests annually  to mark underground utilities.  So that person is going to be extremely busy.  We're happy to be a member of  USA North and we look forward  to making sure we're providing that  service to the community and contractors  working in the community to really present,  prevent dig-ins and things like  that to our infrastructure and other infrastructure.  So extremely excited that this  position is being recommended through the  school year 2122 budget.  We're going to continue our support  of the  Vina Groundwater Sustainability  Agency, GSA, along with  the Butte Choice Energy Authority.  Public Works ONM staff and  myself included support both of  those JPAs and we're going to continue that effort  and just wanted to highlight that as one of the things  that we do.  So this is the summary  slide and really that sums up  what this budget does for us.  The largest community impact  for us is going to be staffing.  This budget is adding some  key positions to the Public Works  ONM side of Public Works  and we're extremely excited about it.  A dedicated fleet manager, the senior maintenance worker  that's going to be the utilities locator,  that's going to continue the cleanup crew which has been  a fantastic addition to  our department. And then also some  hourlies. As you can see through some of those  slides there are some hourly dollars that  are for temporary hourly help that are  stopgap measures. Some in facilities, park,  a little bit of park ranger time  and then some traffic safety and signs  to help us complete that retro reflectivity  project. So those are incremental  increases that  are part of the staffing plan that was  presented and accepted by council in  2017 and that quotes directly out of that  staffing plan which is incremental  sustainable growth as budget allows.  So that's our approach,  our objective and we're really  excited to see these staffing  increases in these particular areas  and that concludes my presentation.  I can answer any questions if you're ready.  Any questions?  Thank you.  Mr. Rodemont.  Alright, last but not least.  Thank you very much for your patience  and hanging in there.  The legs are the  strongest part of the body and the foundation  of the body so sorry Chief.  Had to just throw that in there.  The engineering  department provides services and programs  for the management of all things infrastructure.  I'm going to briefly discuss  some of our successes, some of our needs  and issues and then primarily focus  on one of our four divisions,  our capital improvement program.  So I'll kind of shoot through a bunch  of the slides and highlight the projects we're working on.  I'm not going to go into a lot of detail on the other things  we do, there's a whole lot of other things but  obviously in the interest of time we're  going to focus on that capital improvement program  aspect.  Funding wise,  I'm going to  start with the capital improvement program.  We are the largest budget in the city,  oddly enough, mainly because of the capital improvement program.  About $102 million  when we combine our rollover funds with the  newly budgeted dollars.  And then by the time you add in our staffing  and other divisions,  we're about $106 million total  with a short crew, small crew  of about 31 people.  Some of those positions are frozen currently  and unfunded.  So we're really operating about 26 right now.  So lean and mean.  And with that value of budget,  it's really critical that we're efficient  and effective with the utilization  of those funds as good stewards  of our community and our taxpayer base.  These are the divisions that we  utilize.  So we have our traffic division,  our development engineering, sewer and stormwater,  and then again capital improvement program.  I like to showcase this every year,  this depiction.  Again, infrastructure, engineering,  public works is kind of the built environment.  Everything we experience,  it's the sewer and the stormwater facilities  underground, it's the roads,  the street lights,  bike paths,  you name it, everything in our built environment,  the quality of life that we experience in our community,  and I think Chico has a pretty great one,  comes from a lot of our infrastructure  and our background and foundation.  So some of our highlights.  We talked about  the $8 million man  and a lot of the fiscal elements  that the council and our city manager  has been so great at rebuilding  and getting us out of the hole.  I also want to highlight our staff.  Without our staff,  a lot of the layoffs,  and in the engineering department,  I think we had the highest percentage loss  from the 2012 layoffs.  You know, it required staff to wear a lot of hats.  A lot of people that had institutional knowledge  and they've been able to help weather the storm  and provide service, even if it's not  through those reduced staffing models.  So I also give a lot of kudos to our team.  I'm so proud of the things we do.  The people in the community don't always see it,  but they're coming in early, they're staying late,  they're working weekends,  they're doing whatever it takes,  and I couldn't be more proud of being a part of that team.  So thank you all.  I want to highlight also one of our new hires  this last year  as part of us building our team back as well.  Deputy Director David Gianco  was just notified  of being the APWA,  the American Public Works Association  Manager of the Year,  only being here 10 months, so pretty proud of that.  And he'll be collecting that award  this coming Saturday down in Folsom.  So something to highlight  and be proud of.  What we utilize  in the funding for our  CIP program, again we've been able to secure  about $96 million in grants  over the last six years.  So that's been able to get us leverage  and get projects completed  that would not have otherwise been able to  get completed.  Some of our 2020 highlights from last year  in construction, we expended  $16.94 million in construction projects.  That was the highest  dollar amount that the City of Chico  had ever done.  We hire local contractors, so that's local jobs,  then they buy materials  and equipment from local vendors  and businesses, so it's an  additional investment in circulation of funding  in our community that gets circulated.  In order to do so,  we've had to really rely on  consulting expenditures.  So last year alone, we spent $3.9 million  in consulting services.  So you saw the previous slide, that's about  equivalent to what our entire department is.  You can see the previous years here,  so that's about double about what we've been  doing on average.  And we expect to have another high year  this year with an estimated  construction, that's the  construction cost being about $29 million.  So I'll talk about that a little bit more here.  Some other highlights  that we anticipate working on here,  as you are aware, we submitted two  projects  in the engineering department through the  federal funding earmark program that  Congressman LaMalfa, and two of our  projects were actually selected. So one was  the South Gate interchange to fund the EIR  process, and the other was  the P18 sewer trunkline  in the southeast part of Chico.  That was about an $8 million  request to fund sewer to serve  future needs down in the south  part of Chico for future development.  Other opportunities that we see  for grants coming up is the  long term campfire recovery,  so a lot of work continues to go on behind the scenes  there, and the community development  block grant disaster recovery  infrastructure category, it's a mouthful,  is going to be coming out this summer,  so we're going to be very aggressive on  furthering our success in the grants  and getting money to build the  infrastructure that's needed to continue  to build housing units and infrastructure  needed to support that effort.  Some of our issues,  recruitment and retention  continues to be something we struggle with.  We've had several  recruitments that have gone on  for multiple years, and so  we've also lost about 10% of our  staff over the last year and a half  to other local agencies, so  you already heard the  numbers that we've had and  decreased, but we're trying to build that back.  And so that continues to be something  that we struggle with, and  we're going to continue to work with them.  and limits our ability to do projects  and provide service,  as well as the funding that we work in,  because we're not general fund department,  we work within restricted funding sources,  so we rely on development fees  to pay for the services provided,  we rely on certain other restricted  funding sources for capital projects,  like grants that are project specific,  gas tax, state transportation funds,  things like that.  And also, our concerns and issues  that are known in the public here is the  roadway maintenance funding, our PCI,  our pavement condition index is a 48,  that's the bottom 25% of California.  And so we continue to evaluate that,  we're looking at innovative and  collaborative ways of  more efficient use of our dollars to  extend the life of our pavement  and get that PCI up, and so  we'll be seeing some things roll out this year  on that front. The sewer enterprise,  zero dollars allocated towards  pipeline replacement.  We've got some pipes that are in the ground  that were installed in 1903.  And that's concerning.  And so that is something we are going to be  evaluating here.  Coming in May, we'll be going to the  finance committee to present  some policy directives  relating to the sewer enterprise, and then following that  later in this year, we'll be coming forward to  the finance committee and then council  to evaluate and analyze  our sewer enterprise rates.  So again, trying to move  quickly here through the 2021 projects  that the community can expect.  We just opened  bids for the Eaton  Road Highway 99 off-ramp project.  So the bid amount was  4.75 million dollars to a local  contractor, Knife River Construction.  We're working through the contract right now,  but we anticipate starting construction around  July 1st. It's going to be a very  impactful traffic control  with moving traffic  through the construction zone.  So we'll be doing some outreach to the community,  and giving them a heads up.  But this will be a huge improvement. You can see the picture  on the left here.  Traffic regularly backs up  onto the freeway, creating pretty significant  safety concerns. So this will help  improve that circulation and  safety.  Our 2021 road rehab project is  Park Avenue. So we  also opened bids  last month, and  the low bid was also Knife River Construction  on that project. That's a 2.15 million  dollar project. And we  have the contract in place,  and we will be starting construction around  June 1st here.  So that will be rehabbing the  pavement section, but then also restriping  a tad center turn lanes,  and bike lanes along the corridor  in lieu of the existing  on-street parking.  Marsh Junior High safety improvements.  We opened bids  last month as well on this, and  this is a traffic signal at the intersection  of Humboldt Road and Notre Dame Boulevard.  slash El Monte.  As well as some pedestrian  improvements from the  Little Chico Creek bike path over to  Marsh Junior High. So we coordinated with  Chico Unified School District  to get kids safely across the  street there with a rapid flashing beacon.  There's a student hit on a bicycle  several years ago, so the traffic signal  will provide a traffic control  device and safety measures to ensure  kids can safely get in and around  school there  with the vehicular traffic of parents driving.  So we're dropping kids off.  You can also see as part of this project  we paved the bike path  slash sidewalk along  Humboldt Road to connect to Bruce Road.  We coordinated with our maintenance folks  so we could do that cost effectively as well.  The traffic signal  and the crossing are expected  to start mid-June  once school gets out.  Cactus Avenue traffic signal.  We actually just opened bids.  As you can see, our budget  was $450,000 for the entire project.  $100,000 of that would require  construction management.  The low bid came in at $550,000.  The second bid that we received  was $900,000, I believe.  So we will be  putting that on the shelf  and rebidding that this winter  and hopefully get a better price.  The Infill Infrastructure Grant  Roadway. So this is the first phase  really of the Bruce Road corridor project.  And this is the blue line  on that map on the left that will connect  Bruce Road over to Notre Dame Boulevard  creating the frontage improvements  and access to the two main  affordable housing projects.  The Creekside Place and the  North Creek Crossings projects.  So we've coordinated with the Marion Park Development  and we just put that out to bid yesterday.  And that will hopefully  with opening bids,  hopefully within our  estimates,  would go to construction starting August 1st.  Next is the big one.  Cohasset Road widening.  So we received the $13.3 million  EDA grant this last  year and we finalized  plans. We actually just got approval  today from EDA  on putting this project out to bid.  So that will go out to bid tomorrow. We'll do about  a five week advertisement.  If all goes as planned, we'll be starting in early  August for construction work there.  It's widening Cohasset Road  out to the airport from two lanes to four lanes.  Utilizing the  roller compacted concrete technology.  Doing storm drainage improvements.  You can see on the right hand side there.  That is a storm drain pipe that  floated down the roadside drainage ditch.  So we'll be undergrounding all the  drainage features, adding lighting  and landscaping and doing that widening  and safer access to  the airport  facilities really at  Airpark Boulevard and Boeing Avenue that do not  currently have left turn lanes.  The city  wide systemic safety improvements is  approximately 60 locations  doing improvements. Striping,  rapid flashing beacons,  traffic signal improvements.  I think the biggest  highlight here is on the right hand side.  Part of it is  wayfinding signage for the downtown.  So you can see we've put up at  3rd and Broadway  what we anticipate to do that are lighted  signs. So we're going to be able to pay for these  lighted signs in the entire downtown area  with this grant.  Again at night it will be lit up.  There will be a much better  aesthetic and improvement for signage  and wayfinding in downtown.  The airport  bike path bridge was burned down last  year. It was an old railroad  rail tie  structure. So we are  working on permitting right now. We've purchased  the bridge on the right hand side there.  So we'll be putting that out to bid here in  the coming month or so.  And hopefully constructing that towards  the end of the summer.  Last  I think is the highlight.  We are working, we've been working on this for  several years this concept with this budget.  We intend on  implementing a downtown  plaza ice skating rink.  And so  the concept would be to  be able to invest in the initial  capital and through  sponsorships and operating costs  we can recover those funds.  But this is a really exciting opportunity  to change downtown.  Bring people to downtown for an event  and something that we should be proud of.  So we're excited to see this  rolling out and be able to pull the  trigger on getting the company that  will provide the ice skating rink  this summer.  We're shooting for a November time frame  to then open it up as we get more  details on that.  So those are this year's  projects. Active projects that are going to be coming up  in the near future. As you know Bruce Road  widening. It's going to be widening Bruce Road  from two lanes to four lanes. Plus  a major 12 foot wide class one  bike path with its own dedicated  lighting. So we're working  through that. We hope to obtain  all our permits  by the end of the year and  if everything goes as planned we would be  getting construction next year. Obviously  there's some pending litigation  on that front.  Another grant funded project  is our Little Chico Creek pedestrian bridge  at Community Park. So this will add a  bike path bridge  over Little Chico Creek on the west side  of 99. Connected  to the north part of  Community Park.  Then there's an under crossing there at  Highway 99 and that will connect to  Bikeway 99.  If you don't know this area, the 20th Street Park  area  and the Chapman Mulberry neighborhood  their junior high is actually  Marsh Junior High. So this will  allow kids that live  in that area to also get  safely across  Little Chico Creek and up  the Little Chico Creek bike path  to school as well. So it kind of marries  the other Marsh Junior High improvements we were doing.  Floral Avenue and Eaton Road  roundabout. We're in design right now  on that and coordinating with the  development projects around this area.  So we expect to hopefully begin  construction there in 2022 as well.  Highway 32 widening  phase 3. This would go from El Monte  all the way east to  Yosemite Drive.  We're working through final  environmental and design  components with Caltrans.  We do not have the construction funding  identified currently. So the timeline  is kind of to be determined based on  funding. And again this will be a  highly competitive project in my opinion  for the CDBG-DR  infrastructure funds this  summer. Especially as it  ties to the several  affordable housing projects at the Oak Valley  development there.  Bikeway 99 phase 5.  So again this was another  active transportation program grant.  Working through our right of way  now and finalizing the  design with an expected  bid time of summer  to fall 2022 but likely  beginning construction physically  in probably 2023 at this point.  Our escalating safety and accessibility  improvements. Another grant funded project  through the active transportation program.  Working through the design  right now we just had to request an  extension of time which was approved  through the California Transportation Commission.  And estimate  completion of design and  right of way  in order to begin construction  in the spring of 2023.  The southeast  Chico sewer trunk line. So you can see at the  bottom here the blue line which is  P17B through  P18 lines  is what we are  requesting funding through the  Congressman LaMalfa earmarks.  So again  to another opportunity potentially if that's  not come through to look at the  CDBGDR infrastructure components.  Another one that we are working on that will  come back to council  is the Hagen Lane Congestion Relief  Project.  So we utilize  with the council direction some of the  campfire recovery funds  to look at this project  and look at different  circulation and transportation connections.  And so it's kind of a two pronged approach  of intersection improvements and  circulation improvements but also  a new connection from Park East Park  Avenue to Otterson Drive.  So we'll be coming back to council  I hope later this year  early part of next year with some  concepts and requesting direction  from the council on that project.  Obviously Hagen Lane Business  Park is one of our major  business components of the city  that and the airport area.  So it's important that we improve these circulation  elements and set the table  for successful business.  Salem Street Bridge  replacement is a highway bridge  program project to widen the structure  that is currently functionally obsolete.  Similar to the Gwynn Avenue Bridge  replacement  and the Pomona Avenue Bridge replacement.  So these three projects are all highway  bridge program funded. That program  is underfunded. We're working on  design right now and environmental.  Once we get through those  we will have to work with  Caltrans local assistance  on timing for construction funding.  Because they've had over  $400 million in requests I believe  but only have about $200 million in the program.  So they're constrained.  So we're trying to get through these preliminary  engineering phases and hopefully  tee it up so we can build these projects.  Parkwood Drive  Sewer came from  several requests  of these homes off  of East A Street to install  sewer. So we've created the design  with this budget. We will have the  construction costs funded and hopefully  allow these folks that have failing septic  systems to hook up to the city sewer.  Southgate Interchange  again this was one of the other  Congressman LaMalfa  earmark projects and  this is the extent of the interchange.  Multiple phases is going to be a  long term project but the next  steps is doing an EIR  and evaluating the different  options and connections there.  And then phasing it out to build the improvements  and phases. So a lot of that's to  be determined depending on what occurs with  the funding and our EIR.  In active projects I'll just leave you with this.  I think trying to highlight the fact that  we've got a ton of projects we're working on.  We're really constrained and there's a lot of other needs  that we continue to work on in the city.  And so with this budget we're getting a third  project manager in order to manage these  consultant contracts and see these projects  from you know  from inception to fruition.  Managing the consultants on the cost,  scope and schedule and making sure they stay  on the same level.  our timelines to get these projects delivered  for the community. So with that I conclude  my presentation and I'm available for any questions.  Thank you.  That was very informative.  Any questions?  Alright, thank you.  Okay, well I'd just like to take a minute  to thank all of our staff members.  You all did an amazing job.  And you're quite the troopers too for hanging  out here with us so long and  enjoying the afternoon.  And of course  thank you to the project manager for heading  this up and putting it together.  We appreciate all your efforts and  thank you everybody.  So with that we'll take some public  comment at this time.  Madam Clerk, how many speakers do we have  on this budget item?  I believe we have three.  Okay.  And the first one is  Ruth Sarnoff.  Alright.  Let me get it.  We would ask you just to speak on the  budget at this time if you're looking  to speak and you're wearing a mask  and you can come down to the front.  So Ruth Sarnoff.  I think we're out of water in California  and most of the West and  in a good part of the world.  And laying a lot of concrete  and building  and using both concrete  and water  and other materials  is not really a path  for sustainability.  I think we're out of water  is what is really important.  And I guess  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  sent this water assessment and I also gave it to the clerk and I think maybe she got  it to you earlier. I don't know if you've had a chance to see it yet. But there's a  lot of ways that you get information. One of the things that you might start watching  is on the side of your newspaper here. It tells you the level of the lakes.  Ms. Sarnoff, we have to stay on topic of the budget.  This is the topic because you have a budget that's enormous and it's all about what you're  going to do and what you're going to do requires water and cement and I'm telling you there's  no water. Lake Almodor is like a lake.  It's almost like a mud puddle and all the lakes are down. It's like 42%, 38%, 52% but  Feather River, all the tributaries, we're one system. If you don't believe we're on  a globe and you don't believe that water is primary for life and we're the biggest mammal  on the planet, then I'm sorry.  But, this is not an off-topic subject. There's nowhere in here that you have abided by the  California Environmental Quality Act or done any EIRs for, I don't think, anywhere for  a hundred years, to be honest with you, and you're dealing with a document that's a hundred  years old.  And, I think you all know that, and I tell you, you all know that, and you all know  I've talked about it, I've gotten information out,  and if you don't read your emails, I'm sorry.  But you have a water crisis,  so you want to approve all this stuff?  Thank you for your time.  Nothing worse than a project is a half-done project.  So, Council, I just want to again mention  that we're not in compliance with the Brown Act  when we allow someone to speak on a topic  that is, she wasn't on topic,  and I just want to bring that to your attention  because if other citizens see that  and then we tell them they can't,  I believe we may have some issues.  However, it's up to the Council if you want to waive,  well, that's the Brown Act, so you really can't waive it.  Mary Murphy, followed by Jessica Giannola.  All right.  Good afternoon.  I'm mainly concerned about,  I had heard about the unfunded liabilities  in the last Council's meetings,  and there's numbers being tossed around,  140 million that are supposed to be paid  for that we don't have in the budgets,  and then there was possibilities of bonds being taken care of.  Now there was some discussion of that  and recognition of that,  but when I look at the budget that you guys put out,  whoever that was,  I just want to make sure that,  so in this year, we've already paid a million dollars for it,  and how far out does that go?  Because you were looking at $140 million,  is what somebody said, if I heard that right,  and correct me if I'm wrong.  How far out does that go?  So we won't answer your questions.  We can't do that with each individual speaker,  so we just ask you to speak.  Okay, so I would like it to be,  you know, at least acknowledge that there's a huge amount  of unfunded liability,  and that that needs to be really taken into account, and in turn,  in terms of the funding that, you know, I'm sorry,  I tried to read as much of the budget as I could,  and it seemed to have been changed from the numbers  that were put up on the screens today,  so I think that that should be looked at.  I mean, I thank everybody for putting together the numbers,  but they need to be the same as what we're looking at  and what we're giving as citizens,  because it's really our money,  and that we're asking you guys all to manage it,  and you guys to manage it, so they need to be accurate.  So there's several, you know, I guess I can't ask a question  because you can't answer it, is what you're saying to me.  So I really would like those numbers to be accurate  when they're brought to the public,  and how can I discuss it,  or how am I supposed to discuss it with you guys  if there's questions?  If I, I don't know how to ask the questions  if I'm not allowed to ask the questions.  So can you help me?  You can bring it up during,  so by making the point here, that could,  in change, we could look and talk to our city staff about it,  but you could also reach out to whoever your elected  council member is for your area as well.  And then can we actually ask the city  whoever made the budget?  Because I'm really concerned,  because it looks like you guys are going to just go ahead  and say yes to this,  and I hope that there's going to be discussion.  You can absolutely send us an email,  and we can direct it to staff,  and make sure that that gets copied back to you.  And then we also have the public meetings coming on June 3rd,  was it?  June 8th, for more on this.  So will those discussions be like this,  in terms of not being out there,  you can find answers?  Or is it, how's that going to work?  Same way, on June 8th,  So we won't be able to ask questions.  We won't be able to get questions answered,  is what you're saying.  Well, he's going to go, go ahead, Mr. Dell.  So June 8th, we will have an open forum  where you can certainly ask any questions  related to the pensions.  It'll be open, staff will be there,  we will have consultants that are there to do that.  So that would be a great place  to bring these questions forward.  Is that just only for pensions,  or there's a ton of stuff in here that's problematic?  Well, we would follow the protocol  that's been discussed here by your city council member,  and they can get an email,  and then they can get in contact  with the appropriate staff.  Okay, great, thank you very much.  Thank you.  Jessica Giannola is our last speaker.  Hi, council.  With the budget, I'm surprised that our housing crisis  of unhoused on our streets wasn't mentioned  in any of the planning and budgeting for resolutions.  I heard mention of the CBDG funds,  which is for low to mid-income families,  and that's like starting at 24,000 up to 52,000.  And the people in the encampments, they're not making that.  So great that we have in a couple years  some affordable units coming,  that's great.  But I'd like to hear the budget,  how we're addressing our immediate needs.  Other cities who are and are doing their budgeting right now  and including it, be like LA, San Francisco, Sacramento,  they've all massively increased their budgeting  for the homeless crisis.  Sacramento went from two million from two years ago  to 110 million.  That's how much they are committed to helping the resolution.  And that could be with any number of things  that we'll discuss on other items.  But for me, it was just concerning  that our budgeting is being made now,  and proposals will be made now,  and that wasn't one of them.  So if that's something that can still be discussed  or talked about using these other cities as examples,  we have lots of models going now  because it's a universal issue across the United States  that would really help.  All of us.  Let's see if there's anything else  I wanted to say up there.  I just wanted to point out,  when I was looking at the CBDG funds,  like eligibility and what it's for,  and it does describe, it says,  for our most vulnerable populations.  So just keeping that in mind  when we're using these funds  or talking about these funds,  who are we targeting?  We wanna apply it as best we can across the board  so we're not leaving anyone out.  Which exacerbates our spending  and makes our funds tighter in other areas,  how we could do prevention-based  instead of trying to clean them after the fact.  So I think that's it for budget.  Thank you.  Thank you.  So that was it for the comments on the budget.  All right, thank you.  All right, so item B is resolution adopting  its 2021-2022 proposed budget.  So we'll move to item C, resolution.  Yep, this is just to proceed with the proposed budget.  Staff will be bringing back a final budget for adoption  at the first meeting in June.  So if there are any modifications, any thoughts,  any ideas that you would like to see modified in here,  staff would love to hear those now.  Realizing that there are still a couple of items left,  what we can do is see if there's any time this evening  to finish those up.  If not, we're gonna go ahead and get those on a future agenda  for those other items.  But as it relates to this one,  this is just be adopting the draft.  And give any feedback that you might have  for any changes that you would suggest.  All right, thank you.  Council.  Is that a nod?  Yeah, it's a nod.  Go ahead, Mr. Warren.  So Skipper, I think it's something  that we could all use some help with.  So how many total,  I don't expect you to answer these things right now.  How many total new positions requested?  How many, if any, can be outsourced, saving on pensions?  And then this is the real question.  How do we balance increasingly,  and this is not me criticizing.  How do we balance increasingly loud calls for raises  versus requests for new positions  versus requests for infrastructure?  And it's almost like you and your staff  have been victims of your own success.  I was here in 2012.  And we saw that original number of the minus 5 million  and where it is now, it's just amazing.  I don't think another city could have done.  And it took the fortitude.  It took the fortitude of the staff  and different councils to do it.  And so we've come a long way.  And we know we've got people that have been  without cost of living raises for a long time.  But at the same time,  there is, as a number of the directors pointed out,  multiple people are wearing multiple hats  and they're doing the job of two or three people,  yourself included.  How do we balance that?  How do we lessen the impact for that?  And then still, and we know we have retention issues  in almost every department,  but we know that we're not going to be able to do it  without the help of the county police.  And I think Eric and Brendan both talked about it.  So we're going to need some help doing that.  I don't even expect you to answer,  but if you can kind of take that under advisement  and I don't know, give us something.  Yep. Think about it every night.  So, and be happy to put something comprehensive together  that will enable this council to understand that  when I bring this back,  because that's the best question that can be asked every day.  How can we better utilize the private sector  to supplement government use?  If there is a way to leverage that,  how can we ensure that our employees  are paid competitive market rates?  So we aren't losing quality employees to cities,  minuscule in size to us that we continue to see.  And then how do you get rid of that pension obligation  responsibility when the vast majority is already in place  based upon people who are already retired  and or about to retire?  Those are huge questions.  And I'll be happy to answer that.  I'm happy to speak to those when I bring this back.  Thank you.  I appreciate it.  All right. Any further questions?  All right. You need a motion?  And a...  I'll make a motion adopting the resolution  for the 2021-2022 proposed budget.  I have a motion and a second.  Any comment?  All right.  Madam Clerk, can you take the roll?  It looks like you're only approving  Public Works Engineering Department.  I just want you to know,  it really applies to the whole process.  And the adoption of the resolution.  So Councilmember Brown?  Aye.  Councilmember Denley?  Aye.  Councilmember Huber?  Yes.  Councilmember Morgan?  Aye.  Councilmember Tandon?  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds?  Aye.  Mayor Coolidge?  Aye.  Carries 7-0.  Thank you very much.  All right. And I know we have a stop at five,  but obviously we're going to go past that  until we clear off this initial agenda as the plan.  Yes.  Well, I respect this council so greatly  that I think you may need to eat.  So we can look, and I spoke with the chief already.  I've spoke with the deputy city manager.  I haven't spoke to the city clerk  because she's busy working back there.  But these items,  we can see if we have time this evening to put them in.  If not, we'll get them on a future agenda  and make sure we're able to get through that.  I just don't know about Debbie's.  Debbie can speak to hers.  Well, I think that the confirmation of some  of those appointees do need to happen  so that the meetings can be attended.  But it would be entirely up to the council  if you'd like to wait on that.  Is that a fairly quick item?  Can we just knock it out?  I think so, if the council's okay with that.  Do it.  All right.  So we will temporarily table item C and D.  Move on to item E,  confirmation of amendment to council committee assignments  and overviews of the committees.  Madam Clerk.  Okay.  Thank you, Mayor Coolidge and council.  And I'll make this very, very brief.  As you'll recall,  the council appointees to the various committees,  whether internal or external,  whether that's a board, an agency, or a group,  occurs every December in the even-numbered year,  after the new council gets seated.  From time to time, there's schedule changes.  You guys are very, very busy people.  In addition, there are, I believe,  26 different boards and committees  that you all take part of and serve on,  in addition to coming to council meetings.  So the changes needed at this meeting  will be confirmation of the following mayor's appointments.  And that would be for the Butte County Homeless Continuum  of Care.  So,ysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysys  would ask council to consider confirming the mayor's appointments.  In addition, I did provide in the staff report an overview  of the various boards and commissions, not boards and commissions, but the  boards and agencies that you all serve on.  Just open it up for any discussion.  You can see from the list that there's a lot of time given to  a lot of different agencies. In addition, I did  provide an overview of internal affairs, what the role is, as well as  finance committee. I'll just turn it over to the council if you have any  questions about that information or any direction you want to provide  me. Then at the end of it, if the council could vote to confirm your appointments,  that would be great.  For the Butte Choice Energy Authority, is this  an appointment of an alternate to fill  the law?  I would probably have to ask  Director Gustafson on the Butte Choice Energy Authority.  Is this the replacement for former council member  Schwab? That one was not on  our original list, so it didn't get carried over and get filled.  I have no problem with this, but previously  we did that by motion of the council as a whole. It was not a mayor's  appointee. That was when it was first created because we weren't doing the  mayor's appointments, but that fell to this list.  That makes sense. Thank you.  I had a similar question on the same topic. The balance of the participants  from the council and that committee remain the same. We're only adding,  and I guess this is for you, Mr. Gustafson, we're only adding or  changing the alternate?  For the Butte Choice Energy? Yes. I believe it's the alternate.  So still two council members serving on the board? Correct. Yes. And one alternate?  It's the alternate, yeah. Thank you.  All right. Any other questions?  Comments? Do we have any speakers?  Yes. Let's see. I think Ruth Sarnoff  wanted to say something.  Do you want to speak on this item?  Come on down. And this is in regards to the confirmation of the committee assignments.  I was  I was  I was  asking before, and I think this is  on a different  committee than  than the commissions, which  I had  a problem with because  I was interested in being  on the airport commission.  I have strong feelings about it.  Yeah, this is just in regard to  the Butte County Homeless Continuum  of Care, the Butte Choice Energy  Authority, and the  VINA GSA.  Okay.  So are those the ones that are under E here?  Is that what you're telling me?  Correct.  Okay. So  It doesn't then take any other committees.  Okay. I will  I will  I will  That's actually on a different meeting.  I will have to stick to it at another time.  I find the format and the  is this feeling that everything is very in-house.  There's a lot of nepotism in this committee.  I'm not sure if I'm doing this right.  So, you know,  have it spoken on the topic. But next meeting we are speaking on the airport commission.  Good. Thank you. Thank you. And I would like to  just let the council know that I did do a revised listing  that you have in front of you. It is different from the one that was included in the staff report.  So when you make those appointments, it's reflected of what I said and also  the new revised form. Alright. And that was the only  public speaker, correct? Correct. I do have one more question. Sure.  Just literally just a housekeeping item. We've gotten  several emails from one concerned person.  Actually a couple about the time and date of the finance committee meetings and the lack  of availability of recordings, either audio recordings  or video recordings of those meetings. I just want to check  in about it because I know that that person, some folks have  a specific interest in those meetings, but they're at an inconvenient time.  I will happily answer that question.  I'm sorry that I can't move the finance committee meeting to fit into  every citizen's schedule. I'd love to. As far as recording  the finance committees, we've never recorded finance  committee meetings. Ever. They've always been at the same time they have  been. I've chaired the finance committee twice and I've been on it for six  years. Been the same time the whole time. Sorry that's inconvenient.  We did start going to Zoom because of COVID.  So the  particular person I believe you're talking about is upset that we're not recording  the Zoom meetings, which we do have the capability of doing. The problem is as soon as COVID  is over, this is going to be our last finance committee meeting that is via Zoom.  And then we're going to go back to the old way. And if we recorded just one, same citizen  would be going, why'd you stop recording the finance committee meetings? You guys are trying  to cover stuff up. So we are only doing everything we've always done. And that's  the only way we're going to continue to do it.  Thank you for that impassioned response.  I just wanted to, for the public record, I know that. I had a feeling.  But I appreciate it.  All right. Any other questions or comments by the council? I'm going to entertain a motion.  Move to approve the new assignment.  I have a second by Council Member Dunley.  Madam Clerk, you take the roll.  Council Member Brown. Aye. Council Member Dinley. Aye.  Council Member Huber. Yes. Council Member Morgan. Yes.  Council Member Tandon. Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds. Aye. Mayor Coolidge. Aye.  Carry 7-0. All right. And then with that, we will  recess until 6 o'clock when we'll come back and  do an entire council meeting. Thank you so much to staff. I really appreciate  your time. What's happening?  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  This is a continuation of the same meeting.  So for members of the public just joining us,  we are actually continuing from our prior budget review since 1 o'clock.  So be kind to all of us because we've been here since 1,  and we'll be here until later.  Funny things tend to happen on the day-long budget sessions.  Anyway, so we're going to move back into session here.  And actually because we're not able to have our police chaplain here this afternoon,  we're going to ask him to stand up and give us the invocation now.  Police Chaplain Hanson, if you would approach.  Thank you, Mr. Mayor.  Let us pray.  O great and loving Father, we thank you for the city of Chico.  Its natural beauty.  The goodness of its citizens.  Our proximity to field and stream.  To mountain and meadow.  To endless rows of trees and their cool shade.  For the wisdom of our city founders in planning them.  And also planning communities of faith and places of learning.  A good city to raise a family in safety.  And to live abundantly good lives.  In the aftermath of a year of...  Health crisis, we thank you.  For the many who gratefully survived.  The advancements in medicine.  And the care we took with each other.  We bless these men and women who freely give their time for the consideration of matters affecting us all.  And ask that you might instill in them true and deep wisdom.  A listening heart.  A careful consideration of people's lives and futures.  Above all, we praise you for our freedom.  And our life.  Without which nothing can be done.  Nothing would avail.  But you give us these in abundance.  And with this we praise forever.  Your most holy name.  Amen.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  Alright, so we will continue and move on to item two.  Which is the consent agenda.  The consent agenda is for those items.  Routine in nature.  And can be therefore enacted in one motion.  And do we have any speakers on the consent agenda?  Yes, we have one.  And that's Ruth Sarnoff.  Ruth, we'd ask that you have a mask on too.  If you speak at the podium.  Sorry.  Sorry.  Show your face.  Show your face.  Show your face.  Show your face.  Thank you for that.  My adjourned agenda only goes at the bottom here, too.  Are we on administrative services?  Actually, we're on the consent agenda,  which is approval of the supplemental budget appropriation,  and then also amending section 2R-0450.  You got my remarks earlier about the lack of water here,  and...  I did a homemade audit of the water situation here.  Ruth, we just need you to speak to these two items.  I just wanted to say that I presented that in the last session.  All right. Thank you.  And we're out of water.  All right. Do we have any other speakers? No?  All right. Any council disqualifications or no votes?  All right. Entertain a motion.  Move to approve.  Second.  A motion and a second.  Madam Clerk, when you're ready.  Okay.  Council Member Brown.  Aye.  Council Member Denley.  Aye.  Council Member Huber.  Yes.  Council Member Morgan is absent for a moment.  Council Member Tandon.  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds.  Yes.  Mayor Coolidge.  Aye.  Carries 6-0 with one absence.  All right.  We'll move on to business from the floor.  Anyone wishing to address the council on this item should complete a speaker card that can be found at the back of the room and turned into the city clerk.  This is the time for members of the public to address the council on matters not listed on the agenda,  with comments being limited to three minutes.  Or as determined by me, based on the number of speakers,  the council cannot take any action at this meeting on requests made under this section of the agenda.  Madam Clerk, how many speakers do we have?  Let's see.  We have nine.  Nine?  Okay.  Three minutes.  Okay.  Ruth Sarnoff is first, followed by Carla.  Okay, Ruth.  And this is the time, your three minutes, to say anything you please.  Thank you, sir.  You know, it takes a lot of people working together to expose a system,  that has been in place for 100 years, which is basically rolling the numbers forward,  and never having an environmental impact report,  never having any EIRs,  never having a town or city plan.  I found out that a town,  is not only a small place, there's also a township.  And townships are 36 square miles, and you got a checkerboard of them here.  And you can find Chico right in the middle with a nice little blue dot on your weather map.  And then you can see all the little townships, and that's where all of the construction,  and pollution, and damage to the environment is going on.  And if we keep,  um,  laying concrete,  and we keep doing these high tech things,  and if we keep drilling in the ocean,  and we keep bringing it on land to refine it,  and we run that train with all that diesel smoke coming right through,  our depot right here,  you can see it, and it winds all the time,  carrying oil, or natural gas, liquefied natural gas,  all that is destroying the environment.  Um,  and,  I'm hoping that,  um,  that I could,  uh,  influence you to look at some of the beauty in what is a dying thing in the ocean,  which is most of the coral is gone.  The Great Barrier Reef is not anything like it was.  And,  maybe if you could learn to love those people,  those,  um,  fish,  and the,  and the wonderful forests that are coming out of the bottom of the ocean,  and what's left of it,  it's,  it's really,  um,  it's really a global problem.  And it's hurting the,  the poorest people,  and the black people,  and brown people,  and native peoples,  and Asian people,  and all the people,  that have had to function on the edges of society.  If that's what you want your legacy to be,  is to keep building all these things,  a lot of which are connected to war,  and the war budgets,  which are huge for past,  present,  and future wars,  because we're still building weapons,  and we're still building places for weapons to fly from.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Carla, followed by Lori Harris.  Is there Carla?  So Lori Harris?  All right, Robin Engle?  Several weeks ago,  you asked for several weeks more to negotiate,  regarding our housing crisis.  And what you've done since then is,  on the same weekend,  Mother's Day weekend,  you shut,  closed off,  locked off the public bathrooms,  and the plaza,  without any notice,  without communicating to public works.  The park ranger who was there to help clean up,  did not even know why the bathrooms were locked.  He wasn't given a reason.  At the same time,  the water shut down at Comanche Creek,  where over 100 people are struggling to survive.  You have not remedied this situation.  Any one of us could die after three days of no water.  Three days.  You can do a quick Google search.  That's what I just did.  We cannot survive beyond three days with no water.  I believe this is intentional.  If it's not intentional,  why haven't you remedied this problem?  If you're concerned about fire,  why don't you accept a mere trash bin  to collect items  and keep them from blowing in the wind  and being flammable  and easily causing fire?  If you're really wanting to negotiate,  why haven't you offered to?  One square inch of land  for, for example,  sanctioned camping  costs virtually nothing.  And that land would need to have toileting,  it would need to have running water,  it would need to have public accessibility,  public transportation,  so people can be involved with downtown activities.  And you're showing not only  absolutely no willingness to negotiate,  you're showing a continued,  and implicating a continued genocide  on hundreds of people in Chico.  There are 5,000 people who are victims  of the housing crisis throughout Butte County.  Over 2,000 of those are students.  Your continued killing of our people  is not going unnoticed by us.  We're not deluded by any bionic body parts  and wonderful looking,  wonderful looking housing  that you're going to bring into this region  that doesn't distract us from the matter at hand,  which is that you,  the city of Chico,  minus Alex Brand and Scott Huber,  are killing your constituents  merely because they have no money  and you don't want to see them anymore.  Stop the genocide.  Okay, Diana Dress,  followed by Jessica Giannullaf.  Jessica Giannullaf.  Okay, hi Council.  Hey, hey,  Hey, hey,  Hey, hey,  Hey, hey,  Hey, hey,  Hey, hey,  Really, I can't express my gratitude enough  about the Zoom process.  It was so impactful from my point of view  with the community coming together  without having to interact,  but it's a stepping stone.  And I've just seen it as such a positive step forward  for us, all of us.  So like with Comanche Creek,  we have people who are gathering there  because we don't have anywhere else  for them to go right now.  And we have members from the community stepping in.  They're trying to help them survive right now  while we figure out what are we going to do.  We have people from AMFA out there.  We have Haven at Hope helping with showers  and laundry once a week.  I mean, if you can imagine a shower once a week,  it's pretty, like, that's like so low and hard  for people's morale.  Food, we have food sometimes coming out,  but it's not every day.  It's not regular.  So people are still food hungry.  This is just the conditions that people are living with.  And before they had Comanche Creek,  they were out more in the bushes  and camping.  They were out camping areas that they've created  without even that help.  So right now they're going to step forward  as the community comes together.  But we really need to have this city  to complete that piece.  And I know that we have a conservative majority.  And conservative just means that more fiscally.  Not willing to spend money  where we might not have to.  I know my husband, he's a Republican.  So we have these conversations.  And so I try to understand  where the mindset's coming from  where we don't want to put out this,  we don't want to step forward  because something bad could happen  and it'll be a big snowball effect.  But we do need to have this deep politicized  and more community.  And it's a survival thing.  The camps are like refugee camps.  I was out there last week  and there was no water.  And a little girl, she's four years old,  she comes running up.  I'm standing by the faucet  because I'm waiting for the food delivery to come.  I'm going to help.  She comes running to get some water  and it was off because there was a broken pipe.  But they have no other way of getting it.  Plus, people don't have vehicles or funds.  They're really depending on all of us.  So whatever happens moving forward,  I just hope that we can come together enough,  even if it's a majority enough,  to decide on a place,  decide on something so we can move forward  so we're not staying here and getting worse.  Because if we do nothing, we get worse.  Crime does go up.  Sadness, poverty, that gets worse.  We have to do something.  So I hope those conversations do happen  between the council.  And I applaud.  The effort's going forward.  Thank you.  Okay.  I have a card that was turned in  that does not have a name on it.  Followed by David Peterson.  Go ahead, David, if you'd like.  I think you had the card in the back, correct?  Yeah, in the back.  So you did turn...  Was that Sasha?  Okay, I'm sorry.  So I'll go ahead.  Yeah, if you could sit down.  I apologize.  So go ahead.  Is that Diane?  It's not there.  Okay.  So just a few comments.  I understand that we got about $27 million  from CARES Act funds.  I'm assuming that's correct.  That's coming into the city  or has already come in.  And I just say that year after year,  Chico's done next to nothing  for the crazy housing problem  that we have here,  including homeless populations as well  to just low income.  And every year claiming,  we don't have funds.  There's no funds that exist  to take care of this issue.  Well, now we have some funds.  Now we have those funds.  And every single department in Chico  has also got their eyes on those funds.  Every department.  And I understand.  Every department has needs.  However,  the homeless and the pre-existing  housing problem  goes back and back and back.  And every year,  it's like we don't have money for that.  We have money now.  We have money.  That $27 million,  before anybody takes that money  for anything,  the homeless issue  and the housing crunch issue  should be addressed first and foremost  before all these other departments  who would just love to have a new toy,  or a new technology,  or a new staff,  or more pension,  or higher salaries,  or an increase in a budget of any kind.  It's all well and good,  but the housing situation  has a long history.  It hasn't been addressed.  And always under,  we don't have funding.  We can't do this.  It's just Chico.  We inherited this problem.  Well, now it's not an inherited problem.  It's a real problem  that's a longstanding,  standing problem  and has to get addressed.  We have money now.  So instead of just buying  a bunch of new toys  and new technology,  let's take care of the issue  that's been going on year after year  with the claims  that we don't have money.  Let's deal with it.  Because a lot of you people up here  are very well taken care of.  And I understand that,  and I think you should be.  I think we should all be well taken care of.  Everybody should be taken care of.  But it shouldn't be,  you know,  certain groups,  a group gets taken care of  while another group is not.  That is not correct,  and that's not right.  So I would say that.  I also would say  I was very excited to hear  about addressing  a shortfall of infrastructure  and Scott Dowd talking about  trying to address  some of the infrastructure  for fiber optics  in the Chapman area.  I think it's fantastic.  I think it should be looked into.  And start the process  of seeing if that's some way  to generate revenue  for the city, in fact.  And I think that would be  a great way to help  provide a service  as well as generate some revenue.  So thank you.  So David Peterson,  followed by Diana Dress.  Good evening, Council.  David Peterson,  your current cannabis business applicant.  Last meeting,  some discussion was made  and a motion was made  that would certainly,  could certainly change  the current ordinance,  regulation, resolution.  So before a decision is made  upcoming on the June 1st meeting,  I'd like for everyone  to potentially just  consider a few things.  The overall goal of the pause  was to codify  a direct revenue source.  The licensed retail businesses  would certainly capture  that revenue  from the general public.  So we're going to miss out on  that are being spent  by patrons currently  in and around Chico, right?  So there's people spending money  on these type of industry products  currently in Chico  and around Chico.  They're just using  either the black market  or they're traveling  to different areas  and buying it  from retail storefronts  or delivery services  that operate outside of Chico.  So establishing those businesses  will certainly capture revenue  from those sales.  Great.  That's what we want.  What we're going to miss out on  is the other three businesses.  So manufacturing,  distribution,  and testing.  These three businesses  will capture  a little bit of revenue  being spent within the city,  but primarily  they're going to do business  with licensed cannabis businesses  outside of the area  and throughout the whole state.  So those three businesses  will capture revenue  from sales made  with businesses  down in L.A.  and San Francisco,  Sacramento,  Oakland,  where there's a very large  industry retail demand  for these products.  So that's one thing.  Also, the higher the tax,  the higher the fee,  the higher the retail price.  So at some point,  that burden of fee  and percentages and taxes  and all that stuff  gets shifted  to the in-state retail price.  This does not equal  more revenue,  higher revenue.  I think Mr. Morgan  mentioned it  during the last meeting, actually.  This will actually just drive up  that retail sale point price  and  encourage people  just to go back  to the black market  or travel back  to those areas  they're currently getting  their products from  and buy it from there.  So we'll be missing out on that.  Last but not least,  the number of dispensaries.  So we're talking about  reducing it from  four to three.  Obviously, this is  concerning to me  as an applicant.  This literally reduces  my chance  of being selected  by 25%.  That's a pretty big number.  I didn't consider that  while drafting  my application  or certainly  didn't consider that  while telling my wife  this was a good idea.  So please consider  we're maybe either  keeping it at the same.  I think the state  recommends like  17,000, 19,000 population-ish  to one dispensary.  And I think Chico  just surpassed  the 100,000 population.  So we should be  at five dispensaries.  Maybe just leave it at one  or leave it at four.  Thanks.  Diana Dress  followed by Jeff Creed.  I've been bringing  my concerns to this council  for weeks.  First, we need to open  the Chico City Council  to everyone  without restriction.  Second, we need to quote our law, When this body follows unlawful mandates and coerces others, such as employees and businesses, to follow them, we lose the way our law body is supposed to function. I ask you to cease and desist immediately.  our law,  our law,  cease and desist immediately.  I'm concerned because  this board appears to be breaking  the Brown Act, our Constitution,  and our very way of life,  broken the law by enforcing  unlawful mandates,  forced businesses to close  to an irreparable harm and damage,  changed the way local  government works, excludes  its constituents from their own  needy, broken their oath  to the Constitution, and broken  the public's trust.  I ask that you call a press conference  to address these issues and  clearly communicate to all citizens  they are free and equal  and allowed to resume  all activities without  unlawful threat.  I have submitted my review  of the laws. I'm requesting  this board, code enforcement,  and anyone else requiring  compliance of these protocols  with the threat of citations,  contacting government  agencies, fake misdemeanors,  legal action, etc.  to cease and desist.  We should  never harass hard-working,  law-abiding businesses  and threaten them with legal action,  fake misdemeanors,  citations,  notifying state government  agencies, and fines for the  audacity of them feeding their families  and encouraged tattletaling  on friends, neighbors,  and better yet,  public health.  We are not competitors.  Causing division within our community  is harming us.  Stop now.  Okay, Jeff Crean.  I guess that person doesn't know  there's a doctor somewhere in Butte County  who made that decision and not you guys,  so I appreciate you following the law.  In the past, I've been  pretty critical of  management around here and I thought I would bring up  some specifics  tonight. I was going to use  the 2019  homeless cattle herd as a good  example of the lack of management.  So when I set out to do anything,  whether it be go on a trip  or go to the grocery store, I usually look at  four things.  What are my objectives? What's my plan?  What's the execution? And what can be my  measurement of success, failure, or somewhere  in between? So when we've  looked at what happened starting in January,  the objectives were never really clearly  quantified.  There was something about Chico being  cleaner and no campers in the parks,  but even after Lower Bidwell was  cleared, there was still a camp in the cleared area  for over two weeks.  So possible objectives that you could  have quantified would be no camps citywide,  no camps in parks, no camps in parks  or waterways, zone camping  like some other cities are looking at,  or camp wherever you want and routinely  chase them like you chase them out  and chase them around like Chico's done  for the last however many years.  So the objectives,  there was no good objective.  So the plan, the plan  I was told and  kind of seemed coherent with what I saw  was chase a bunch of people around  like cattle until  some get tired of it and  leave the city and then we'll try and coax  the others into some sort of  shelter. That's not  a real plan. That's just kind of a  let's try and do what we've been doing and  waste time.  That plan wasn't quantified  with time. There was no completion date.  There was no  like  communication of what that enforcement  surge would look like when it ended  and what the sustainment enforcement would look like  because we didn't have an objective to  fall back to. To say that  we're going to transition from surge enforcement  to  prolonged sustainment enforcement  when we meet these goals.  So the plan falls apart based on  the lack of objectives.  And you know it almost seems  like the plan was set up to  draw a lawsuit and kind of  wonder why the city lawyer  didn't see the lawsuit coming and take  steps to prevent it.  So then we have the execution of the plan.  The execution of the plan.  We started with a big dog and pony  show, displaced a bunch of campers,  chased them around the city, chased them  to places out of sight.  And you know that's  where we drew the lawsuit. Now that they're  out of sight.  Out of mind.  The public discord's down.  And we have what the city wanted all along.  Maybe.  Evaluation.  You've got no clear objectives,  no good plan,  and a botched execution.  You can't be held accountable for your failed.  So who creates a plan that you can't measure  success and claim success when you achieve it?  Okay.  Jeff was our last speaker.  All right.  Okay.  We'll move on to item four, public hearings.  Item 4.1, hearing on resolution declaring  weeds, rubbish, refuse, and debris to be a public nuisance,  ordering abatement and removal, and setting a deadline  for abatement and providing assessment of the cost  of abatement.  Charlene?  Hello?  Hello.  Welcome.  I'm Charlene Durkin with Code Enforcement.  Good evening, mayor, council members.  As you will recall, I'm a member of the  council on the April 26th council meeting.  You adopted a resolution declaring weeds, rubbish, refuse, and debris to be a public  nuisance, which must be abated.  After the April meeting, a notice regarding the hearing was mailed to property owners.  Tonight, staff recommends adoption of the resolution before you, which overrules any  objections to the previously adopted resolution.  Establishes Tuesday, June 1st.  2021 as the last day for voluntary abatement.  Direct staff to ensure the abatement of any items that are not voluntarily removed.  Maintain an accounting of the costs that are associated with this effort and to provide  council with a report of the costs that are to be recovered from property owners at the  June 6th city council meeting.  All right.  Any questions?  No?  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right.  At this point in time, we'll open the public hearing.  And do we have any speakers?  Yes. Yes, Ruth Sarnoff. All right. Ruth. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.   ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  My first question really is, what was the purpose of having this resolution?  Who was it directed to?  And who's being hurt by this, and who's being helped?  I ask repeatedly that there be some context for these agenda items, and it's not being heard.  It's not that hard to say we're talking about the people who are still in their cars or a van in Paradise,  or whether we're talking about...  people that are homeless somewhere, or whether it's to try to create a sense of...  Somehow it's the public's responsibility to meet all social needs, whether they're...  Ms. Sarnoff, this is about weed removal on people's property.  Huh?  This is about weed removal on people's property.  Which people?  The people that...  People who own property.  Well, I can tell you that all along Esplanade forever, I've tried to get people with property  to have to clean their private property to clean their lots.  And that means dry grass, and for, I don't know, for years I've been asking for goats who eat the roots out  and who don't...  caused fires and are much cheaper than every single kind of institutional response every time we have a fire up here.  And the dark smoke is not good for people.  And somehow or other, there needs to be an opportunity to have open discussion about the environmental issues here  and...  California and in the world.  And I sent  a letter  yesterday  to the council  that I got off at about  6 o'clock last  night because I just couldn't get it done  any earlier. And I basically  have brought to you  today, and if you want it  somebody will have to speak to it,  but I brought you  some DVDs  about  the beauty  of coral and the beauty  of nature and the beauty  of  so much in the environment.  And if you would like  to have them and be  exposed to that,  I'm welcome.  We need to make sure when you speak, Ruth,  if I may,  when you speak, you have to speak  on the topic.  Well, the topic is not...  It can't be slightly on the topic.  It has to be entirely  on the topic.  The topic is not on here.  The topic is...  I think anybody that doesn't go to meetings all the time  will tell you the topic is not on here.  Ma'am, the topic is clearly printed on the agenda.  So each of these items  that you come up on speak on,  you have to speak on the exact item.  So you have to speak to...  Well, you've done things for a long time  your way, and a lot of people  out there think that that's going to happen.  Unfortunately, that's the way the law dictates it.  It must be done or we'll be in violation  of the Brown Act.  Chico is the only city out there.  No, this is not true.  Every city does it this way.  Thank you.  Alright, thank you, Ruth.  Alright.  Any other speakers, Madam Clerk?  No.  Alright, so we will close the public hearing.  And what's the will of the council?  Thank you.  Do we have a motion and a second?  Now I'm clear.  Council Member Brown?  Aye.  Council Member Denley? Aye.  Council Member Huber? Yes.  Council Member Morgan? Yes.  Council Member Tandon? Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds? Yes.  Mayor Coolidge? Aye.  Carry 7-0.  Alright, item 4.2.  Hearing to consider the 2021-2022  annual action plan for the use of  Federal Community Development Block Grant, CTGB.  CDBG, and Home Investment Partnership  grant, Home Funds.  This is the Mirror.  Nope, hello.  Hey, Jeff, go ahead.  Um, I have a PowerPoint, if I can bring it up.  It's just a short one.  Okay. Good evening, Mayor, Vice Mayor, and Council Members. I'm Mary Jo Alonzo, Housing Specialist,  and I'm before you tonight to present the final 2021-2022 Annual Plan for Public Hearing  as required for the use of federal funds from the Department of Housing and Urban Development,  which we refer to as HUD.  As you know, the city is an entitlement city whereby funds are annually allocated by a formula  based upon a number of demographic and socioeconomic factors.  The funds assist the city in addressing the needs of low-income households and neighborhoods in our community.  Every five years, a consolidated plan is developed with broad goals to be achieved over the subsequent five years.  The priority needs identified in the 20-14 plan include affordable housing, homeless prevention, homeless services,  neighborhood revitalization, and economic development.  This annual plan represents the second year of the currently adopted consolidated plan.  Chief Showys, Chief  The City was notified late last week that their CDBG allocation for next year will be  revised from the earlier notification and the City will actually receive an additional  $13,408 in CDBG funds.  Of that addition, staff proposes allocating $2,682 for program administration.  This is to meet the 20% allowable set aside and proposes allocating the remaining $10,776  for the Habitat Wisconsin project.  The total CDBG allocation shown on this is now $923,294 and the home allocations stay  the same as you saw when we came to Council.  At the meeting, we had a motion to approve the $2,680.  The meeting on April 26th.  The annual action plan was drafted by staff based on projects, activities, and goals established  in both the City's federal consolidated plan and the City's housing element, which satisfies  state priorities.  As detailed in the budget, and that's attachment C, a lion's share of the CDBG in home funding  is going toward affordable housing projects, two of which are located on City-owned land  and have been in the pipeline for development for several years.  The city has a vested interest in continuing the funding for these projects and activities.  The draft annual plan has been available for public review and comment since April 15,  and, as of today, staff has received three public comments in support of the plan.  And, in conclusion, the Community Development Director recommends that you consider any  additional public comment received during today's meeting.  tonight's hearing and approve the NO plan  and authorize its submittal to HUD.  This concludes my report and Maria and I are happy  to answer any questions that you may have.  Questions from council?  Okay, no questions.  Correct, no questions?  Okay, no questions, thank you.  All right, so we will open the public hearing.  And Madam Clerk, do we have any speakers?  We have one, Ruth Sarnoff.  All right, she said she'd pass.  Okay.  So we will go ahead and close the public hearing.  Will the council?  I'd like to make a motion to approve the plan  and authorize its submittal.  Second.  A motion and a second, Madam Clerk, take the call.  Council Member Brown?  Aye.  Council Member Denley?  No.  No.  Council Member Huber?  Yes.  Council Member Morgan?  Yes.  Council Member Tandon?  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds?  Aye.  Mayor Coolidge?  Aye.  Carries 6-1.  All right.  Okay, moving on to the regular agenda.  Amendment to the False Fire Alarm Ordinance.  And we have a report from Chief Standridge.  Welcome, Chief.  Mayor, Vice Mayor, Councilman.  Good evening, members.  Good evening.  I bring a recommendation to change the False Fire Alarm Ordinance,  or Code 5.41, to reflect that the original ordinance as passed in 2018  used a boilerplate language that exempted State of California,  United States, and other political subdivisions from the enforcement of the  enforcement of false fire alarms.  This was brought to our attention here recently by a user fire alarm systems.  So we want to rectify this to apply the false fire alarm ordinance,  or the code, to all entities and all business owners, facility owners,  so it's evenly applied to provide as high a level of safety as possible to  occupants and residents.  So my recommendation is to make the recommended changes.  And I'm done with my report.  And if you have any questions.  All right.  Questions?  Mr. Huber.  Thank you, Chief.  Oh, did you want to?  Were you?  OK.  Yes.  So a large part of this report deals with CSU Chico.  What level of contact have we had with the University, and do they have a position on,  um,  the multiple fire alarms that have been set off on the University,  and any sort of plan to change that?  Prior to my arrival, the administration worked with the University,  presented the issues that were created by the false fire alarms,  and started to do an education campaign.  When I arrived here, we worked with the town of Gallaudet.  We did a presentation with the apartment.  We had the department owners on the sit, on the campus itself,  the Chamber of Commerce, and other venues as well,  to communicate this out.  Since that time, none of the recommended changes that they had indicated that they were going to make,  they have not made.  And since then, the false fire alarms have actually increased from 2016-17 of the original report  to 2019, which had 282 false fire alarms.  And that's a lot of false alarms, which accounts for about 39% of all false fire alarms for that year.  All right, Council Member Brown.  Yeah, I actually saw an article prior to the meeting where University Communications commented on this particular item,  and they said that they do, their understanding is they're not legally required to pay these fees.  Is it simply because they're not, that's not written into the policy?  Is it as it's currently written?  Or is there something else related to that?  So the University Communications meeting indicated that they had two arguments against the application of the fees.  The first one was the language in the ordinance code itself, which we're rectifying today.  The other one is an argument of statute that would, they claim they're exempt from.  And I would defer to the attorney for specifics behind that.  I would defer to the attorney for specifics behind that particular statute and his assessment.  Mr. Earing, do you have an assessment at this time?  I do.  I do.  The area of, is occupied by the state.  The state fire code is adopted by many cities, both general and charter cities.  Chico is a charter city.  So if you have an area that's occupied by the state,  it is not lawful to charge the state for fees and so forth.  I'll give you an example by analogy.  The state fire marshal carries out the duties of the fire marshal pursuant to state statute.  Those fees are passed to cities, both charter and general law cities,  for those inspection duties that the fire marshal carries out.  The cities cannot object to the payment of those fees.  They're typically paid by departments and so forth for the fire inspection services,  such as sprinklers, alarms, and so forth in different buildings.  And that happens throughout the state.  So my view on that is it's an area occupied by the state.  And it's something that, it's a fair argument to say that the fees of Chico may not be applicable to a state entity.  Okay.  So we would make changes to our current ordinance,  try to get those fees and probably be in the same position that we're currently in?  Is that what I'm hearing?  Could you repeat? I couldn't hear you.  We would pass this ordinance, try to get any fees that we may have lost out on,  and then possibly or probably be in the same position that we're currently in this evening?  We could be.  I mean, depending on the action that you take, I'm happy to take a closer look at the issue.  Okay.  I'm happy to chat with Cal State University Chico on their position and their general counsel.  Sure.  At this point, you know, you have an ordinance before you.  What you choose to do with it tonight is up to you.  Got it.  Thank you for the input.  I do have a few more questions if you'll humor me.  Just for the good of the public, why is the fire department responding to all of the alarms that go off on University housing?  Because a fire alarm represents an emergency.  And until we arrive on scene and determine that it's a false alarm, we treat it as if it's an actual emergency requiring response.  And why is that different from when an alarm goes off in my house because I burnt my food?  Because you're not a monitoring system.  So it doesn't go to a monitoring company unless somebody were to walk by, hear your house alarms going off, and called it in.  Or you as a resident called it in and had us come out there.  So we make a differentiation between a commercial facility that has a monitoring system,  and a monitored system, in which case they call automatically for our services.  Is Chico State required by the state fire marshal to have a monitored system?  That I couldn't tell you.  I'd have that research happen and can get back to you as well.  You mentioned some work that the fire department had done prior to your arrival to resolve the issue of false fire alarms.  Can you kind of expound on that work?  It sounds like you did some presentations in the halls and there was a town and gown meeting where you did a presentation.  So prior to me getting here, the staff that was working on this had met with the university,  spoke to them about some simple remedies.  And it's important to realize that we have no authority on university campus property to enforce our code or our ordinance.  So we're bound by whatever the fire marshal, state fire marshal dictates is the issue that they want to resolve.  So we don't have any authority.  We don't have any ability to leverage the false fire alarm to compel and get the building owners, facility owners to fix the problem.  And because the university is such a user of this particular issue, we have nothing else to leverage.  This is one way that we potentially can do that.  You mentioned the amount of alarms that have gone off.  Do you have a dollar amount that equates to what would be owed to us?  Yes.  As a result of that?  No.  And I want to be clear.  Our goal is not to collect the fees.  Our goal is to fix the problem.  Okay.  And most of the time what we'd like to do is work with the facility owner to create a solution that works for both of us.  Sure.  And then that way we create a partnership in this risk reduction model rather than penalize them.  But it's the only way we have to actually compel them to fix the system so that they're proactive versus reactive.  So we make this change to the policy today.  It's written into our code.  You have an option now to engage this entity that is, according to our code, in violation of it.  And your end goal would be to continue the conversations that started prior or to instituting this policy?  So the university contacted me in 2018 as well.  We talked through it then.  I was still intent on pushing this through and to make it uniform across our community.  Not exempting anybody.  And because of the number of false fire alarms that exist in the university, it creates a hazard not only for the residents because we have false fire alarms that are going off that are indicating a problem with the system or the users of the system.  That also creates a risk for the responding crews in the community because we are going lights and sirens with the assumption that is an emergency that needs attending to.  So we don't.  Okay.  So we don't just arbitrarily say it's a false alarm because we may have been there one, two times today, last week, whatever the case may be.  We go to inspect or investigate to ensure there isn't a problem.  Sometimes these problems can manifest and the system worked as it was supposed to and there was an issue that actually was a reasonable or appropriate mechanism for tripping the fire alarm.  Thank you for letting me grill you a little bit on this.  That's okay.  Some of my reasoning behind it is it feels a little bit hasty to do this.  There have been many years of proactive discussions with the university.  We have a very good relationship.  And I want to be clear.  This is not pointing out the university.  This is an application across all entities.  So we ensure that everybody is following the same code that everybody else is required to do.  That don't fall out with the system.  And we do not want to have any issues outside this ordinance.  Okay.  And just to reiterate, your end game is to use this to initiate that conversation so that you can find some solutions to these.  Correct.  And ultimately, if they aren't compelled to make the changes, then we go to the next level, which would be a nuisance alarm.  And there are some legal remedies that we can go from there as well.  And that doesn't contradict with what Mr. Ewing just shared with us?  That would be.  If they were legally permissible to fall under this ordinance, yes.  We could pursue the nuisance ordinance or that nuisance clause in the ordinance itself.  Thank you, Chief.  I appreciate it.  All right, Chief.  I've got a couple of questions.  Okay.  So this is generally in the apartments, correct?  Mostly, yes.  On the ward?  Yes.  Those would be.  And when I was on the council prior, we had this brought before us.  Same issue.  Generally, from my understanding is those smoke alarms go off at the sign of anything and trigger the call to action.  So, if you're in a building, you're going to have to call an alarm.  So, someone burns their toast or something maybe a little more serious, a pizza in the oven, and then you guys have to roll to respond.  My concern is we're rolling city resources that may be used somewhere else.  I'm sure this is your concern, too.  It is.  And it's just ridiculous.  I mean, you've got to roll the resources.  You can't just assume they're crying woof.  You have to go every time somebody cries woof.  Correct.  So, I understand that.  I would think that the university would understand that, too.  And I know their system, obviously, something has to be done in those apartment units.  I don't think it's just an education of don't burn your pizza in the oven.  I was a college student.  I burned my pizza in the oven all the time.  So, you know, I think we can get past this, but they have to redo their system in some way that makes more sense.  And those were the discussions prior to my arrival as well.  Yeah.  So, I would say two-pronged approach here.  We pass this.  We get a little more teeth.  We open up some discussions with the university.  Maybe through the city manager and Gail just talking at that level and try to work through this would be my thought.  Hopefully, they'll realize that this dangers their students in the parking lot.  It dangers the citizens in our community.  It risks other citizens who might be getting help later.  So, all right.  I would just add that we're doing a lot of talking about Chico State University,  but there's tons of other business owners, myself included, that also have to pay this fine and an alarm fine.  If my employees accidentally set off my alarm and everywhere else.  So, this is not a targeted thing at the university.  I just want to make sure that this is clear.  This is a citywide ordinance that would apply to everybody.  And I have discretion and I have taken into account when somebody disputes and look at the narrative  and make sure that we weren't missing something based on the code that it was applied to.  So, we do use quite a bit of discretion when it's disputed.  All right.  Any other questions for the chief?  All right.  Public comment?  Madam Clerk?  We have one speaker, Ruth Sarnoff.  Ruth, do you want to talk about fire alarms?  No?  Okay.  Okay.  All right.  So, we will close the public hearing.  Will the council?  And I'd make a motion that we pass an ordinance of the city council of the city of Chico, California,  amending chapter 5.41 to the title five of the Chico Municipal Code.  And I'm going to ask the council to pass an ordinance of the city council of Chico, California,  amending chapter 5.41 to the title five of the Chico Municipal Code, relating the regulation  of fire alarm systems, as well as asking city staff to reach out to university staff in  an attempt to maybe solve this issue for the long term.  Second?  The motion is second.  Madam Clerk?  Council Member Brown?  I am in a vote no, but I do want to thank you for your presentation.  I understand that the position that the fire department is in, and I think it's very valid.  I just think that some communication between then and now was maybe skipped with the university  that I would have preferred to have occurred so that they had an opportunity to comment  and, you know, maybe those solutions could have been identified prior to this.  So, I am in a vote no today.  Council Member Dinling?  Aye.  Council Member Huber?  Yes.  Council Member Morgan?  Yes.  Council Member Tandon?  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds?  Aye.  Mayor Coolidge?  Aye.  Carries 6-1.  All right.  Um, discussion on alternative uses for CDBG, BG, that's, CV, funding, it's been a long  day.  All right, that is the meeting on 4-6, Councilquote 5, 2, pursuant to a motion by Council Member  Dinley to hold the discussion about alternative uses for this funding.  Council Member Dinley, do you have anything, oh, we, sorry, I, no, it wasn't noted, fire  department.  Good evening, Mayor, Vice Mayor, and Council Members.  Before I start, could you give me control  so I can, I have a couple little things to show you.  Okay.  Okay, Council requested a discussion of possible uses  of the Community Development Block Grant Coronavirus,  or CDBG-CV.  And staff has compiled a report of available funds  and possible feasible uses.  As you know, these funds are a special allocation related  to the CARES Act passed by Congress  with specific requirements that they be used to prevent,  prepare for, and respond to the Coronavirus.  They are also subject to a duplication of benefits review,  meaning that the funds can't be used to pay costs  if another source of funding is identified to pay those costs.  Aside from these requirements,  the Department of Health and Human Services  has also provided a report  and Human Services to make sure that the general rules  and regulations of the regular CDBG program apply,  though there have been a few waivers,  including those regarding noticing requirements  and lifting of caps on expenditures  for public services activities.  Funds must predominantly benefit low  and moderate income people,  and are encouraged to be used for activities,  projects that can be initiated quickly and efficiently.  Use for these funds must be identified  and submitted to HUD via an annual action plan amendment,  or amendments, by mid-August of this year.  The City has been allocated CDBG-CV funds  for a total of approximately $1.6 million,  as shown on here.  Scroll up.  And as you can see on the chart,  127,000 was dispersed in May of 2020  through an approved amendment  to our fiscal year 2019 HUD annual action plan.  These funds went for public services,  for Meals on Wheels, CHAT, Catalyst,  the Peg Taylor Center, and True North Housing Alliance,  to respond to the effects of coronavirus.  Administration funds have been reserved,  leaving available balance of $866,146.  So CHAT, excuse me,  SAM has identified some feasible projects  that could be proposed,  and CHAT brought forward in a plan amendment  as early as June 1,  should you choose to do that.  These are the top,  sorry, this is kind of funky.  So here are the possible near-term activities  that we've identified that could be,  basically they're already activities in action right now.  They are identified organizations that have proven  that they can utilize these funds and are able,  have capacity,  to do the requirements for submission of reporting, et cetera.  They are the Small Business Development Center,  which could provide economic or micro-business assistance,  could expand capacity for them to assist additional folks  who have been hit by the coronavirus,  their businesses have been affected by the coronavirus.  Transitional Housing Assistance Program through CHAT.  This would expand the master levy of the housing assistance  program to provide transitional housing for individuals  and families and case management services.  And then an additional item could be  temporary shelter hygiene services,  like the Haven on Hope on Wheels,  and they do the mobile laundry and shower services.  So those are all possibilities.  If those were funded,  then we'd have a remaining 373,000, approximately.  So that,  let's see, I'll go down to the,  sort of to be developed things  that haven't been vetted as well,  just because for one, utility rental assistance,  I know there was a lot of interest in providing that.  Since that meeting, the state,  the May revised budget came out.  The governor is proposing allocating quite a large sum  of funds for utility and rental assistance.  We don't really know how that's going to play out.  So we would have to, if we were to pursue that,  we definitely need to check and make sure  that there's not going to be  any kind of a duplication of benefits.  So we could work on that.  And then another potential use is a temporary shelter.  You know, your resting environment  or whatever the council wants to do with that.  And basically that would be a public service.  It would assist with operational costs, staffing, supplies,  associated with that resting area.  Okay.  An additional plan amendment to consider,  items on that second chart could be brought back  as late as the August 3rd council meeting  to be able to meet that deadline  of providing the amendment to by mid August.  And with that, I'm happy to answer any questions.  Questions?  Council Member Brown.  Yeah, just a couple of questions about table two,  specifically, utility assistance and rental assistance,  given the governor's proposed budget,  was inclusive of these services.  Wouldn't that account to a duplication of services  if we were to award funding for that?  It may possibly.  We have heard of some interesting situations  where renters have actually paid their rent  using a credit card.  And so right now with the program that's out there  through the state,  they have no way of demonstrating  that they haven't paid their rent.  I mean, the landlord's saying, well, you paid the rent.  So there's no documentation that they haven't paid it.  But obviously that credit card bill is going to come due.  So there may be some other instances like that  where there are gaps,  but obviously we would definitely have to closely monitor  to be sure that there's no overlap.  Okay.  And then as it relates to the funding in table two  for a temporary housing sheltering option,  it seems like it would really only be staffing,  case management and COVID-19 infrastructure, so to speak.  And so it's a very broad range of funding  that could be utilized for this,  or that the funding could be utilized for, is that correct?  Right.  Everything spent,  these funds have to be spent  to have a tie back to the coronavirus.  So we have to make that case  as well as making sure that there's no duplication.  And yes, it would be for basically for case management  or that type of thing.  Thank you.  So anyone else?  All right.  I have a couple of questions.  So could it be used for outreach to the homeless community  in order to try to get them into shelter?  Yeah.  If there was an organization  that had that capacity to do that.  Okay.  Again, tying back to coronavirus.  Yeah.  And then it could also be used  for a potential campground location.  The case management or the operations of-  Something along those lines.  Exactly.  Okay.  All right.  That's my questions.  Thank you.  All right.  Any other questions?  No.  Do we have any speakers on this item?  Madam Clerk?  Yes.  I apologize.  We have Jessica Giannola followed by Leslie Johnson.  All right.  Good night, good night.  Okay.  CBDG funds, those were really great ideas.  I was hearing that our different uses  that the money can be applied towards.  With CHAT, they have amazing projects.  Transitional housing is definitely something  that is a need here.  Another thing that I can speak to is the need for somewhere  for people who are medically fragile or elderly or disabled  that need to have a place off the street,  but staying in a community shelter is more at risk for them.  So they're opting to often stay on the street because they can't-  they can't like separate.  But if we had funds that can help get them a room,  like an individualized, safer space while they're waiting  for the next level in housing, that is something that could be,  I think, really used in our area.  I know people right now that I could name that do need it  and they don't have it.  So that is a need in our area.  Showers, that was a great idea because if we have people,  we have working people who are also unhoused  and if they don't have access to a shower, it's really hard  for them or students.  On a personal story, I was an improperly sheltered child  in school, in middle school, and we had access  to a shower once a week.  I can tell you how hard that was to go to school  with only once a week shower from a public place.  So if we can up that, that's going  to help people tremendously, their health,  keeping disease down, keeping hygiene up, morale, ability  to get to work because they're at least clean.  So that's, I think, a great place where the funding can go.  So that's a great place where the funding can go.  So that's a great place where the funding can go.  That's that step-up process we're going to do.  What else?  I don't know.  I think these are great ideas.  I would support many of them.  Thank you.  Leslie Johnson followed by Dr. Robert Bauman.  Good evening.  Hi. Leslie Johnson, Director of CHAT.  And I'm here to, I guess, renew my pitch for the 283,000,  I guess, renew my pitch for the 283,000,  that was initially talked about being used for CHAT  for our shelter, I mean, our housing program.  This would be specifically a program that is ongoing now,  but the funding ends for that at the end of this month.  And so the timing is actually very ideal.  We would be able to continue this program another 18 months.  And the focus being on families with children  because they are one of the most vulnerable groups,  and it is very hard for families to keep their kids safe,  from COVID safe and safe and healthy,  and have good hygiene and everything else  when they're homeless and having to be in congregate situations  or staying with other families or things like that.  So we have a great plan, a great program that's going now,  and it's been very successful.  Our goal was to try to help about 10 families,  and I think we've helped about 18 families.  And almost all of them have been able to transition  into permanent housing with this intensive case management  that they've received that has enabled them  to get their applications in for housing,  work on their budgeting skills, their parenting skills,  and all the things that they need, the guidance,  and every family's different.  We have a great case manager.  She's done a wonderful job.  And we would love to be able to continue this program  and continue bringing in families who are homeless  and making sure we get them  established and safe and secure and healthy permanent housing.  So we hope you would confirm that grant amount to CHAP.  Questions?  I do have a question actually.  Can you just, just based upon what you said,  that it's a current running program, and with the 282,000,  it can continue for another 18 months,  but will you be sheltering any additional families,  or is it just maintain?  You said it would be 10 more?  No, we would be opening up approximately six new houses.  Six new houses, okay.  This would be not to maintain the people  that are in the existing program.  This will be all new families.  I'm glad you asked.  So the 282,000 is opening six new homes  for 18 months approximately?  Okay.  And it's focused on families with children?  Yeah.  And we kind of did it by bedrooms,  that it would be about 22 bedrooms.  Oh, rooms, sorry.  It depends on what size houses we get.  We just have to go with what's out there and what's available,  but that would be our goal.  And hopefully it would be more than that, but that would be it.  Absolutely.  I just wanted to have a ballpark.  Yes.  Thank you.  I appreciate that.  Thank you.  Anything else?  Thank you.  So Dr. Robert Bellman is our last speaker.  Thank you.  Good evening to all of you.  I support awarding that amount to CHAT for their project.  We have in Butte County, from what I've heard,  up to about 500 children that are homeless as part of families.  And in our community, we have about 1,000 children that are homeless.  In our own community, there is a, I can't say the exact number,  but this is a very important first step in getting these kids  and their families housed.  The kids need to have that security.  They need to be able to come to school showered and well fed.  And so that's very, very high.  So that's our priority.  The other thing that I saw that you're considering money  for maintenance and setting up campgrounds, we need that.  We also need a place for people who do have cars to be able  to safely sleep in them.  And we need to have these places set aside  from the local residential areas.  So that, you know,  the homeless people are safe and people in our communities  who have concerns about homeless being in their community,  in their immediate area, those needs need to be met as well.  So we need to come together, the people who are pro and con  about the homeless situation, and work together with the council  and with the community.  The different groups, we need to talk to each other instead  of fighting all the time.  And we need to come to solutions that work  for everyone in our community.  And there's not one solution.  It's going to take many, many solutions.  But we need a variety of things.  And certainly the campgrounds are a good, a very good option.  We need them in different locations.  I still think we should reconsider the BMX proposal  and also the McLaughlin property that I know you guys voted  down several, you know, a month ago.  But really, you know, one of the objections was  that there was noise pollution from the airport.  I mean, if a homeless person had a choice of being, you know,  having noise pollution or having a place that's safe,  I think they'd choose the noise pollution.  Thank you very much.  All right.  Thank you.  Oh, I did have, I did go to Eugene, and I saw a number of.  And unfortunately, Dr. Gorman, your time is up.  Can I just?  You can drop that with the clerk, though.  Yeah. I just made copies for all of you.  Yeah. Thank you.  All right.  Well, I kind of want to start this one.  So Councilmember Denway?  Yes.  Do you want to start this off?  Yeah.  Go ahead.  I just have a follow-up question just thinking  about how to move forward.  Ms. Demers, if, there you are.  Thank you.  I'm just curious if we were to move forward with the amendments  and attachments in the staff report,  the one that is the final page 505  for the temporary shelter services.  I don't see that that specific 173,000  on that page has anything listed about outreach,  and I would like to see that.  Yeah.  that's not included, I don't know,  because it's not in there, if we submit that,  if that would fill that out.  Yeah.  No, we could certainly.  So, you know, the first three items,  we kind of have vetted.  We know kind of how that would work.  And then the temporary shelter and or outreach is something  that if you want it to be more directed toward outreach,  you know, we could move in that direction.  Those are the items, the rental assistance, the utility,  and then the whatever it is that's serving that temporary,  you know, resource.  And then the temporary location could, you know,  we could work on that part.  Okay.  So you really just need direction if we give it  on those, the two unvetted options is what I'm hearing,  right?  Okay.  Yeah.  Well, I would also encourage you to let me know, you know,  let me know if you want to move forward with the three,  and we would actually bring the formal amendment.  We could bring it June 1st.  And then vet these other items and figure out what, you know,  what's going to be feasible and workable,  and then bring that back.  Later.  Yeah.  Well, I would be interested in seeing us move forward basically  on all of the attachments, but just including outreach  into that 173.  I'd be really curious to see how we might be able to leverage  that to get a better understanding  of what we're dealing with.  But I'd like to hear from the rest of council.  Councilmember Denley, just to clarify, is your desire  to move forward on table one, all three of those options  that are ready to go, and then to direct staff  to further vet the items in table two, including outreach?  Yeah.  So my understanding is, Ms. Demers,  is that basically everything will come back.  You're just making the final packet, correct?  Basically.  So we could expedite those first three.  We could bring those three back in amendment on June 1.  And that will give us some time to sort of vet these other items  and get more information and bring that back later.  Okay. Yeah. So I'd like to see that.  I'd be interested in hearing on all of them.  So if those ones came back earlier  and then the other ones got looked into, including outreach,  then yeah, I'm not ruling those out.  Well, I'll just go, because we're all speaking.  Mr. Morgan can go whenever we want to.  I'm going to make a proposal just  to see what kind of direction we go.  I would give the transitional housing assistance to CHAT,  because I think they do a better job than anybody.  That's the only one I would fund from there,  and I would take the rest of it and move it towards the temporary  shelter resting environment to include outreach.  I would leave the other stuff off.  You want to make an impact?  If that's a motion, I would second it.  Council Member Morgan, can I ask a point of clarification?  Absolutely.  Just so was that a motion?  Because you have a second.  Sure, I'll make it a motion.  Okay. So you have a second.  Council Member Brown, go ahead.  Thank you.  I would support that.  I think given where we're at on our campus, we're going to have to do it.  given the hard timeline, it makes sense to wait on some of those funds.  One of the things that I was thinking is that Haven of Hope on Wheels made sense,  because you would need sanitation services  at an outdoor sheltering environment.  And I think it's fair to say we need that now as well.  And so would you accept a friendly amendment,  including funding the sanitation services and taking the other funds  and seeing where we're at with an outdoor sheltering environment at a later date?  Yes and no.  Okay.  And here's why I say that.  Because I think Marie and her team, if we take the 282 and give it to CHAT  and put the rest of it towards a resting environment to include programming,  and they decide that the showers and laundry service are part of what needs to go there,  that's where it needs to go.  Okay.  But what I'm apprehensive about doing is blindly throwing out the mobile shower  and laundry services anywhere it may go now.  Okay.  And I would like it to be a motivator to get people in a better place.  Does that make sense?  It does.  Okay.  So I'm not saying no to it.  I'm saying include that in the camping or resting environment at their discretion.  So that would be a clarification to the motion perhaps?  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Could you restate the motion, please?  Oh, God, no.  Yes.  I'll do my best.  So my motion was to take the two.  282 and 933, designate that to CHAT, take the balance of all of it,  move it to the temporary shelter, sanctioned campground or resting environment,  including programming and whatever Marie and her team  and maybe some of the things that come out of closed session are decided that need to be in that spot.  Outreach.  Yes.  That's why I said programming.  I mean outreach.  Because we know this is going to cost.  There's going to be a lot of money.  And, you know, I'm not saying that's going to be a problem.  Nobody asked me to.  Yes.  I'm not going to say why.  I don't support the other ones.  All right.  Council Member Hueber, you had something?  No.  Council Member Denley?  I was actually going to ask why you didn't want to include the micro business assistance or utility and rental assistance.  I'm sorry.  I really don't understand why we wouldn't do that.  I'll tell you why.  You put me on the spot.  It's fine.  There's a ton of money.  There's a ton of money.  There's money everywhere.  The government is throwing money at people.  Business.  Businesses that come to.  Jen and I had this conversation just the other day.  If a business comes to government asking for help, they're done.  I mean the last place anybody should go is a government entity asking for help with their business.  Nothing personal.  It's not what they do.  So I just don't see that.  I think you'll throw $100,000 away and it won't have an impact.  As far as the utility, rental assistance, all those things, I think there's a hundred different ways for that to happen.  I think there's a lot of money being spent on a lot of different things.  And we're going to talk about strategy at some point.  And as board, we've got to be serious about if we're going to make an impact, how are we going to do it?  If we're going to spread it all out, we're going to get a lot of nothing.  So my approach is more laser focused than shotgun.  Doesn't mean it's right.  Just means that's how I would do it.  You look completely incredulous.  Well, I'm just listening to the reasoning.  To each their own.  I just hear there's a ton of other money out there for businesses and utility assistance and rental assistance.  Yeah, sure.  But there's also.  Millions and millions and millions for the homeless situation.  So I don't, you're losing me on the rationale that I think you might not have my support on that motion.  That's why.  Can I ask Ms. Denver's question?  Sure.  Just to tune in on that a little bit finer.  Exactly what at the SBDC was that you told us, I think there was a programming that that was helping to support.  Could you remind me what that was?  Sure, sure.  It's the micro business technical assistance.  So basically it's small businesses that are owners of lower income.  It's providing them with technical assistance to maybe pivot to perhaps their particular marketing strategy isn't working right now due to COVID or they need additional resources for whatever it might be.  Some kind of software.  They don't really know how to work a certain program or they don't know how to do a business plan.  They've got to change their model.  Those type of things.  So it's assisting them.  It's not actual funds for their business.  It's not actual financial resources.  It's more resources to help them potentially change the way income may be coming into or out of their businesses.  Correct.  Thank you.  Okay.  Council Member Dentley.  Oh, okay.  She answered your question.  So, well, I appreciate Council Member Morgan's motion and I appreciate Council Member Dentley bringing this forward.  And the micro assistance.  I actually think that the utility assistance is worthwhile too.  But I know the governor is exploring that program.  I know also we have I think $21 million coming in that we could allocate to some type of those programs depending upon what the governor actually ends up doing and actually comes through with.  And while I appreciate everything CHET has done for our city, I just feel like we've been here before.  So, yeah.  I think we should just allocate the entirety of it for outreach or the possibility of a temporary camping environment or something along those lines.  That's what the ad hoc committee came back with.  So I'd make a substitute motion that the entire amount is allocated towards, you know, outreach and or a campground in the future.  Something along those lines as we see fit when we make that decision.  Okay.  Thank you.  Showers,quote,quote,quote,quote,quote,quote,quote,quote,quote,quote,quote,quote,quote,quote,quote,quote,quote,quote,quote,quote,quote,quote,quote,quote,quote,quote,quote,quote,quote,quote,quote,quote,quote,quote,quote,quote,quote,quote,quote,quote,quote,quote,quote,quote,quote,quote,quote,quote,quote,quote,quote,quote,quote,quote,quote,quote,quote,quote,quote,quote,quote,quote,quote,quote,quote,quote,quote,quote,quote,quote,quote,quote,quote,quote,quote,quote,quote,quote,quote,quote,quote,quote,quote,quote,quote,quote,quote,quote,quote,quote,quote,quote,quote,quote,quote,quote,quote,quote,quote,quote,quote,quote,quote,quote,quote,quote,quote,quote,quote,  So the first one was chat and then throw everything else in outreach slash campgrounds slash home services.  And yours is just service.  Yeah, well, my figuring is we could always come back to the chat program,  but if we needed that extra money, we're not going to get it back if we give it away.  Mr. Knight, to be fair, if he doesn't get a second and ours doesn't pass, we start all over.  I was just trying to get to you.  Yeah, this is a final final, so this could not pass.  If I don't get a second, I'll probably vote for theirs.  You got a second.  Okay.  So my motion dies. Madam Clerk, will you take the roll on Mr. Morgan's motion?  So the motion was by Council Member Morgan, seconded by Vice Mayor Reynolds,  to direct to provide direction to staff to allocate the $282,000 plus to chat for transitional housing.  Move the rest of it to the outdoor shelter slash camping slash resting environment,  including program outreach and all needed services.  Can I ask a quick question?  It's for Leslie, if that's okay.  Yeah.  Vince, is it okay if we get a clarification before we take the vote?  Okay.  So Council Member Tandon has a clarification before we take the roll for the vote.  Is that okay?  Yes.  Okay.  Leslie, if you come on down.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I just wanted to check.  I know you mentioned there will be 22 individuals, most likely,  who would be helped with this $282,000 that would be allocated to chat if we decide to do that.  Do you have a list of individuals already identified?  I mean, I'm just curious to know, do you have applicants in there,  and what is their status right now?  I just wanted to know that.  The goal is eventually to get everybody into the housing.  And if we can get 22 people in today or tomorrow.  No, not today or tomorrow, but it would be pretty quick.  Yeah.  We use the coordinated entry system that's within HMIS,  which is how we're supposed to.  That's the system countywide that ranks homeless individuals based on their vulnerability.  And I did ask the program director whether there are still a number of families on there,  before I brought this to you.  And she said that we have three pages list of families.  So, yeah, it would be based on the ranking and the housing that we have available and their needs.  We definitely prioritize people with health issues and things like that.  But, yes, we would be able to move it along.  So are they in the temporary housing then?  We would find people probably some living in a car or a van,  some living in somebody's garage.  It would be.  They might be.  So I guess the clarification, maybe it's what she's asking too,  and your question is making me think it's a little more vague.  So do you have an actual list of people who would go straight into those homes or no?  The list is the coordinated entry list.  So we open it up on the computer and it tells us who has been entered in there.  So 211 enters people, the tariff shelter enters people.  Wherever they enter the system, they're put on the list and they're ranked according to their needs and vulnerability.  No, I just want to make sure that list already exists.  Yes.  It is ready to go.  I don't want to open it up and have to search for people.  Nope.  Okay.  Gotcha.  All right.  Madam Clerk.  Council Member Brown.  Aye.  Council Member Denley.  Aye.  Council Member Huber.  Yes.  Council Member Morgan.  Yes.  Council Member Tandon.  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds.  Yes.  Mayor Kulig.  Aye.  Carries 7-0.  And I want to say one super quick thing.  I want to say the main reason.  I want to say the main reason that I support CHAT and what they're doing in this project is because they use the coordinated entry in HMIS and qualify and it encourages people to call 211 and to get into service and to work off of that list.  And so that is why I support that effort.  And thank you for doing that and keeping HMIS going and all our service providers lifting up the level of integrity there.  So thank you.  Can I make a follow-up statement?  So obviously that was a big shout-out to CHAT.  But it's also.  Pretty big shout-out to staff because we are entrusting them with that money to figure out the right thing to do in those spots.  And I know they're going to come back.  All right.  So moving on to.  Oh, okay.  Actually, we're going to take a 10-minute break.  Thank you.  Showers, over to you, Chief.  Chief, over to Chiefys. [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible]  Thank you.  Thank you.  So as you know, early in April, in addition to taking action to reject the BMX site as a sheltering option and looking at redirecting CDBG funds, Council voted 5-2 to rescind the Shelter Crisis Declaration that was put in place in fall of 2018.  Following that action, Council was advised that the motion to rescind the declaration would need to be formalized by resolution.  And so in anticipation of a resolution coming forward to Council, I brought a request to Council to take time to analyze the consequences of rescinding the declaration before it expires on June 30th of this year.  Directly following the vote, we received information via email from the county about hundreds of thousands of dollars that would be lost to our community and to service providers if we move forward with rescinding the Shelter Crisis Declaration.  This information is critical to consider before a resolution to rescind comes forward or Council takes further action.  It's also critical to the impending expiration to the Shelter Crisis Declaration should the Council allow it to expire on its own.  So I thought I'd start really quickly.  I have more comments by asking the city attorney just to give us and the public a brief overview of the Shelter Crisis Declaration that went into effect in 2018 and some reasons it was originally passed by Council.  So Mr. Ewing, would you be willing to share?  A bit of context for the purpose of a Shelter Crisis Declaration and what it does for the communities that declare them?  Certainly, Council Member Brown.  In fall, October 2nd, 2018, I presented a report to the Council regarding the declaration of Shelter Crisis and I also covered the Homeless Emergency Aid Program.  That was recent.  That was legislation that was signed in June 2018.  The Homeless Emergency Aid Program.  The program, HEAP, made $500 million available in one-time funding available to continuums of care in large cities, populations of over 330,000 in the state of California.  The funding was intended to provide immediate emergency assistance to those jurisdictions that are experiencing homelessness or at risk of homelessness.  The Butte County-wide Homeless Continuum of Care was eligible to receive $4.9 million in HEAP funding at that time.  For theysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysys  community. The declaration of a shelter crisis was considered by the Council at that time  since the state required a shelter crisis declaration in order for local jurisdictions  and services providers within those jurisdictions to be eligible for HEAP funds through their  local COCs. At that time in October 2018, the Council made findings pursuant to the  presentation that I gave at that meeting. They found that there were a significant number  of persons in the city that were without ability to obtain shelter, that that resulted in a  threat to their health and safety and the health and safety of the community. And according  to a government code section that I've cited, 8698, the City of Council declared a shelter  crisis.  Thank you. And so I'm hearing that part of  the  the  part of or a major part of the reason for implementing that was to be able to have access  and have service providers located within Chico to have access to those HEAP dollars. Is that correct?  That is.  And then the other component of a shelter crisis has to do with building codes and some  loosening restrictions. Can you speak to that slightly?  I certainly can. So with respect to the type of eligible uses for HEAP funds,  what I mentioned at that time would be services.  So street outreach, health and safety education, criminal justice, diversion programs,  prevention services, navigation services, and operating support for short-term, short-term, or comprehensive homeless services,  rental assistance, and subsidies, and then speaking to what you just asked about, capital improvements, emergency shelters,  transitional housing, drop-in shelters, permanent, supportive housing, small, tiny houses, improvements to current structures that serve homeless individuals and families, and hand washing,  hand washing stations or public toilet  and shower facilities.  Note that with respect to capital improvements  that would require the compliance with applicable  building zoning and health and safety codes.  However, there was a carve out on our heat  that allowed the loosening of building code  and zoning code restrictions with respect  to temporary emergency shelters.  And I believe that's what you were speaking to.  Thank you.  So in doing my due diligence,  I reached out to Don Taylor,  Housing and Homeless Administrator  at the County Department of Employment and Social Services  to request some hard numbers as to the impacts  of rescinding the Shelter Crisis Declaration early,  if that is still the Council's desire.  And in reviewing this data,  which I forwarded to you via email,  you can see that there are still hundreds of thousands  of dollars that could be lost by local agencies  at the moment, but the crisis is rescinded,  the Crisis Declaration is rescinded early.  These funds have already been allocated  through the COC through HEAP.  And agencies working to address,  two agencies working to address homelessness,  including CHAT, CAM and our Youth for Change and AmpliHealth.  And so those agencies are depending on them,  on that funding to administer their programs.  You'll also note in Mr. Taylor's email  that his office intends to request an extension  of the County Shelter Crisis Declaration  due to the lack of affordable housing units available  and the lack of emergency shelter beds compared  to the number of unsheltered homeless in our communities.  This doesn't account for the barriers associated  with available emergency shelter beds,  which is another layer to this conversation altogether.  So for these reasons, I'm hopeful  that Council will take no further action  to rescind the Shelter Crisis Declaration early.  I also intend to ask that this Council vote  to extend the Declaration expiring at the end of June  for at least two years,  which is what the County is also requesting,  to reduce barriers for service providers to access funding  and fill in gaps in service.  And to reduce barriers for the city and its partners  to establish emergency sheltering environments  as needed during this crisis.  And I guess just want to be 100% clear,  that extending the Crisis Declaration,  Shelter Crisis Declaration doesn't require us to do anything.  It simply allows us flexibility.  If we choose to utilize city land to implement sheltering  or other projects in collaboration  with service providers, it also ensures that any future funding  that is tied to a Shelter Crisis Declaration is accessible  to the service providers currently working to prevent  or to reduce homelessness.  And with that, that's all I have.  All right.  Any questions?  Can I ask a question?  I have a question perhaps for Mr. Ewing or possibly Mr. Orme.  What drawbacks have we found there to be  with the Shelter Crisis Declaration?  What does it inhibit us from being able to do?  Or are there penalties associated with it for us?  And I guess that would go for extending it as well.  Okay.  Thank you.  I'll take a stab and then I'll defer to my colleague, Mr. Orme.  I'm not aware of any specific drawbacks.  You declared the Shelter Crisis.  Funds were made available pursuant to, you know,  legislation that was enacted at that time recently in June.  So in October you took action.  So I'm not aware of any specific drawbacks.  I will now defer to my esteemed colleague here, Mr. Orme.  Thank you.  I'm unaware of any drawbacks either.  So just merely allowing it to extend itself or taking an action  to extend it wouldn't cost us anything, wouldn't essentially nothing other than just the wording  of keeping it in place.  We don't have any penalties or actions against us or anything else.  Okay.  So, again, I'm not aware of any drawbacks.  The fiscal impact would be the fiscal impact associated with whatever action you took,  the staff time incurred in preparing the documents to extend the Shelter Crisis,  but that would be it.  That's all I'm aware of.  Okay.  Thank you.  All right, anyone else?  Council Member Vemma.  I was just curious, I'm not sure if maybe the city manager would know this or a city attorney.  I apologize for not thinking this through beforehand.  I'm just curious if off the top of your head, if we've ever had to invoke the shelter crisis since 2018,  what has the city used it for?  I have a vague memory of us utilizing it.  Mr. Reed can help out here.  I do remember us acknowledging it in light of the post-camp fire when we were working with FEMA,  and they were going to put the trailers out there at the Hagen Lane Business Park.  We acknowledged we already had a problem, a situation.  It had been exacerbated, and so we just kind of acknowledged that as we allowed FEMA to move forward  with the use that's not normally allowed in that area.  I don't know that it was official as much as it was something that we kind of leaned on  that helped build that kind of discussion.  And then I just have another question, and then I'll wait until after public comment for the rest of my thoughts.  But I'm also curious to get an understanding of, like I know the county has a declaration as well,  and this might be for you, Attorney Ewing.  If the county has a declaration in place,  and we have service providers that are providing for anyone in the county,  do those funds really depend on the city having a declaration?  Thank you for that question, Council Member Denley.  And then back to the earlier comment that my esteemed colleague, Mr. Beig, was answering.  As I mentioned earlier, because of the shelter crisis, there's a relaxation.  That's a funny sounding word, but the zoning and building code requirements  of the city are not going to be the same as they were in the past.  The city and the state are relaxed.  So you can use areas of certain city land for temporary emergency shelter.  So that's an example of, now I'm not aware of any specific instances where that was done,  but that's the purpose of the declaration.  That's one of the effects, if you will.  And then with respect to your question,  what happens is the county at the same time, or a month or two before in 2018,  declared a shelter.  And so they could access the HEAP funds also.  So in 2018, I did that analysis and I said, well, and the same question was asked,  like, well, the county has done it, what about us?  So in order for the city to access the funds, the city had to declare the shelter crisis declaration.  They couldn't rely upon or piggyback upon the county's declaration.  And then the county also works as an administrative agent for the funds that it receives from the state.  And distributes those funds or passes them through to the continuum of care organizations that are based in the city.  So if we accessed it with our declaration, sorry.  If we accessed it with our declaration to get our own specific funds,  I just don't remember seeing the city getting HEAP funds ourselves.  Do we know those dollar amounts?  If I may, Don Taylor's email referenced this as well.  There's certain.  There's certain organizations or agencies whose scope of service is countywide.  Certain organizations and agencies who are more specific to the city of Chico,  those are the agencies that would be hurt the most by rescinding early,  or if there was funding available in the future that was contingent upon a shelter crisis declaration,  those agencies wouldn't have the opportunity to access that funding.  And so it depends on the service area of the organization and not just the city of Chico.  I guess I'm just trying to get an understanding of what organizations those are,  because I didn't know we had any that say only if you're from Chico we'll provide for you.  So I'm just looking for like numbers, organizations, like the concrete information.  Right.  What we were shared by Don Taylor is that CHAT, Caminar, Youth for Change, and Ampla Health funding would all be affected.  Youth for Change and Ampla Health are countywide service providers,  and so there was some question about how much of the effect,  what would take place on them.  But CHAT and Caminar are city-based service providers,  and their funding would absolutely be affected based on his analysis, or his office's analysis.  I'd love to see staff follow up on a report for that.  That's just my two cents, but I'd love to hear what the public thinks.  So if anyone has...  Yeah, so our homeless solutions coordinator is here.  Susie, do you have anything to add as it relates to the funding accessed by some of our local entities?  No, not really.  Okay.  I just capitalized it fully.  Okay.  Indicating the service scope as well as the residents,  the city or county residents of the person they're showing.  Okay.  So whatever the direction of council is,  if we need to come back with some of those specifics,  we'll actually include that in that report.  It looks like that's what everybody's looking for.  All right.  Any more questions for staff?  All right.  Public comment?  We have some.  We have four speakers.  Jessica Giannola, followed by Lori Mason.  Okay.  I completely support the continuance of the housing crisis, and it's because we...  Well, we still have a housing crisis, but it would allow that funding with all of these partners  that do work within Chico, and it's like a boundary thing.  So Chico as a city is declaring something.  That means the partners within the city are eligible for the services, for the outreach,  and for keeping people off the streets and trying to get them out of the city.  So we're trying to get people back into housing and preventing them from being homeless.  So that is one of the...  That important aspect of having that declaration.  It allows that funding to be there to prevent more damage and human damage and to get people  off the streets.  So 2018, I just find it interesting that 2018, October, before the fire, is when this was  declared.  And then the fire happened.  And then we have people from Paradise down here.  I think pretty much everyone knows somebody.  Either you're related or you were in that fire zone and lost something or someone.  So the people at this point who had insurance or support, they probably found housing at  this point.  But our poorest people, the ones that were living in trailers or shelters like a shack,  and people were, they're the ones that ended up down here and are still down here.  So they're the ones that are...  That's why we see so many people.  They didn't migrate to here because we have these great services.  They can't...  We absorb them into our already existing population of unhoused.  Because I do outreach out with the encampments too.  And there are a lot of fire survivors.  Like legit, verified fire survivors still out there with nothing.  So we have this crisis now.  The hope is that we are moving forward to help resolve that.  But we're not there yet.  So it's totally appropriate that we say, okay, yeah, now we still have a crisis.  Let's get on board.  So why didn't we do anything so far?  Like what did the city do with the declaration in the past?  Well, we had a lot of political strife happening pretty much immediately after declaring the  housing crisis.  We had a lot of heated subjects.  And then COVID hit.  So we basically lost two years.  So now we're at a starting point.  We're moving forward.  And I think we're in a different place now.  And so I think there's more support for services and just working together.  So we definitely are still existing in that.  Our partners within Chico and the county, they depend on this declaration so that we can get that help and funding.  Okay.  Thank you.  Lori Mason followed by Leslie Johnson.  Hello.  Thank you for letting me speak tonight.  So related to the issue of the shelter crisis declaration,  you just heard from the attorney and the staff that it doesn't actually pass the city of Chico anything.  It's just that the city has lost funds to be funneled to people who are helping with the crisis.  The other thing is I wonder, and this is just me speaking.  I'm not an attorney.  How would the judge view removing the shelter crisis declaration in the current lawsuit that the city is facing right now with regard to Northern California Legal Aid?  I think he's declared it a crisis.  He's certainly giving a lot of his attention to it.  And I think if the city comes back and says, well, there's no real shelter crisis here, I wonder how that would go over.  My next question is, if there is a continuation of the shelter crisis declaration, why, in fact, is this not on the agenda at every meeting?  Every organization I've worked for, been a part of, volunteered for,  if we have an agenda item that we call a crisis or an emergency,  then we are duty bound to discuss that and work on that problem at every single point that we meet.  The other thing is we have North State shelter team has put in a proposal probably two or three months ago asking for support  and help with a crisis.  So, he's going to ask for help with that. but are fortunate enough to have a vehicle to have a place to safely sleep. They would not be there during the day. They would not impede business in any way. And to date we have not heard from the council whatsoever. So I will cede the rest of my time and I thank you all very much  So, he's going to ask for help with that.  So, he's going to ask for help with that.  So, he's going to ask for help with that.  So, he's going to ask for help with that.  Dr. Robert Baumann.  Thank you, Council.  I want to mention, first of all, that the project that I was writing up earlier  with our family housing program, that was funded through HEAP,  and we were able to help many families with that funding  that did depend on the existence of the shelter crisis.  So we were really happy to have that in place,  and I would really urge you to extend it another two years  or whatever the appropriate time is.  I know you're aware that it can impact funding,  but something that's been highlighted less  is that there are other benefits of having it in place.  As has been mentioned, there are no detriments, only benefits.  There are no obligations imposed, rules, penalties, expectations.  It's simply something that by declaring that a significant number of people  in our community are having difficulty obtaining shelter,  we're putting it in place.  That's all we're saying.  I just want to mention some of the other impacts, though, that it does have.  You might not be fully aware of.  And some of you know I was an attorney in my previous life,  so feel indulged me.  I'm going to read you a little bit of the statute.  Upon declaration of a shelter crisis, the political subdivision, that's us,  shall be immune from liability for ordinary negligence  and provision of emergency housing pursuant to these sections.  So that's a good thing.  It's removing potential liabilities.  The next section says the governing body, let's see,  it's telling us that there are immunities, that's what I'm looking for,  that are created as well.  So things that I can see when I'm sitting at my desk, I can't see right now.  The city does have some immunity that is available to us in terms of any sort of litigation  because of the shelter crisis declaration.  And then, as was mentioned, regulatory statutes can be waived.  So all it does is give you more freedom to set aside or ignore what would ordinarily be  some binding regulations, statutes, and rules.  So, again, that's a good thing.  It gives you more freedom, more power, and authority to do whatever.  You may want to do with regard to the shelter crisis.  And this can include homeless shelters as well as housing facilities.  You can use public facilities for housing if you choose to do that for emergency homeless housing.  So I hope that's helpful.  I hope you will go ahead and extend it.  It's a real benefit, and it gives you more freedom, more flexibility on how you want to handle this crisis,  especially if you're going forward with some alternatives,  such as, you know, a shelter crisis.  As a campground project, that could be very applicable.  Thank you.  So our last speaker is Dr. Robert Bowman.  Thank you.  First of all, I want to express my appreciation.  I want to express my appreciation to all of you tonight working together  and coming to this conclusion that you came to in your earlier discussion.  You've made tremendous step forward tonight to dealing with this very, very grave problem.  It's a problem that doesn't affect us because we're housed,  but it does affect us because we have members of our community,  that are at risk.  They're at risk of getting COVID, spreading it to other people in the community,  not getting adequate health care, overloading our ERs with repeated visits.  It's not fiscally sound not to deal with this in some other creative way,  and I think you've made tremendous progress.  Thank you.  And I think we need to take a step forward today.  As I mentioned earlier, I think we need to have safe parking spots.  We need several of them.  There are probably about 80 people who have their own property.  They have a property.  It's their car.  The rest of us are lucky enough to have a rental or a home.  But, you know, we had a housing crisis here before COVID.  We had a fire.  We had a fire in the campfire.  And then suddenly we had 17,000 people here.  And I went to some of the shelters near my home trying to help out.  And I knew people who lost their homes.  One cellist jumped on his bike and took his cello down to Chico because his car didn't  work.  He almost died that day.  It's a couple of my other friends.  And I think we need to take a step forward.  We're only one fire away from being homeless, some of us ourselves.  So I think this is something that's going to be with us for a long time.  And extending this resolution is very, very necessary.  I've mentioned the car parks.  I mentioned the campgrounds.  We need more porta-potties.  We have tons of people in this community who are out there every Sunday.  They're cleaning up at Comanche and bringing people food.  They don't even have water now for some reason.  I just heard that tonight.  So we really depend on you authorizing us and giving us, us the providers in this community,  the tools to do this job.  I gave you sheets about Eugene.  They have some great things happening there.  And I think that's a great thing.  Thank you, Dr. Hall.  Thank you.  Thank you again, forever.  All right.  Council discussion.  I'd like to make a motion.  I would move to direct staff to prepare the necessary documentation to extend the declaration  of a shelter crisis for two years.  I'll second that motion.  All right.  Thank you.  We have a motion and a second.  Can we have discussion right now with the thing?  Okay.  We can have discussion, yes.  I'm just checking.  Thank you.  So just, I've previously made one argument as to there being enough shelter in the community.  And I won't go on that 6 minute, 15 second tirade again.  I'll go on a smaller one this time.  So basically going back to what the city attorney had mentioned back when we first declared this,  we went through basically saying there was a finding that there was an inability for  people to find shelter locally.  And a different way to address that beyond what I've already said is just using the county's  own numbers from 2020.  That there were 493 total emergency shelters.  And I think that's a lot of numbers.  So those are, you're seeking shelter.  Those are like the basic entry level, just seeking shelter.  493 in the county.  They were only 65% utilized.  Which goes back to the fact that we always have open beds here in Chico, which is what  I said last time.  We have enough beds.  The county's numbers just reiterate that exact same thing, but their specific number was  65% utilized.  In addition, I just, going back to, I don't think we have a shelter crisis.  I think we have a drug addiction and mental health crisis.  According to HUD's own numbers, 78% of the unsheltered are either mentally ill or drug addicted.  And when I've asked Don Taylor how many of those 493 total emergency shelter beds provide  clinical care for mental illness or drug addiction, I was told that only the small amount of youth  for change beds have clinical treatment tied to them.  So with 78% of the unsheltered, I think we have a drug addiction and mental health crisis.  And with the PIT numbers, we've got 694 people roughly in the county that need clinical  treatment.  We can't expect a shelter and these funds that don't allow you to require treatment,  they don't allow you to require drug treatment, they don't allow you to make it a mental health  bed, we cannot expect these shelters to give us the clinical results that our community  actually needs.  I just would like to see us putting effort into the community to make sure that we have  a safe space for people to come in and do their work.  And so maybe if we declare, I'm not saying we do it tonight, but maybe we declare a drug  addiction and mental health crisis, I mean, the money is apparently coming pouring in  from this crisis, maybe there's money there.  I want to do something meaningful, and I think that this is adding to things that already  aren't utilized.  We're just going to have 50% utilization instead of 65 if we keep funding these emergency  shelters.  So those are my two cents.  I have a question for Ms. Calkins.  Sort of based on some of the things that Counselor Denley was just referring to, do the funds  that could be available to providers based on declaration of a shelter crisis, can any  of those be used for addiction services, detox, mental health?  Any of those things?  No, typically that funding runs straight through the County Behavioral Health Department.  And going back to Counselor Denley's comments about shelter beds and availability, we have  a higher number of homeless than we have year-round beds that cater straight to the low barrier  population.  So a lot of those beds that are counted in the housing inventory count are specific to  subpopulations.  The term emergency is defined as a point of time, meaning typically three to six months.  Not necessarily that it's an emergency that they have a substance use disorder or a behavioral  health need.  It's based on the time that they can stay in that bed.  So you have things that are categorized as emergency shelter beds only because of the  number of days they're available.  Not because people can go straight off the street into a low barrier shelter.  Does that make sense?  Yeah, so another question is of the numbers that Ms. Denley is referring to of unused beds,  what percentage of those come with strings like either sobriety or domestic abuse?  Or etc., etc.  Yeah, I don't have a percentage off the top of my head.  But, you know, what's counted in those and what was counted in our 2021 point in time  count are often short-term beds like what Safe Space offers.  If they happen to be open for a cold winter shelter season and it happens to fall on the  point in time count night, that's a snapshot in time on one day.  So, you know, this year we counted all the folks that were in Project Room Key beds.  It's not an emergency bed.  It's not an accurate depiction of the entire year.  It's a snapshot in time, just one day.  So, all of those beds that potentially were short-term and happened to be open on the  count night got counted.  It's not a year-round bed.  Got you.  Okay.  Thank you very much.  You're welcome.  Ms. Calkins, can I ask a quick question?  Yes.  Are sober living environment beds included in that part?  It depends on the term of service, but some are.  Yes.  Salvation Army, for example.  Is that right?  I believe they are.  But it depends on their term of service.  So, aren't they different?  Aren't they at least a year?  Actually, I don't know that.  I think the point I'm trying to get to is that some of these beds aren't just for people  coming off the street into the bed.  They're also people who are currently housed wanting to access the sober living environment  and going into those programs.  Is that correct for some of them?  Absolutely.  That's the subpopulation I was talking about.  Yeah.  When you talk low barrier, anybody can go into that program.  Right.  But when you have a sober living environment or a domestic violence emergency shelter,  that subpopulation has to meet that definition before they go.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  All right.  Vice Mayor Reynolds.  So, I would wonder if you would entertain a friendly amendment.  I would say that we create, call a shelter mental health and drug addiction crisis, and  maybe we can bring some extra money in in some other ways and have staff bring that  back.  I won't accept the friendly amendment because it is not tied to a specific state policy  that says this is what the shelter crisis declaration is tied to the policy that relaxes  building codes that may bring additional funding into our communities that addresses liability.  I'm fine having that as a separate conversation, but it seems to me passing the shelter crisis  declaration on its own is appropriate.  And if we're wanting to pass another sort of declaration that we're crafting on our  own, then we would need more staff insight into what that would actually mean or impact  it would have.  Okay.  So, no, I'm sorry.  I won't accept the friendly amendment.  All right.  Council Member Tamley.  So, from what I'm hearing here is that we, sorry.  So, please, I believe that I'm understanding it correctly that the shelter crisis was done  because of the HEAP funding.  Is that correct to some extent?  Yes, that is correct.  The HEAP funds were made available in June 2018.  Sometimes, they're not.  Sometimes, they're after.  I believe it was July.  The Council directed a city attorney to prepare documents for its consideration to adopt a  shelter crisis.  I did that.  So, I just would like to read this one sentence from an email from Don Taylor.  And from what I'm interpreting from that sentence suggests that the HEAP funding and the other  funds are not required.  Whether we have a shelter declaration.  Whether we have a shelter crisis declaration or not.  I just want to make sure that I'm understanding it correctly.  So, let me just read that here.  If I may, Council Member Tandon.  Sure.  He did clarify that cash funds, which was a different pot of money, and were included  in the policy that made HEAP funds available, were not affected by, would not be affected  by rescinding the shelter crisis declaration early.  Correct.  HEAP funds would be affected.  Okay.  Thank you.  All right.  Go ahead.  It may have been confusing as the legislation that enacted both HEAP and CESH cash, SB 850,  had stated HEAP needed a shelter crisis declaration.  I reached out to the HCD representative for CESH and received a confirmation email that  a shelter crisis declaration is not required by jurisdictions for funding to expanded and  those jurisdictions.  Long story short, no potential loss of funding for those grants.  I'm just making sure.  So, could you clarify on that, Mr. Erie?  I'm aware of that, and that's what you read was accurate.  So, you know, the HEAP funds are tied to the shelter crisis declaration and the cash funds  are not.  Okay.  I have a question there.  Is everybody done?  Okay.  My question is, do we have city staff providing the actual answers to all these questions  in one location?  Mr. Orr, maybe you know the answer to that.  Can you repeat the question?  I'm trying to put my head around what that was.  Do we have, I mean, you know, Alex, and to your credit, I know you're a member of the  I know I've had conversations with Don as well, you know, through various meetings.  But I'd like to see something official.  I mean, I know what she mentions is probably accurate.  I know we've obviously got differences of opinion on certain things, but have we ever  had it laid out by staff or?  No, we've only received emails from the county which delineate what they are aware  of as being the impacts to our community based upon us.  Okay.  So, with that, with that, with that, with that, with that, with that, with that, with  that, with that, with that, with that, with that, with that, with that, with that, with  that, with that, with that, with that, with that, with that, with that, with that, with  that, with that, with that, with that, with that, with that, with that, with that, with  that, with that, with that, with that, with that, with that, with that, with that, with  that, with that, with that, with that, with that, with that, with that, with that, with  that, with that, with that, with that, with that, with that, with that, with that, with that,  can but we we trust that mr taylor is accurately portraying the impacts potentially so i'd make  a substitute motion that we actually not only for the sake of our community to know exactly what  we're receiving from the shelter crisis and what we have received in the past as well as how it  will affect us in the future a little clarity and transparency that we actually do a full report on  this and then bring it back i would amend my previous motion to include when staff comes back  with a resolution that we may or may not adopt a report requested from the county with all of that  information so that we could consider it all at once well not the same thing would you accept that  that adjustment to my motion council member huber thank you so we have a motion a secondary motion  and the first motion was changed yeah i'll second the substitute i'll second the substitute motion  because i think it encapsulates encapsulates the first motion yeah  you  can i clarify  so i have an original motion by council member brown seconded by council member huber  and there was a friendly amendment by vice mayor reynolds that was not accepted  and then the mayor was talking about looking for something more detailed and written out  um and then then i went to amend my motion so i apologize for that  um  so i'll i'll take that off the table and then i'll ask my my colleague mayor coolidge a question  after this is dealt with so and and then you were asking just to amend your original motion  to include that when staff comes back with a resolution that may or may not be adopted  that a report comes back with it that includes all the report all the information that was being  requested sure yes that is my amendment okay so is there a substitute motion as well yeah i i had  made the substitute motion so the substitute motion was that you were going to amend the original motion  or looking for something written for staff to bring back additional information on how accepting  i mean i got it but i didn't get it as a second or as a substitute motion as a substitute motion  okay so hold on and then yeah go ahead is there a reason that you wouldn't accept both of those  at the same time i think i'm just trying to meet you in the middle here so that we have  all the information in front of us if the information is indeed accurate wouldn't it  follow that the shelter crisis declaration would make sense to  be a little more difficult to consider moving forward with i thought i think that might be a  logical follow-up absolutely but but i i do think we can just do that at the next meeting when we  bring it back so i don't think there's a necessity for it i just don't understand delaying when we're  when we're set this is because we have time this is set to expire at the end of june right but if  we deal with it at the next meeting we have time if we deal with the next meeting then there's a  motion for a resolution and the second meeting in june  this resolution on the table where we could have it all  in one package at the next meeting.  And you're not willing to meet me there.  I think it's obvious that I don't even have  all the information.  I don't think we all do.  I mean, whereas, you know, certainly I believe that.  I don't think we've had our staff flush it out.  I don't think we know the implications exactly moving forward.  I don't know that we know the implications  that it's occurred in the past.  And I don't think we've vetted it through the public.  So I'd like to vet it through the public.  I'd like them to actually look at what the benefit is.  Don't you think that doing that all at one time  is probably the cleanest way for the public to weigh in  and participate and know what's on the table?  Yeah, but I think we have to do that next meeting.  We can't do it right now  because we don't have the information.  I'm going to call a question  because I think you guys could do this for a while.  Yeah.  And if we, but no, the point being that the votes  will direct us where we're going.  So on the substitute motion that I actually missed  for something in writing that outlines all of the benefits  and anything else?  Basically outlining everything that it's affected  in the past as well as what it will affect in the future  by our staff.  Okay, thank you.  Council Member Brown?  No.  Council Member Dinley?  Aye.  Council Member Huber?  Yes.  Council Member Morgan?  Yes.  Council Member Tandon?  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds?  I seconded it, so I have to vote.  I'm actually a no.  Okay.  Mayor Coolidge?  Aye.  It carries 5-2.  Okay.  Item 5.4, Council Member Tandon's request,  services in District 7.  Council Member Tandon?  I don't know.  District 10?  I'm out of time.  I'm not Tuesday.  I already need to go to the meeting, so.  Go right there, sir.  Yes.  So I just wanted to check in that I understand  that the district has a lot of support for the district  and that right now in District 7 we have a lot of service  providers including Jesus Center, Taurus Shelter.  We know we're building a lot of affordable housing out there  as well, which we need for sure.  But I would like to see, check with the staff,  how we can make sure that not all the service providers just  concentrate in one part of town or maybe one district of Chico.  And I don't know if you can see this, but I think it's a lot of  I understand that we have already approved the expansion  of the Taurus Shelter and construction of Renewal Center.  But I would like to formulate a plan to see how we can utilize  the tools like zoning and use permit to make sure  that all the service providers don't just concentrate  in one district.  And the constituents are definitely getting affected  with theft, vandalism, and other things.  And there is negative impact on businesses and residences as well.  So I would just like to see, hear from staff and my colleagues here  to see what's their opinion on it.  I'd be happy to start, give you some input.  I think it's a perfectly valid question about the importance  of the distribution of services throughout the city.  To me, your question is, just to me personally,  it's not so much about what happens in District 7.  It's about what isn't happening in all the other districts around town.  And so I think if there's a way that we can encourage  a more equitable distribution of services throughout the community,  and throughout the districts, I'm all for that.  Any other?  Council Member Brown?  No? Okay.  All right.  You guys are waiting.  Okay, public comment?  We have one speaker, Jessica Giannola.  All right.  Thank you.  So last one of the night.  I would like to support Council Member Tandon.  I'm in District 7, and I'm a huge advocate of helping people.  And so I don't necessarily mind that District 7 is shouldering a lot  of the programs that impact the area.  But I would like to support the concern behind of why aren't we having  more services also in other areas.  Because we are a city, a large city.  We're growing and growing.  And I think it's important that we do have more services throughout the city  with different districts, depending on what they offer.  Like the parks area might offer something that downtown businesses might offer.  So it's like kind of you would be able, as a team,  kind of figure out what works better in each district.  That it's still lending a hand and helping our services that are needed.  So it's not just all one area.  Because I think that when we see other cities on the news or we visit,  we can see what happens to a part of a city that everything is pushed to.  And they don't get the support they need.  And people get forgotten.  And that becomes the part of the area like nobody wants to go to that end of town.  So I think it helps people.  It helps our community.  And it helps our leaders to kind of stay on top of, okay, what do we need?  What's lacking in this area?  What can we throw at this area here for support if we're all invested?  So I just, I'd like to, I agree that it should be looked at  and moving forward sharing that support for our community.  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right.  Comment?  Council Member Denland.  Thank you.  I agree with wanting to look into, you know, where and what,  what we have going on in the city,  whether that be specifically in District 7  or just the way it's dispersed within the city overall.  And in light of that, I would throw out a motion to see,  because I think it's a big conversation.  There's like a lot of directions it could go and how we would deal with it.  I'd like to see a conversation taken to internal affairs  regarding to go over current zoning requirements, permitting processes for services within the city,  including the current status of services in the city.  So where is what right now?  And then looking at how we handle that.  So internal affairs.  Is that right?  Yes.  Public comment first?  Oh, yeah.  Sorry, public comment.  We did it, right?  No, we did it.  We did?  Yes, Jessica.  I was like, wait a minute.  We just had Jessica.  Yeah, so that's a motion.  Yeah, that was a motion.  So.  I would second the motion, but I just want to make sure this is actually an actionable item.  Because it's services in District 7.  You'd be looking to give staff direction.  Staff direction, okay.  Okay.  So we wouldn't be able to agendize it for internal affairs, though?  You could give staff direction to agendize it for internal affairs.  Okay, gotcha.  Okay.  That's what I was looking for.  All right.  Is that sufficient, Ms. Preston?  Okay.  Okay.  You're second?  Yes?  Okay.  Vice Mayor Reynolds was second.  Council Member Brown, you have a comment?  No, I think I just want to say, I'll support the motion.  I think it's a reasonable conversation or starting place to look at where things are  and what they are.  But I also agree with Council Member Huber's original comment about this being a unique  opportunity for every district, every part of the city to really look at what our assets  are as it relates to addressing the public.  So, you know, theysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysys  the concentration of chat houses.  Because while we can certainly look at District 7 and go,  there's the Jesus Center, there's the Tory shelter, okay.  But that's not all the services that we have.  Some of the best-run services in the entire city, nobody sees.  And I am apprehensive about spreading the services out around the city  to somehow make it better.  Just like a quick detail on that, I have some worries about confidentiality.  As it relates to some of those that may be more anonymous.  And so I actually think I won't support the motion,  given what Council Member Morgan just said.  Because I think if we start mapping out and plotting out services  that should be more confidential, that could be problematic.  You could do it just based on number in a district.  I don't know if that's what was asked for.  Yeah, but I'm saying if the Internal Affairs looked at it and just said,  we want to know.  How many in each district, not on a specific street.  Sure.  Yeah.  Sean, what's your district number?  One.  One?  Seven.  One.  He's one.  I am number one.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Anyway, District 1 actually has a lot of services, if you think about it.  The Wells there.  There's some other programs there.  I'm not trying to make it better.  No, I'm not.  But I do want to commend Council Member,  Tandon for bringing this forward.  This is why districts are the best way, really,  because you have people who are looking out for specific areas of the city.  It lends itself to discussions about what areas certain services are being put in  versus others and how areas are being impacted in our city.  So I think that's an important discussion because of that.  I'll support it.  So with that, Madam Clerk, take the roll.  Council Member Brown, for confidentiality issues,  and lack of reassurance, no.  Council Member Denley?  Aye.  Council Member Huber?  Yes.  Council Member Morgan?  No.  Council Member Tandon?  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds?  Aye.  Mayor Coolidge?  Aye.  Carries 5-2.  All right.  Just let's see what else we've got here.  Give me a last one, please.  All right.  Vice Mayor Reynolds requests a districting request for proposals.  I think we might be able to actually fly through this super fast.  We have a state mandated deadline of when this has to be done.  It was originally supposed to be done in September because of the late numbers coming out on the census.  It's been extended to, I believe, in December.  We are still on a tight deadline.  What I would like to make a motion is that we would authorize staff to retain a consultant to help manage and guide us  through the redistricting process so we can get somebody that can make sure to run all the meetings that we're supposed to have  and all that kind of stuff.  So I just want staff to put out that RFI or whatever we need to do and bring us back some options.  All right.  Questions?  Public speaker?  Oh.  Yeah.  It's okay.  You make the motion.  Was there a second?  No.  There was no second because we haven't heard public comment.  Okay.  We have no public comment now.  We don't?  No.  Ruth Sarnoff left.  Oh.  Okay.  All right.  Quick question.  Okay.  So no public comment.  Motion on the floor.  Was the motion seconded?  No.  Okay.  I just had a question.  Is it a foregone conclusion that the districts need to be changed, that we're not leaving them the same?  Yes, because with new census numbers,  and we have to take the actual census numbers and redo them and re-go through all the public meetings and all that,  everybody in the whole entire state of California does.  So I'm afraid if we don't get our RFI out soon enough that we may not have an actual consultant to lead us through.  So that was my concern in bringing it forward sooner than later.  Yeah.  My understanding, I'm sure Mr. Ewing could back this up.  It's required by law, correct?  Yeah.  The census is coming when?  We don't know exactly when, but it's coming.  It's delayed, and I would encourage you to make your motion to direct staff to bring back what you requested on your particular item.  All right.  So we have a motion.  Do we have a second?  Second.  Second by Council Member Denley.  Madam Clerk, you take the roll.  Council Member Brown.  Aye.  Council Member Denley.  Aye.  Council Member Huber.  Aye.  Council Member Morgan.  Yes.  Council Member Tandon.  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds.  Aye.  Mayor Coolidge.  Aye.  Carries 7-0.  All right.  We are going to revert to our original agenda.  Item D, E, C.  From the earlier agenda.  Sorry, folks.  Hold your places.  We still have item C, D, and E from the earlier agenda.  Item C is City of Chico.  So, strategic visioning and planning.  Deputy City Manager Jennifer McCracken.  I move that we table this.  Second.  I'll just say why, because I said it.  We've been through this.  I understand we need to go through it again.  It's an important exercise.  It's not urgent.  And we're going to be in closed session for a while.  And we've been here a long time.  Okay.  Right now, I'm about to vote yes on just about anything.  Okay.  Okay.  Thank you.  Oh, wait.  Now they want to stay.  They have to agree.  Don't sit down yet.  To move the rest of the agenda or just this item?  Okay.  Council Member Rickbuck.  Cook, E already.  We just have C and D, which the next is ALS.  So, Mr. Ewing, if we table this, we don't have to have public comment, correct?  Correct.  You can table it, and you can have public comment now, or you can have public comment  later.  Okay.  Okay.  Clerk Cresson, what's your thoughts?  When we table things, we typically take the public comment at the time that it's heard.  Okay.  All right.  Let's do that then.  Can we ask a quick question?  Yeah.  Do we need to do E?  No.  That was already done.  So, we did E.  Oh, perfect.  Well, you guys said C, D, and E.  Well, we did E.  So, you might let the public know if they're, you know, hey, we're considering tabling these  items.  If you're listening or you're not listening, you can just say, well, we're going to table  this item.  If you want to speak, you'll have an opportunity to speak at the meeting.  So, let me do this.  Clerk Cresson, how many speakers do we have on that item?  None.  None.  Okay.  So, moot point.  All right.  So, go ahead.  Okay.  So, the motion was to table item C and D, correct?  Or just C?  Just C or C and D?  Okay.  Council Member Brown?  Aye.  Council Member Denley?  Aye.  Council Member Hubre?  Yes.  Council Member Morgan?  Yes.  Council Member Tandon?  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds?  Sure.  Mayor Coolidge?  No.  It carries, though.  6-1.  Yes, I know.  Just more of a night owl.  All right.  So, with that, we can get back to the rest.  We will, reports and communications.  Mr. Orem.  Sure.  Honorable members of the council, just a quick comment.  I just wanted to say a couple of quick ones.  We've been hearing a lot of speculation surrounding water being turned off in Comanche Creek.  I thought it would just be important that I just share a little bit about that.  I just found from one of our council members, which I appreciate, reached out advising me  of a situation.  That was last night and yesterday evening.  And staff immediately turned around looking into the situation.  We immediately called Cal Water.  And they were extremely responsive.  And responsible for looking into the matter to find out why the water was turned off.  And lo and behold, it was turned off for good reason.  There was a tremendous amount of vandalism that had occurred to that system.  Not only to the system for the landscaping, but also to the backflow device, which was  pivotal to have in place.  And it's a rather unique fixture.  It's not some simple one that you can just go to Walmart or Lowe's or Home Depot to buy.  And so, city staff has been diligently working on that.  I know Director Gustafson has.  He's had his team working towards those ends.  Even to the point where we are collaborating with Cal Water on potential water donation  from them to help support the situation since there's no water going to that site right now.  The water fountain doesn't work.  And so, they're continuing to work on that.  And it's our hope that by tomorrow we'll have some measure of some of these aspects fixed.  Particularly focused on the water fountain.  And so, just so everybody's aware, I heard there was a lot of speculation of, you know,  maybe behind the scenes dealings or some ill intent from council or staff, which is horribly inaccurate.  And so, I just want to reassure council staffs on top of it.  As soon as we heard about it, we turned around and started working on a solution.  So, for whatever that's worth, I just thought I'd share that.  And I also just want to thank the team and the council today because what I saw during the budget process was a lot of patience.  You were very patient.  You were very patient because I asked you to be expediting through your items.  You did a great job trying to get as much information out as possible in a short period of time.  Council, you were very patient.  So, thank you.  And I know that it's really important for both you to work together in order for the public to be informed.  So, great job, one and all.  So, with that, thank you very much.  That's all I've got to report.  Mr. Orm, I just want to thank you for being so incredibly responsive to that concern.  And thanks to Cal Water for also checking it out quickly.  So, I really appreciate that.  Thank you.  Okay.  Just a follow-up.  I know you sent us an email.  Did we get that?  Did we issue a press release?  We usually don't issue press releases on those items.  The only reason I'm asking is because of what we're being accused of doing.  Yeah, if I start that, we'd be issuing a press release every night.  Fair point.  Sorry.  I'll just keep telling them it's the mayor's fault.  Thank you, Mr. Morgan.  But we can do bottled water now.  So, anyway.  Yeah, Cal Water can.  Too soon.  Too soon?  All right.  All right.  Councilmember requests.  Pursuant to AP and P1010, councilmembers may verbally request an item to be agendized  at a future meeting after stating what the item would be.  A majority vote of the council is needed to order in order for staff to agendize.  Councilmembers may also submit requests in writing.  Anyone?  I have a request.  All right.  Councilmember Brown.  Yeah.  I would like to make a request for reconsideration of one of my votes, Mr. Morgan.  At the last council meeting, I was asked to submit a request for reconsideration of one  of the documents, which is the introduction of the introduction of the introduction of  the introduction of the introduction of the introduction of the introduction of the introduction  of the introduction of the introduction of the introduction of the introduction of the  introduction of the introduction of the introduction of the introduction of the introduction of  introduction of the introduction of the introduction of the introduction of the introduction of  introduction of the introduction of the introduction of the introduction of the introduction of the introduction  introduction of the introduction of the introduction of the introduction of the introduction of the introduction  introduction of the introduction of the introduction of the introduction of the introduction of the introduction  introduction of the introduction of the introduction of the introduction of the introduction of the introduction  introduction of the introduction of the introduction of the introduction of the introduction of the introduction  introduction of the introduction of the introduction of the introduction of the introduction of the introduction  But voted yes because I thought I was voting on keeping the conversation going.  But now that I've had the opportunity to review the motion, talk to staff, and understand impacts, I'm not in support of it for many reasons.  So it contradicts itself.  It flies in the face of recommendations by committee staff and consultants.  And I think it actually reduces direct revenue and jobs that we could have access to when the conversation was about increasing revenue.  So I'd like to agenda as a discussion to reconsider my vote at the earliest possible council meeting.  And you can consider that a motion.  All right.  We have a motion and a second.  Madam Clerk.  Council Member Brown.  Aye.  Council Member Denley.  Sure.  Council Member Huber.  Yes.  Council Member Morgan.  No.  Council Member Tandon.  No.  Vice Mayor Reynolds.  Sure.  Mayor Coolidge.  No.  Carries 4-3.  Thank you, Council.  All right.  Anyone else?  One once.  One twice.  Closed session.  Oh.  Public comment on closed session?  Sorry.  We do not have any.  All right.  Sure.  Thank you.  Thank you.  And again, thank you, staff, for all your diligence and presentation today.  Great job.  Thank you.
