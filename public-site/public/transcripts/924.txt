 Good evening. I'll call to order the regular Chico City Council meeting of November 3rd. We'll start with the invocation from Carol Rayner from the Christian Science Church. Carol Rayner, Christian Science Church I thought this evening if there's any bitterness or dislike or aversion to anyone or to anything in the world. If there is any clouded past or anxiety for the future. Let it all vanish. Release it to our Heavenly Father's love for each of us right now with a few moments of silent prayer. Heavenly Father, we take this moment to count our blessings, to be grateful for all the good that is present in our lives. Thank you God for the lovely fall colors in our beautiful home. Thank you for the beautiful city of Chico. Thank you for the gentle voices of people helping one another. And thank you for revealing the answers to our hopes and prayers. From the book of Numbers. The Lord bless thee and keep thee. The Lord make his face to shine upon thee and be gracious unto thee. The Lord lift up his countenance upon thee and give thee peace. Amen. Thank you. Thank you. Please join me in the Pledge of Allegiance to the flag. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. And may we have the roll call, Madam Clerk. Councilmember Huber. Yes, Madam Clerk. Yes, Madam Clerk. Yes, Madam Clerk. Yes, Madam Clerk. Yes, Madam Clerk. Yes, Madam Clerk. Yes, Madam Clerk. Yes, Madam Clerk. Yes, Madam Clerk. Yes, Madam Clerk. Yes, Madam Clerk. Yes, Madam Clerk. Yes, Madam Clerk. Yes, Madam Clerk. Yes, Madam Clerk. Yes, Madam Clerk. Yes, Madam Clerk. Yes, Madam Clerk. Yes, Madam Clerk. Yes, Madam Clerk. Yes, Madam Clerk. Why don't you stand down here and look up to the camera and stop. The world is a proclamation from the City of Chico for Homelessness and Runway Youth Awareness Month. Whereas California has an estimated 200,000 children who are homeless, including some 2,000 K-12 students in Butte County, and approximately 25% of youth exiting foster care will experience homelessness. A high percentage of homeless youth have been physically, sexually, and or emotionally abused by their guardians, and are frequently re-victimized and exploited while living on the streets and in shelters. Natural disaster and a lack of affordable housing have exaggerated youth homelessness across rural California, and due to the lack of state-wide housing, homeless youth face great difficulty in accessing, stabilizing, and succeeding in school, reducing the likelihood of successful graduation. LBGTQ plus young adults are at 120% higher risk of homelessness when compared to their peers, and compromise about 40% of the unaccompanied homeless youth population. The citizens of Chico are the key to preventing youth homelessness by accessing the state's housing system. They are acting as mentors and role models for youth, guiding them towards available resources, productive choices, and creating opportunities for youth to successfully transition to adulthood. Now therefore, be it resolved that I, Ann Schwab-Meir, the City of Chico, on behalf of the City Council, join advocates and communities across the country in taking action to prevent youth homelessness and runaways, and do hereby proclaim November 2020 as Homeless and Runaway Youth Year. I hereby proclaim November 2020 as Homeless and Runaway Youth Awareness Month, and do commend this observance to all citizens. Thank you for the work that you do for this vulnerable population. Thank you so much. On behalf of the Homeless and Runaway Youth Task Force, the staff and clients of the Sixth Street Center for Youth and the Heart Program, we thank you for your support in proclaiming this Homeless and Runaway Youth Awareness Month. Thank you. Thank you. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Attendance of the meeting, the public may attend the meeting in and speakers must sign up to speak by checking in at one of the speaker card tables located in City Hall. All speakers will be given instructions to queue in the speaker line. Please follow instructions accordingly. People who are coming into the Council Chambers to speak must wear a facial covering. Remote public participation during the meeting. The public may view the meeting on Comcast Channel 11 or via streaming video found on the City's website. With remote public participation tonight allowed in the following ways. Public comment will also be accepted by email and can be sent to publiccomments at chiccoca.gov during the meeting prior to the close of the public comment on an item. The public is encouraged to comment on the item. The public is encouraged not to send more than one email per item and not to comment on numerous items in one email. Are there any corrections to the agenda? Mayor, I'm interested in shortening the meeting if there are some items that we can put off one more time. And I'm looking at the two most contentious items. If that might be delayed for two weeks. As you know, I had four items that Council had approved to be agendized. And I'm quite happy that all those items will be at the next meeting. And so I would just want to test the Council's interest in delaying the ad hoc committee final report and the park fees. Thank you. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. I'll second that. Okay, so there's been a motion and a second to table items 5.1 and 5.3 till our next meeting. I'll be opposing this motion. I appreciate that it will pass and people would like to be home and looking over results in the election. However, we continue to put off so many of our agenda items. We refuse to work past 10 o'clock and this is another example of putting our business, our personal business here and wanting to get out to an election and observe the results and passing on our responsibilities. So I'll be opposed. Other comments before we take the vote? Madam Clerk, will you please call the roll or call the vote? Okay. Okay. Council Member Huber? No. Council Member Morgan? No. Council Member Ori? Aye. Council Member Reynolds? Aye. Council Member Stone? Nay. Vice Mayor Brown? Aye. Mayor Schwab? Aye. Carries 4-3. So items 5.1 and 5.3 will be tabled to our next meeting. Madam Clerk, will you let the folks that are over in City Hall? And will City Hall know that in case anybody has signed up to speak to those items? And we did have some people. Okay. While we're doing this, I'm going to move that we put off 5.2 as well. If we're going to do it, let's do it. If we weren't going to be here, we should have just opened the meeting, told everybody we were going to close it and then left. Right. And we put it on the agenda. We told people to come. Got it. We've had a very big meeting. We've had a very big problem with agenda management. I think that's the reason. For a variety of reasons. And I think that's the reason why we should do it. Because we told people. But then we're splitting the baby. We're like, well, we won't do these, but we will these. The park fees and the rules and regulations isn't okay, but marijuana is. Let's either do it or not do it. Because right now we just look dumb. So I will make the motion that we also delay 5.2. I'll second that. So my opposition is simply that we've already passed the campus ordinance. This is a fee structure. It means that we take applications the third week in January rather than the second week in January. So to me it's one that can be, should be passed. Anyway, that's why I would oppose it, how it differs. I was supposed to delaying 5.1 and 5.3 and I'm opposed to delaying 5.2. So I'm sorry, I'm not going to support you on that. So I will hear a motion and a second, correct? Any other discussion before we take a vote? Okay. Council Member Huber? No. Council Member Morgan? No. Council Member Orry? No. Council Member Reynolds? Yes. Council Member Stone? Nay. Vice Mayor Brown? No. Mayor Schwab? No. Fails 2-5. So we will hear item 5.2 this evening. Okay. Let's start with the consent agenda. The consent agenda is for items routine in nature and can be enacted in one motion. Are there any council disqualifications or no votes on the consent agenda? I would like to pull item 2.1. I just have a quick question on 2.3. Well, let's, okay. I guess we will pull that as well. Are there any speakers for the consent agenda? No. And were there any comments sent electronically? No. Okay. Okay. So I will entertain a motion for approval of the consent agenda, which is item 2.2. Okay. Move to approve. Second. Council Member Reynolds, Vice Mayor Brown is the second. Okay. Just a second. Oh, excuse me. I, there's one that just came in for consent and it was Patrick Newman to speak. Okay. Then let's bring in Mr. Newman and allow him. Before we do the vote? Okay. Before we take the vote because we don't know if it was what item. Okay. Okay. So I will entertain a motion to approve the consent agenda. Okay. Mr. Newman is second of Mr. Newman's einf норм of Mr. Newman of Mr. Newman of Mr Newman of Mr Newman of Mr Newman of Mr Newman of Mr Newman of Mr Newman of Mr Newman of Mr Newman of Mr Newman of Mr Newman of Mr Newman of Mr Newman of Mr Newman of Mr Newman of Mr Newman of Mr Newman of Mr Newman of Mr Newman of Mr Newman of Mr Newman of Mr Newman of Mr Newman of Mr Newman of Mr Newman of Mr Newman of Mr Newman of Mr Newman of Mr Newman of Mr Newman of Mr Mr Newman of Mr Newman of Mr Newman of Mr Newman of Mr Newman of Mr Newman of Mr Newman of Mr Mr Newman of Mr Newman of Mr Newman of Mr Newman of Mr Newman of Mr Newman of Mr Newman of Mr talk. We think somehow it needs the convenience of being able to go over here. I'm having a real hard time hearing you. Okay, I'll speak louder, I'm sorry. You missed some good stuff right there. So, yes. Your shelf is waiting a little bit. The mic is holding it. Sorry. So, I just think, I mean, Mark Stemmen ought to be here to oppose the airport also. So, these statistics that I just dug out, a shuttle would use about a fifth of what it takes to fly to any nearby airport. I thought I was hallucinating when I suggested that we use this airport to do hops to San Francisco. And I started talking to friends and they said, sure we did. It's crazy to use aircraft to make those short hops. This is not a major hub. We're not a major city. We don't need an airport. It's an expense. It's an expense to the city. It's environmentally unsound. And I just want to say that one more time. Thanks a lot. Thank you. So, that's the end of the public comment. Ready for a vote? Okay. Council Member Huber? On 2.2. On 2.2. Council Member Morgan? Yes. Council Member Ori? Aye. Council Member Reynolds? Aye. Council Member Stone? Aye. Vice Mayor Brown? Aye. Vice Mayor Schwab? Aye. Carry 7-0. Okay. Items pulled from the consent agenda 2.1, approval of amendment to city of Chico budget, appendix B1 and B3. Mr. Morgan? So, my question is probably for Jamie. And it's just for my own whatever. So, it says this is cost neutral. So, the engineering tech and the GIS analysts make equal salaries? It's cost neutral, sir, for the general fund budget. It does have an increase to the restricted budget that it falls underneath. So, overall, yes? Correct. Okay. And then my second question, and this is, we've approved a lot of these. They don't always come with a 21-page report. What was that all about? The 21-page report is the accompanying B3 and B1 appendices. I felt weird to just attach each individual page that we changed to the documents. So, I provided the entire document to our council. Thank you. Other questions? No. I'll move to approve 2.1. Second. Oh, that was a... I heard Mr. Stone first for the second. Council Member Huber? Yes. Council Member Morgan? Yes. Council Member Orry? Aye. Council Member Reynolds? Aye. Council Member Stone? Aye. Vice Mayor Brown? Aye. Mayor Schwab? Aye. Carries 7-0. Item 2.3. Acceptance of California alcohol and beverage control grant. Mr. Orry? Yes. Chief, if you wouldn't mind. I noticed there's a gap from the last time we got the funding and the excellent report that talked about how it's a hit and miss kind of thing. Is there ABC visits? Is there a program in the city? And this is a hit and miss kind of thing. an increase over what ABC normally does? Or is this, we just haven't had it recently and now we get to get it back with this special grant? Yeah, I haven't seen any grants come along away from ABC for quite some time. ABC is its own state of California entity. So they work up and down the state. This is specifically a grant for the Chico Police Department to work the underage drinking operations. So it's really a shoulder tap program to make sure that our licensed businesses in town are adhering to the rules and not selling to underage. So there is no price match with this. It's just a $19,000 grant that our school resource officers will work some of these operations for the remainder of the year. I got that part. The part I was trying to figure out if this is, if we've had none of that going on or if you have 30 citations in a year, there's been a dozen in the past couple of years. I'm just throwing numbers out there just to try to figure out, has there been a presence by ABC in Chico over the last two or three years? We've seen ABC, they usually, where they're focused is usually our big popular weekends where we have real issues. I haven't seen them personally in a while dealing with the underage drinking though. I think they're pretty focused when they come to town with the regulatory issues with the bars and restaurants and the underage drinking. And then some of our college aged issues. Thank you. Yes, sir. I move approval. Second. Just a moment. Council Member Huber. Yes. Council Member Morgan. Yes. Council Member Ori. Aye. Council Member Reynolds. Aye. Council Member Stone. Aye. Vice Mayor Brown. Aye. Mayor Schwab. Aye. Carry 7-0. So business from the floor, members of the public may address the council at this time on any matter not already listed on the agenda with comments being limited to three minutes or as determined by the mayor based on the number of speakers. The council cannot take any action at this meeting on requests made under this section of the agenda. How many members of the public wish to address the council? We have seven in person. Okay. And we received one public commenter, comment via email from Nicole Nava. Okay. So we have seven people. We'll let everyone speak for three minutes. Okay. So our first speaker is Robin Engle followed by Rob Berry and then Brian Letso. Hi. Good evening. I just first want to say that I'm disappointed that two really big issues were dropped. There are five of us out there in the cold waiting to speak and I did spend time preparing arguments for these items. So it would be nice if you considered, if you as a council considered the public when dropping items and the fact that some of us do prepare, to speak on them and are here for that. And knowing that there's going to be a new council next time around, we don't even know if these issues will be brought back. I certainly hope they are. Well, I don't hope 5.3 is ever brought back again. But that aside, I just wanted to raise the point that we are in a crisis. We are in a housing crisis. There's no crisis of the homeless. There's a housing crisis. Okay. Thank you. And in 2017, there were an estimated 134,000 homeless people. I'm sorry. Yeah, I meant to reframe the wording. 134,000 victims of our homeless crisis. And of course, we know this is before the campfire, which put another 27,000, I believe, into homelessness overnight. As Mayor Schwab said, 200,000 children, youth, I think you said, are homeless in California alone. We know that the pandemic has brought hundreds or thousands more to the streets. It's getting worse and worse. This is not a fault of any particular type of human being. This is a fault of the greater system and a lack of housing. There's a lack of affordable housing. There's a lack of housing, period. I have friends who want to move to Chico, and I tell them, no, you can't. You can't find a place to live, period. There's no housing. 6,000 high-rises or units down the pipeline is no assurance of anything except developers expect that parents of college kids are going to keep shelling out all sorts of ungodly amounts of money for their kids for remote schooling, and that's not going to happen. We need to fix the problem by common sense, and it's not a political issue. It's a human kindness and decency issue. Everyone deserves housing. Everyone has the right to housing. We can't survive without housing, food, shelter, and fire or heat. It's also getting really cold out there. Please keep in mind there are people who are starting now to freeze at night, too. This issue is not going away. . . . . Council, thank you very much. Thank you. Who's up? I want to apologize for any inconvenience you may have had. We do have one more meeting of this council, and I would fully expect that these two items would be in front of us in two weeks. Thank you. Okay, I forgot there was a second meeting in November. Thank you, Carl. Thank you all. Rob Berry, followed by Brian Letzow, then Larry Halstead, Patrick Newman. Well, good evening. Tonight is election night. There's something going on out there that's actually more important than what's going on in here. And I'm really looking forward to a change of personnel, a change of agenda, a focus on the community's needs, and now... I'm going to stop what has been going on here. A constructive conversation about how to fulfill the obligations of city government to its citizens and not pandering to the needs of a few at the expense of almost everyone else. So I'm going to be paying attention to the returns tonight. I'm sure you will, too. Going to miss you, Carl. Have a good evening, everyone. Brian Letzow, Larry Halstead, Patrick Newman, and then Charles Withoon. Is Mr. Letzow here? Yes, he's in a... Sure. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I have one outlet and that one is broken. It recently became broken in the last month or so. But there are no other stations for me to power up my wheelchair. I had to have somebody go and fill my meds up Sunday because I didn't have enough power to get there. I'd like to see more stations or outlets put in, strategic points at least, you know. I feel that, you know, these cars have power supplies. Why can't I? You know, I have important business also, you know, no different than anybody else. Or if I just want to go to lunch. Either way, I should have the right to get there and get home. As it is, I can't travel outside a certain distance and be able to. I can't make it home. Your consideration of this matter would be greatly appreciated. Thank you. Thank you. Larry Halstead followed by Patrick Newman. Good evening, Mayor, City Council, staff, and good citizens, and hopefully all voters of the City of Chico. It is indeed an incredible opportunity to come here on such an incredibly historic night, especially on such an important day. I want to thank you all for joining us tonight. Tonight's the night we're going to find out across this country if hate wins or if love wins. We're going to find out if we care about our fellow brothers and sisters or if we don't. And nowhere is that going to be discovered more than here in the city of Chico. Chico has a lot of crisis going on with the homeless. They've got the crisis going on with the police accountability. They've got the crisis going on with the drug problem. And unfortunately, we've had people come in here with all their hate. They've organized. They've got outside money. We're going to see whether or not hundreds of thousands of dollars and outside developer-type money, people that want to engage in the war against homeless, are going to win or if love's going to win. You know, when you go to the farmer's market, you sure do run into a really good sampling of the big heart that the people of Chico have. Most people in Chico care about the homeless. They care about the environment. They care about helping one another. But the fact is that no matter how the lines have been drawn here in the city council, this city and the city council are in the dark ages on all of these issues. The police accountability is way out of control. You've got an incredibly bloated budget for the police. And yet I'm wondering, are you guys even paying attention to what all of the issues and how they've been resolved in the past? Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. I'm the most familiar with and got me studying police accountability for the past 20-some years is the Taisha Miller matter. December 28, 1998, Riverside police murdered this poor girl while she was unconscious in her sleep. It became a huge, big issue, nationwide issue. And it ended up costing that city millions and millions of dollars. But what I would urge you is to get a hold of Mayor Loveless and find out what he's talking about there. You know, he's saying there's been a police accountability, and he's saying there's been a police accountability review that grew out of that, and they're still active. They've done a massive amount of policies on police accountability. This city doesn't seem to know about any of this. They're showing grace ignorance, and we just hear law and order, law and order, like that's going to help. The same is true with the homeless issue. You guys are all ignoring the directives of Gavin Newsom. He said to the cities, he couldn't be more clear, again, go read his State of the State speech. You guys will create it, and he'll step in and do it for you. You guys are doing all the wrong answers. You've got a bloated budget. You think you're throwing money at the agencies. You're not helping the homeless. It's a war on homeless, and it needs to end. Thank you very much. Patrick Newman followed by Charles Withoon and then Jeff Creed. Um... This human rights in the public space issue is the most frustrating, demoralizing, depressing thing that I think a person can touch. Because it means trying to advocate for people and then meet them every Sunday for five years while we watch them die on the streets. It makes me a little deranged at times. And sometimes I leave the council meetings and I have a pretty good feeling about what I said. Other times I leave and it's not so good. So the last time I was here, I sort of castigated the entire council in a sweeping broad brush kind of way that I'm not comfortable with. I think a lot of you did really hard work during these last two years. On some painful human rights issues. Emergency sheltering was one of them. Heating and cooling centers. Mostly Mr. Stone, who also worked on some decriminalization stuff. Scott, without you, we would have no restrooms. Other than the ones that were put in due to COVID. And it took courage to stand up for that, especially right after the campfire when the entire focus was on the campfire. We still got some 24-hour portable toilets, which after three or four years of fighting for that, it was small, but it was meaningful. And Alex, you have worked really hard on trying to decriminalize our system. I think any effort like that ran into a buzzsaw with needles. And the kind of rage that that brought. I think it made it politically impossible to move forward with that. What decriminalization we could have achieved. I think that it was also courageous to align yourself with the CDC on shelter in place. And however much backlash there's been from the community, at least for a few months, some people had the right to rest. It's profoundly important. And several others of you have supported the people who have led in these ways. And I want to say that I appreciate that. Thank you. Thank you. Charles Withoon followed by Jeff Creed. Good evening Council, staff. Thank you very much for this opportunity. I've been very proud to have been part of this. I believe it would be very beneficial and fruitful to get on a future agenda. I want a discussion or an explanation made public about the criteria used in the homeless opportunities plan that rendered certain city parcels not viable. I submit the criteria that was used may have been valid under previously typical circumstances. How can you make these important decisions with a backdrop of the campfire, the bear fire? COVID, I think, has changed the landscape. It should change the criteria of how we pick city properties for campgrounds and tiny home villages. I hope that can be on a future agenda soon, or I would really appreciate a response in writing. I would like to know why the Internal Affairs Committee members, from the Internal Affairs Committee members, why there was no response to the proposal for a campground of a vacant city property at the northeast corner of Hicks and Eaton. It was suggested that by one of the members of the property may be used for a new road remodel for a roundabout at that intersection. But today, I was in contact with the project manager of that project, Noel Carvalho, who contradicts that suggestion. He said, I quote, yes, that parcel is a city property, which will be minimally impacted. And he sent me the Caltrans-approved site plan. And if you compare that with Google Earth, it looks like the main impact is that this property will get a curb and gutter. So this is a vacant city property that is already fenced and graded. This is a location where a campground could be operational in a matter of weeks. And it was not even on the table at the Homeless Opportunities presentation. I would like some explanation on that score, as would Leanne, Lizzie, Annette, Vanessa. I'm sorry. I know too many women about 60 years old who are sitting outside tonight. Have a good night. Our last speaker is Jeff Creed. Howdy, howdy, howdy. I didn't want you to feel alone tonight, so I thought I'd come discuss some failures we've been seeing in the past. Big surprise, right? I'm always here talking about failures, but you've had two years. What have you done in two years to meaningfully impact this city in a positive way? So let's look at some of the things they talked about before me. Somebody's talking about Farmer's Market and how it's all these lovely people who support homeless. I go to Farmer's Market not every week, but the interesting thing about Farmer's Market, I've never seen a homeless person there. There was one guy there begging like three years ago, and a redhead chased him off. So what are they doing at Farmer's Market to chase off the homeless people? Because I remember being homeless, and if I were homeless, I'd be at Farmer's Market. There's a lot of cash flowing around, a lot of handouts. That's a perfect place to beg, perfect place to pander. And so what are they doing at Farmer's Market Saturday mornings? What's going on Saturday morning? Where are all the homeless Saturday morning? Question for you. The other person was talking about his wheelchair getting around town. So I had the misfortune of not being able to get an Uber Sunday morning. No cars available for like two hours. So I walked, right? And I walked, and you know, the VA took a year to get an MRI on a knee injury, so walking wasn't fun. And I walked all the way down the Esplanade. And it was interesting. I dare any of you to sit in a wheelchair and have somebody push you down the Esplanade from Enloe to downtown. I dare you to sit there in the wheelchair with your hands crossed and be pushed down the sidewalk. Now, I started complaining about the sidewalk downtown a while ago, and lo and behold, it got fixed. But why does somebody like me need to start raising these questions? That's your job to direct these people to get that stuff done without needing input. You guys are a complete and utter failure. I lost my timer, so I don't know where I'm at. We're at about a minute and ten seconds left. So public toilets. Public toilets. I've talked about public toilets a few times, and specifically Devil's Triangle. I put up another video on YouTube the other day when I drove by Devil's Triangle. We have the pile of trash, because there's no dumpster, and I've spoken to Public Works, and they won't put a dumpster because it's too dangerous. But there's nothing stopping me. There's nothing stopping you from putting barricades on the road there and taking the two lanes to one lane so you can put in dumpsters and porta-potties. There was one porta-potty all the way around the corner on the other side of the creek that was knocked over. Then I go down to Esplanade and Window Channel, and there's a porta-potty there, and it was totally trashed out. There's a dumpster there that you can't go near because the trash is all piled around the dumpster. That dumpster's never been used. There's always been trash around there. So what have you done? The porta-potty even out here in the Farmer's Market parking lot has been gone for a couple weeks. So when you're sitting here saying you've done these things, what have you actually done in two years? Thank you. That's the end of our business from the floor. We will move to public hearings, 4.1, public hearing of the 2019-20 Consolidated Annual Performance and Evaluation Report, other name is known as CAPER. And we have a report from Mary Jo Alonzo, a housing specialist. Good evening. Mr. Mayor of einf норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм I'm Mary Jo Alonzo, Housing Specialist for the City. As a condition of receiving federal funding through the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, the City is required to prepare and submit a Consolidated Annual Performance Evaluation Report, referred to as the CAPER, at the conclusion of each program year. The purpose of the CAPER is to report on the progress in carrying out the City's five-year strategic plan for both CDBG and home programs, as well as reporting on specific achievements of the Annual Action Plan and the City's actions to further fair housing. The CDBG accomplishments during the program year included spending approximately $442,000, and the highlight of this funding was a large increase in the number of low- and moderate-income small businesses that received training and counseling services, provided through the Small Business Development Center. The Center reported that 13 full-time and 11 part-time positions were created, and 201 jobs were retained. The increase in demand was directly attributed to the pandemic. From March through June, 242 requests for consulting services were received from struggling business owners and entrepreneurs in the City of Chicago. Of the 242 requests for assistance, 72 met the City of Chicago CDBG income requirements. As we're aware, COVID played a huge role in meeting program accomplishments this year. Public service agencies were hugely impacted, and two sheltering organizations, both True North and Catalyst, reported less individuals assisted due to the need to keep the shelter numbers low to meet physical demands. On the other hand, the demand for public services provided by agencies such as Meals on Wheels, Peg Taylor Center, CHAT, and Community Action Agency all exceeded their planned goals for the year. Some of these organizations also received an allocation of CDBG-CV funding to be used specifically to prepare, prevent, and respond to COVID. These program funds will be reported in next year's Keeper Report. And here we go, moving on to the Home Program. The City expended close to $171,000 by assisting 17 households with the Tenant-Based Rental Assistance Program, and the fifth and sixth Habitat for Humanity homes on East 20th Street were completed. Due to COVID, the services provided through the CDBG and Home Programs were impacted last year. As I had mentioned, the number of businesses assisted increased as well as the demand for public services . We also saw an increase of code enforcement cases . This enforcement coupled with other City improvements and services is expected to arrest the decline of low- and moderate-income areas of Chico . Tebra was very close to meeting the annual goal by providing assistance to 17 households last year. The number of homes added fell short, but we will see three of those homes, Habitat for Humanity homes on Mulberry Street, those will be completed next year and reported on. The homeowner rehabilitation program connected less than the anticipated homes, but staff has recently been working to engage the newly annexed areas of Chapman and Mulberry, and we've invited low and moderate income owner-occupied homeowners to participate in the sewer assistance program. We're expecting an increase in services for that this coming year. Moving on to fair housing, four fair housing educational workshops were facilitated by our partners, Legal Services of Northern California. and North Valley Property Owners Association. They saw a higher turnout last year because two of the workshops were conducted virtually due to COVID. The city continues to provide fair housing referrals to local, state, and federal investigative authorities, and we continue to publish information on our website and imprinted brochures regarding fair housing policies within the city. And wrapping up, the full CAPER report was included in the agenda packet, and it is available to the public. The public notice was published in the Enterprise Record on October 19th, which incurred public participation in the document through tonight's meeting at the close of the public hearing. Any comments that were received will be incorporated in the report. Upon close of the public hearing tonight, it is requested that council approve submission of the report to HUD. And this concludes my report. Happy to answer any questions. I hope that you may have any questions from council. Thank you. So we will open the public hearing. Did we have any comments submitted electronically? No. And do we have any speakers here? No. So we will close the public hearing in looking for authorization to submit the CAP. Move your... Sorry. Am I hearing? Can somebody else say something? No. Okay. Sorry. I'll move to approve, actually, to approve sending this off. Second. We have a motion by Council Member Stone, second by Council Member Orry. Ready for a vote? Council Member Huber? Yes. Council Member Morgan? Yes. Council Member Orry? Aye. Council Member Reynolds? Aye. Council Member Stone? Aye. Vice Mayor Brown? Aye. Mayor Schwab? Aye. Vice Mayor Brown? And zero. Okay. So regular agenda 5.1 has been tabled. 5.2 is establishment of new fees for the commercial cannabis program. A report from Chris Constantine, Assistant City Manager. Good evening, Council. I won't go into depth. We approved two ordinances and a resolution to implement the commercial cannabis program. The first set of fees that we need to put into place before we can start the program relate to the initial applications background. We норм einf норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм about how we're approaching the process. We have a dedicated site. We're doing frequently asked questions so that if there's a question about a fee or anything else, we're addressing it consistently across the board. And once you approve these, if you approve them tonight, we anticipate opening the application process next week with a 45-day closure occurring during the holiday, which carries over to the next business day, which will be the earliest January 4th of next year. Any questions? Okay. I'm confused by a little bit of this. $8,700 for other business-type application fees. Kind of simple about all this. It seems to me there's two kinds of businesses generally. It's a delivery service and a retail. Yes. So would this $8,700 be what we would charge for an application fee? Yes. Yes. Is that somebody that provides a delivery service? There's five different business types. The main one is the one that has a restricted number of permits, which is four, the commercial storefront retail. The remaining four business types are separate. They still have to go through a pretty laborious process, but they have their, depending on the zoning of where they land, are permitted by right, but still have to go through a compliance check. Still would have... Still have to go through the compliance check. So they still go through a process similar, to the storefront retail, just not as extensive. So that $4,8700 would be applied to a delivery service? Correct. Thank you. Other questions or comments? I have a quick question, Mr. Constantine. You said that you've dealt with a group of professional experts on this, and you said the people in the field are happy with it. I was wondering if you could comment on maybe, who some of those people are and who exactly these experts are that we're dealing with. The experts we use are HDL. We've contracted with them for sales and property tax services for many, many years. They hired one of the foremost experts in revenue to open up their cannabis program. They implemented 200 different programs related to cannabis. We felt that when the council desired to go in that direction, we engaged them because they are the experts in the field, and this is a very regulatory type environment. We've never developed an ordinance like this before. So they helped develop the ordinances, the regulations, the requirements, and then have helped us put together an application process which is objective and defensible in the case that we award and are challenged. In terms of the people in the field, we've received input and comments from more than a dozen different firms, and questions, what not. We did that. We didn't engage them to develop the program outside of the committee structure, but we received numerous comments about, hey, we really appreciate your website. We appreciate the level of details. We've seen how we calculated the fees. Those look very reasonable compared to other cities. We haven't received any negative comments from folks that would potentially apply about how we're approaching this process. Okay. So I think that when we started on this road, there was, not that this is necessarily my thing, but there was a lot of people that really wanted preference for local businesses and stuff like that. So I think it's just important to know who exactly is, if we have large companies like MCO Solutions, who's out there pouring thousands of dollars into our political campaigns, if they are having input on making these fees, I think that's just important for the community to know. So absolutely not. Nobody that would be a part of this process had input in developing the fees. This was strictly internal. And our contracted consultants that helped us put the process together. Perfect. Thank you for clarifying that. No other questions. How many, did we have any electronic comments? We did. We received three public comments to the email account from Nicole Nava, Jennifer Pratt, and Max Del Real. And then we have one speaker in person. Okay. Doug Roberts. And then we didn't receive anything via Engaged. Okay. Oh, excuse me. Yeah, Doug Roberts. Okay. So as Mr. Roberts comes in, we'll give an opportunity for council to read the emails that were submitted. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mrn норм норм норм норм норм норм норм норм Mrn норм норм норм норм норм норм Mrn норм норм норм норм норм норм Mrn норм норм норм норм норм Mrn норм норм норм норм Mrn норм норм Mrn норм норм Mrn норм норм Mrn норм норм Mrn норм норм Mrn норм норм Mrn норм норм Mrn норм норм Mrn норм норм Mrn норм норм Mrn норм норм Mrn норм норм Mrn норм норм Mrn норм норм public hearing and entertain a motion to entertain a motion. I move approval of the resolution. Second. I have a motion. Let me speak to the motion. Sure. I'm going to oppose. I think there's unintended consequences, I think, through this fee structure, particularly the $8,700 for delivery service. Now, you know, I try to follow all the rules and state guidelines on all this, and so if I understand correctly, if you're coming from a city where you have been approved, you can deliver to Chico. And, in fact, that happens today. That state regulations, rules, allow delivery services, to come to Chico without any review, without any application fee. I have a hard time believing that other services will come in and compete at a cost of $8,700. So that's one of the unintended consequences that I see with this, is that it's an invitation to ignore or not to be regulated and reviewed by Chico just because of the... large fee. And then I think something similar on the $10,000 as an application fee plus ancillary fees. I don't know. I guess if we were going to award something as many as four retail, and I wouldn't be surprised if we don't initially award all of them, that you would want a pool of applicants maybe twice as large so you could have some choices that were not what we're setting up, is, you know, pay to play. That, you know, if you've got $10,000, you've got a pretty good shot at getting a permit. And if you don't, we don't want to hear from you. And it seemed like there was another layer that we would need where maybe we go through some kind of process where we limit it to the four or five or six that most likely, and they pay the $10,000 fee, and so I just don't see that we are going to get the pool of applicants that gives us a good healthy choice of local folks, of other criteria, and instead we're going to be, you know, it's a lot of money. And maybe I'm being naive. Maybe a franchise to sell cannabis in Chico is well worth $10,000. But it does seem to me that we are, that there may be unintended consequences with the curriculum. And that's a very important proposal. Council Member Ortega. If you don't mind. No, I appreciate your comments and don't disagree with many of them. I guess I have a question for staff, which is, how do these fees compare to communities of our size or near our size that have regulated successfully? So as I mentioned earlier, folks that would be applying had not, have provided positive comments about the fees. I think you received a letter today and two weeks ago about the fees being reasonable and in line with other cities. Sure. Have we done that research ourselves? No, we have not because the premise here is what's the cost for the city of Chico to provide this. And so you're seeing a fee that's cost recovery. I need to address the question of delivery specifically. Delivery is no longer allowed once this permit program goes into the process. You must have a city of Chico permit to be able to do delivery within the city. So in terms of the unfair competitive advantage, if you're coming from the outside, you wouldn't have a competitive advantage over a local business, doing delivery from locally. So the existing distribution, distributors, whoever they are, maybe they're in some kind of state register, I don't know. I hope our PD knows who they are, would become illegal upon, well, since mid-October? So do delivery within the city of Chico once these, or once we proceed with this actually, you must have a permit through the city of Chico. That's not my understanding of the law. I feel like we had this conversation at a previous meeting that we cannot ban out of the area deliveries within the city of Chico. Am I missing something? You know, we can look at the regulations again, but I'm very strongly based on what the regulations say is, once we implement the regulatory structure in place with regards to delivery, our regulatory structure takes precedence in terms of those requirements being on any delivery service. Thank you. Mr. City Attorney, could you speak to that item? I just am remembering a conversation previously about this. Yeah, I don't recall, I do recall a conversation about it. I don't recall off the top of my head what the ordinance says specific to this issue, but it is something that we could look at and bring back. Okay. Okay. So. Mr. Rory, I appreciate your comments too, and I appreciate where they come from, knowing that we, I think one of our desires is if we're getting into this business we'd like it to be local people. I feel like I've gotten a good level of feedback from local businesses that may be engaged in this. And the fact that I haven't heard from any of them about this suggests to me that they're okay with it. Any other comments? Okay. Have the vote, please. Council Member Huber? Yes. Council Member Morgan? Yes. Council Member Orry? No. Council Member Reynolds? No. Council Member Stone? Aye. Vice Mayor Brown? Aye. Mayor Schwab? Aye. Carries 5-2. Item 5.3, this table until next meeting. Thank you. Thank you. Item 5.4, ratification of memorandum of understanding Chico management employees. Report from Jamie Cannon, Director of Human Resources and Risk Management. Leaving Mayor, Vice Mayor, City Council. The first item you have in front of you is the memorandum of understanding, I'm checking my order, pardon me, for our Chico management employees. As you know, this is our group of all the managers in the City of Chico. This agreement is pretty neutral. It equates to about a cost of $24.83 per employee per year. The big change of that cost is an increase to their opt-out benefit from $100 per month to $200 to be in line with our other bargaining groups. In addition, this group has decided to take on more of the City's CalPERS cost at 3% additional contribution in exchange for a cost-neutral salary increase of 2.68%. Happy to answer any questions. Questions? Okay. Did we have any comments submitted electronically? No. Okay. Let's see. 5.4. We did not, but we do have two speakers in person. Okay. Let's have them come in and they'll have three minutes each. So it is Robin Engle followed by Larry Halstead. Good evening again. Forgive my ignorance. I'm not exactly sure which staff are CME, but I do want to say what is concerning to me about this is that salaries will be set through December of 2023, and that is regardless of any fires, pandemics, anything else that we're talking about. And I know that there's some concerns, greater concerns in the community about retirement salaries, et cetera, for city staff, about salaries being not necessarily unfair for your jobs, but it's... Not relative... Not relatively equitable, excuse me, for Chico, where we have a severe housing crisis and we have a severe lack of jobs in general. So I... Again, I'm sorry, I don't know specifically what jobs I'm talking about... I'm addressing in general, but city employees are paid quite well. It's... It's widely known. And salaries and benefits retirement are quite hefty in relation to greater Chico. And again, I have a concern about this being set through December of 2023, regardless of circumstances. Just wanted to say that. Thank you. Thank you. Our last speaker is Larry Halstead. He left. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. I'm going to close the public comment and entertain a motion. I have a motion. I could speak to the motion. Yes, please. You know, I have to say that I've been very impressed over the last four years, the consensus of the council to hold salaries and hold hiring to a minimum. And I do appreciate... that that's more than four years, that there's been a consistent policy of this council going back probably eight years. And I fear that that's not going to be the consensus of the new council. I hope I'm wrong. But, you know, I think this is an example of how, yet again, there's no net increase in a paycheck to an employee. And actually, my only concern really is the opposite of Robins and that is that a three-year agreement is just takes so much time and effort for us to do these two and three-year agreements. I was fortunate in my term on the council that we had two back-to-back six-year agreements with all employee groups. It sure made life a lot more, you know, more difficult. It was consistent, more predictable. And so I'm, and you know I've urged that time and time again. So I do want to note that this is yet another three-year agreement, and I didn't see the term on the next one, so I'll ask you when we get there. I didn't go through the entire ordinance and the resolution to try to find it. But that's my only concern is the fact that we can't seem to, you know, that we keep you so busy. It is. I think we have now at this point 10 bargaining agreements for just under 400 employees. It's a primary focus of my position. It's really hard in labor relations to get a long-term agreement with no money on the table. I feel pretty successful, frankly, with three years. And it's challenging when we're not offering cost of living adjustments. I mean, as you know, it's been since 2008. So, but I appreciate your words. Thank you. Any other questions or comments? Have the vote, please. Council Member Huber? Yes. Council Member Morgan? Yes. Council Member Orry? Aye. Council Member Reynolds? Aye. Council Member Stone? Aye. Vice Mayor Brown? Aye. Mayor Schwab? Aye. Carries 7-0. Item 5.5 is ratification of pay and benefits resolution, public safety management. Ms. Cannon. Good evening. This is the other side of our management house. As stated in their title, this is our public safety employees. Our police lieutenants, police captains, as well as our deputy chief of fire. In this agreement, it is mostly housekeeping items, as well as letter agreement inclusion that have occurred throughout the year. And this agreement is cost neutral. It is a two-year term. Questions? Okay. Are there any comments submitted electronically? Yes, we did receive one comment from Bluebird House Cleaning. That was an email that was sent into your, each of your mail. You can see that there are no boxes. And, let me double check. No, we didn't receive any. There's no one in person to speak to this item. Does anybody need any additional time to review the email? We can entertain a motion. Motion to approve. Second. So we have a motion from Councilmember Huber and a second by Councilmember Reynolds. Councilmember Huber? Yes. Councilmember Morgan? Yes. Councilmember Ori? Aye. Councilmember Reynolds? Aye. Councilmember Stone? Aye. Vice Mayor Brown? Aye. Mayor Schwab? Aye. Carries 7-0. Okay. Go to Reports and Communication. We follow reports and communication items provided for the council's information. No action can be taken on items in this section as council agrees to include it on a subsequent agenda. City Manager's Report. Anything to report, Mr. Orme? Just really quick. Thank you, Honorable Mayor, members of the council. I know it's an exciting night for all of you. And so I just, I'll be quick. One, I just want to compliment the city team for collaborating on getting our dispatch up to date. I did an update on that this week. It'll probably come out tomorrow. But I will tell you that those that are working 24 hours a day or 7 around the clock to help ensure the safety of our community have a much more livable space to be in, our dispatchers and our records clerks and folks. So I just want to make sure and highlight that, because that took a huge collaborative effort between IT, public works, police, of course, and fire. Fantastic job. Secondarily, I just want to wrap back around on Vice Mayor Brown's question. And within our ordinance, I knew it wouldn't take but a couple of minutes for Mr. Constantine once he stepped away, to find out what the! Mr. Mr. Mr. future meeting. After stating what the item would be, a majority vote of council is needed in order for staff to agendize. Council members may also submit requests in writing. We had no written requests. Are there any verbal requests? I've got two. One, I'd like to agendize what the gentleman in the wheelchair came here earlier today, if there's an opportunity. He makes an excellent point, and Council Member Ory, you were shaking your head about the same rate that I was, which was, yeah, we provide these electric charging stations for cars. There's no reason why we shouldn't be doing something similar with wheelchairs. So where possible, I'd like staff to review some opportunities there. Do we want to take these individually? Any questions or comments? Is there a second to that request? Yes. Okay, so we'll take a vote. And this would be to agendize the discussion of additional power supplies. More power. More power. Power to the people. Council Member Huber? Yes. Council Member Morgan? Yes. Council Member Ory? Aye. Council Member Reynolds? Aye. Council Member Stone? Aye. Vice Mayor Brown? Aye. Mayor Schwab? Aye. Carry 7-0. Okay, next item I'd like to agendize, at least in the closed session portion, a review of the city manager. I note that it's been, I believe, three years since we've reviewed the city manager. I want to make sure that it's noted. There's nothing that's triggering that. It's just, I know, it's been three years since we last reviewed the city manager. We spent the last year reviewing the city attorney, and it's time. So I'd like to comment on that. Sure. For, I'm trying to think of how long it was. It might have been four years. Four years. I was chair of the city manager's review committee, and it was done every year. And then the council changed, and the chair changed, and it was never done. And in the last two years, we've pushed a lot of things. And we've had a city manager that's gone through a lot of stuff in the last four years in particular. He could probably go anywhere. And one of the greatest things that this council dropped the ball on was actually doing a review of his performance. He's got no idea how we think of him. One of the primary responsibilities of this body is to hire the chief executive. It is probably the primary. And we didn't do it. And I have, I'm equally guilty because I failed to bring it up because I didn't want to point fingers because it wasn't my responsibility. I don't think it needs to be agendized. The people in charge of it just need to do it. Yes. Right. The chair of that committee is Vice Mayor Brown. And Council Member Morgan and Schwab are on that committee. And again, I don't want to sound like I'm disparaging the committee. I'm just noting that it's been discussed at least a couple of times in the last year. And so I just want to make sure that it gets taken care of. So the process for that would be for the committee chair to call a subcommittee? Yes. Or call the committee? The committee can meet and decide how you want to do the evaluation. Yes. If you want to use the prior review documents and just move forward. And then once the committee has met, then that committee goes into closed session and meets with the full council. And then you bring in the city manager for the evaluation after that. So you don't need a motion to actually do that. The committee can just meet. I will send an email to the committee with immediacy. I couldn't hear that. But I will send an email to the committee with immediacy. I sent an email out to the city clerk to get more information a couple of months ago and have that information and I'll get the committee convened. If I could comment, I think one of my three appointments is chair of the city clerk's committee. You're doing a great job. Thank you. And I guess I didn't... Maybe we need... That standard, I didn't know it, that we want an annual review or maybe each council needs to determine whether they want an annual review. And it just does seem like it's kind of too late that to do a legitimate review, you would need... You would want to allow a month of comment and feedback discussion. And that in, what, 40 days, there'll be a new council. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.! Okay. The first one, as I think many of you know from correspondence, John Scott has asked that the discussion of poker room downtown be delayed until January or so to the new council. I don't know if an old council can obligate a new council to agendize something, but that won't be coming back to us. I don't, hopefully we won't have to have a meeting in two weeks to say that we're gonna postpone it and that it, you know, we'll put it on the lap in the new council. Yeah, does that sound right? That that would be, if a request of somebody is to delay the discussion that we'd just do it? Frankly, the agenda for next meeting is going to be quite lengthy because we have tabled these two items and have probably eight council member requests. So I guess we can take that under advisement as we're planning. I agree with Carl. Somebody shouldn't just get to put it where they want necessarily, but we have put again tonight, more things off. So my request for the next meeting, I don't know how to say this and not have it sound the wrong way, but somebody that understands how these meetings run, put together an agenda that doesn't force us to push off a bunch of people. I mean, it's been week after week, after week, after week. We're not gonna cover it. We're not gonna cover it. We're gonna go, we're gonna do it. Then now we're gonna put it, stop it. It's embarrassing. It's embarrassing to be part of a body that can't put together an agenda to get done by 10 o'clock and then move it. So whether we talk about the car house or not, let's have an agenda for the next meeting. The last one of this council, regardless of who wins and doesn't. That is actually done in a professional way. And we cover the things. We're supposed to. I don't think that pejorative language is called for, calling us unprofessional or embarrassing. I call us all unprofessional and embarrassing. My comment and I'll withdraw it. It's your problem is an advocate, a downtown business person who wants to have a business decision made by this council has asked that it be delayed until January. I could just do nothing and that's fine. I was just advising the council that I'm quite, I was just advising the council that I'm quite, I'm willing not to have that on the next agenda. It makes a lot of sense. And that there is this, maybe I'm just naive or purist or something that this current council shouldn't obligate the future council on agendizing items. And so, you know, there it is. That's all I had. Madam Clerk, could I look for some direction from you? Would it be appropriate for Councilmember Orre to request that that item not be heard? Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr You know, and so we can, it sounds like the business owner wants to wait, and he went through Council Member Ori to get that agendized, and they both asked for it to be delayed. Yes. Thank you. And as a body, we continue our business, irregardless of who is on the Council. So as I see it. And there's three of us that are still going to be here, so I will personally make a commitment knowing that I am still going to be here for two years to ensure that we get Mr. Scott's request on a future agenda. So you can pass the bill. I appreciate it. To Council Member Morgan's point, though, we are negatively amortizing our agenda items, right? We continue to stack on more and more without addressing these issues. They're continuing to pile up. They're piling up at a pretty record rate, yet we're leaving early tonight. So we know why the problem is there. We should fix it. You know, I would be curious, City Clerk, if it's handy. I would be curious, City Clerk, if it's handy. Not where you have to go back and count, but how many meetings this Council has had in the last two years? And compare that to any other previous two-year period of a Council? I can do that. From the campfire to COVID to redistricting, we have seen each other a whole bunch. And I don't think it's an agenda management issue. It's the fact that we're finally catching up. You know, it's the final deadline in two weeks. If we don't catch up, it's, you know, it boxes. It's unchecked. But, you know, I do very much appreciate the hard work of the last two years of this Council to meet time and time again to take care of the City's business. As long as we're keeping tabs or telling those meetings, we want to make sure that we note that there was a distinction in March that changed things. And so our agendas and our agenda management has not been consistent through two years. And I think I would also like to bring to everyone's attention the number of... council member requests made by this particular Council. And I think it's indicative of the things that we were trying to manage and the things that we were putting through. But in my history, maybe one item a month was brought by Council. And, I mean, even tonight we've heard two or three proposals. So that has been extraordinary. Do we have any... any other comments? So we have no closed session. So with that, we will adjourn to the... adjourn the regular City Council meeting on November 17th at 6 o'clock. Thank you.
