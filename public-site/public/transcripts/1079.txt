And I just want to pray for you this hot September. Father, we thank you so much for your love and your grace. I thank you so much for the willingness, Lord, of this council to serve.

And I pray that as we gather here, Lord, we look for your heart and your best for this city that you love. I pray, Lord, that we would come together on common grounds for the interests of all. And, Lord, where we have disagreement and find difference, God, I pray that in the end we'll prevail upon the unity we find, that we are all made in your image. And, Lord, you desire good things for our city. So, God, I just pray for a great meeting today. And I pray, Lord, that we would be encouraged by the work of the council today. In Christ's name. Amen.

And we'll move to a presentation, item 1.7 from the Youth Program Grants. Deputy City Manager Jennifer McCarthy. Good evening, Mayor Coolidge, Vice Mayor Reynolds, members of the council. I'm Jennifer McCarthy, Deputy City Manager for the City of Chico. In June of 2021, you directed staff to look into creating a program that would help offset the social, emotional, and mental health needs of school-aged youth in Chico that were impacted by the pandemic. And out of that came what we're referring to as the Youth Well-Being Program. This program was funded by one-time funds the city received through the American Rescue Plan. And with that $150,000, there was four grants that were awarded through a competitive process. These grant funds went to Girls. On the Run, the Salvation Army's Youth Music Program, the North State Composite Mountain Bike Team, and the Boys and Girls Club. To say your funds went a long way would really be an understatement. These organizations did an amazing job serving the youth within Chico. So with that, I'm going to turn it over to each of them to give you just a very brief explanation of what they were able to accomplish with these funds. So with that, I will turn it over to Girls. On the Run first. And you can all come up and line up behind her so that we can. Move through it. Thanks. Mayor Coolidge and council members, my name is Claire Johnson, and I'm the director for Girls on the Run in the North State. I'm just so grateful to be here tonight to show you what the impact was that your funds had on our girls here in Chico. Thanks to the grant, Girls on the Run was able to provide 228 girls with a place of normalcy that they really hadn't felt since before the pandemic. You see, Girls on the Run is way more than just a place to be. It's more than a running program. Our programs combine critical life skills with the power of running to teach girls the importance of nurturing their whole selves emotionally, mentally, socially, as well as physically. Helping them not only find ways to navigate this makes up world we're in right now, but learn how to thrive in it. And that we did. Studies tell us that girls' confidence peaks at nine years old and then it plummets. So that's what was going on. Even back when we started the program. before the pandemic, adding on a layer of that, the fact that they couldn't be with their friends in person or find an inspiring role model to help them through difficult situations. But your funds were able to make it so that we were able to really give those girls a positive and safe place. They learned how to get along with others. They learned how to boost their confidence, find friends, learn the power of giving back because every team does a community impact project, and realize their strength when they cross the finish line of the 5K. By helping Girls on the Run empower these young girls, you're helping build the next generation of strong, confident women. So in so many ways, you're actually building up our entire community with these funds. At a time when funds for programs like ours were being redirected for more important housing and food and shelter, it was so needed to have this funding gap so that we could continue to do what we're doing. And so I think that's what we're doing. We're trying to provide this program and make it affordable. So we're just so grateful that we were able to have that opportunity to bridge the gap. I do have Coach Marlia here with me and her daughter Renavia from one of our sites. Hi, thank you everybody. My name is Marlia and I'm going to read two statements today. The first is from my daughter Renavia and the second is mine. I am Renavia. I've been in Girls on the Run for three seasons. I like Girls on the Run because girls can learn and it builds up strength. I also like Girls on the Run because it's a good place for girls and because it helps you meet other girls. After Girls on the Run, I feel positive. And as a coach, I've been in Girls on the Run coach for three seasons now. Thank you so much for supporting this program. I love spending time with the girls and getting to know them, seeing them grow in their confidence in themselves. At the end of each season, they are more sure of themselves and ready to try new things with an attitude of, I can do this. Instead of being wary and just ready to give up. We learn lessons about empathy, inner beauty, compromise, and community service, all of which are extremely important for girls. So thank you again for supporting this program so that all girls could have the opportunity to participate. Thank you for what you guys do too. Thank you. Good evening. My name is Lieutenant Jeff Boyd. I'm with the Salvation Army along with my wife. We are the pastors and administrators. We are the community center. We desire to have a school of rock, but I'll tell you, we have one drum set, three donated guitars, three ukuleles, and one keyboard. So you can imagine with 14 children, it was hard to have lessons for this. But we aspire to have a school of rock. So when this opportunity came up for the grant funds, we jumped on it and were graciously awarded that. Now all of our children are able to have their own instrument during our group lessons. And they also, if they show the aptitude and they come for a certain amount of attendance, they actually take an instrument home with them to practice. Because it's not enough just to learn it for a 30, 45 minute lesson once a week. They get a hot meal. They get vocal training. We play in the beautiful gymnasium. And then they get group lessons. And then from there, they set up into little rock bands, little combo units. And so we've seen children go from not knowing an instrument at all to mastering one instrument and moving on to another. Helena started on the ukulele, which is, this is one that was bought with the grant funds. And she's now learning the guitar. Madison is still working on the guitar here. Little Isaac. He wanted to play the drums, but there wasn't any drums. So he went to the guitar class where they're sharing three guitars and there's seven kids. But now we have these electronic drum sets and we have a real teacher that's able to, so he's able to play drums. Carter started on drums and now he's learning the bass. And so we have options for kids to learn multiple instruments. And so we're so grateful for this opportunity. We've seen the kids open up. A lot of the kids, when they first come into the program, are very shy and reserved, not willing to maybe to participate in some of the group singing exercises. Um, as a kid, I'm not sure I've ever been in a group where I've been able to learn the guitar. I'm not sure I've ever been able to learn the guitar. As we've progressed in this, the kids have really come out of their shells. You see a lot of confidence. You see them on stage in performance settings and we see a lot of confidence. Helena went on to do a local competition and then went to Los Angeles in a regional competition and won first place for the ukulele. And Carter the same. He had a regional competition down in Concord, won first place there. And then we took them to Los Angeles where he competed on the drum set and won first place as well. So, just keeping these kids on the deal. This is all made possible through this fund. And we've actually set ourselves up where it's not just this year. Now we have all the instruments to be able to continue for years to come. So, thank you so much. Thank you. Congrats guys. Good evening. I'm Kelly Haight. I am the team director for the North State Composite Mountain Bike Team. Coach Ken Husky, Coach Andy Carden. Um, in our third year of operation as a team, COVID hit us pretty hard. Um, in a really good way. The team just exploded. It tripled in size. Um, all of the parents that were desperate for something for their kids to do that was fun and motion and outside. And we got so big we needed more space. So, we cleaned out our reserves and to get a trailer and then this grant came along. And we can't thank you enough. The grant refunded or repaid the reserves. We had money to operate the team. And in just a moment you'll hear a little bit about what that trailer looks like. In addition to the funds we had and the funds that we graciously got from you guys. We had a lot of local businesses pitch in to help us put solar on the trailer. Uh, buy tools. Wrap it with graphics. And so we can represent the team. Uh, we set it up for off-grid use so we can take it out to these remote areas where we ride. We have, uh, hot and cold running water. And we have lights. So we can, um, we can pack chairs and canopies. And we can prepare meals for the kids. And then get cleaned up after that. After a ride. And so we organized a series of trailer build days, um, with the goal that all of our athletes would do as much of the construction on the trailer as possible. Um, there was so many of the team that responded to the call. Uh, it was amazing to see the level of support and interest, um, from the athletes and their families. Um, after a quick meeting, everyone went to work. It was so rewarding to see their skills and the personalities come out. As we did these series of days together. Um, at the end of the day, there was a clear sense of accomplishment and ownership on everyone's faces. And now we take this trailer to our races and our events. And the kids that built it are there using the trailer. And, uh, it's been a huge, uh, benefit for our team. So if you help build the trailer, will you stand up? Carver, what'd you do? I did a lot of welding. Um, there may be others. Haylin? I have eight ones and I'm getting tired of running for my shoulders. I helped Carver with the welding, for sure. I just don't want to work it out. I also have the electrical one. I'm just... I have a lot of other things to do. I'm just... I'm getting tired of it. Get it over with. Get it over with. Get it over with. Get it over with. Get it over with. Get it over with. Get it over with. Get it over with. Get it over with. Get it over with. Get it over with. Get it over with. Get it over with.

Local artists did some great stuff for us. And then we also did CRIM trainings for our staff. We offered four trainings. That's the community resiliency model training. It's talking about how do we work with kids that have experienced trauma or are going through challenges and issues. How do we kind of talk them down from being at an unsafe area back down to a safe zone. So we did that, offered that for our staff and it's been huge. So just thank you to the City Council and to your support of the Boys and Girls Club. Proud of the work that we've done together and it just feels good to have your support. I'd like to turn it over to Garth who's got a little bit to share with you about his participation. Hey guys. So last year the Teen Center started a new program called Hope Squad and to be a part of this, members are nominated by their peers and staff. Members have to be trusted and positive influences at the club and in Hope Squad we not only work to for suicide prevention but we also try to support and get help to members who are struggling with all types of mental health. Right. We also plan and host events. Some of these included a week dedicated to self-care activities. We had guest speakers from Chico State to talk about suicide prevention. We designed numerous bulletin boards about mental health and we worked with Chico State themselves on mental health research for the state of California. And this Thursday we will be attending and supporting the stay event downtown. I was the first wave of sixth graders that ever made it to the Teen Center back in the school year 2016 to 2017. And we had absolutely nothing like this. Maybe one day we had a little blip about mental health but I didn't know what other people were going through and I felt like they didn't know what I was going through and I felt isolated from everyone else and that stuck with me for a bit. And I felt isolated from everyone else and that stuck with me for a bit. So I'd like to thank everyone on the school council , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,! , , , , , , just all of the groups, this is really the intention of these funds and of the council in terms of doing this. If you would all stand up, we just would love to see you standing and give you a round of applause for everything you do. Thank you. All right, thanks again. And yes, you can sneak out of the door. We've got a packed house tonight, so. All right, well, they're leaving. If everybody could, I'm going to go into the speaker card announcement. So if anybody, if everybody can just listen to this, because it does, anyone wishing to speak does relate to you. So anyone wishing to address the council on any matter listed on the agenda should first complete a speaker card, which can be found at the back of the room. Once you fill out that speaker card, you can turn it in and you can go to the next speaker card. So it'sаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетает but also do not applaud or boo any speaker at the podium. We ask you that so individuals can feel the sense to speak their mind and their free speech can be fulfilled. So we ask you not to snap, clap, applaud any speakers on any particular topic relative to stopping their free flow of thought as they decide to address us. So, all right. And then with that. Mayor, may I have one point of order? Sure. On closed session, I neglected to point out that the council and staff met on 2.8. There was an item that came up after the posting of the agenda. The council voted, was it 6 with one absent, 6-0 with one absence, to take up that item, and we discussed that item in closed session. No action was taken. Direction was given. All right. Thank you very much. Thank you. So moving on to the consent agenda, it's important to note that, that item 2.1 is being pulled, so we will only be voting on item 2.2. And these are consent agenda to be considered routine and nature can be enacted in one motion. Do we have any speakers on the consent? All right. Entertain a motion. Approved. Motion by Vice Mayor Rounds, second by Council Member Tandon. Madam Clerk, take the roll. Council Member Bennett. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Vice Mayor R Instituto Instituto Instituto Instituto Instituto Instituto Instituto Instituto Instituto Instituto Instituto Instituto Instituto Instituto Instituto Instituto Instituto Instituto Instituto Instituto how many speakers? We have six. Six, three minutes. Okay. And as I call your name, I'll call the first speaker and then I'll call the second one in the queue. And if you could go ahead and line up in the center aisle, that would be great. So starting would be Robin Engel, followed by Julie Three. Good evening. You can ignore hundreds or thousands of people in our community, but they won't die or disappear just because you want them to. You can ignore federal district judges and magistrates. You can argue with them as you have and refuse to respect them as you have. But we're still facing over 600,000 dollars at this point in time because of Warren versus Chico. And this continues. The final price tag will be surely astronomical. There are approximately 30 beds or more in the pallet shelter community. There is no reason for this. There have been many months to fill those beds. There are again hundreds or thousands of people in need of shelter. There is still no standardized comprehensive way of assessing people who are victims of the housing crisis so that they can be placed in the pallet shelter community. It's another thing you refuse to implement. We don't even have a cooling center. There has been one petty excuse after another. Today it reached 115, 113. The climate is fatal to all people. Institutions are Institutions are! Institutions Institutions Institutions Institutions Institutions Institutions Institutions Institutions Institutions Institutions Institutions Institutions Institutions date for the health care workers now i'm advocating for my mom jane williamson died august 15th four shots of moderna medical murder medical murder by moderna yeah my mom was dead she healthy woman she was shot by her by moderna in santa clara county she was on vacation in wyoming in her hometown literally monday the 15th woke up to go to the bathroom at six i ate my aunt her sister went in to give her coffee and she was dead light switch went off that's called cardiac sudden event otherwise known as medical murder luckily she died in wyoming and that wyoming state forensic pathologist dr tom bennett can confirmed cardiac amyloidosis from the lipid out of particles this stuff's toxic you guys need to do something about it you can you've got things you can do think about it when i leave here tonight okay these are the four batch numbers she got here's what i'm able to do with those batch numbers thanks to albert ben vidas he's a chico state grad of 1995 he created a portal on top of theirs it's like this i'll send you the link if anybody wants it you can put all these batch numbers in here get a relative toxicity my mom's were pretty toxic that first one if she would have known that 35 people died already from that first shot she would have never gotten the second one the third one the fourth one right 125 pounds killed her this is developed by a chico state grad so he and i are working together tomorrow on a couple things i run various reports all day long and take them to the county what we also did with the county is we FOIA we did a FOIA request got every single batch number that was released into this county all these batch numbers released into this county these are the toxic lots i'm going through them one by one painstakingly going into albert's portal i can tell you right now all of them have deaths associated with them in bears and we know bears is only one percent of the uh of the vaccine um entries okay so this is fraud willful misconduct good news is again i was able to meet dr david martin on friday night in yuba city he introduced me to stanford graham wonderful attorney they've got a capital murder case going on in a jurisdiction that's friendly with some sheriffs that are getting involved so i've got my mom's case going against santa claire county attached to that capital murder case so you county's got some willful misconduct that they've got to account for since again another lawsuit dr henry ely petition going on for the cdc for all of their false information the deaths that are being reported are false they're not coveted okay 22 of them in santa clara county they already found they were covered car accidents a whole bunch of things we've also done a FOIA request for butte county give me the names and the information on those death certificates we're going to match them up we're going to see who died in butte county who died or dr miller whoever was in charge of the time and then we'll have some conversation this stuff's toxic i implore anybody in this room do not take one more shot they're bioweapons we all know it's mainstream and yeah we got to do something about it i'll show you one last picture if this isn't if this isn't disturbing enough i'm on the daily cloud team with we're going through those visor documents and this one picture i'm going to show it right here this is a placenta ultrasound webbing around that placenta thank you Thank you. Don't take these shots. Thank you. Nicole Nava, followed by Katie Posey. Good evening, Council, City Manager. I am here to talk about health. So one thing is I want to recognize, as some others have, that September, National Suicide Awareness Month, and Sunday kicked off Awareness Week. And I think it is so refreshing to hear all the youth come in and say the good. I am all about the outputs. You guys know that. I always harp on the outputs. So I love when people circle back around to say how meaningful something was and what they actually did with the funding that they received. So thank you so much for those wise decisions. There are a lot of people that are alone and need to be checked on. There are people who still are worried about coming out of their home. Or maybe that just got very disconnected. So I just want to encourage the community to reach out and remind people that the new number is 988, much shorter than it used to be. And I want to do a plug that put it in your phone. Put it in your phone now or after this meeting. Because then when things are going on and there's a stressful situation, it can make you forget really easy things. So 988. Other health issues. So prior speakers were talking about. You know, the situation with the pallet shelter. And I do a check quite frequently on that. And I was lucky enough to tour the facility as well. Talk with their director. There were residents there greeting her left and right as we were moving through the facility. And there are beds available. Like, I appreciate that you guys post them. So I just want to share with the community that at the tourist shelter, there are 28 open beds. At the pallet shelter, there are 53 beds. Well, shelters. And so you would have 106 beds if people agreed to share. And then three beds over at the Jesus Center. We also have potentially, right, 100 more beds coming online maybe summer of next year with the renewal center. These folks are offered shelter as the camps have been cleaned. And quite a number refuse to go. So it would be good if people who are having connecting points with people out there. Could encourage them when the assessments occur. To really seek their health and wellness. It's important. It's been 112 as we all know. And we've been blessed enough to have AC. But I'm sure everybody's phone went wild like mine did tonight. With the emergency bulletin about conserving. And so we should be caring about all the humans. Some of these humans have been offered the space. But are traumatized and maybe afraid to take that leap. Or have other reasons for not wanting to go. But there are many of us who are out where we see them. And we can speak with them. And again, if we can just be that guiding light. To kind of say we believe in you. And we would love to see you get under that shelter. That would be fantastic. I think many of us do feel that way. I don't see it that you guys wish them ill. Thank you. Thank you. So Katie Posey followed by Jessica Giannola. Good evening, council. I've observed already that under the new city manager. We have seen dedicated cleanup of our city's public areas. As well as more transparency through meaningful communication with the public. Indicating the city is doing their best. To press forward and ensuring the parks and waterways are safe. And accessible for everyone to use as intended. In addition, the city manager and council seem to be continuing to work. To help these individuals. Those individuals staying in the camps getting connected to real help. We know this is at the end of last week. There were 87 minimum beds. Accountable per the settlement agreement. To allow for enforcement. To allow for enforcement. To allow for enforcement. To allow for enforcement. To allow for enforcement. Those numbers are at the end of last week. These scorching temperatures I truly hope. There are no more delays in the assessment process. So that these individuals can be in cold units. And receive case management services. We've seen some of the litter on the bike path cleaned up and disposed of. Which is a wonderful thing. One area of concern from people in our community. We know there are people who are still living on the bike path. So it's inevitable that they will have belongings. There's concern from some that the bike path is not safe. Or that the bike path is not accessible for other folks. And concern from others that the people on the bike path are in a precarious position. And need support. While it's positive to have periodic litter pickup days in these areas. I wonder if we can also think about being proactive in the way we can help those folks. Using the bike path as a living space to become more conscientious of the way litter affects the people and the environment. We know that there are concerns from those who use the bike path. And that the pile up of trash was a public health hazard. While we know the city can't clear the bike path of tents. And move individuals. Hopefully into better and safer spaces. With resources that they're in need of. Could we address people taking care of their trash. Since other people, animals and plant life are affected. I'm in no way suggesting that those who are unsheltered should be held to standards. That all members of the community aren't held to. What I am suggesting is that our city brainstorm better implementation of litter rules for the entire population. We're aware that some of those who are unsheltered and homeless also struggle with drug addiction. And or are experiencing mental illness. This adds a layer of complexity to future planning. And I'm aware of that. Even if dumpsters are provided they can overflow as we know. The problem still remains. There are 100 arguments from those on social media as to why litter in a space where there are people camping is an issue. What we don't have is much of our measured and multifaceted suggestions for solutions. And this is where I think we can continue to brainstorm. And perhaps even invite people to grapple with solutions that we normally might not want to invite. In the face of challenges with complex root issues. We shouldn't ignore the need to bring multiple perspectives and ideas to the table. As Achiko Iora pointed out in a recent editorial, common ground and unity has to begin with people. And it's time to put away the harsh rhetoric. Lower the temperature. See each other again. Listen to each other again. Thank you. Thank you. Jessica Giannola followed by Robert Baumann. Hi, Council. The first thing I want to ask for again is for you to adopt a policy for allowing late speakers to speak. If you turn in a card so they can still comment and participate in the community discussion. As well as allowing phone calls in for people who are at home. Maybe children with children homebound. Whatever it might be. So that they can speak too. And also because we can model after the county. The county does it already. It's a good model already in place. Invites people in instead of excluding them. And the speaker is a little bit low. Just letting you know out there. I can barely hear anyone. And that is for affordable housing. Low income. Especially income based housing. And our housing division has done an excellent job at giving all those opportunities with what she has. As well as our housing authority. And as well as our housing partners. They are doing what they can with what they have. And I just want to keep continuing to support the city. And developing more ideas. Accessing more grants. Whatever it might be. So that we can connect people to housing. When it comes to like say equality. And hoping that people keep trash up. Or whatever it might be. We have to think of equity. And if people do not have access to housing. We have to consider what are they capable of. So that is part of the city responsibility. Is ensuring that we do provide access in whatever means that we can. So that the people of the city can have housing. And that is something that we are working on. We have times like now where there is extreme heat. And in the winter there will be extreme cold and rain. And that is often when you see a lot of people come out and say hey. You know there is a lot of people out here who do not have any housing. And what can we do about that? And other times it may be we might forget about it. But on a day like this I do not know how anybody could. One population that I am really, really, really concerned about among many is families with children. We do not in Chico have very much resources. For people with children. And they are often in the RVs that are out there. And the vehicles. Can you imagine how hot it is in a vehicle right now? And we have families here in Chico that are living in vehicles. Because they cannot access housing that is affordable for them. So I just want to keep continuing to support you guys. Whoever is here in the future. Whatever it might be. And getting more resources. It is part of the city responsibility. And I want to make sure that we are doing that. We do not have to build the houses as a city. But we do need to do what we can to make sure they are built. Safely. Thank you. Thank you. Our last speaker is Robert Bowman. Good evening. I want to. We have a present and ongoing sanitation and hygiene problem. You know. We have a problem that is affecting our community. And the many homeless camps. And the immediate need for dumpsters and port-a-potties. To at least temporarily alleviate this problem. No one housed or unhoused wants trash where they live. Or unsanitary conditions caused by people having to relieve themselves outdoors. Because of unavailability of bathroom and hand washing facilities. The largest of these camps currently is the San Diego San Diego. And the largest one is Windchime Park. But there are numerous smaller homeless encampments around our city facing the same issues. I can attest to the fact that most of the homeless residents at Windchime. Who I see two or three times a week. Want to be responsible for keeping their area clear of trash. And if you go there you will see them collecting their trash. Bagging it up and depositing it in the two dumpsters. That are there every morning. They have been provided by the Sierra Club's Motherlode chapter. However there is always an overflow. Because of the large number of people camping there. And the nearby campground east of Windchime. Many of whom moved out there out of necessity. Because of last month's sweep of Comanche. We have a shelter crisis. Even when the pallet shelter. And the tourist facilities. And the community facility gets filled. There could be as many as 250 people homeless in our community. And we need at least one or two low barrier campgrounds. And eventually a pallet shelter. Another one. The North State shelter team is currently working on a revised proposal. For a managed campground. Which addresses the three concerns that you all came up with. When we were talking about the! When we presented the first draft to you. And hopefully by two or three days this week. You'll get the second draft. Thank you very much. All right. Thank you. All right. We'll move on to item 4.1. Appeal of the planning commission denial of the use permit. Mr. Big. Welcome. Thank you. Let me pull up the powerpoint. When you're ready. All right. So good evening. Mayor Coolidge. Vice mayor Reynolds and council. Tonight you're considering an appeal of the planning commission's denial of use permit 1925. Town place suites hotel. So on July 21st, 2022. The planning commission held a public hearing. And considered a use permit. And associated architectural review application. For a to construct a four story 112 room hotel on a vacant four acre site located northeast of the intersection of state route 32. And Bruce road. Pursuant to the city's municipal code. A hotel use may be established in the community commercial zoning district. Subject to use permit approval. At the July 21 meeting. The planning commission received significant public attendance and participation. And the planning commission's decision to approve the plan was approved. After hearing public comments and deliberating on the project. The commission determined the project did not meet the threshold for two of the use permit findings. And voted three to two to deny the use permit. In order to complete the record of the proceedings. The planning commission met again on August 18th. To adopt a resolution of denial. The project applicant has appealed those actions to the city council. Contending that the project is in fact consistent with the general plan. And that the proposed hotel use would be compatible with the general plan. Given the existing and future land uses in the vicinity. On the screen you'll see the five findings for approval of the use permit. And highlighted are the general plan consistency finding. And the compatibility of the proposed use finding That the commission could not make So So So So So So So So So So So So So and operating characteristics are inconsistent with surrounding residential senior and residential uses. The project is far from existing tourist attractions and amenities and would therefore tend to generate more vehicular traffic trips to each or to reach entertainment and services. Further, the use would not enhance the character, identity, and livability of the existing neighborhood and would not be considered compatible infill development, providing a missing neighborhood element, such as neighborhood retail, professional services, or use that otherwise contributes positively to the existing neighborhood. The July 21st Planning Commission staff report that is attached to your staff report outlines findings supporting consistency of the project with the City's general plan and determining the proposed hotel use is compatible with existing and future land uses. Some of the goals, policies, and actions cited include the project would enhance regional tourism that supports local businesses. It would develop a commercially zoned property consistent with a land use plan that provides a mix in distribution of the existing neighborhood. The project would promote land use compatibility through use restrictions, development standards, environmental review, and special design considerations and meets all applicable development standards. Development of the project would result in circulation improvements, including the future installation of a traffic signal at the intersection of Bruce Road and Sierra Sunrise Terrace. And the project site is in an area of Chico that is experiencing significant growth and would activate a second corridor parcel along State Route 32 corridor. Institutions currently looking to develop projects onаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетает including landscaping, lighting, and parking improvements, and that the Architecture Review Board take action on the project's architecture review application at a meeting that was scheduled for July 27th. Given the Commission's denial of the use permit, the July 27th ARHPP meeting was canceled. If Council decides to uphold the appeal or approve the project, it is recommended that the Council take jurisdiction of the site design and architecture review of the project as allowed by the City's Municipal Code. All the required findings for the architecture review have been included in the resolution for approval. You've received significant public comment regarding this project, and you will hear additional public comment tonight. My recommendation to Council is to stay focused on the findings for the use permit, which are the subject of tonight's appeal hearing. You do not need to pursue every issue that is raised. Concerns regarding evacuation routes or emergency vehicle access have been clearly addressed in the record by both the Fire and the Police Departments. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I'm, of course, available to answer questions. We have Kelly Murphy, Senior Planner, that's been involved with the project from the beginning. We also have John Hope from Michael Baker International Attendance, who's also available to answer any questions regarding the environmental review. All right. Before we get to that, just to outline this for everybody. So we do have a very strict guideline that we have to adhere to for public hearings. So we've obviously heard the staff report. We'll do ex parte communications from Council, and just a second here. And then Council discussion and questions. We do 10 minutes. Open the hearing for public input, which is no more than 50 minutes, which includes 30 minutes for, well, first the appellant applicant, 15 minutes. They get 15 minutes. Additional speakers, meaning members of the public, 30 minutes. So divided among the number of speakers. And then the applicant rebuttal, that's three minutes. And then closing. So we close the hearing, and then Council discussion and vote from that point. So that's the guidelines that we have to adhere to. So that's what we will be doing. So at this point, do we want to do ex parte communication announcement? Start on my right with Mr. O'Brien. So I did receive an email, all the normal emails that all of Council did, of course, but also one from Gary Taylor that was specifically addressed to me. And he just outlined his concerns. There was a request to meet with Jim Stevens. We were not able to make that happen either, but that's it for me. I also have received many emails and a request for a meeting with the gentleman. I did meet with Mr. Jim Stevens quite a while ago now, and I have contacted staff a number of times with questions which have been answered. I met with Mr. Stevens, and I met with Mr. Gary Taylor. And a couple of associates, I don't remember their names, who I met with. Anyways, a couple of lovely ladies from the Cal Park side. All right. And I had a probably 30-second phone call with Jim Stevens. And I met with no one in regards to this, but I did read all the emails. I did speak with Mr. Jim Stevens as well. I also got to speak with Mr. Gary Taylor. Jim Stevens. I talked with Jerry , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , Thank you very much, Council. All right, so Council questions of staff. Mr. Morin. I'll wait till after the hearing. Okay. All right, so we'll start with the... Okay. I'll ask a question of Mr. Buehler. Go ahead. But when you were at the podium, you made a comment that is probably worth repeating about what's not up for discussion is where a better location for this may be. Did I hear you say that? You did. Why did you say that? Well, because again, tonight, the question before you is an appeal of the Planning Commission's decision about whether or not this use could be allowed at this location. So other possible locations aren't relevant to the discussion? I don't believe so. Thank you. All right. All right. Okay, so we will open the hearing for public input and invite the applicant. And I believe, who do we have? We have Mark Wolf and Jim Stevens. All right. And I will... Run down, set the timing, and we'll go from there. Not used to our timer being 15 minutes long, so bear with us. Wait a second. Get it onаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетает permits. They're kind of routinely granted in cases I can't frankly remember the last one that was denied. I went and looked at the definition of the use permit and it said the idea of a use permit is to provide additional information for uses that are allowed but are not of the normal variety. It's a unique use and so it asks for additional landscape sighting, proximity information and it says that at the time of the application a review of the configuration, design, location and potential impact of the proposed use shall be conducted by comparing it to established development standards. So that's what I see is the key here. So what the job of the commission is to take a look to see what the information provided specific to this use, the hotel use, and compare that to the established development standards to determine if it's an appropriate use in that spot. Additionally, it says their conditions of approval may be placed on the proposal with the use permit process to ensure that the use is compatible with the existing and designated uses in the general vicinity. So there's a process involved to take a look at additional information, compare it to our design standards, and then add conditions to ensure that it's going to be compatible. So you're going to hear tonight, we've heard quite a bit of discussion. There have been a significant amount of correspondence that you've received and that have been brought forward on concerns expressed. So far there's only Mark and I that have expressed any concerns. So I'm going to turn it over to you, Mr.! Thank you, Mr. Chair. I'm going to turn it over to you, Mr.! Thank you, Mr. Chair. I'm going to turn it over to you, Mr.! Thank you, Mr. Chair. I'm going to turn it over to you, Mr.! Thank you, Mr. Chair. I'm going to turn it over to you, Mr.! Thank you, Mr.! Thank you, Mr. Chair. I'm going to turn it over to you, Mr.!

Thank you, Mr.! Thank you, Mr.! Thank you, Mr.! Thank you, Mr.! Thank you, Mr.! Thank you, Mr.! Thank you, Mr.! Thank you, Mr.! Thank you, Mr. Mike Trollander is our last speaker. Hello, Council. I'm Mike Trollander. You know, I think it was 1992 the Greywater Act was passed in California where part of the plumbing code now is that greywater is allowed. So when I hear that, you know, we send every ounce of water. We send every ounce of water down to the sewer plant to get processed and sorted out and we pay for that. I do wonder when do we look at the idea of diverting water from the plant and using it right in our own landscape. And we love green Chico. So, but why I'm here today really is because our road conditions and our sewer pipes and our plumbing. Public infrastructure all kind of have the same problem. This one's easier to correct because we can, we can, you know, it's an enterprise fund. We can charge the appropriate amount to kind of fix the problem. But really it comes down to when we look at the benefit of a compact urban form like Merriam Park, which is 18 times the tax benefit on 20% of the infrastructure. So Merriam Park has way fewer pipes and roads per occupant than anywhere else in the city other than parts of downtown. And there's a direct benefit of that in that we can afford to maintain that and we can afford to, it's so lucrative at Merriam Park that it pays for a lot of other things. It pays for a lot of other roadway, a lot of other pipes, a lot of other roads. It pays for a lot of other policemen. And so the idea here isn't to kick single family in the head. The idea is to, what we learned today is how important a general plan is to you guys, to this council. And when we look at compact urban form in our general plan, the idea really is to have a spectrum of a path. Patterns of development in the city, not just one, not 300 acres of single family. And we look at the benefit of places like Merriam and what is it going to take to do three or four more Merriams and get our growth that way. So those are my comments. So thank you. All right. Thank you very much. Council discussion, questions, motions? All right. So I was kind of prepared to motion for Mr. Gufton's department's tweaking of the finances, the finance committee's initial recommendation. I was a little moved by a speaker given what's happened with inflation and the cost of everything. The other comment I wanted to make, and so I kind of want to discuss that, the ripping of the bandaid, getting it over. I would tend to be more for the ripping of the bandaid, but given what's happening in light of the economy and everything else, it's a tough thing for most people right now. I'm trying to look out for long term and be like, yeah, but look where the rate ends up. That's a tough discussion. The other comment to Ms. Posey's thoughts, two things have happened fairly recently. I can't speak to how long the roads have been deteriorating in the sewer system. I know that Mr. Guftson has been looking at this for a long time. We dealt with it with the finance committee over a year, but it was a long time coming. So we will make sure that the city understands what's happening, why the money is being spent that way. And the things I was going to talk about, one, this actually came up in closed session. We have, for those that don't know, a new city manager that is an excellent communicator. And the amount of press releases that I've seen in the last, I don't know, how long have you been here, like six minutes? Two months. Two months, sorry. It's been so fun though. In the last two months, we've had a lot of good news. We've had a lot of good news. But the last two months, they've been short and sweet and people understand that. There's a lot better communication coming out of the operations part of the city that the people that are paying attention are seeing what's going on. I think that'll make a big difference because the citizens do need to understand this isn't a grab for Eric to give raises to everybody in his department or pensions or any of those things. So that does need to be important. And we also, I think we have like a public information officer now, which is something we haven't generally had. So the information will get out there. I understand that. I would like to hear from my fellow council. Members on how they feel about the increase. I'm literally torn between what finance committee came up with and Eric's tweaking of it. And if it weren't for the inflation and the weird times that people are having right now, I'd probably go for the bandaid off and say, yep, you got it. It's over. It's not going to change for five years. It's just a little tougher in this environment. Vice Mayor Reynolds. So this is my first time seeing this presentation. So thank you so much. And it's been a pleasure. I'm so honoured by it. So it's so good looking. So it's so good looking. So it's so good looking. So it's so good looking. So it's so good looking. So it's so good looking. So it's so good looking So it's so good looking So it's so good looking So it's so good looking So it's so good looking So it's so good looking So it's so good looking So it's so good looking So it's so good looking So it's so good looking $38. So I just think that's something that future councils are going to think we hung a noose around their neck and we may all or not be here in four or five years. You will be. Casey Morgan or whatever your name is. Casey Morgan. So I just think that's a, I mean, $38, that's super hard. I get it. This economy is horrible. I also don't want to be sitting here having the same conversation like we have about the roads every time we do the budget and see how far behind we are. I'm really bummed that we didn't take care of this probably five or six years ago and done it a little bit gradually and been a little bit more prepared, but I wasn't here, I wasn't aware, but we are now. So I think I'm more apt to, I'd love to end at the $38 in five years, I think, not 65. The rip the bandaid off option. With the $38 and 34 cents, you know, if we do five years, total is $2,300, but if we increase gradually, individual house owners will pay $2,800. So if we do it... Is that math right, Erin? It should be the same either way. No, it is different. I just did that. Quick, blame the consultant. The consultants have no sense of humor, by the way. And I could have Greg come up and explain, but I believe it's, you know, inflationary factors if there's a slight difference. Again, this is all volumetric. It's based on water usage. So we're just giving some estimates. I will say that the finance committee landed on, you know, if they were going to rip the bandaid off, the amount was $46.91. And with adjusting the fixed versus the variable component, it brought it from $46.91 to $36.91. So and again, that's just the volumetric component. That's what we're looking at. But I, yeah, I want to say if there's a slight difference, it's likely just because of inflationary factors because we're, the intent is to collect the same amount of revenue in the five-year period. It's how quickly do you collect that revenue or not? And when can you start implementing those capital projects? Okay. Thank you. Oh, you're looking at... So after five years, do we do another analysis? Is that a desired time to go and plan it? Because the infrastructure is going to keep on deteriorating. Correct. You know, most agencies go through this process every five years. It's an enterprise fund, so we cannot collect more than it takes to operate and deliver capital projects for the utility. So we would have to prove to the council and the rate payers that, hey, in five years, we're going to be able to do this. In five years, prices are continuing to go up and therefore we need to go through another rate analysis. And we start that about three years from now. I would also add that if we go to the $38,000, if you go to that very first slide of what everybody else is at, even if we were at $38,000, there's only three other communities. We're only more expensive than three other communities. We're still way on the bottom end. Correct. Comparable sized communities. Yeah, we've, you know, we run a very organized plant, a very optimum plant. It's automated. We do everything we can to deliver, you know, the services at the lowest possible cost to the rate payers, and we continue that mantra. All right. Mr. Benton. Which one do you recommend? I'm curious. I know it's our decision. I think the finance committee asked me that as well. It's tough from a staff perspective because as a public works director, you want to fulfill 100% of the need, right? But I know that's not reasonable. I know that we've enjoyed low rates for decades, and trying to play catch up that quickly is a severe strain financially on the rate payers. I live in Chico. I pay rates too, and it's hard to have a rate almost triple. And I'm also sensitive to what we could deliver, what our staffing bandwidth can deliver from a project's perspective. And so that's why I agree with the finance committee's recommendation that 50% of the collection system need. I think that's fair, it's reasonable, and something we could accomplish in projects that we can deliver. Originally, I liked the gradual increase, but once we were able to work on the increase, the fixed portion of the rate and decrease the variable portion, I like the all increases in year one. We get the paint over with once, we'll receive likely a lot of calls, but we'll get through that once, and then that rate's going to stay the same outside of CPI for five years. At this point, that's the option that I prefer and recommend. And to be certain, that's figure nine, correct? I believe so on the staff report. Page 11. I've got it as number three. Yeah, figure nine, correct. Figure nine. Yeah, it's 50% on figure nine. So 38, 34. And then it comes out of your pocket for the four cents across. Correct. Council Member O'Brien. So no one is up here I know as a fan of rate increases, unless they're absolutely warranted, and I thought, Eric, you did an excellent job in explaining that to us in the public, that this infrastructure is absolutely going to require additional monies. I understand that, and I appreciate you explaining that so eloquently. So the question for me, and I think the rest of the council were struggling with, is it better to, as has been said, to rip the band-aid off and take care of the pain initially and then have that last five-year not be quite so detrimental or kind of ease into this thing and then see a higher rate increase at the end of that five-year period? I thought initially I was going to support the graduated, gradual approach, stepped approach to this, but I think, and I'll ask those on the dais that are business owners, small business owners, is it more advantageous for you to have a fixed rate, if it's $38, whatever that number is, for a consistent five years or have this go up every year? What is your, as a business owner, what is your preference? I'm curious. As a business owner, I like to know what my fixed costs are, but the flip side of that is, right now, when we get to that $60 rate or whatever it is, right now $60 sounds high, but with what's going on with the economy, $60 five years from now might not even buy me an ice cream cone at Schubert's. Luckily, I don't have to pay for my ice cream at Schubert's, but hypothetically. Now everybody's like, my God, she's buying us votes with ice cream. Someone looking at that chart, I agree with you completely. The perception, I think, is what the perception is, oh my God, look at that number. With the $38, it's consistent, there's a jump, but then it stays at $38. So I think from a public reaction standpoint, I could be wrong, but I think it might be more palatable for the $38. That's my thought. Well, all right. Vice Mayor? And it's not going to come down. If it gets up to that $65, it's not going to drop back down to the $38 once we get to year five. It's staying at $65 for good. That first year is going to be tough to explain, but it's going to be like, we're keeping you from a $65 permanent however many years from now. The last time we went through this, I'm looking at Skipper again, was the waste management or ecology people, and it's like the rates were all over the world. I've lost some small business owner friends. I'm not even going to tell you who it was, because he was paying almost nothing, because somebody else was paying such a higher rate, and it took a lot of explaining for people to get it. But in the long run, this is probably better. So I would agree. I think the right decision and the tough decision is to just do it and rip the Band-Aid off, and I think that will be more preferential for everyone in the end. A little painful at first. I agree with that. But in the end, I think that's a better option for us. Not a desirable option, but one we have to take on. This infrastructure is not a luxury. Not a luxury, right? We flush a toilet, we turn on a faucet, we have to have a wastewater treatment plant that deals with that outflow. And doing the right thing, I think, for us, even though it's a tough thing, is to go ahead and rip that Band-Aid off, just take it on the chin right now, and spare further paying down the road. Now, $38 is the way I want to go. I will second your motion. All right. There's a motion. Do you have further comments? I just wanted to address something that was said. There is conversation, and you have gone and visited some plants, if I'm correct, about possibly doing some gray water treatment, and we're looking at other options for the future. It's just not in this right now. Absolutely. And that will work towards that, and that's, part of the regulatory-driven components at the wastewater treatment plant that Regional Water Quality Control Board wants to increase treatment levels because they know reuse is a factor. Our wastewater treatment plant is an identified project in SGMA's in our groundwater sustainability plan to meet SGMA requirements. It's ranked, I think, number seven out of nine or ten projects, but I think it's an option, and at some point we will be in a scenario where water resources is a resource that we're capitalizing on. Absolutely. Perfect. I knew that was happening. I just wanted to address it to let the public know that our conversations are happening and things we are looking into. Council Member Tannen. I have one quick question. I know you mentioned that 70% is fixed and 30% is volumetric ratio, so it will fluctuate if the water use, or in the first year will take the average of the water usage and base it on the base, on that basis in the next year, it will change if the water usage goes down for any reason, it will go down for the following year for that particular household. Yes. Yeah, there's a fixed component of the rate that will be 70%, and those figures are in that exhibit and in the financial report. 30% is volumetric, so it's going to be in the rear, so it's going to look at the previous year's water usage. We're only trying to capture water that goes through the household facilities, not landscape irrigation, so we're looking at a four-month average. So, we're going to be looking at a four-month average of December, January, February, and March. Yeah, and it also gives you the opportunity, if in fact you lessen your water usage during those periods of time, that you're able to pay less water, that you will have less impact on the sewer, so your sewer rate will go down. Correct. It's dynamic, and there's supposed to be some equity there, right? It's interesting how much more water a 3,000 square foot home uses versus a 1,000 square foot home, and so if you use more, you're going to pay more. If you use less, you're going to pay less. Eric, I can't thank you enough for your work on this. It's been tremendous, and it's been, I know, a long road to hoe with three finance meetings on this, and a lot of individual meetings with the individual finance committee members, and probably council members beyond that. I think it's a little disingenuous when people just want to say that, look, this council is raising rates on this, this council is going for a sales tax increase, this council wants X, Y, and Z. The fact of the matter is that most of us got here, and we're burdened with these problems and are just looking to solve them, because we don't want to leave the city in a lurch. The easy way out would just be, you know what, we're not going to raise it. We're not going to raise it. We're going to kick that can down the road. We're not going to fix the roads. We're going to throw some money at it to make it look pretty for right now. We're not going to do the services that we need. But the responsible thing to do is actually to look at this increase and make it, in a way that hopefully is less painful over the long term, because these pipes start breaking, this stuff starts happening, you know, we'll be losing other services. We'll be losing police officers. We'll be losing all the road repair. We'll be losing all that kind of stuff. So it would be irresponsible to do otherwise. So I'm glad we're looking at this, absolutely. And I could add to that, Mayor Coolidge, and I think there was one speaker that stated that, you know, we're putting some undue increases on the financially constrained, where we look at the proposed rate structure, we were able to reduce the fixed amount on multifamily homes, which in some cases is more financially constrained people in multifamily scenarios. The rates are actually going to go down. They're going to go down years one and two, and then they start to gradually go up. So we've done everything we can to really put equity in this proposal that the more water you use, the more you're going to pay. The less water you use, the less you're going to pay. And yeah, we do not want to be in those scenarios with catastrophic failures. They're extremely costly. That situation on the River Road trunk line, if that would have continued, we would have made national news, and that's not a position we want to be in. Emergency repairs and disasters to that degree could be extremely catastrophic and very costly. All right. Further comments? All right. Madam Clerk? Council Member Bennett? Yes. Council Member Morgan? Yes. Council Member O'Brien? Yes. Council Member Tandon? Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds? Aye. Mayor Kulik? Aye. Carries 6-0 with one absence. All right. Thank you very much. So moving on. Item 5.3, no items after the posting of the agenda. Reports and communications. Following reports and communication items are provided to the Council's information. No action can be taken on items under this section unless the Council agrees to include it on a subsequent agenda. City Manager's report. Mr. Sorensen? No report. All right. Thank you very much. All right. We are receiving and filed. We are holding a commercial cannabis storefront retail dispensary's final selection. You have information only. The sun shining of draft MOU Chico Police Management employees. Moving on to item 6.4, Council Member requests for to AP and P-1010. Council Members may verbally request an item to be agendized at a future meeting after stating what the item would be. A majority of the Council is needed in order for staff to agendize. Council Members may also submit a request in writing. Do we have any requests? Seeing no requests, we'll move to adjournment. Thank you very much. We'll see you in two weeks.
