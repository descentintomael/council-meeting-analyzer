And at this time on business from the floor, members of the public may address the council on any matter not already listed on the agenda. So please keep your comments to items not listed on the agenda. Comments are limited to three minutes or as determined based on the number of speakers and the council cannot take any action at this meeting on requests made under this section of the agenda. How many speakers? We have eight. Eight. We'll do three minutes. Okay. Our first speaker is Jeff Creed followed by Bud Caldwell. Good evening, council. So somebody said I didn't know what I'm talking about. So let's talk about some things I do know about some things I do know. I do know the city of Chico is broken as an organization and it's very plain to see walking down the street anywhere in Chico. It's clear and obvious, even though nobody wants to pay attention to those things. So let me give you an anecdotal example. Every organization I've ever been in from grade school to the military, to retail, to construction, there's always somebody to enforce standards. So when I'm out there playing soccer in the sixth grade, pull up your socks, tuck in your shirt, right? There's somebody there to draw the line and enforce standards. In the military, it's a lot more intense. In retail, it's even more intense because it's dollars, right? Dollars and cents matter. And when you chase off a customer because there's too much trash in front of your store, it costs a lot of money to get another customer back in those doors. So how does that relate to, well, there's a quick minute. How does that relate to the city of Chico? How many people were sitting on that side of this dais for almost a year when there were blue tarps hanging at second main? And did nothing about it? Would the blue tarps still be there if I didn't call and complain? It's a question you should think about as you walk around the city and look at the other issues that are just openly blatant. There's sidewalk across the street from here torn up. Now the city says it's supposed to be repaired within six months of an owner tearing it up. I'm guessing it's going on close to two years. Has anybody said anything about that? So another example of the city being broken. First, state of the union or state of the city I went to, they were very clear and they outlined all these problems with roads and how we're not doing the maintenance. So if any of you run a business, you understand your P&L, in and out, right? That has to include maintenance. The city is on an unsustainable budget plan and has been for more years than I can count. So when is it going to be on a sustainable budget plan? When are your expenditures? When are your expenses? Are needed expenditures for maintenance going to be covered by the city budget? Then there's no plan for that. Nobody's even talking about it. You spend, as a council, I see more time spent in this room doing the work of the city and not working on the city. Doing the business and not working on the business. And you can tell me I don't know what I'm talking about all you want, but let's go walk around the city and you show me where I'm wrong. You show me where there was a budget that was sustainable. And I'm going to tell you that it was sustainable in this city in the last five, eight years. Because it hasn't happened. I haven't seen it. And you state it very clearly every January. And you're going to do it again this January. And say this is what we need for maintenance. And this is what we have. So we're going to not do our maintenance. We're not going to do this. And we're just going to fly. Have a good night. Next speaker is Bud Caldwell followed by Barry Jones. Good evening. I'm Bud Caldwell. I'm just one of the businesses in South Chico that's really kind of fed up with the whole program. So is that guy that just spoke. I think it's different levels and different levels of understanding. I know what a lot of you are going through. And I don't know how you do it or why. But I appreciate that you're here. But I think we need to change. Change direction right now. I've been angry for years now. And that's not working at all. Restroom fires in my restrooms that I built for nighttime drivers. I had that five times in one week. And, you know, then I have to lock my restrooms. I have to put a porta potty out. Then I get needles and the needle exchange program that worked so well. And then I'd have 41, 50 needles a week. 200 bucks a month to pump those out. And I got real sick of it. How stupid does the city have to be or whomever brought that law into being to give the druggies needles? I didn't cause their addiction. I can't cure their addiction. But I don't need their addiction to run my business. They scare my customers. Now I've got to have an armed guard cruise through there a few times a night. And I'm really getting tired of it. But I want to give them real help. And I believe you guys know the way to do that. It's going to irk you in a lot of ways, I'm sure. But I think we need to change direction and do whatever you can to bring our city back. If you've got time, go down to the Chico Library. Down. They're by Moms. And see the book, My Hometown Chico. And a lot of it looks the same. And a lot of it is just that much difference. But that's kind of like the difference between a non-professional and a profession. Just that much difference. And I think the quality of people we have here on this council now, what do we want? We've got negotiators. We've got speakers. We've got teachers. We've got... business people. We've got law enforcement. We've got everybody. So just do what you can do and let's get back to having our town again. Thank you. Next speaker is Barry Jones followed by John Peterson. And I would just make a note, if you're next up, just go ahead and wait in the center aisle for us so we can get in between speakers a little faster. I appreciate that. Thanks. Go ahead. My name is Barry Jones. I'm a lifetime resident of Chico and a business owner on Myers Street off of Park Avenue. I'm speaking for myself and many other businesses and community members that have the same feelings that I have of the problems of the encampments and the crime we're dealing with. Many of them that talk to me, they're very difficult for them to come up and speak because of the dangers that could happen to their business as far as retaliation, so they're afraid to come up, but they're definitely out there. By now, you guys have probably seen many letters written from citizens of businesses sharing the same impacts. These citizens are asking for a clean and safe Chico. Like many of my friends and neighbors, I'm heartbroken about the trash, the crime, the filth, and the general state of our once beautiful city. On a regular basis, there's been news of stabbings, shootings, thefts, home invasion, drug overdose, and drug use. And it has led to a very uneasy feeling in the community that it's not safe. We're not without compassion for the people in need, but if we don't hold the people breaking the laws accountable, I'm afraid a serious event's going to happen, and we're going to lose the real Chico. This new element in Chico has been able to do whatever they want with no consequences. Why should a few be able to ruin Chico for a population of 100,000? The encampments can't be moved. But the laws can be enforced within them and protect our community. I've listened to public speakers. I've read editorials in the paper. I've seen the work of a handful of people trying to turn Chico into something that's never been and never should be. I'm standing here today to support city council and law enforcement, find a way to enforce our laws fairly for everybody. I support development, a strategic plan, compassionately and accountable, helping the community. I support helping among those who are truly vulnerable here in Chico. I know this lawsuit makes it difficult to disclose information, but our citizens don't feel safe. I feel our parks and public spaces have been taken away from us. I would like to see more transparency from the council if possible. We need hope for the city of Chico to save our town and enjoy Chico as it once was. Please, please, save our parks, waterways and our beautiful town. Thank you. John Peterson, followed by Don Russell. Good evening. I'm John Peterson, our family-owned Chico Nut Company. I'm here to speak on public safety regarding the city's vagrants and how it affects our business. As a lifelong resident of the fine city of Chico, these are a few of the issues we are faced with with trying to keep our city safe and trying to conduct business in our city. Point one, out of town customers being robbed. We have had two separate incidences involving vagrants, one that attempted to rob our international customer and one that actually did rob our customer, both while walking to the Diamond Hotel. One was in the parking structure and the other was walking around downtown after dinner. After these incidents, we have been in the city for a long time. We have been in the city for a long time. We have been in the city for a long time. As the incident has occurred, neither one of these customers are willing to stay in Chico for the night. We are having to entertain them in a different city. Point two, employee safety. Our secretaries keep our front door locked because of all the vagrants tweaking out in our parking lot on their way from buying drugs in Lindo Channel. We now have, or we now have had to move our employee parking so that the vehicle is not seen behind locked gates due to vehicle damages caused by vagrants. Point three, used needles in a food processing plant. We have found used needles thrown over the fence into our work yard from Lindo Channel. We have had to train our people to walk the fence line looking for used needles so our forklift tires would not pick them up and bring them into our food processing facility. Point four, the! Next speaker is Don Russell followed by Robin Engle. Hi, my name is Don Russell. I would like to talk about the Comanche Creek and the we purchased the corner of Park and Myers and it was a pretty dilapidated property when we bought it and we put a lot of effort into building it for both office space and restaurant and bar use and it's our personal office for my business and my employees. In 2010, I was asked to participate in the Southwest Neighborhood Redevelopment Plan. As part of that, I was on the committee for the Comanche Creek Greenway working with barber neighborhood residents. You know, we had a little diverse interest in what that could be because at the time it was a fenced off non-public area and to the city's credit, you know, we worked and we made recommendations. To the city's credit, they built the trailhead, they built the parking. The community spent hundreds of hours cleaning, cleaning, removing invasive species, fixing the trails, you know. And I thought, you know, the city's a good neighbor, right? The city's a good neighbor. They did this for this community in this area. The city's a good neighbor. They did this for this community in this area. The city's a good neighbor. They did this for this community in this area. The city's a good neighbor. The city's a good neighbor. The city's a good neighbor. The city's a good neighbor. The city's a good neighbor. The city's a good neighbor. The city's a good neighbor. The city's a good neighbor. The city's a good neighbor. The city's a good neighbor. it's not safe it's a shanty town let's face it it's not something that the city should be proud of in developing my property i followed ordinances i paid fees i conduct my business under the guidance that the city requires if i veer from that code enforcement can can send somebody out to go put me straight i don't have somebody to send to the city to say enforce your codes on your own property right now you're not a good neighbor you're you're a bad neighbor because you've allowed this to fester and infect not only that park but it infects the whole neighborhood and the whole business park and it goes out into the neighborhoods this morning we had to call 9-1-1 because someone was convulsing at the doorstep of the property next to ours you know that's i don't want my employees to have to deal with that and i don't want to have to deal with that so i really hope that the city finds a solution to address this problem i implore you to do so thank you robin angle followed by julie three some of us know that the city has a lot of problems with the city's public health system i know that human life is much more important than having to pick up a piece of trash or having to see a blue tarp or something that's inconvenient for a wealthy housed person to have to deal with up to 95 percent of murders in this country are committed by adults so the percentage of children or youth that commit murders is very small and as i'm sure you know police chief o'brien and yet there were three or four reported murderers or um conspiracy youth excuse me teenagers who conspired in the tecker pond shooting and only one has been charged the others are considered witnesses which basically means they're immune from any kind of prosecution and they're not considered witnesses they're considered witnesses and they're not considered witnesses they're considered witnesses and puts them in the same same category as the eyewitnesses these are teenagers in the teen years our kids should be worried about prom they should be worried about their crushes they should be worried about whether their haircut makes them look cool or stupid they should not be thinking about murder and above and beyond committing murder our da has been in office for 34 years he's in his 80s we have no term limits in butte county i can't tell you how many years i've been in office for 34 years and i've been in office for 34 years and i'm in office in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in wants to impart his condolences. That's how human this person is. This is a human being. This is not a transient. This is not an element of society. This is not someone who's trying to take over the city. This is someone who has been through chronic, countless traumas, as has every human being in our community who is unhoused now because there is a housing crisis and because from the top down, there is hate that has trickled down to our children. Children live what they learn. They've learned to hate people because those people are unhoused. How thwarted is that? And how unfair and outrageous is it that three out of four of these killers is free to commit more and more crimes throughout their childhood and into their adulthood? I want to also acknowledge thanks to you. Thank you, Councillor Alex Brown, for being the only one, the only one in our council, in our leadership, and amongst the police who spoke out against this heinous crime last month. And the complicity of the rest of you, well, the silence of the rest of you does sound like complicity. I'm asking again for a response. Thank you. The next speaker is Julie Threed, followed by Jessica Giannulli. Hello, everyone. I'm here to talk about messaging and communications. You've got a lot of things coming up really soon, and the homeless crisis, the 1% sales tax, the ice rink. So I just, I thought I'd come up for each agenda item that I feel really passionate about and give some examples rather than just kind of blurt stuff out. So, and again, it's, you know, we're adults and words matter, truth matters. If you can add a little humor, that'd be great. Balance your words, if you can. And I think that's a great way to end the day. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. All right. Moving on. We don't have any public hearings tonight, so we'll move on to the regular agenda. Consideration of resolution initiating proceedings to annex property, Glenwood Avenue annexation, District Number 3. And I believe Mr. Big, there he is. All right. How are you? Good evening. Good evening, Mayor, Vice Mayor and Council. Tonight, City Council is being asked to initiate proceedings to annex a roughly 43-acre unincorporated parcel island on the western edge of the community near the intersection of Glenwood Avenue and Oak Way. The area, as you can see on the left of the slide, has been within the city's sphere of influence for several decades. Over the past several years, numerous parcels in the proposed annexation area required connection to the city's sanitary sewer due to failing septic. The area, as you can see on the left of the slide, has been within the city's sphere of influence for several decades. In order for the city to extend its services outside of our jurisdiction, it requires approval from the Butte Local Agency Formation Commission, otherwise known as LAFCO. LAFCO did, in fact, approve the extension of city service to these parcels, but it was conditioned upon a future annexation. The city and LAFCO have made substantial progress towards the common goal of annexing the remaining county island areas within the city sphere. The island areas, as you can see, function as part of the city's political, economic, and economic development. The islands are a part of the city's political, economic, and social fabric and are logical to be under city jurisdiction. On the greater question about the islands, the city and LAFCO continue to work on an ultimate annexation plan for the orderly annexation of these remaining islands. Progress on the plan, however, has been delayed initially by campfire and then more recently due to COVID-19. But again, back to this proposed annexation, the city and LAFCO staff coordinated and sent out a joint solicitation letter earlier this year. The letter was... The letter was intended to gauge interest and receive feedback from the community. Approximately five individuals contacted staff with general questions regarding city services, but there was no negative feedback. Following this public hearing, if council proceeds with the adoption of the recommended resolution, an annexation application will be submitted to LAFCO, and they'll be responsible for all the remaining steps. I'm available if you have any questions. All right, any questions for Mr. Vig? Thank you very much. Do we have any speakers on this item? We don't, okay. All right, entertain a motion. Move to approve. Second. Motion from Vice Mayor Reynolds, a second from Council Member Tandon to approve a resolution of the City Council of the City of Chico initiating proceedings to annex property now located in the unincorporated territory of the county of Butte to the incorporated territory of the City of Chico, Glenwood Avenue. The I believe this is George. Good evening, Council. At its meeting of September 21st, the Council directed staff to change the Climate Action Commission from a standing commission to an ad hoc advisory body. This direction does not end the work of the commission, nor does it limit the climate action as a city priority, but instead provides the ability for the work to continue through an ad hoc committee that can meet when needed. The ad hoc committee will continue to provide guidance and recommendations to both staff and the Council on climate action issues. In order to make the change to the structure of the commission, the Council will need to adopt an ordinance repealing 2.54 with the first reading of the ordinance at tonight's meeting or provide other direction of Council desires. All right, questions from Council? Mr. Bennett. One quick question. Changing the status of the committee to an ad hoc designation, they can still meet whenever they want on their own and continue their great work on climate activity, or do they have to receive permission from the city? I would direct questions to either Director Veig or Senator Vig. Thank you, City Attorney Ewing. So the question is, could who meet? I mean, whether they were a standing commission or an ad hoc committee, they were established by the city to serve towards the city's progress on climate action. Are you asking if... As an ad hoc designation, could they still meet on their own to continue their work on whatever activities they decide they should continue working on? Can they just meet on their own? Yeah. If they were an ad hoc committee, they would be appointed by the mayor and staff would be directed to work with them. So we would be functioning, they'd be functioning at the direction of the city council through the mayor as an ad hoc committee. Now, any group who's, you know, working towards climate action can meet independently, but if it was a city ad hoc committee, it would be in concert with city efforts. Okay. So a group of people could meet whenever they want to discuss whatever they'd like to discuss, regarding the climate action and their great work. Okay. Thank you. Director Rigg, I think I've got a few questions for you as well. I know that this item is just to disband the Climate Action Commission, but for the good of the public, can you explain some of the essential differences between an ad hoc committee and a commission? Usually an ad hoc committee has a sunset and... The deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy like the ARHPB with regular meeting times and a more generalized but focused responsibility on behalf of the city. I think that would be the major difference. Great. You already answered my question about who decides the membership of an ad hoc committee. The report mentioned that the new committee would be able to meet, quote, as needed. Who decides how many meetings are needed? I guess that would be as determined by the mayor. Likely. There could be a, you know, like the last ad hoc sustainability task force, it was identified around, you know, nine times a year. So there was always plenty of work to be done. Has anyone suggested staff or otherwise that our climate action commission or body does not need to meet as regularly as they currently do? Will you please repeat that? Has anyone suggested staff or otherwise that our climate action commission or body does not need to meet as regularly as they currently do? I've not heard that. What's that? I've not heard of anyone. Thank you. Are staff required to participate in ad hoc committees or do they have to be directed by council to participate? Well, I mean, if the mayor has established a committee to do work on behalf of the city, it just seems logical that staff would be supportive of that and participate. Even if it requires more than one hour of staff time? Is there a requirement? Is that your question? Yes. If one council member is directing more than one hour of staff time, the whole council has to approve that. I'm not sure I understand. I guess I'm just familiar with how the sustainability task force functioned. It was clear that there would be staff support for their efforts. Great. Because again, they're working in coordination with city staff, but without staff, how are they getting information? How are we setting up meetings, agendas, and things like that? Thank you. How do we know that we will have savings related to the disbanding of the Climate Action Commission, particularly as it relates to staff time, considering that response? How do we know? It says that in the staff report. I know I'm putting you on the spot. Sure. I guess the notion is if you're not having those meetings at staff time that goes into the agenda and setting it up, participating here or virtually, so there's just an inherent truth that if staff's not working on those agendas and coordinating, that there would be less staff time working. Okay. There's an upward of $2,700 in marketing savings that would be for commission recruitment. This may be a question for the city clerk's office. Am I incorrect in assuming that this marketing cost ties into the recruitment for all other commissions, or is the Climate Action Commission recruitment done separately? The recruitments are done together. Depending on council action, we would do an additional recruitment. So the only additional cost that we would be incurring for the Climate Action Commission recruitment would be if we did an additional recruitment specifically for that? Correct. Thank you. This question may be for the city attorney. Your staff report states that the council gave direction at it. The staff report states that the council gave direction at its last meeting to staff to prepare these documents eliminating the Climate Action Commission. Mr. City Attorney, I'm struggling to understand how that action, was in accordance with the Brown Act. Can you chime in? So I'm looking at the agenda item and the description of it, and your question is about the Brown Act is what? The agenda item that this action with direction to staff was given from was making appointments to the Climate Action Commission. Okay. And so the question is, is that a violation of the Brown Act? I guess it boils down to that, yeah. Yeah. Okay. So the action taken, you had a motion, and that motion ultimately was to provide direction for the item that you have before you today. The item on the agenda described, as you mentioned, it was about appointing persons to the Climate Action Commission, and then a different motion was made related to that subcommittee, and that was the Climate Action Commission. The related subject was changing the structure of that commission to an ad hoc committee. So in terms of the subject, we're talking about the same thing, the ad hoc commission, the structure or the organization of that commission, which really means how frequently it's going to meet. That's really what it boils down to, which is what Director Veig pointed out to you in response to your earlier question. The standing committee is, you know, a commission has a regular meeting, and so forth, the ad hocs don't. So the Brown Act has what's called a safe harbor provision. It's called essentially when you have a general description of the agenda item, which is what the Brown Act requires specifically, as long as the body substantially complies with the requirements of notifying the public who was ever at that meeting had a chance to look at the agenda and see what was going to be discussed. Now, parsing it down to particular actions that the council members are going to make on a particular subject was not set forth in the agenda description, and it's not required by the Brown Act. It's a general description of the subject that was provided. The public had an opportunity 72 hours before the meeting to see what was on the agenda to come and to weigh in. The public also has an opportunity today and at the second reading of this item to come and weigh in on their views on this particular item, agenda item, whether they're for it or against it. So I don't, to just give you my view on this or my opinion, I don't see a Brown Act violation because the Brown Act is protecting the public's opportunity to participate in public meetings. The public has been given the opportunity to participate in three meetings, as I count. The first meeting where this agenda was, the meeting today, and then the subsequent meeting where you're going to have a second reading. So there's no, in terms of, there's no hiding or secrecy or lack of transparency with regard to the public about what's going to happen here. The subject matter, which is the Climate Action Commission restructuring or reorganization, is being discussed today. It was discussed at the prior meeting and it will be discussed at the next regular meeting. So in terms of your question about a Brown Act violation, I don't see it. That's my view. And I hope, hopefully that's responsive. Very. Thank you. All right. Further questions for Seth? Okay. I've got a couple. So, and maybe if the city attorney and Mr. Veague and clerk can all help with this in terms of getting my questions answered, but just for clarity. So the difference between an ad hoc committee and a regular standing committee is a regular standing committee has regular meetings that occur monthly in this case. And then an ad hoc committee, an ad hoc meeting would be as they were needed or called by myself, correct? Yes. Okay. I'm just trying to clarify some things for the audience. So, and then currently, so, and Mr. Veague, I think you know this, is when did we change it from an ad hoc committee to a commission? Approximately two years ago. And prior to that, it was an ad hoc committee for about how long? Do you know? About six and a half, seven years. Okay. And then it was in the form that I, staffed, and then they also served in the 2000s in a couple of variety forms as well. So there was a particular item, they'd be called to do work on that particular item as needed. I think at the last meeting, I clarified that the original sustainability task force kind of did all things sustainable, capital S, all things. The last six years as, six and a seven years as an ad hoc committee, and then as a climate action commission, the focus has really been on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, as well as adaptation and resiliency to climate change. More focused on that very narrow area. So more focused in the last two years, you would say? Last eight. Well, they were really focused on the greenhouse gas emissions. Whether as an ad hoc or as a commission. They weren't pursuing things like plastic band bands and things of that nature. Okay. And do you see any difference necessarily? And this is very opinion, so you don't have to necessarily answer it, but, you know, switching from an ad hoc to a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, is there really any difference in, in terms of the work that gets done? Well, at the time that council and staff helped work with the sustainability task force to bring forward that recommendation, it was to highlight the commitment of the city to climate action. So that was, you know, the ad hoc represents something that has a sunset. The standing commission represents something that's going to be in our code and regular meeting dates. There's that, that elevated understanding. Okay. And then when it was a ad hoc, it didn't actually have a sunset, right? I was told apparently it was sometime in 2015 or 16, but no one told me. And we functioned. It kept going. Yeah. Gotcha. But there was lots to be done. Yeah. And I mean, we've had other ad hoc committees, which, you know, staff has been involved on, but usually those are approved by council. It's not just simply me going. Yeah. And it's more focused following the campfire. There was the housing committee and it really was narrow and they wanted to have a scope, but they kind of came back with, with specific recommendations to council. The sustainability task force, that ad hoc committee, it was, it functioned very much like the climate action commission. But there's, like I said, when it came to council with the recommendation that was both the commission, the task force and staffs for council was, Hey, let's acknowledge the ongoing efforts needed for addressing climate action. All right. I appreciate your clarity and your good memory too. How many speakers do we have on the side? We have 12. Okay. Three minutes. Okay. The first speaker is Alan Harris, followed by Laurie Harris. Good evening. I'm Alan Harris. I heard your discussion two weeks ago about dropping the standing committee on climate action, and it made a lot of sense. I hadn't, uh, heard on that subject before. But I thought I'd come up and make some comments. I'm all for spending little or none of the council's time on issues deemed climate action. As a normal resident of Chico, who you represent, I think all this greenhouse gas control, et cetera, is a bunch of nonsense. Spend your time and our money on things more important, not more politically correct, trendy subjects that just add more spending of our tax dollars and do nothing. The people of Chico don't care about climate action. Fix the mess that is real people on the ground every day. If you have to provide guidance on this climate action stuff, do whatever it takes to stop anything more being put into place. Advise them just to forget about it. The less you waste your time with it, the better. You guys are right. You don't need a standing committee. Ad hoc is just fine. Thank you. Laurie Harris, followed by Robin Engle. Thank you. Wow, that's like much ado about nothing, huh? How many times can you ask the difference between a standing committee and an ad hoc committee? I'm for the ad hoc committee. Councilman Morgan observed this unnecessary standing committee, and Debbie Presson made great comments as well about how many times they've really been necessary. Spend time and money on necessary things. Clean up this homeless mess. Go clean the streets. Fix the potholes. Do something that you really ought to be doing since you're supposed to be representing us. Right, guys? Next speaker is Robin Engle, followed by Julie Threat. The air we breathe is important. It does sustain us. It does sustain life. It sustains our lives, and it sustains nature. I disagree with Council Ewing in that the public got a chance to give input during the last meeting about the Climate Action Commission being essentially disbanded and turned into an ad hoc committee. There was no opportunity. It was within a very, very short amount of time that suddenly the conversation became, not one, but two. It was not one of how do we find members of the commission, but one of how shall we disband it, basically, and make it maybe an ad hoc. I was there when Councilor Horry and I believe then Vice Mayor Alex Brown had given us a very well thought out, strong climate action plan for the city of! We very much appreciated it. I felt really good about it, and I was certainly not the only one. And I know there's a big brain trust that's been working very hard on Chico's climate. In this capacity, I also know and won't be fooled by all the talk about this isn't disbanding it, because we know from what we saw fairly recently of the ad hoc, police are not disbanding in the city of Chico. The deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy agree that this council is not concerned about global warming and what's happening to our climate and that an ad hoc committee does not suffice. Thank you. Next speaker is Julie Threatt followed by Jessica Giannola. There's your communications, the two total different perspectives. So for me, again, I'm thinking from, this is a hard one, for communications perspective, as you're kind of rolling things out and deciding for or against. When I read this agenda item, what hit me was, I don't know the difference between your committees, your commissions, or your ad hoc. And I know the commissions are very kind of hardwired and they're documented. So I went to the website and the one thing about the climate commission, it's like the one that's updated all the time. They've got, here's the person you connect to. And I thought, okay, this is functioning. The Bidwell Park Commission always kind of stuck at me because we've been talking about the parks being dirty and everything for like a year. And I'm like, where is the Bidwell Park people? Because their website takes you to this beautiful Bidwell Park. And you're like, okay, that's not reality. I mean, so I'm like, are they, I mean, that is kind of almost like, like false advertising a little bit. But so, and then again, when I hear ad hoc, when I worked in the business world, when you said ad hoc, you went, okay, you're never meeting. It's loosey goosey. It's not documented. You're not really gonna be there. You're not being held accountable. Your group question, Mr. Vandenberg, I mean, that's, they're gonna, I think people that are climate, they're really compassionate, they're gonna meet all the time. They're gonna meet as groups. But if you want something to be really documented, and if you go with the ad hoc, I would try to put something in this as you need to meet once a week, give us a report, give us information. Cause we're in California, we're in now a almost socialist country. We're gonna get handed down some mandates and some rules. And if we don't have our eyes on the ball, I feel like next year we're gonna be handed, like we're gonna need to hire a climate czar. That's gonna need to come in here and say, Chico, get your crap together. And again, we know that people in this community care about it. Every development, if you go to Marion Park, they have this really cool charging station for people that live and rent there. And they've got charging stations down at Target. You know, my brother's waiting for this electric Ford truck to come rolling out. So at some point we gotta get real. We need to make sure that they're all connected. And I think this group's really important for that. So thank you. I'll really quick on the ice rink too. From a climate perspective, when we're talking about water and electricity, it wasn't for climate change my concern. It was like, our neighbors are losing water. So it's not about the climate change. So thank you. Thank you. Jessica Giannola, followed by Bryce Goldstein. So I heard a suggestion similar to other problems that we have as a collective unit in the city of doing nothing. If we do nothing, the problems will only get worse. They will only get bigger. Greenhouse effects, pollution, all of the impacts on our temperature, our groundwater, our foliage, our increased fire activity, all of that's intertwined. It's all connected. And when we do a behavior like driving more than we need to, all of those things over time, eating more hamburgers than we need to, the gas and the gas released from the cows, and all of that impacts our air and our environment, which presses down on our ground and our heat that's trapped. And all of those impacts, they all affect us. So our behavior needs to be changed, and otherwise it gets worse. So we can't not do anything. I have concerns with this moving from a commission to an ad hoc. How does that impact public input? How is our participation involved with the change in that? And if we have, if it's meetings are up to, the mayor decides how many meetings we have or how long they are, what's not being discussed? And if it's limited, if it's not, I don't know. So there's concerns there with that. I suggest that the commission is just left as it is. We had it developed in 2019. We certainly haven't gotten better with anything. If we're progressing forward, we shouldn't be taking steps backwards and going back to how it used to be. We should keep moving forward. So I guess overall, it's just a bad idea to remove, I guess, the something that we've already have in place that's meant to keep our community healthier and thriving and moving forward. If it's an, it seems like it's a science related topic. And if we're not understanding as a collective unit, again, we can reach out. We have a university here. We have people that you can communicate with to understand what the benefits would be of a commission in this city addressing greenhouse gases. So please, if you don't understand it, please reach out. Don't just go to disband or limit the number of conversations that are chosen people that will be on the ad hoc community or people in the commission to discuss these important things that impact all of us. Thank you. Bryce Goldstein, followed by Emily Donaldson. Good evening. Until tonight, I haven't heard anybody in this community saying we should be doing less to address climate change. Nobody campaigned on this against addressing climate change. And I haven't even heard it discussed at city council until last meeting when five members of the city council voted, in my opinion, off topic to demote the Climate Action Commission back to an ad hoc committee. So the only reason why I can gather why this happened is that climate action is unpopular. And I think it's unpopular amongst a few people who presumably are also the leaders of corporations that funded your campaigns, because I do not hear that from the general public. I also want to know why it took so long to even discuss these appointments. It has been months. In fact, a year since our application process, we had planning commissioners appointed months ago. We have a full planning commission. And we had many, many qualified applicants for the Climate Action Commission. And those have dwindled. As time has progressed, and they have been ignored. And then I heard, I read in the press, one of the members of the city council saying something about lack of interest. There was no lack of interest in applying to this commission. There was a lack of interest from the city council in appointing people so that the commission could continue its vital work in addressing climate action in our community. Climate action is public safety. I hear about public safety all the time. We heard it at Business From the Floor. People campaigned on it. And public safety involves ensuring that our community isn't going to flood or burn down or be impacted by our roads eroding, things like that. That happened from climate change. So we need to do everything we can to address climate change. Part of that is reducing our emissions. And part of that is planning for the impacts. Adapting. We are in a changing climate. And yeah, we really need to be assessing this work, preventing it, adapting to it as much as possible. I don't know why we're moving backwards from having a climate action commission back to an ad hoc committee. And I was involved in this ad hoc committee in the past when I worked for the city through AmeriCorps as a Civic Spark climate fellow. And I know what great work the members of this commission do. And I was so excited to see them be able to move up from an ad hoc committee to a commission that meets more regularly, offering more opportunities for public interest. And so I'm really excited to see the impact on the public input and other things like that. I'm also a little concerned about the impact of this on the staff members who staff the commission and their job security. As I said, public input. I'm also thinking if you're looking for cost savings, you could have listened to the public comments that you've been receiving for years about reallocating our budget to spend less on police and more on housing and safe streets, or you could ditch the ice skating rink. Thank you. Emily Donaldson, followed by Grace Marvin. Good evening. I strongly oppose repealing or disbanding the Climate Action Commission. I think that this commission is necessary to ensure the implementation of the Climate Action Plan. I don't think that an ad hoc committee is going to be enough to ensure that the Climate Action Plan is implemented and that the city is able to implement it. I think that the Commission is held to these goals that were set forth. Climate change is an ongoing issue. It's not going to sunset. It's going to get worse. And so, I think that this commission is necessary, and I think that climate resiliency, you know, it's ongoing. And so, I think that the commission is necessary. I think that we need to act in a way that matches the scale of the problem. Thank you. and that we need to lead in a way that matches the scale of the problem. The problem is enormous, and the solutions are enormous as well. Carbon neutral by 2045 or by 2050, set by the state, 75% waste reduction by 2025. These are huge issues. So I think that we should keep the Climate Action Commission. I also wanted to add that young people are looking to our leaders to make these changes, and I think that it really just doesn't send a good message to disband the commission. Thank you. Grace Marvin, followed by Jared Geiser. Good evening, everybody. Please reconsider any attempt to abolish the Climate Action Commission to save $2,700 and some staff time by making climate change, an ad hoc group cannot be justified. The city could save so much more money paying ongoing and ever more attention to the climate emergency we are all facing. For example, the committee should stay vigilant in addressing energy costs at every level of government while promoting energy efficiency among all our citizens. Show good example. I think that we should be taking good examples to us rather than trying to turn the clock back to times when our population was not sufficiently aware of the damage we are doing to our planet, country, and city. Young citizens of Chico are highly aware of climate change and will vote accordingly. We must care for their futures. The city must show its support for strongly addressing climate change by climate change. We must protect our environment by keeping its commission status. Thank you. Jared Geiser followed by Addison Winslow. Hello. Good evening, everyone. I'd like to start by saying that I agree with all the previous speakers that have spoken in opposition to disbanding the Climate Action Commission because it plays a vital role in the city government and today's state and time. So a little background on myself. I went to Chico State. I studied climate change and the impacts of climate change on humans, and on human society extensively. I was actually in a class where I studied the impacts of climate change to Chico, and they are severe. And we need to change how we are living. We need to adapt to the impacts that we already know are going to happen so that my generation can live here. This is a serious crisis. An ad hoc committee for this issue is honestly insulting. There's no sunset on climate change. We've known about this issue for 40 years, and for those of you who don't know about it or have chosen not to listen to people talking about this, I encourage you to Google the greenhouse effect, and I'm sure there's a Wikipedia page that will explain the issue of climate change in probably a two-minute read. So please, if you don't understand this issue, do that. And I urge you, please, to maintain this as a commission. So I wanted to read a quote from the latest United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change AR6 report that says, for a 66% chance, the United Nations will be able to do this. The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The Celsius was the bare minimum that we need to limit warming to. And the latest report from the United Nations body that's spending all of this time on this, all of these resources on this, all of these scientists are dedicating their time on this issue. They said we have nine years of current emissions. So no, we cannot make this an ad hoc committee. We cannot brush this away and let the mayor decide all this. No disrespect to you, Mr. Coolidge, but this needs to be a public commission, as it is, as it was established in 2019, and as the community desires. So please do not consider this motion. Please think about my generation. Think about the city of Chico and what it's going to look like. And so, as other people have mentioned, this is a public health and safety issue. The biggest issues that I looked at when studying this in school for public safety were extreme heat, smoke impacts from wildfire, wildfire destroying our neighboring communities, and excessive and exacerbated droughts as a result of this. Please consider our future and our present, because this is affecting us now, and the city needs to do a whole lot more about this, and this commission is the least you can do. Thank you. Thank you. Addison Winslow, followed by Caitlin Dalby. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Five of you already voted to do what the public is here appealing you not to do, which is to span the Climate Action Commission and defund the efforts to plan intelligently for resilience and adaptation in the face of what's turning out to be a very tough reality posed to us by climate change in Chico. Forgive me if I mischaracterize some of your motives or overestimate your understanding of the purpose or utility of this commission. It's because this isn't something any of you have clearly available stances on. Besides, of course, Council Member Morgan, who I recall making a sarcastic remark about rescuing sea turtles. As well as more recently summing to the effect of, if China, who I assume you think is the absolute worst, is not doing their part, and let's assume that they aren't and won't be, then why should Chico be making an effort to be part of a united effort to steward habitability on planet Earth? Let me try and be convincing here, but first of all, be honest with you. You and your short-sighted, petty business interests are the reason people... are being forced to call for and depend upon the centralized government... Okay, Mr. Winslow, you can make comments as to what he said, but you can't make comments to him personally. I'm addressing this to you, too. No, but yeah, just don't make it personal to him. Okay, yeah, yeah. Yeah, or any of us, for that matter. The reason people are being forced to call for and depend upon the centralized government response to the climate crisis is this sort of mentality which you're pushing for here. Your hostility to action or even symbolism and solidarity with the interests of the rest of the planet... are a source of repressive despair the world over. The way you feel about Xi Jinping, Mr. Morgan, is the way people everywhere feel about you. What you describe your indignation at China for lagging is like a mirror of international climate negotiations... where Western powers like the United States who industrialize off-colonization and indiscriminate fossil fuel use... are called hypocrites for expecting formerly colonized countries to abstain from such usage in their efforts to reach a comparable standard of living. The most backwards, selfish, and parochial... aspects anyone could possibly associate with the American exceptionalist mentality you're splaying out right on the floor... putting it on a banner at the entrance to town and nonchalantly like you hadn't even thought about it previously. Like the agenda item of making appointments to the Commission was as much a surprise to you as your spontaneous pivot to disband the Commission was to the community. The little bits of progress towards sustainability in Chico have been made because of decades of consistent expression of support by the community. And they should not be reversed because of any one-off. It's all over our general plan. And since that plan was formed through dozens of community workshops, the reality we faced of extreme heat, droughts, floods, and wildfires have surpassed even conservative expectations. It's been especially bad for Chico, but the reality is we can expect it to be worse for others with far fewer means of leading and becoming a model for climate adaptation. So I encourage you to not roll back these efforts that we've been moving forward for years in the past. The time has come. The time has come. The time has come. The time has come. The time has come. The time has come. The time has come. The time has come. The time has come. The time has come. The time has come. The time has come. The time has come. The time has come. The time has come. The time has come. The time has come. The time has come. The time has come. The time has come. I have a master's degree in land resources and environmental science from Montana State University. So some people would say that I have a good idea of what we're talking about here. I'm also the executive director for Butte Environmental Council, a 46-year-old nonprofit dedicated to protecting and defending the land, air, and water of our region. We have thousands of your voting constituents as donors, members, volunteers, and followers on our media outlets. We're also partners of the city. Strong partners of the city, I would say. We've planted 700 trees with y'all in the last few years. First, I'd like to acknowledge that we gather on the traditional land of the Machu Picchu Indian tribe of Chico Rancheria. Butte Environmental Council acknowledges with gratitude the land itself and the indigenous people who have and continue to steward throughout generations since time immemorial. We've only been here but a blip of time. We're proud to be developing this land. Thank you for hearing our public comments this evening. I think the majority of us here can agree on the concept that we all want to leave this world better than we found it. Especially those of you with kids or grandkids or nieces or nephews think about that. We want to make sure that the choices that we're making today are going to positively impact those who come after us. Climate change is a public safety and health issue. And it is a long game. It's not a make a difference today or see how the effects play out tomorrow. We're talking decades. But those are our future generations. Those are our descendants, right? Farmers are suffering from drought and lack of water. Developers are at a disadvantage. With a non-streamline process. I don't know if those of you up there know that the Climate Action Plan actually streamlines the CEQA process for developers. And there are some good developers out there who may finally put in some affordable housing for us. The council ran on a platform for a safe Chico. The effects of climate change driven by polluting factors and overusing our natural resources are a direct threat to our public. And it's a direct threat to our health and safety. The commission is in charge of developing and implementing the city's Climate Action Plan because climate impacts in Chico are getting progressively worse. And include the deadly heat waves, prolonged droughts, extreme flooding, and mega fires. Please don't move forward with this process and keep our commission intact. Thank you. And Eric Nelson is our last speaker. Good evening. Carbon dioxide is being added to the Earth's atmosphere by the burning of coal, oil, and natural gas at such a rate to cause market changes in climate. This is a quote from the president of the American Petroleum Institute at their annual meeting in, believe it or not, 1965. The safe level of carbon in our atmosphere is 350 parts per million. We blew past that in 1987. The carbon is the most important element of the atmosphere. Carbon math is brutally simple. The more the emissions, the more the warming, the more the harm and the suffering. The science is clear. The Earth is warming at alarming rates. It is one thing not to have the knowledge about the danger before us. But we have it. We have been presented with it by nonpartisan scientists. We have been informed about what we need to do. Not acting on that knowledge is unconscionable. There are those that say, leave the problem to the state or the federal government. We have other problems to take care of. This is not an either-or. This is a both-and. And all of us, local, state, national, need to be on board to act decisively and boldly to urgently move away from fossil fuels and into a sustainable and clean economy, one that is just. And as Kimberly Nicholas says in the book Under the Sky, we make, quote, one that sees the values of quality of experience, not just quantity of material, deepening rather than just speeding up our lives. We need to lean into this opportunity. We need the bold and courageous local leadership that helps us envision and implement a clean economy that improves the lives of people in Chico by ensuring clean water and air, creating new jobs, reducing carbon in the atmosphere, making our homes and buildings more efficient, reimagining transportation by creating the infrastructure to support more bikes and buses. Many hard-working people have already provided a blueprint in Chico's Climate Action Plan. Decisive action in this moment means committing to the Climate Action Commission to keep our city focused on the action plan to continue to expand and improve it for Chico's sustainability and resilience. The Camp Fire, the Dixie Fire, increasing numbers of 100-degree days, the Camp Fire, the Dixie Fire, continuing drought, all of these are alarm bells. The question is not, what are the costs of doing this? The question is, what are the costs of not doing this, of not taking urgent action? We need to be good ancestors. We need to, and I quote Kimberly Nicholas again, to lift our sights beyond ourselves in the here and now and make what is necessary possible. We must engage together with ferocity and compassion and kindness at the root of our action. To get there. As an important part of the leadership of this community, please have the wisdom and vision to lead the charge and continue to fund the Climate Action Commission. Thank you. Thank you. All right. Further questions from council or comments? It's easy for everybody, but I do have a couple of comments. Number one, not a climate change denier. I don't believe meetings necessarily accomplish things. Somebody said there's a lot of ado about nothing here, which it is. The Climate Commission was made a standing commission two years ago because it made some people feel better, which is fine. Turning it back into an ad hoc commission doesn't really change anything. Yes, it would have a sunset, and I assume that sunset would be finished when we're no longer in some kind of climate crisis defined by whoever that is. That may decide those things. On the sea turtle comment, that was actually an accurate comment. Since the plastic bag ban in the city of Chico, there have been no Chico sea turtles found choking on plastic bags in Little Chico Creek. So that was actually an effective ordinance. I support it. And I'm going to support this ordinance, which I expect to fail, but I'd like to move on because this is a lot of rhetoric about changing a standing commission for which we have many that don't... have their regularly scheduled meetings anyway. The Architectural Review Board is canceled all the time. I get emails all the time about the Planning Commission not being met. So having a standard meeting for climate action when all of those mandates are already in our general plan and they're already handed down by the state, I understand it makes you feel better, but it doesn't make anything else happen. The ad hoc committee will do exactly the same thing. It can meet exactly as often as it needs to. More or less. Less or not. It's actually about creating government efficiency, which, gasp, doesn't happen from this dais very often. So I don't expect it to pass, but I don't want to keep talking about it. So I will make the motion to approve the ordinance of the City Council of the City of Chico repealing Chapter 2.54, entitled Climate Action Commission of the Chico Municipal Code, and turning it into an ad hoc committee. Is there a second? Okay, motion dies for lack of a second. Further comment? Do you have any comment? Or I can go, whichever you prefer. Okay, I'll go. Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. So this is something I've had an issue with for a long time. And maybe it's because I was born in the early 70s when this whole thing was getting rolling and, you know, a couple of Earth days in. I was, I'm just uncertain of why the environment has become a political issue in our country. I just simply don't understand it. We all want to leave the Earth better than we found it. That's what I learned from my parents. That's what I learned from Boy Scout. That's what I learned from all the way through my teachers and everything else. To that, at the same time, I think we shouldn't obviously, you know, there's a tradeoff. So with any impact on the environment, there's an impact on us and the world around us. So I think that needs to be measured. But, you know, in my first term, I championed and brought forward a program that did both those things. It was the LED light street program. And it saved the city $250,000 a year. And still is. And made us more energy efficient. So the council after us, after my term, which ended in 2018 for my first term, brought forward a second phase, which this council already enacted. And I believe we have a third phase, Mark, is that correct, coming forward? You know, I've obviously been someone who's been pushing solar. I tell the recycled art competition for ten years. You know, I can tell you this, though. So Chico, anyone who thinks that Chico doesn't do a lot on this issue is just blatantly wrong. Could we do more? Of course, you can always do more. But, I mean, we have a bicycle master plan, an urban forest master plan. We require any major road updates that include bicycle infrastructure. We have a plan for in-field development. We're exploring community choice aggregation for carbon neutral electricity. You know, and like I said, we have the energy saving programs. That's a big part of it. And I think that's a big part of it. The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The but that's what the state we live in and how we follow it. So at this point in time, I would like to see us just because, and someone mentioned it, you know, why haven't we appointed this committee already? There's obviously been some challenges, and we've had some new council members join us. So, you know, I'd make a motion to actually keep the commission as a standing commission as it is, but to go out and do another recruitment just to give our new council members and the community, since this has been some time, we might have some new folks interested, get a little wider choice of folks on there. So with that, I'd make that my motion. I'll second that. All right, we have a motion and a second. Any further discussion? All right. One more comment. Sure, go ahead, Council Member Tan. So I have heard here, and I mean, we all love this planet Earth that we are on. And like Mayor said, we want to leave it better than we got it. But we all want technology as well. I want to ask everybody who's here, do you all keep your ACs on 24 hours? How many of you have turned it off? Now we are in. Okay. Lower 80s. Right? We all use vacuum cleaners, and we all try to use each and every piece of equipment we can find. But we want to have a commission that tells the government how to not, how to control our environment, or how to not make our environment polluted further than it is already. I like to see more, it's not just the government's duty to do it. It comes with an individual. It comes with an individual responsibility. And I think each of us should work on it. It's just not the government's responsibility. Just forming a commission is not going to change it if we do not educate the people or our young generation. So how many times do we charge our iPhones in a day? You know, the students? I mean, everything is on it. Why can't we write it on a piece of paper? And I have noticed people put tools and words on a piece of paper, and it goes away. It goes in the trash. That is where we are hurting our environment more than anything. We are talking about reducing the carbon footprint or reducing the food wastage. And I did a research that Americans waste so much food that it's the third largest source of carbon is the food wastage. How many people here keep track of how much food you guys waste at your home? Which is wonderful. I applaud to you guys that you do that. Because I have seen people would buy a burger, take a bite, and put it in the trash. But if you tell them to put a $20 bill in the trash they won't do it. So I don't believe that just making a commission is going to change it unless we, each of us, work on ourselves. All right. Any further discussion? Mayor Kula. Mr. Koolage, if I may, just clarify something. You don't need a motion and action on this item. To continue the way we are. It exists. It exists. It exists. That was kind of the point of my motion. We could have been on a 10-minute break eight minutes ago. It exists. It's in the ordinance. But to go out for an additional recruitment, we would need a motion, yes? You do not need a motion and action for that, either. You have a commission that exists in the ordinance, so you can direct staff to do another recruitment. Okay, that's it. Okay, so I'll make a motion. I'll retract my original motion, make a motion to direct staff to go out for an additional report. Thank you. Thank you. And to clarify, we have seven applicants for five vacancies. All right, so do we have a second, or is my motion dead, too? Oh, did Casey second? Oh, okay. So we do have a second. All right, let's do the roll. And that was just to do an additional recruitment? Yes. Don't need. So we technically don't need that? Because it's something that we weren't necessarily going to do. Right, you don't need action. The city clerk administratively does that function. They do the recruitments. It's in the ordinance. You don't need action. But we had it done previously, so it's doing another recruitment, an additional recruitment. So we don't need action to do an additional recruitment. No, I think the city clerk hears you. Here's the will of the council, which is to get more votes. There we go. All right, sounds good to me. All right, with that, we're going to take a ten-minute break. All right. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. All right. All right. Okay, we'll move on, reconvene here. Sorry about the longer break than expected. Item 5.3, declaration of shelter crisis. Mr. Ewing. Thank you, Mayor Coolidge. Pursuant to Government Code Section 8698 at SEC, the City of Chico, may declare shelter crisis upon a finding of significant number of persons within the or without the ability to obtain shelter, resulting in a threat to their health and safety. The recommendation of the city attorney is that the City Council adopt a resolution making the findings necessary for declaration of a shelter crisis and declaring a shelter crisis pursuant to Government Code Section 8698.2. The recommendation of the deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy deputy crisis provides the city with the following options. Any vacant or underutilized facility or property currently owned, leased, operated, or maintained by the city through money derived by taxation or assessment may be designated a public facility, city-designated facility, for purposes of emergency sheltering during the declaration. The city may suspend the provision of any state law or regulation prescribing standards of housing, health, or safety to the extent that strict compliance would prevent, hinder, or delay the provision of emergency shelter in or on city-designated facilities. In place of the housing standards referenced above, to ensure minimal public health and safety, the city may enact health and safety standards effective only during the declaration. Slide 6 Slide 7 From time to time, the city may allow persons unable to obtain housing to occupy city-designated facilities during the duration of the declaration. The city is immune from liability for ordinary negligence in the provision of emergency housing to unsheltered persons during the declaration, limited to conditions, acts, or missions directly related to and which would not occur but for the provision of emergency housing. Slide 8 Fiscal impact. There are no funds being requested for emergency housing. The city may not be able to access it as part of this report. However, future actions regarding the use of city-designated facilities for emergency shelter may come with related costs. The alternatives are also set forth in the staff report you have before you. I'm available for any questions at this time. All right. Questions for Mr. Ewing? Council Member Bennett. So, I'm going to ask you to give us a few minutes to discuss the! If some of the, I'm going to say building codes are adjusted such that the work can continue with the sheltering situation, sheltering crisis, once the regulation is rescinded at some point, does the city need to go back and upgrade the facilities? I'm going to ask you to give us a few minutes to discuss the! If the city needs to be reduced from the existing facilities to current code, and I'm using code because that's what I'm used to, Building Code. Right. Or is it, I mean, how would that work if it was rescinded, the emergency crisis was rescinded? Is there a go back? If it were rescinded or if it, let's say, it's unscended or expired like the last one. So the question then would be, does the, would there be a reversion back to the application of those Building Codes to what has already been built, if you will? Or the city designated facility? The answer to that question is no. However, in conjunction with what you have before you, you'll see in the coming, at the next regular meeting or meeting after that, some other adjustments that are consistent with what the city attorney's office and city staff are doing to facilitate the process that the city is undergoing right now to move forward with a particular matter that we're discussing. In closing. Thank you, sir. Yeah. All right. Further questions? All right. How many speakers on this item? We have 13. All right. Let's see, three minutes. First speaker is Joyce Davis, followed by Lori Harris. And again, if your name is called as the next up, if you could just be ready to go. Appreciate that. Thanks. Go ahead. Good evening. I'm Joyce Davis. I am Joyce Davis. My great uncle was Fred. He'd be rolling over his grave right now. I have a practice on Mangrove where I have a shop and a practice. And what I want to address about this is I deal with these people, and I'm trying to find a nice way to put it, because they're not necessarily homeless. What I consider homeless is we have a friend staying with us right now. And he was in the fire from Greenville, okay, while they're finding a new home. That's homeless. These people that come out in front of my office, in fact, yesterday, a guy ran in to ... I was by myself because it was lunch hour. And he ran in, and he was definitely on drugs. I would say probably meth. He was talking a mile a minute, and I couldn't get him out. And thank goodness a guy came in to deliver me packages. And so he escorted him out. But it's one time it did scare me. He was definitely really high. But that's drugs. There's mental problems going on here. And there's two completely different things. And what I do know is you've got the Torah shelter. And I think y'all just gave them $300,000 plus. Well, we've got some declarations we're getting put together. And I'll tell you, there's a bomb ready to be dropped on you. And I think it's going to be dropped on Mr. Timothy, because over there, I think it's at True North Housing Alliance. What's going on over there? There needs to be some oversight, some audits, to find out what's going on with what we already have. Because that could be a great place, but there's too much politics going on. There's things going unchecked. We've had two moles in there. And what's been going on is they've got ... The gal that runs it, Janice, she's the one who's Jackie, she made a position for her boyfriend. You know what her boyfriend was doing? Stealing their medications. So if we can limit comments not to persons. Okay. Specifically, would you appreciate that? Yeah, that's fine. They're not locked up. And I don't understand that. They just have them behind a counter. That's institutional type of stuff. You don't do that. They should just be able to give them food, give them a place to stay, help them out, which I know they do. They do a lot of good things. But they're facilitating people that are not only on street drugs, but then pharmaceutical drugs. They don't have that ability. They shouldn't be able to do that. But then you've got the other side of this. They've got a disabled shower for men that's been out of commission for over a year. You know what just happened in there? They had a guy come in. He had his leg cut off at the knee from having diabetes. And it was still bandaged. He fell trying to get into the regular shower. Thank you. So anyway, there just needs to be better oversight of what we do have. Lori Harris, followed by Robin Engel. Thanks, Joyce, for that $300,000 amount of money. I didn't know that because my first comment was, how much money is going to be gained in lining someone or some groups, in the! Pack it why can't why can't why can't why can't why can't why can't why can't why can't why can't why can't why can't why can't why can't why can't why can't why can't why can't why can't why can't why can't why can't why can't why can't why can't why can't why can't why can't why can't why can't why can't why can't why can't that could be placed somewhere else they don't want to be. They would rather roam through my garbage cans and go and turn in their money. Cans, get their cans for their money. Live off the streets and knock on people's doors, raid their cars, or do something else. A shelter is not going to be a new thing for them. They're not going to go there and they're not going to stay. They need mental health. And don't think Butte County Services can help them. I already worked with those guys and they kept wanting to know, do you want me to call this person? In my former job, that's what they were supposed to be doing to help mentally ill people who didn't want to be housed. They still don't want to be housed. Causing another shelter in place won't help these guys. Have you looked at the hotels up and down Main Street? They're in such sad shape. Let's declare another crisis, why don't we? How much money? Is that really going to put into people's pockets instead of really helping homeless people? What they need is real people taking care of them mentally. What happened to the churches doing their job? Well, let's just let it off to the city and the state. Because we can get our money line. Just follow the money. It's pretty easy. Robin Engle followed by Julie Threat. To be clear, there's no new crisis. We've had a housing crisis for many years. There are, as stated in this summary of the agenda item, there are far too few housing units available for far too many people. And it's not too late to do the right thing. I'm fully in support of declaring a shelter crisis. I wish it had happened back in the day. I wish it had happened in June when it could have much more easily happened and we wouldn't have to waste our time now on it. But we certainly are still in crisis. Your motives may be money, but whatever. I'm glad that this is back on the agenda. And hopefully you'll move forward in declaring a shelter crisis because there certainly is a shelter crisis that exists in the Chico and that gets worse and worse by the day, by the hour. As I said earlier, there was a murder because of it. So we need to make a change and we need that change to start here and now. Thank you. Julie Threat followed by Jessica Giannola. Okay, so when I saw this on the agenda, the first thing I was totally confused. I'm like, oh my gosh, I missed the last meeting and what happened? It was just in June. We had a three-year crisis and then it went away. Now what happened in like three months? So I immediately knew. It has to do something with the legal proceedings going on. This has to be an important step to get us to the end because you're all supporting it, I think. So I'm like, okay, just let it alone. I support it. So then we just had that last conversation. I'm like, it's the term crisis. What does that mean? What's the definition of a crisis? I know mine's different than yours. So it really has to do with a government entity, a regulation about the term crisis. So at any point when you talk about something being a crisis or an emergency, definition from the government perspective, would be greatly appreciated. It can't mean like no homeless, zero, nobody living on the street, no crime or else we don't have a crime crisis. And the COVID, the health emergency order, that drives me insane the most. Nuisance, he's allowed to make decisions because he's got emergency power. I'm like, when is it not going to be an emergency? Like no cases, no anything. I need like a figure, a number to target. So from a government perspective, if this helps us get through certain regulations and certain things to move us forward, great. Because I know you're all absolutely comfortable and compassionate and concerned. And it's a priority of yours to, and you're worried about the homeless and the health and all that. This has nothing to do about you thinking it's not an emergency or a priority. It just has to do with these particular events. And then going forward, as you all are moving to the next phase, as things start to be able to be communicated, just remember you guys now are like 10 steps down the road. You've got all this body of knowledge. You've been all, you know, you've got the full, you've got the full body of information. So you're kind of down the road. And Sean, I totally appreciated your radio thing because I was like, oh my gosh, four to six months from now, this is going to be amazing. So, but I'm like, I'm way back. Huh? Okay, I'll send you a copy. So, and I'm like the kid in the backseat here going, are we there yet? Are we there yet? Are we there yet? And I'm like, and then in the middle, there's all this stuff happening. People have little pieces of information. So again, you're going to have to bridge the gap because, you know, I'm like four to six months, I'm not buying it. I'm way back here. But you're seeing things I'm not. And so you've got people in the middle that are going to, you know, kind of get confused or misinterpret and, you know, not, or, you know, go, okay, four to six months, really? I don't believe it. I don't buy it. So again, just remember to kind of bring us back to, I'm over here, move us forward a little bit. So, but I support a shelter crisis for this particular situation. Jessica Giannola followed by Grace Marvin. Okay. So imagine my surprise to see this on the agenda. I've been asking since April that we extend and then reenact the shelter crisis declaration, specifically for funding that could be available for case management, any resources that can help reduce the impact of our shelter crisis. People don't have enough places to live. Homeless is homeless. There's an environment that's not safe for homeless people. We have environmental refugees and we have circumstantial refugees. Either way, they still need housing. And we have shelters, yes. We have the JC that is program-based. So if people are enrolled in the program and they participate, then they can stay with their services. Housing is still limited. Remember, this is a shelter. People need housing, too. Torres is also limited in services. We do need a third. I don't know if that will happen, but we do need a low-budget housing. We do need a barrier because we have people who are suffering addiction who still need to be housed. They need to be sheltered. And if the two shelters that we have are not doing that, then you can see where there could be a benefit of a third. Both of them have, the ones that we have, have case management as far as I know. So if someone is suffering from a mental illness, which a lot of people do, there's depression, anxiety. It's very common. They may need to take medication just to regulate, get them back on an even keel. So we have a barrier. That should be supported. People, they don't need to be institutionalized because they're taking medication or because they've suffered brain damage from whatever many, many reasons they could. Our goal should not be to make the judge happy by this declaration. So when I heard this declaration, I was like, okay, what is it for the city? What's the city getting out of this? Because we've been asking for this. And why suddenly is this on here to be approved? So I'm hoping that there's good intention here. I heard something about being released of liability. I'm hoping we're not going to have some suggested options that could place people in more danger and that this is kind of the sidestepping preemptive, okay, we can't be held liable because we have a declaration now. So I'm hoping we have good intentions. Seeing where we would have gone wrong in the past, again, with this seeking out information on the housing crisis, what do people need? They need to know. They need buildings. They need vouchers. They need support, case management. They need a whole slew of things that I wish our council was more informed on that you can also inform our community on so that they're better informed. Okay, thank you. Grace Marvin, followed by Laura Cusona. Greetings again. Thank goodness and thanks to the courts and much local advocacy, the city of Chico is on the verge of declaring a shelter crisis for approximately 571 homeless in Chico. The relevant government code 8698, named in section two of this resolution, includes shelter facilities with particular basic requirements as well as simpler shelters with fewer detailed specifications. The latter can include tents in designated city-owned areas. This declaration by the city of Chico involves the development of a continuum of shelter and service options for the homeless, meaning that the city can avail itself of national, state, county, and local resources to not only provide suitable shelter but also appropriate services. Then our currently homeless souls will have an opportunity to get therapy and treatment. They will also be able to get a job, a job training, social, and other support. Eventually, they will no longer need homeless shelters or facilities. A statistic that's relevant here in light of what the earlier comments were made is that approximately 75% of our homeless are from our county. They were here before the campfires and the North Complex Fire. They're not outsiders coming in. My husband, Julian Ziener, and I strongly support the city signing in onto this Chico resolution of declaring a homeless crisis in our fair city as described in government code 8698. Thank you. Laura Kuzona, followed by Tom Van Overby. Good evening, Council. Good evening, staff. It's been a while. It's great to be back in the chambers. It seems like a topic that I keep showing up on. For those of you who don't know me, I'm executive director for the Jesus Center. And the Jesus Center is also host to the Renewal Center that will be adding 100 low-barrier beds in the next 18 months. I just wanted to say a word about this, that it was just three years ago that we were here and the room was filled with people as we were pushing into our first year of the Chico resolution. And this was the first declaration of a shelter crisis, right before the campfire, actually. And the service providers and many of the citizens were motivated because there were dollars on the table through the state of California that required that we would declare in each of the municipalities a shelter crisis. I want to just make that distinction because I think it's really important to understand that we're not, I don't think we're discussing whether or not we have a homelessness crisis, small h, small c. We're talking about a particular declaration that then gives us certain opportunities both back in 2018 and through June 30th of this year, evidently for this year and in the months to come, particularly from the perspective now of the city, versus then it was more from the service providers who were seeking funding. One of the projects that I was very involved in and we still are seeing the fruit of, is the mobile medical unit. Ampla Health received almost a million dollars from those heap dollars. It has provided access to very important health provision, particularly poignant in this last 18 months with the COVID-19 virus. And I think we can count them as one of the reasons why the spread among the homeless has been fairly limited. I just want to say that I believe that we seek these kinds of tools so that we can use all of our resources, to address the issues that face our community. The private sector, the Jesus Center, the Torah Shelter, CHAT, who's present here this evening as well, we are doing all we can to harness private dollars. And the Jesus Center continues to push forward. We have, I think, $33,000 this year from the city of Chico, but all our other resources come from private sources or contracts that we have. And so we will build our $18 million project with private dollars. But, that does not solve all our issues, as many people have said. We still have limited resources. So we welcome the city doing a part of this work. You already put a lot of resources to the work with folks on the street. And I know you carry a lot of the burden. And so we welcome your creativity and your seeking resources using this declaration of shelter crisis to that end. Thank you. Tom Van Everbeek, followed by Larry Wall. I'm glad I'm going after, before Larry, instead of after. It's a tough act to follow. I'm going to start by telling you something you have not heard tonight yet. And that is, thank you, council, for moving so quickly to, after you were installed, to clean up our public spaces. We are in a crisis which you inherited from our previous council, which is why they were unelected. The way forward involves the necessity of approving an emergency shelter crisis. Which is the Texas Declaration, which is you probably know will make some people unhappy. Most of these people, however, remind me of a friend's ex-wife who was unhappy before she was married. And she was unhappy while she was married. And after divorce, she was still unhappy. And she blames my friend for all three phases of that unhappiness. So I would ask you to look past that. On a recent trip to Germany, I asked a police officer whether they had homeless people, because I didn't see them. I didn't see any. I mean, everything was very clean. And they didn't have people begging in the streets. And he said that they had, yes, they had homeless people, but they had a place to go. And he said something very important. They were not allowed to disrupt civic life. And I think that's the core issue here. Not allowed to disrupt civic life. So there are about 571 people homeless in Chico. And some are unfortunate. They're all humans. Some are unfortunate. Some made bad choices. But they're destroying civic life in Chico. Bidwell Park, the downtown, our creeks, everybody has a story. The good news is that this is fixable. For the first time in decades, the city knows what it has to do. It has an outline of what it has to do to fix this crisis for the benefit of the citizens of Chico, as well as the homeless. All of you understand that to have the restraining order lifted will probably involve a shelter solution. And this is just by looking at the reality of the situation. The city has a past to make this happen, but it's impossible to have a shelter solution without the approval of emergency crisis declaration. A no vote means we'll be under the restraining order indefinitely with the result of increase in misery for Chico and the homeless. Our parks and downtown will become increasingly dangerous and squalid. Yes vote gives Chico the access to state federal resources, legal protections, to resolve the current situation cost effectively and in months rather than years. All of you understand what is at stake here. I trust you have the courage and love for this wonderful town to vote yes and clear the path out of our current predicament. Thank you. Larry Wall followed by Bryce Goldstein. Good evening, your honor, council, Larry Wall. Common sense, common sense, something we all aspire to, some of us have it, not all of us use it. But passing this resolution in declaring a shelter crisis is a no-brainer and a common sense thing. It's going to give us access to apply for money to help fix our problem. It's going to help us. It's going to help us. It's going to, it's going to, careful how I say this, it's going to make the judge, I believe, a little bit more amenable to our, to our situation. He's more apt to look favorably upon us than if we don't pass it. It is also going to lead down the way to providing those in need with a shelter space and a place to rest. And it also will provide an opportunity in the future. Near future, we believe, to clean up our parks, our waterways, and our public spaces. When that happens, tourism and business activity will increase once again. And so it is a very simple thing to ask of you all just to pass the darn thing and get it behind us so we can move on. If we don't pass it, I think we've just put up more obstacles. Your constituents are asking for it. And I'm here representing them. I'm representing a good number of them. Thank you. Bryce Goldstein, followed by Jared Geiser. Hello again. I feel a little bit like I have deja vu. I was here three years ago advocating for declaring a shelter crisis, and fortunately we did that. And then a few months ago, I was here advocating for continuing to have that declaration in place that we are, as pretty much everyone knows, experiencing a shelter crisis. So I think it's a no-brainer, as others have said, to pass this and declare a shelter crisis. I'm just wondering why the change of mind. It makes sense. We can get more money for the service providers in this community, and we can help address this crisis. So hopefully we can agree on two things tonight. Thank you. Jared Geiser, followed by Tom DiGiovanni. Hello, everyone. I'd like to start by saying yes, I believe you should declare a shelter crisis. We've never not had a shelter crisis since it was originally declared in 2018. There was talk earlier tonight about a waste of city resources. I think talking about this issue three times when it should have only been discussed once is a bigger waste of resources than standing commissions. I've helped with creek cleanup. Just this last month, I helped with the creek cleanup. Several tons of trash were removed from the creeks. And a lot of that is on the ground. And I think by addressing the shelter crisis, we can eliminate some of that waste that is a result of human habitation in our creeks. And I think a shelter crisis is an easy thing a city can do to move towards addressing the issue. And so, yeah, I think that we need to provide shelter for those without it for both humanitarian and environmental reasons. And I would like to see some awesome solutions come out of the shelter crisis declaration, such as a sanctioned campground and a suitable location that will gain wide access to the community. And I think that we need to provide some widespread use among people that are unhoused in our community, as well as tiny house villages such as Everhart Village. So I just wanted to say, yep, please declare this crisis. Tom DiGiovanni, followed by Leslie Johnson. Good evening, Mayor and council members. In general, I think we can decide to move away from how we got here. This reconsideration of the shelter crisis. I think it's important to note that the shelter crisis declaration, which expired earlier this year, by listening to folks right now, it looks as though there's a strong appeal to move forward. What I know about homelessness, I learned from Laura after working with her for a couple of years. And believe me, and I'm sure you know. I'm sure you know. I think it's a very challenging set of problems. So my own suggestion here is to focus on best practices, proven practices, and certainly to try to bring, and that will likely bring, a remedy to the lawsuit, and deliver some needed relief to the broader community. Thank you. And our last speaker is Leslie Mellon. Lee Johnson. Good evening. I think it's pretty clear that the conditions are present for this declaration. We do have a significant number of persons within the city without the ability to obtain shelter for whatever reasons. They're not able to get into housing on their own without some help and it does result in a threat to their health and safety. So the circumstances are there and the benefits of adopting it, we, you know, have already been discussed it. It gives us as a city more options, more possibilities for some innovative solutions, some alternative solutions, doing things that we wouldn't necessarily be able to do in ordinary times to address this and get it resolved and it does open the door to more funding. We can have the most willing and dedicated provider organizations and churches and everything else, but if there's no funding, it's hard to really deal with a big problem like we have facing us. So this opens the door to some state and federal funding potentially that can really, really make a difference. So I'm for it and I hope you'll go ahead and adopt the shelter crisis declaration. Thanks. That was our last speaker? Correct. All right. Councilman? I got a few. Mr. Morgan? All right. So the previous shelter crisis did not bring in a lot of change and it did not bring in a big money windfall. I'm not sure this one will either. So here's the current situation of the city. We are in crisis. Very bantered round term tonight. The city is kind of like Apollo 13. No one has been here before. Chico's fighting the results of Boise versus Martin and we're doing it alone. There is no playbook, there are no best practices, and there is no clear path out. We can't create cleanliness and safety and according to some we can't supply the beds required by a very vague law. There is, though, a strategy. The strategy that may allow us to enforce our rewritten ordinances and provide for the citizens most in need. We can't talk about that strategy. We're bound by pending litigation and confidential negotiation . Now you can dispute that . That is in the right, but try going public and see what happens. That said, the staff leading our strategy believes the declaration of a shelter crisis will help us return to a city within our control and the ability to be transparent about it. If we don't believe the shelter crisis is necessary, regardless of what's happened in the past, we don't believe in the strategy. And if we don't believe in the strategy, we don't believe in the executive team leading it. And if that's the case, anyone who votes against this resolution, and thus the strategy, I would expect later tonight to agendize a discussion to replace some number of the executive team. I don't expect I'll see that happen. Our strategy involves getting to a safety and cleanliness, the return of our plaza and parks, and yes, maybe doing some things that we wouldn't normally do because they are unproven. I look forward to the return. I look forward to the return of the city citizens voted for and the ability to be transparent about how and why we've done the things that we've done and the things that we are going to do. I am optimistic that we are doing well in our negotiations. I've heard positive things from both sides. I've heard positive things personally from the judge. I believe in the strategy. I believe in the staff. Therefore, I believe it is necessary that this resolution be passed. And with that, I will make that motion. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Do you have a comment, Mayor, as well, before we vote, if that's okay? All right. Do we have a second on the motion? I'll second that motion. Go ahead, Councilman. Kind of reveals my position, doesn't it? So I do understand the contentiousness of this issue. I know it may be perceived by some as government throwing more money without any accountability or creating something that we can't control as a city. I get that. However, we are at a crisis point in our community. We've heard it from community members. We've heard it from community members throughout my short time as a Councilmember. This injunction that hangs over our head right now and its impacts is a detriment to both the housed and the unhoused alike. I view the Shelter Crisis Declaration as strategically necessary, as Councilmember Morgan stated as well, to offer the most expedient resolution to the injunction. And expediency regarding this issue should be a Council priority, the Council priority. And I suspect it is the community priority as well. So we are never asked to find the perfect solution. They do not exist. But we are asked to find the best one. It is my position that the best solution leading toward resolution of this injunction, and the only way I see to do so, is to have it in the best possible way. And to do so expediently is this Declaration. It is the best path forward for all. So therefore, I will support this Declaration and I second the motion made by Councilmember Morgan. All right. Further comment? I do. Vice Mayor Reynolds. So, I just want to say that I am beyond apprehensive to declare this Shelter Crisis. To say I'm apprehensive, that's an understatement. A lot changed January of this year regarding Shelter Crises and the Declaration of them. We are signing on for a lot more bureaucracy and reporting that will become state mandated, unfunded liability for our city for the years to come. Just getting that on the record. With that being said, we're in a place our community has never been, we're in a place we've never been before. Overwhelmingly, I hear every day, people clearly hearing that we're in a place where we've never been before. And so, I want to say that from our community members that they want safe access to their parks and waterways. And equal enforcement of the laws in our community. With all that said, we have staff that has been spending hours and hours and hours with the plaintiffs and the judge. And that same staff is recommending this based on those conversations and this is what we need to move forward. To be clear, this likely will not bring any money to the city. But we are going to be able to do that. And that will for sure end up costing us money. I.e. all the mandates in 8698. So, that's what I have to say. Alright, Council Member Brown, you had some comments? I'm feeling a little whiplash, honestly. And I can imagine the public on all sides of this issue probably feels the same. Earlier this year, this council voted down the effort to extend our shelter crisis declaration for two years. So that we would have the tools at our disposal to implement it. Or support solutions to our housing and homelessness crises. Despite the fact that keeping a shelter crisis declaration on the books had absolutely no adverse impact on the city. It was shot down under the premise that we don't have a shelter crisis at all. All of the reasons listed in this staff report were presented at that meeting and it was shot down then. Here we are in the name of strategy. Having access to all of the tools at our and service providers' disposal should have always been a part of our strategy. And we were never obligated to act on it. I'm going to be consistent and aligned with the evidence by supporting this item. We've been in a shelter crisis and in need of the tools that it allows. We remain in one and in need of those tools. Changing that designation based on what is most convenient for us as a body doesn't look like leadership. And how this issue was dealt with earlier this year looks a whole lot like partisanship. So I'm going to vote yes on this item, but I am going to do it with my nose plugged. I hope we continue to do this. I hope we do the right thing on this issue. And I sure hope we stop playing ping pong with our citizens and with the very real and very severe crises that we're facing. All right. Council Member Tandon? No? All right. Mr. Bennett? All right. Oh boy, what an issue. So I brought this forward in 2018. And put it on the agenda and asked it to be agendized. And was, some might say, the deciding vote in it. And looking back on that decision, nothing happened. Really. No money. No solutions. Through two different councils. As the problem got progressively worse. And I can tell you, I've had a lot of constituents reach out to me about this. During the campaign I had a very, very clear path of thought on this. It hadn't been worthwhile. We didn't really receive anything. It wasn't necessary. But I've had a lot of my constituents reach out to me. And, you know, and of course, looking at the strategy of the city, too. I definitely had some deep thought about this. Because it's a complicated issue. And it's not easy. It's easy to say one thing or the other and just, you know, have whatever rhetoric you want to have. And we've certainly heard it. But it is something that we need to do. And we need a solution, too. You know, I've talked and seen our state head down a terrible path on housing that's made it more expensive. And harder to build for years. Saying that we need to have more affordable housing. We need to stop it. All the while continuing what they're doing. And still to this day continuing what they're doing. Same with mental health. Getting rid of the hospitals. I love to hear certain groups of people talk about how terrible it was to get rid of mental health hospitals. And say how we need mental health. And do nothing to bring it back. Drug treatment has turned into drug promotion. Someone's on the phone. Drug treatment's pretty much in the state of California turned into drug promotion. All the while saying that we need drug treatment. Drug treatment. Drug treatment. I realize why we need this. It's a tough pill to swallow, though. I'll tell you. And I realize we're trying to treat the patient. But I'd really rather find a cure to the disease. And I think everybody in the room would probably agree with that. At least in general. So with that, I'll call for the vote. Council Member Bennett? Yes. Council Member Brown? Aye. Council Member Morgan? Yes. Council Member O'Brien? Yes. Aye. All right. Moving on. Item 5.4, consideration of appointment of cannabis permit appeals board. And Mrs. Rogers, are you prepared on this one? Or if we need the city manager to help you out, I think he can. But I know you've prepped well. But without Ms. Presson here. I will start and pass off if I need to. All righty. Go ahead. Thank you. The city has received several timely filed appeals for rejection of cannabis permit applications pursuant to Chico Municipal Code 5.42.160. The appeals should be forwarded to council with any member of the council requesting the city clerk to place the matter of determining the appeals board on the next regularly scheduled council meeting. The council is being asked tonight to choose to either serve as the appeals board or appoint another body to serve as the appeals board or to direct the city clerk's office to obtain the services of a hearing officer from the Office of Administrative Hearings. If the council chooses to appoint itself as the appeals board, the appeal hearings will tentatively be scheduled for the November 2nd Council Meeting or the council may also hold a special meeting to hear the appeals. appeals. That concludes my questions. I would just like to ask the city attorney if you could give us a recommendation on what you've maybe seen in other communities. And then my second question, follow-up question to that is this appeals board, are they only hearing the appeals that are happening right now? Or if at the end, say we have 20 applicants and we choose three, those other 17, if any of those appeal, is it the same board appealing that? Or I don't even know if there is an appeal process at that point. So those are my two questions. Thank you. Thank you, Vice Mayor Reynolds. What I've seen in communities that we represent throughout California is often the same thing. We have a lot of people that are appealing to us, but we don't have the same thing. So I'm just going to ask you to give us a little bit of a breakdown of what you've The city council wants to be the appellate body because the city elected officials have a sense of what they want and what their constituents want in their communities. These are cities with council districts and these are also cities without council districts, although as you probably know from the recent districting process, most cities in the United States, I mean in California, are going to districts. That's an eventuality. And then of course, there are some smaller jurisdictions, where because of time constraints, the council chooses not to act as the appellate body and they delegate that responsibility to an administrative hearing officer or they designate a particular body that is not the council members to be the hearing body. So I've seen all three. In terms of recommendation, my recommendation to you is that you function as the appellate body because you represent your constituents, you represent your district, and I trust that each one of you has a pretty good sense of what's going on in your district and what you want for the city of Chico. All right, further questions? Council Member Brown? Yeah, I appreciate it. I was going to ask the same question, so thanks Vice Mayor Reynolds. I don't actually have a strong feeling either way, but I think I've heard that in other communities that there's keeping the processes, the way that the council is moving away from councils, kind of eliminates that appearance of impropriety piece of things. And so I was wondering if, A, you could speak to that. I know some of the lawsuits that have come out of other communities have been because of the appearance of bias on the part of councils, and I wouldn't want to put us in any danger in that way. I certainly can. So that issue does arise from time to time, and what you see with what we've seen anecdotally is, sometimes you have applicants who will try to influence the process by trying to get to you, or members of your staff, if you have a staff, to bend your ear about their particular appeal, and then that information is, those ex-party communications are disclosed or are not disclosed, they should be disclosed, and you then have subsequent challenges to the ultimate decision that's made by the appellate body. It happens. And that's frankly true with many appellate bodies. There are other appeals, and it's not necessarily appeals in this area, it could be appeals that come before you for other land use issues, so that is something that you would hazard. I would say, however, objectively, if you appoint a body, or if you hire an administrative law judge, or an administrative hearing office, the latter would probably be the most, give you the most immunity or insulation. I think the administrative hearing officers would really be aggressively hands-off. If you appointed another body, you still run the risk of people trying to influence that body behind the scenes, if you will. So we've experienced all of those issues, and we try to navigate them. But my recommendation remains despite that peril that you raise, and that is you represent the city of Chico, you were elected to do so, and you have a pretty good sense of the constituents that you represent in your district and what they want in their district. Great. Thank you. So, Mayor, I have a question for Mr. Ewan. So along those lines, if we did, say, go in the direction of having a hearing officer, we could craft it with a final say by full council if there was something that was disagreed upon or maybe by the applicant. If they wanted, like, a lot of hearings, you know, you have layers of different administrative processes. Is that something that you have seen in your experience? I can't say that I, what we've experienced is we see the administrative hearing offices being the final say, right? So it's binding. So their decision is not appealable. Now, that doesn't mean that you can't make a non-binding. That's not a big decision to send this matter to an administrative hearing officer and say, but this is going to be non-binding, in which it would come right back to you if the parties are unhappy with the result. But what we've seen consistently is binding. It's like binding arbitration. Right, right. Okay. Thank you. Yeah. Thank you. Well, I guess based upon the... I guess based upon the recommendation of our city attorney, then I would... I'm reluctant to have us do it just because I'm reluctant to do anything that's going to cause more lawsuits or anything else. But I think any way we go in this particular... in dealing with cannabis, we're going to be in problem either way. So I would make the recommendation or make the motion that we as the city council... Oh, sorry. That's all right. How many? How many speakers do we have, Madam Clerk? We have two. All right. Let's do that. Three minutes. First speaker is Julie Threatt, followed by Jessica Giannola. Could have guessed that second one. Okay, so... Okay, so when... I do have to say that you're not allowed to wear political shirts, but I know Parker Posey isn't really running for president. So... Okay. I'm not... I don't... In this month... I was just kidding. We need to lighten the mood a little, so... Go ahead. Okay, so when I read this one, the first thing I thought was... I'm like, the options. Appeals, the city... That's like the rooster guarding the hen house. I didn't know where the appeal went, but I'm like, oh, no. No. Then I see another body. Who's this other body? Are they from the community? Are they like a commission? You guys like hire them, get out? Okay, that sounds... A hearing officer? Oh, no. That's like a state person coming in and they don't know. They don't know our stuff. They don't know our business. They don't know our people. And so I was listening to the comments and I'm thinking, okay... Again, I'm no hearing officer. But if it's binding... I mean, these people could go appeal, appeal, appeal, appeal. So it just sounds... I guess at the end of the day, I think it makes sense to just try it. You guys be the appeal board, see how it goes. And then if it... Again, just... You guys are dealing with so much now, you're going to have to appeal this stuff. But okay, so I guess it's the... I think the city council is the best bet. Anybody else is at arm's length. Be efficient. Less cost. The hearing officer sounds like a big bunch of administrative nightmares. So stay away from that one. But really quick... Because it reminded me that I haven't heard what's going on with the candidates program. For one, I'm a big fan of the program. I'm a little worried about the downtown, but I haven't heard anything. So I'm like, okay. The 1% sales tax, that raised it again for me. Because we had been given some... You know, when they all came in and gave their pitches, we were going to get this money, a percent of the revenue or whatever it was. And I didn't know if this kind of had gotten... And so I Googled, you know, what's going on in Chico. And literally it was like, oh, we've got all of these. You know, the 10 top cannabis delivery things for Chico. I'm like, I didn't know we had those. So I wrote them all down. You know, positive roots and 530 green trees and fire farmers. And I was like, really, where are these? And somebody said, oh, it's just the delivery people, right? They really come from Sacramento or one of these approved places. I'm like, but there's one like .5 miles from my house. Like .5. I'm like, is that like Canyon? I'm like, it's literally on Marigold. I mean, the little Yelp on Marigold. I'm like, behind PV. I'm like, but there's no address. But it's pointing me to this. I'm like, what is that? So I just would want to just raise that up, bring it up. There's something right there on Yelp, on Marigold, behind PV, that says that they're the ones that bring the stuff to my house or wherever they're going. So just something to be aware of. Really, there's no... Oh, it's fire pharmaceuticals. Fire pharmaceuticals. Our last speaker. Our last speaker is Jessica Giannola. I'm going to actually suggest the opposite of having the council serve as the appealing board. I just feel like sometimes a council or a governing body can be more divergent. And I don't... I don't feel like ours is. I feel like ours sways really, really, really hard in one direction. And that's not really fair to people who are... Their businesses depend on your answer. So if you're already telling them no to begin with, if they're taking their appeal back to you, they're just going to get another no. So I think that to have a fair appeal process, it would not involve the council. It would involve people from the community, perhaps strongly, including people who are knowledgeable about the profession that is, like, if it's cannabis, someone who's knowledgeable about the concerns, like legit-backed concerns, the benefits, how the businesses are ran, all of that. Someone should be knowledgeable if they're making these decisions for our community and these businesses. These are local business people that we're discussing. And so I just feel like it just... They wouldn't have a fair shot if you're making that final decision in an appeals process. Yeah. All right. Any further questions? I did have one more. Mr. Young? I guess I'm just hesitant because with the districting process, you know, we're going to represent a particular area and then, you know, obviously, it's going to skew a little bit depending upon, you know, the representation and census and things. So is it binding with the council, too, as well? The appeal? So when they appeal to us, that's binding, right? There's no other appeal unless they were to go to court, correct? That's correct, according to the Muni Code. So the decision of... If the council is the appellate body and the appellant presents their case and the council, the council's decision is final. Now, mind you, the decision is the decision, whether it's yay or thumbs up, thumbs down. You can disagree with the position of the city staff. You can agree with the position of the city staff. And then the remedy available to the appellant would be to litigate the issue, to appeal your final decision. Okay. I guess I'm more concerned with, you know, it being brought back at a later date, back to council, for an additional hearing or anything like that, if the makeup of council were to change or something of that nature. So you would have an appeal. We have a certain timeline that's running. Once that appeal happens and the final decision is rendered, and that would be before an election, before this body is reconstituted, the applicant would either live with the decision or appeal the final decision. Let's assume it's the city council. And that appeal would go to the superior court. Okay. So they could appeal the final decision of the city. They couldn't bring it back at any point. It wouldn't come before you. It wouldn't come before you. Okay. Not at a future date or anything like that. No. I mean, a lot of things can happen. Like I often say to you, anybody can sue. But now, someone could do that. That doesn't mean whether procedurally it would be correct. Okay. So there is no vehicle for a motion, I mean, for an appeal reconsideration with a new council. Okay. I haven't seen that one. That's really the hard one. Okay. So, okay. That answers the question. Thank you. So, quickly, I want to second the vice mayor's motion before she makes it. But we're not talking about a bunch of, this isn't like going to go on forever. There's like three or four appeals. The staff, again, they put together a process by which these things would be approved. It was very straightforward. Some people didn't make it. Sorry. This body, or one before it, was, what's a nice word that I can get away with using? Not very smart. In approving cannabis to begin with. We painted all these rosy pictures. It's going to bring in money. It's going to do this. We're going to change the world. It's going to solve climate change. It's bad. Anybody that looks at it, I heard lots of people come forward. Lots of people. All the data shows this. No one showed me any data. For six years, I was the only person that showed data. I had it from Boston Children's Hospital. I had it from Harvard. All the data is bad. All of it. It's bad for the community, having said that. We approved it. Less than some people wanted. I appreciate that. We moved forward. I settled with it. But if we're going to be, if we're going to make the decision to allow the stuff into the community, we should be the ones that have the accountability to listen to the people that didn't get their way and couldn't fill an application out the right way. So I stand with the vice mayor after she makes her motion. All right. With that, we'll toss to the vice mayor. So officially, my motion would be that we appoint the city council to serve as the appeals board. I would like to second that. All right. Council Member Tannen, you had a comment? I just had a quick question. That, I mean, we're choosing number one. It looks like there is a motion on the floor. But in case we would have chosen the number three to have an office of administrative hearing, in the application process, is there a fee that they might have to pay? If it have additional costs to do this hearing? I'm just curious to know about that. Yes. The applicant bears the costs. That's true typically with entitlements and permits and licenses. We, the city, are not bearing the cost for you applying to do or operate XYZ business. And if you run into challenges or whatever that require you to appeal, you're going to pay for that, not the city. Thank you. So just further along those lines. So if, in fact, we had an appeal board, they would pay for that process, correct? That's correct. But for council, they would not? Not for your time. Yeah. Yeah. I get that. We're not going to charge them. Okay. Just one last quick comment. We are talking three applications that are strictly appealing based upon zoning. We are not judging people's business, their plan, what they're doing. This is... Strictly the zoning part to get to the next step to get down to HDL or whoever's rating them from this point. So I think we locally know best our community and the zones and can see that the best. That's why I made that motion. All right. Any other comments? All right. I have a motion from the vice mayor and a second from council member Morgan. Take the roll. Council member Bennett? Yes. Council member Brown? Council member Morgan? Yes. Council member O'Brien? Yes. Council member Tandon? Yes. Vice mayor Reynolds? Aye. And mayor Coolidge? Aye. Carries 7-0. All right. You guys want a break or you want to push through? Push through. All right. I like it. I don't know. I heard the city manager's report's like an hour. Okay. Item 5.5. Council member Tandon requests. Everhart village fee waiver request. Council member Tandon. And certainly ask city staff to help you out on this a little bit if you want. Yes. I would like to request to have this discussion with the council members to waive the fee of $41,545. $41,545. So we can have the Everhart request. Council member O'Brien? Yes. Council member O'Brien? Council member O'Brien? Council member O'Brien? Council member O'Brien? Council member O'Brien? Council member O'Brien? Council member O'Brien? Council member O'Brien? Council member O'Brien? Council member O'Brien? Council member O'Brien? Council member O'Brien? Council member O'Brien? Council member O'Brien? Council member O'Brien? All right. Council Member Brown? No, I'll wait until I get to the comments. Oh, okay. Anyone? I'll make just a couple of quick comments. So I've been very public in my support of CHAT and the way they go about their business and helping people. They really do it in a way I think is beneficial not only to the individuals they help, but to our neighborhoods. You never hear a complaint when I was a chief of police here. I never heard a complaint from any of the housing that CHAT did in our community. And to me, that spoke volumes. It tells me that they're running their housing projects in an extremely responsible fashion. So I'm going to support this. And thank you for bringing that forward. And just wait your support until we do comments, too. Just not to extend anything out there. Do we have any further questions? No. So I think Council Member Tandon said she'd like to hear our thoughts. I hate fees. I hate fee waivers even more. Because any number of people have come in here and asked for fee waivers. My favorite was a local developer that's done an amazing job, amazing job, with some property southeast of the city. It's going to continue to do it. And everybody's got a reason, right? It does economic development. It does this. It does that. It does all these different things. I can find it. I can find it. I can find it. I can find it. I can find it. I can find it. I can find it. I can find it. I can find it. I'm going to ask all of you I don't think we need more beds. Somebody else says we do. So we've got to get them. We've got to get them as quickly as possible. Chat's going to help that happen. They're going to go one better than that because they get people off the street and they keep them there. I will approve almost anything, especially something for that small a dollar amount, that helps us get past the injunction. This does it. That's why for the first time ever I will support a fee waiver. But all the developers and all my friends that are listening, thinking, oh, my God, he's flexible. No, I'm not. All right. You want to hear public comment? Go ahead, Council Member Brown. I'll be short about it. It's a no-brainer. Thanks to chat for bringing it to the attention of members and for continuing to do the good work while maximizing public awareness and input. It's really important. So I will, of course, support Council Member Tandon's sponsorship of this request. All right. Do we have public comment? We do. We have four speakers. All right. Three minutes. First speaker is Lori Harris, but I understand she's left. Second speaker is Jessica Giannola, followed by Leslie Johnson. Thank you, Council Member Tandon, for bringing this forward and the support from who I'm hearing so far. I think that this is a really... I think this is a really good example of how the city can partner with our housing crisis and where you can actually play a role. Because there are people who say, do something, do something, do something. Like, what can you do? You can't build homes. But you do have some control over the purse strings and some of those mitigating efforts that can help us project succeed. And when we see projects like a housing project with a nonprofit housing people who are... who are unhoused and at risk, then we're all winning. And so I support this 100%. And I'm glad to see more support on the board or on the... with the council members, too. So I hope that we do consider future items that are similar in nature. It is something that I think would be important in tackling this housing crisis that we do have. Thank you. Thank you. Leslie. Johnson, followed by Jared Geiser. Hi. I want to thank you for considering this and for being interested in Everhart Village. I just wanted to kind of mention that it is... Everhart Village is a planned shelter community for people that are homeless in our community with mental illness. It'll have about 20 individual shelter units. Behavioral Health's working closely with us. We were just meeting with Behavioral Health today. Kind of hammering out our MOU. Behavioral Health and the county have given us $175,000 toward this and the property... made the property available. So this is really going to be a big help having the sewer fees waived because the biggest issue with this property is that it is quite expensive to put in infrastructure, we're finding out, even with a good property and a great location, which is near Behavioral Health Services. So thank you so much for your support. This means a lot to us. We appreciate it. And our last speaker is Jared Geiser. I want to start by commending Deepika for bringing this... Councilmember Deepika Tanden for bringing this to the agenda. I think this is a really good idea. I think collaborations like this between the city and the county and other organizations in our community is the kind of action we're going to need to actually address the homelessness crisis. So I commend this. Support this. I urge you all to support this. And explore other ways to increase the housing supply, especially the really affordable housing projects like this. Thank you. All right. Comments? I have two comments. Mr. Orme has a comment. I just have two comments. One was, where did the number 41,545 come up? I don't know if that was a bid from a contractor or if that was the city's estimate too or whatever. I wanted to question that. And then is there any other way that we should consider doing this that would not be a fee waiver that would set up a precedence for future but yet we can still support it? And then my third thing is it says 141,545 or whatever amount it may ultimately be. I think we need to have a set amount that maybe we're willing to go because ultimately whatever that could be, I think that's just too open-ended. So those are my three comments for you, Mr. Orme. And then I have a question for the City Manager. Thank you. And that's exactly, Vice Mayor, what I was going to ask the Mayor as well. So you were right on cue. It's my understanding that that dollar amount did come from staff in an estimate as to what that cost would be through chat. And so I'm seeing the head nod in that as well. And yes, as it relates to fee waiver, I would wholeheartedly request the council authorized staff to not waive the fee, but to find funding. And we will have to do that. We will have to have fund balance to come back to cover those costs for the staff work. It will help the accounting very much, especially when it's an enterprise, like our sewer enterprise. I see too many cities abuse that, not to say that this would be an abuse. However, I think setting that precedent would be something that would be difficult for the city, and I would not recommend waiving it, but actually asking the city to cover that cost for the fact that we will have fund balance as we're closing the books from last fiscal year. So that's what I would recommend. Thank you for that question. I have another question. Yeah. Somebody deeply involved in city operations, great knowledge and great research, claimed earlier tonight that we have never had a sustainable budget in seven years. How can both of these things be true? Is that rhetorical? Yes. Okay. All right. Further comment from council? I'd only like to say I really appreciate Council Member Tandon bringing this over. I think it makes a lot of sense. So with that, I entertain a motion. I'll make a motion to have city staff find the money to pay for it as opposed to waiving it. Second. All right. We have a motion from Council Member Morgan, second from Council Member Tandon. Take the roll. Council Member Bennett. Hold on. Before. Before we vote, can I ask a clarifying question? Sure. When you say it, is that up to the amount possible or the $41,545? I'd be shocked if it was very different. So not possible. Just for clarity's sake, it's our understanding that to cover the cost of sewer connectivity, and that's what is being requested. So we will cover those costs. And I will come back with a supplemental budget appropriation to accommodate that at a future meeting. So if that becomes... Outrageous, we can go with another benefit. Absolutely. Thank you. Perfect. Just want to say thank you. All right. Council Member Bennett. Thank you. Council Member Tandon. Yes. Council Member Brown. Aye. Council Member Morgan. Yes. Council Member O'Brien. Yes. Council Member Tandon. Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds. Aye. And Mayor Coolidge. Aye. Carries 7-0. Thank you. No item is supposed to have to the agenda. Moving on to the next item. Item 6, Reports and Communications. City Manager's Report. Mr. O'Arm. Sure. Honorable Mayor, Vice Mayor, members of the Council. Always a pleasure to be able to share a little bit about what's going on in the city. And I just want to highlight administrative services tonight. And I'm not going to go through a long laundry list of things that are going on, because most people will find that mundane, because it's about finances and IT. Needless to say, though, I want to share that we are wrapping up in administrative services. Mr. Dowell is under Mr. Dowell's lead. Our audit. That will be closed out for this year. Things are looking very good. City staff continues to do a diligent job in ensuring that the books are closed accurately and with acuity. And then we're also working on what's called an automated clearinghouse. What we're trying to do is find ways, instead of doing physical checks and giving physical checks, we're trying to go to find ways of reducing costs of processing disbursements from the city to vendors and others. I want to commend finance staff. For looking at this and proceeding ahead on doing this. Because ultimately what we hope will do is lower the cost of local government. And how much we are pressing against the public. And then in addition, I just want to give additional kudos. You've heard about it before. You've seen the presentation on the broadband general plan. The IT division of the administrative services department has been reaching out to the community to get feedback. What the intention of that is, is to increase internet speed, enhance reliability, and lower the cost to both residents and businesses. And so it's a great opportunity. It's a great initiative that Mr. Dow and his team have undertaken. And they've recently also, just to add another note to that, besides broadband, just signed the agreement. And I know I signed off on one of these here in my inbox. To get the public safety radios in place. You approved that. And that document just got signed. It will be implemented in the coming months. And so our public safety and public works folks will have reliable radio connectivity. So with that, I just want to commend administrative services. They're usually behind the scenes. Not getting a lot of accolades. But they've done a great job. And they continue to do a fantastic job to prove to this city that we do have balanced budgets. And we can account for every penny. So thank you. All right. Thank you, Mr. Wong. So and remind me on receiving and filing reports. We don't have anyone speak on those. We just simply do it, correct? Receive and file. City councils receive them. The public is able to look at them. So 6.3 through 6.6. Receive and file reports. Sunshine negotiation proposals. 6.4 monthly financial reports. 6.5 AB 361 Brown Act open meetings. Teleconferencing and 6.1 Sunshine draft MOU CPOA. So with that, we will adjourn and move into closing. I'm sorry. Mayor Coolidge. Requests. I can't. And then also we do have one speaker on item 6.4. Oh, we do? Oh, okay. All right. So let's sorry. I'm moving too fast. So item 6.2 council member requests. Do we have any? I don't see any. Okay. All right. Seeing none, then we'll move on to item 6.4. We have a speaker. That is Julie Threat. I'm like really trying hard to make sure I focus on what you're all doing in the meeting. No worries. So and again, with this one on the financials, because I was hearing just a lot of things going on with our financials with all these programs. And so I got Terry's Citizens First Aid Chico memo and I was like, okay, the solution's coming out and we're all excited. It's going to be here. It's going to be amazing. We don't know what it is quite. Has something to do with beds and a lot of shelter beds. And her memo said it's going to cost millions. It's going to be a cluster. I'm like, okay. And then I heard our reserves are full. We've got a million dollars on top of that. We're going to invest it right. And we need a 1% sales tax. So I'm like, okay. I'm like all excited. I'm ping ponging all around. And it sounds great. We've got money. We've got a lot of reserves. I've got people saying we don't spend it right. So I'm just like, okay. I'm just putting it out there that from a perspective of a regular citizen, I appreciate that the finances are being managed correctly. And I think that just is the right time to be extra cautious about the wording and the language about, because I think, let me just put it out there. I think you guys do so much more with so little staff and the city is run amazing. And I think that the police department deserves everything that they need and all the fire resources. That's my own personal opinion. I think the 1% sales tax is amazing. I think we need it. I think it's long overdue. And whatever happened to the money we're going to get from the cannabis people, I still don't understand where that money went. It was probably pie in the sky. So let's just leave that alone. And so again, I think as you're rolling out this plan that's coming out in the next couple of whatever weeks, this wonderful thing, getting us on a clear path to getting back to a cleaner safe Chico, I'm all for it. But yeah, if it's going to cost money, it's better to know now rather than somebody complaining that where's the millions in the reserves. Thank you all very much. Thank you for tonight. All right. And with that, we will adjourn into closed session. Thank you.
