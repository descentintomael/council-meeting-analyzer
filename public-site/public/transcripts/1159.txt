They might stop you and ask you something. So I want to make sure you have all the answers to any questions that you might ask. I'm going to go 10 minutes, not 45. I'll go through this as quickly as I can, but raise your hand or something if I'm low and past that if you want. Our history, long and storied. We're the second oldest CSU in the state, second to only the San Jose State, started in 1887. And then there's some various, we've got a lot of pictures to go through. You can see them all there on your screen, I believe. Part of the 23 state system, California State University system, one that I'm very proud to be a part of, and I've been a part of this my 23rd year within the system. I'm very, very excited to be here. Who are we today after 138 years? Well, we're 13,600. We have 160 students. We'll see in a little while that's down from our peak from 2016 or 2017, but going up. We have 183,000 alums, 13 different NCAA teams, several student organizations, 77% of our students receive financial aid, one of four residential campuses in the CSU. That's a pretty important facet of what we offer to our students. And as you'll see, a majority of our students, a vast majority, come from outside the North State. And so when people come to Chico State, they're moving here, they're coming to live here, to be part of our university. We have 380 academic programs, 3,300 degrees per year-ish. We're going to have graduation in May, and looking forward to shaking 3,300 hands as they come across the stage. Some of our programs have 100% job placement rate. I'm very proud of what we do with our students, what our faculty do with our students, and our staff, and we turn them out ready to go to work. And that's what we hear. We're a Hispanic-serving institution, which means we have more than 25% of our students of Hispanic background. In fact, we have about 37%. And that puts us in position to get extra points for federal funding, for grants, but it also has us recognize that we've got students coming from several different cultural backgrounds, but predominantly a large number from Hispanic backgrounds, so we need to recognize that as we work with them. We've been recognized. We've been rated tops of lots of different things. Money Magazine, America's Best Value Colleges. I don't remember if I told you this when I was here last time, but when you graduate from Chico State, our graduates have the lowest average debt load of any school in the state of California, fifth lowest in the country. And so we work really hard to make it a good value when you come out of Chico State. Top educational value, number six and 17 masters university, best bang for the buck, number three masters institution for environmental practices, and this is just the first page of the many different rankings that we have, and that we're very proud of. You can see some more on our website if you're interested. What's our advantage? When we're out, and I'm going to be doing a lot of talking on Saturday, I do a lot of talking a lot of times, but on Saturday, we'll be talking to a lot of parents, a lot of students, and talking about what does it mean to be a Chico State student, what is our advantage? We are different than the other CSUs. We're a very unique institution in the state of California. We've got a very vibrant residential campus culture. It's a close-knit community that is student-centered, and I think that's a very important facet for us. And it's an important facet for Chico, that we work together to make sure that our students get a great experience that they're taken care of, that they can learn as much as they possibly can, and then hopefully choose to stay here, and we'll see that a good number of our students that come from outside do stay here. Award-winning faculty and programs, unbelievable research, unbelievable care that our faculty give in the classroom, attention that they pay to their students. Our students get a great experience, and I hear it all the time. My kids grew up in Davis. They went to high school with a lot of students that came here. We lived around a lot of people that came here and went to school. I've not met one person who didn't love their experience here, and that's what we're trying to do. We're trying to provide. And it is in an environment that's different than any other CSU, right next to downtown, in a small city that's built around a college and that functions with a college in it. And we're very proud of what we do. Our students have job-ready skills when they come out. They're pretty social. They know how to talk to people. They know how to do work and also make presentations. Our engineers can make great presentations. It's a great skill to have, and I've seen you all do it, and you're really good at it. It's not a secret that our enrollment was down. It was down significantly in the last five years. We've worked really hard at it at least over the last two years. CSUs didn't have to recruit students in the past. They just came to us. This is new for us, and we're learning how to do this. We've been doing a lot over the last year. Everyone on campus knows enrollment is job one. We've enhanced our marketing. We're improving our yield rates. We've got commitment events. We've got Choose Chico coming up, Wildcat Weekend in the fall, Wildcat Preview, and all sorts of different programs that we're trying to show our students we care about them. If you come here, you're going to be a student that's going to be successful, that's going to have a great experience. We're creating guaranteed admission pathways for our community college feeder programs. We've got seven different community colleges in our service region. We're going to sign agreements with three of them on April 29th. There's going to be a slide later. You can check that I got the date right. April 29th, where if you go to Butte College, you're going to think of yourself as a Chico State student the moment that you get there. We're going to have a pathway for you to come in seamlessly. We're working on that with everybody. We're also trying to improve our student retention. Every student we retain is a student we don't need to recruit, and it's also a student we're doing our job for to make sure that they're getting an experience and learning what they need to learn. Here's our enrollment over the last handful of years. You can see we peaked in 2017-18. We had over 17,000 students. A little over 16,000 full-time equivalent students. And bottomed out last year, 22-23. Between 21-22, 22-23, our enrollment went down 9%. Between last year and this year, we're up 1.2%. So we've turned the ship around with the efforts that we've been doing, and we see the numbers going up again next fall. And so we're moving in the right direction. We're going to continue that momentum. And Saturday, I think, is going to be a big day. We've got record numbers or near record numbers of people coming. Bigger than last year. And looking forward to welcoming a lot of families here on campus. Where do they come from? This is our service region. Our service region is the size of the state of Maine. We have one four-year public institution in the state of Maine, and that's us. And so there's 812,000, 813,000 people who live there, about 38,000 high school seniors. But I just saw a picture, a map, I think it was in the Sacramento Bee, it might have been the LA Times, of the students that are A through G qualified, the students that have taken the classes in high school to be able to enter the CSU. Very low percentages across the high schools in our region. So we need to work on that. We've got to get out and talk with our partner schools on how can we help get them ready to enter here. 26% of our students come from the North State. As I said, the majority of our students come from away. They move here. They're making the choice to come live here. And we want to make it as easy as we possibly can for them to do that. You can see 20.9% of our students come from the Los Angeles area. We have 2,800 students right now from the Los Angeles area. A big chunk from San Francisco, a big chunk from Sacramento, and then some from elsewhere as well. I need a volunteer. Somebody volunteer. All right. I need you to remember that number, 26.5. You got it? I'm going to change the slide. Okay. All right. So 26.5% of our students come from the North State. 38% of our graduates stay in Butte County. So what was the number? 26.5. And that's less than 38% if I'm not wrong. So we bring students from outside of Butte County, and a good portion of them stay here. So more of our graduates stay here than we get from here. And I think that speaks volumes to the community. It speaks volumes to the region. And I think it is also a push for us being important in this region. And I don't think I actually have to convince people of that, but I'm happy to try to give you some numbers anyways. Where do they go work? All kinds of big companies all over the state of California and all over the world. We got a lot of things we're proud of. We're one of the few CSUs that has a farm. We have an 800-acre farm. We have a human identification lab, which if you haven't read about it, I'm happy to sit down and have a cup of coffee with you. And tell you how important it is and how great the work that they do. And we have an almost 8,000-acre ecological reserve, which very few universities have access to. We brought in over $60 million in grants and contracts last year. Up 10% from the year before. So that's money coming into the university above and beyond our regular budget allocation, which I'll show you some of those numbers here in a second, that we're then spending and using here in the region. Just recently we got $5 million grants for two of our regions. We're bringing in a lot of stuff. We're bringing in a lot of stuff from the U.S. Department of Energy. And as you're going through these slides later, you can read about the details. But it's batteries, it's quantum information science and technology, all kinds of really cool stuff that we're bringing stuff in. We do a lot of work in our community. Yesterday for Cesar Chavez Day, I joined a bunch of our students and our faculty and our staff out on a day in the community. We were at the Boys and Girls Club. I think there was a group up at Paradise. I went up to try to join, and I couldn't find it. And so I know where Paradise was. I know where the students actually were, so I didn't get to see them. But Boys and Girls Club, Bidwell Park, all kinds of great projects that were going on. That's part of what we do. Part of what our students are about, part of what Wildcats do is partner with our community. We do it with law enforcement, with rural partnerships. We're one of the few rural serving institutions in the state of California. There's only four that are granting four-year degrees, and we're proud to be one of those. We've got communities that help caregivers for elder adults, legal clinics, medical clinics, speech pathology and audiology clinics, and all of these things that we get to provide for our community, but it's also training for our students. I'm very proud to be able to do that. I just added this slide. I've been doing this roadshow now for a couple of months. We just added this slide, so you've got to tell me how you like it. You're the first ones to see it. We've got a lot of elementary school students that come onto our campus. They go into Lacson, they see science shows, they see math shows, they see ballets. We had 13,500 area school children come to a performance at Chico State in the last year. And so when I asked for the slide to be put on, I thought it was going to be like 500 or 600. So this number kind of blew me away. Over 13,000 elementary school students come onto our campus every year, between K and 12, from a 300-mile radius from around. And we're very proud to be that sort of a resource. Our economic impact, our student growth is huge. We had 14,000 students last fall. We're down a little bit. Spring is always lower than fall because students graduate in December. Our students on average spend $27,000 a year, 17,000 of that off campus. And so every student we bring in, mostly from outside the region, spends $17,000 in the city of Chico. And that's a huge impact. If we raise our enrollment by 1,000 students, that's going to bring in $17.9 million to the city and generates sales tax, property tax, all sorts of other things. We have a budget of about $250 to $300 million, including payroll, including services and products that we buy that we spend predominantly here. This is what our students spend money on, mostly on rental income. Number two is on hospitals, limited service. That one, I'm not sure exactly how that's possible, but it's a wellness center on campus, but that's what the data shows, and the impact that it has. Here's what we spend on personnel. It's $200 million a year on payroll. Most of those people live here. They then go out and spend it on housing, on food, on entertainment, on services here in the region. So we're very proud of the impact we have on the region. That's one of the things that drew my wife and I to Chico State. I think I mentioned it last time. We love working with students. I love my job. But I also like being in a university that has an impact on a region, has an impact on a city. And I don't know of another university in the state of California that can have an impact on a region like Chico State can. So we're excited about that. More numbers of our economic impact. All right, April 6th, choose Chico Day. Love to have you on campus. If you're wandering around, you're going to see a lot of people really excited, and I'm pretty sure we're going to get a majority of them to say they want to come to Chico State. You come to Chico, you come to our campus, you come to our campus. From somewhere else in the state of California, you've not seen a college like this before, except on TV and in the movies. And so when you come here, they tend to want to stay. April 29th is our impact day. It's when we're going to be announcing our agreements with these community colleges. We'll have some other community colleges there as well that we're going to be working with. And then this is the wrong date. The date got changed, but we're going to have a groundbreaking of a new building down at our farm sometime not May 23rd. So maybe... Whatever the date is, it's not going to be this one. But it'll be soon. We're building a new, I think it's a $12 million facility down there that'll include a learning room, administrative office space, and a farm store where we're going to be selling our farm products down on the farm. This is one of the coolest programs I know of. It's College Core. It's out of the state of California. Students donate some of their time. They can get $10,000 a year in cash. It's not a loan. It is money that they get just because they can volunteer. We just got re-upped for another couple years, so we got another $2 million to fund that. And here's the big finale. Today, tomorrow's leaders are made here today. They're made here at our university. We're very proud of what we do. But they're also made here in the city of Chico. The experience that they get at our university is the experience they get in the city of Chico. So as I did when I was here before, I want to thank you for all the work that you all do It's a great place to live. It's not just you, but all of you do all this work, too. It is a special place. We can feel it. Our students can feel it. So I appreciate what you all do for us and for our students. So thank you. I don't know if I'm taking questions. All right. Questions? No. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Thank you. All right. Next is presentation by Charlene Durkin. Welcome. Code enforcement supervisor, come on down. . Well, hello, mayor, council members. I'm here tonight to just give you a brief overview of the This is an overview of our municipal code 10.20.200. We call this our 168 hour code. This is 168 is 168 hours is equal to seven days. This code prohibits long-term storage on the streets. So in code enforcement, we deal with motorhomes, utility trailers, travel trailers, boats. The police department deals with vehicles that are stored on the street. This is kind of just an overview of what we do. Every case is handled individually. There's always circumstances that are going to dictate how we're going to handle this. But this is kind of a general overview on how we handle these. We go out to these calls. They're generally reactive. We're generally getting these calls called into us. We're not in every area every day to know what is being stored on the street or what's just there temporarily. So we rely on our citizens to let us know, hey, this has been here for too long. We don't want it stored here. We contact an owner if we can. We talk to them, educate them on the code, determine a reasonable timeframe for compliance, allow them that time. If they don't comply, we're going to issue them a notice of violation. If compliance is still not gained, we may tow the vehicle or issue a citation. If we can't locate an owner, we're going to send off notices and then we are going to, if we don't get compliance, we're going to tow that trailer or boat or whatever. it is that's stored on the street. I'm here to answer any questions you might have about this ordinance or concerns you have about it. anyone? I have some questions. what would it take to be proactive instead of reactive? we would need more officers. how many? it' s hard to justify that. we don' t have this is not one of our biggest areas of complaint. I think that we are pretty responsive in the calls we get to these. but we' re busy dealing with other higher priority rules. I would totally agree with you. it' s hard when you' re asking for citizens to tell on their neighbor, hey, something' s wrong. they don' t seem to have a problem with it. okay. well, I don' t know if that' s good news or bad news. okay. fair point. my concern is usually when you get one complaint it means there' e 10 people who actually have the same issue. or a similar issue. we do like to reassure our citizens that are complaining. we never tell anybody who' s calling. we handle all these complaints we' re not confidentially. sometimes it' is obvious there' e some neighborhood dispute problems and people do know who' re calling. but we don' t tell people who' e called. okay. so we' re coming into budgeting season. so would it help to have more? absolutely. all right. absolutely. so do we have a long list of do you have 200 complaints that you' re waiting to go or is it you' e got five on them to follow up on? so we' re pretty re able to handle these usually within a few days we start contact on these 168 cases. again everything is so individual that there are circumstances that you would be amazed about. we try to be reasonable and give people a reasonable amount of time without letting them overstep their boundaries. we definitely more officers always help with proactivity. sure. yeah. all right. anyone else? all right. thanks so much. I appreciate it. all right. we will move on to the consent agenda. all matters listed on the consent agenda are to be considered routine in nature and therefore can be enacted in one motion. are there any speakers? no votes. council disqualifications. let' s see. I don' t have any speakers. okay. on consent. all right. entertain the motion. move to approve. second. motion. vice mayor rounce. second. history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history! thank you. we will now move to the public comments. we have seven. three minutes. I will call the first two names if you can line up in the center aisle. Mike Egbert followed by nolan lup. I will piggyback on what president perez had to say about people coming to town. I thought it was going to be 3500. He says 5000. I will take his word. That is a great attendance. They are potential students coming to chico. They are here to choose chico and hopefully chico state. It is an open house for the school and also for downtown since the campus is right across the street. The question we need to ask is why is it so hard to The recent cliche is true about first impressions. For downtown chico they all have been in the room for years is the empty and boarded up windows. Chico has 28 empty storefronts right now. In my opinion chico is suffering from broken window theory. The theory suggests that if people see signs of neglect and disorder they are more likely to engage in antisocial behavior. Fixing the small problems and maintaining order can help prevent bigger problems from happening. Empty storefronts have not been addressed. The key contributing factor in feeding this issue is that downtown is unsafe and not family friendly. It is because of the lack of social distancing. The! My background is in research. I spent 40 years doing consumer research. I built broadcast companies all over America and all over Canada. The platform is at the height of its relevance. I do strategic planning with these groups. The process was pretty simple. We need to check our egos at the door, say what needs to be said, plan the work that needs to be done. It is not personal. It is business. One of the things that we need to do besides a long-term vision is plan for what we can do today. What is the biggest thing we can accomplish in the shortest amount of time, the least amount of cost, that would immediately have great impact? For Chico, what is that? It is beautifying the windows. The windows that are empty. The storefronts that you can see into. regular basis. The vinyl window coverings can make this happen. You can put beautiful pictures up. Famous places of Chico. Flowers, fields, trees, art. It is quick and easy to install. It is inexpensive and it can get rid of the scariness almost overnight. In the words of the Duke University women's basketball coach, it is time for Chico to handle hard better. issue today. Thank you. So our next speaker is Nolan Lipp followed by James Hutchinson. Hey, everybody. Back on Steve's comment from earlier, I am a transplant from Tahoe. I'm out with Sean playing kickball. Real sports. I moved here and graduated Chico. Immediate job placement. Backing up everything Steve said, it's a great place. On the other hand, my wife and I worked really hard. Moved up here, bought a house. Right over there by beautiful Tiger Ponds. Which, as everybody knows, was kind of a battleground for a lot of the conversation during the last few years. And we fought hard, real hard, to get that resolved. Tom was very active in helping with that. He was over in our neighborhood several times. I talked to Ms. Tandon there as well. Spent many, many days here in the chamber talking about this. We got that resolved. It was great. You know, we went through everything in that order to make sure that we gave proper notice. We had all of our shelters. We gave them their seven day notice. We gave them their 72 hour notice. They were gone. It was great. I was able to run in the park. I was able to see wild animals. I wasn't getting chased by dogs. I wasn't hearing gunshots at night. It was fantastic. About seven, eight months ago, all of a sudden we saw a tent spot back up. We went, okay, cool. Read through that settlement agreement and said, okay, we've removed them. And Tom, you and I had this discussion where according to everything that we know, we were able to take anybody that has been both assessed for sheltering and for, actually I should say, for camping in a spot that has been marked as cleared, like Tiger had, and remove them immediately. That didn't happen. We had to go back through the entire process right next to my house that we'd spent so long clearing. Back through the process. Okay, you got your seven days. You got your three days. You're out. Guess who's back? I wrote a call a couple nights ago. Hey, there's people that are literally on the other side of my wall. If I go walk to my backyard and I look over my wall, here is a tent. Can we do something about this? I call it non-emergency. It's not an emergency. Nobody's being crazy out there. No, no we can't. If they're not doing anything that is, you know, a fire, a hazard, you're not allowed to make contact with them. And I asked her straight up, I said, do we need to go through this entire process again? Yes. There is nothing in that settlement agreement that says that we have to do this. Once that has been marked as a clear spot, we are able to remove these people. I don't want to go through this shit again. Sorry, stuff again. I'm tired of it. I'm a little bit excited. Anyways, thank you. Thank you. James Hutchinson followed by Sean Reese. When I came home the last time, I was in the city council meeting. I watched Action News. There was a picture of my backside. My name was right up there in the corner of the picture. And the topic was disruption by Palestinian protesters. The person was up here at the podium. They had disrupted, but the face was a little... And people came to me and said, hey, were you disrupting the meeting? No, of course not. But there is a thing now. We have to look at what we can do to help the situation that these protesters are talking about because we only look at what we can't do. One of the things you've done in this council before is called the Sister City Program. It was moderated by Dwight Eisenhower back in 1956 with the idea that you get individuals talking together, one-on-one, exchanging information about the situation. Exchanging ideas. That you can reach peaceful relationships you can't achieve any other way. You've done Sister Cities before. I'm asking you to reach out to these people to have an end game. To say, when this is resolved, we've got a place for you to come and get educated. We will send you information. We will reach to you by telecommunications to teach you skills you need. And then we will do this in the spirit of what these kinds of people are talking to, ending this. One-on-one communication. What happened when Rabin and Yasser Arafat sat down at the same table? What happened was Arafat said for the first time remember one P.O.O. leader? Said, hey, okay, I'm willing to accept the existence of Israel. Quite a comment in today's environment. Rabin said, okay, if you're willing to do that, we are willing to accept the existence of a Palestinian state. One-on-one communication. Those kinds of communications can happen with these kinds of programs. To reach out and get the educated people who want to be educated. We've got a college right here. These people, when this thing is resolved, I hope soon, will need some place to get educated. They're not going to get it there. There's 25 cities in Gaza and a space smaller than Manhattan. And you've seen it. Where are these people going to go? We need to offer them that space. We need to offer them cooperation, humanitarian aid. It's been done. It's been done in cities all over California and the country. Why not? Why not consider it? Thank you. Thank you. Sean Reese followed by Gia Monticella. Good evening, Mayor and City Council. I'm the local representative from NorCal Carpenters Union, Local 1599. And I'm speaking here today to talk to you about ensuring the future of our construction industry and helping our community. This all begins with the pre-qualification language of our local developments. There are a variety of factors that I hope you'll consider in all your future endeavors to lift your local community. First and foremost is ensuring the men and women who are building our community are provided with healthcare. By choosing contractors that give this benefit that we all need, our health. On average, one out of four construction workers in California lack health insurance. That cannot be a statistic we see our community fall into. As elected officials, you have the power to help. Policies that require contractors to offer their workers family healthcare will raise the standard in the construction industry while also ensuring that employers who do offer healthcare can compete on a level playing field. We're two to three hours away from home, creating higher and higher fuel costs at a time when fuel costs are already painful to our wallets. As more and more construction workers are forced into other communities, local hire policies can help bring stability to families and communities, ensuring workers can spend time with their families instead of spending hours and hours and every day in traffic. Along with hiring locally, we need to ensure that those local hires are properly trained for the work. Apprenticeship programs do just that. We have programs for our proven escalators in the middle class, training tens of thousands of California residents every year at no cost to the taxpayer. Apprenticeship program success depends on apprentices being able to secure work opportunities. Without work opportunities, apprentices are likely to leave the industry for lower paying jobs. Policies such as pre-qualification helps ensure that contractors hire apprentices and are doing their part to build our community's construction workforce. Policies that require utilization of apprentices develop a pool of opportunities and a pool of skilled labor in the local area who can work on future projects. And lastly, but most importantly, is a living wage. Ensuring the local workforce earns a living wage is vital in our community's success. Without it, our community cannot thrive. I know at the end of the day, we all want our community to succeed and thrive and I believe you will do the right thing to ensure it. Thank you for your time. Thank you. Gia Monticello followed by Charles Withoon. Hello, my name is Gia Monticello. I'm here on behalf of the Associated Students of Chico State. I am the current Commissioner of Community Affairs. I obtained this position in January. I've gotten the pleasure to meet some of y'all at the Moonlight Safety Stroll. So I just wanted to come and say hello to the rest of y'all to just let you know that I am here as a helping hand for Student Voice if you are ever in need of one. You can always reach me at theascommissionerofcommunityaffairs. I have office hours. I'm always welcome to meet with any of you. If you have any questions about student life or just need a student perspective, I'm always welcome to offer that. And we also have various, 16 various other positions of student leaders who can help if you ever need it. And yeah, that was it. So I'm going to say bye. Thank you. Thank you. Charles Withoon. Good evening, Council, staff. Thank you very much for your work. Appreciate your time here. I'm going to bring to you an idea that is as important as other speakers this evening. I am shocked at how many agendas, city agendas, come and go. I've seen several that do not mention shelter crisis. I've been here since 1972. We've never had such a severe shelter crisis. We've had declared shelter crisis for the City of Chico, declared shelter crisis for the County of Butte, and we've never had such a severe shelter crisis for the City of Chico. Meeting after meeting goes by without talking about creative ways to address complaints by the citizens and by businessmen. You all got a letter very similar to this two weeks ago. I have yet to get a response. We asked for a reply from staff and from Council. This is talking about how can we creatively improve the situation. Our legal team advised us to have camper meetings. We've had one-on-one meetings. We've put together this and we have 12 issues that need to be rectified at the camp. Or maybe three in were actually and had management and had some protocol and had some organization that is being offered to you by the nonprofits. If you look at this document, I have started ones that North State Shelter Team has been working on. I'm waiting for an invitation for a little discussion. We can do better. Thank you very much. Thank you. And our last speaker is Addison Winslow. That's time. Council, I'm here before you today because you elected to not have reports be given from the fund guidance. Mayor, what's up? The year is 2024. Massive transportation improvements are promised for the City of Chico. The return of regular passenger rail to Chico. But no one is pursuing federal grant funding on our behalf. We have many developments going on at the Chico airport and the council receives regular updates from our city manager. We're looking at a nearly 13% rate increase on PG&E. Meanwhile, our efforts towards energy independence have stagnated. It's... I... This year, for the first year, we've become the best paid City Council that the City of Chico has ever had. So how is it that now is not the right time to be receiving reports from City Council? I think that if you're not active in your community and transparent, if you have no reports ever to give, you're not going to be able to make these land use decisions. Last year, this council removed the ability of our boards and commissions from agendizing their own discussions. This council requires a full majority vote just to discuss an item. From a long-standing policy, individual council members could write written requests to explain the context to the public and to our colleagues. Last year, we changed the rule to remove it. So now you can only give verbal requests and they must be made at the meeting, dropped like a surprise. We had a prolonged dispute last year over whether council members are held to the same time limitations as members of the general public in our deliberations before the items before us. This council has become adept at cutting off members of the public who speak on items that we deem to be of insufficient importance for the City. You want to talk about homelessness? Too bad, that's a closed session item. I would challenge you to name one thing this council has done more effectively than constrain the spaces for public discussion. And you call yourselves conservatives. There's nothing anti-government about removing public officials from the process of governance. It's just anti-democracy. It means what happens, happens while the public is not at the table. Thank you. With that, I'll yield my time. Can't yield your time. Alright, thank you everybody. Alright. So we are moving on to public hearings. Assembly Bill 481, Annual Military Use Report. And we have Chief Aldrich. Fire away. No pun intended, I hope. No. No. Good evening, Mayor, Vice Mayor, members of council. Thank you for your time tonight. I'm here to ask about the continued approval of the annual military equipment ordinance. That would be ordinance number 2576. In January of 2022, law enforcement was required to abide by the rules set forth within Assembly Bill 481. The council meeting on April 19, 2022, council adopted ordinance number 2576, authorizing the use of equipment defined within assembly bill 481. The annual military equipment report and policy were posted on the PD's website on March 26 of this year. And the community was notified via social media outlets and a press release to all media outlets within the surrounding area. My report is 58 pages. It' s fully transparent. It goes beyond the requirements of AB 481. And I felt the need to put everything in there so there was zero questions as to what we have on hand. I believe in full transparency and I believe that report offers that. Thank you. We held a community engagement meeting on March 28. As you know, last year we held it after the council meeting. There was a request from the community that we hold it before the council meeting tonight. And I honored that request. So we had that meeting last Thursday. We had roughly 25 people attend. We had some lively conversation. Good questions and good answers provided. Or at least I felt that was the and I hope that they were good answers. There were some concerns that I took back, we reviewed and found that there were no issues related to those concerns. Particularly there was a question about something that was not in our policy and it was actually found to be within our policy. Last year in 2023 the police department contacted over 41,000 use of our equipment. We had zero complaints over the use of our equipment. And only two emails that I received with concerns involving the use of the equipment. Those concerns were addressed on Thursday night as they were the same questions that were posed to me by the community. Our budget has an impact from equipment and training related to That is more than half of 1% of my total budget. As promised, during the last annual review we no longer have any true military owned equipment. That was one of my promises to you as council and to the community. And I can stand here or sit here today and let you know that we no longer own any of that equipment and all of our equipment on hand is owned by the city of chico. We are no longer part of the government' s 1033 program as it' s called where you obtain equipment from the defense utilization materials office. We have no further requests for equipment during this session tonight. As it stands I believe we are well equipped to provide for a very safe community and respond to any incidents that we have experienced. I want to thank you for that. That is something that we absolutely need. It' s something I absolutely support and I know that council supports that. So thank you. I continue to meet with concerns community members for justice. They are the main group who brings forth issues related to this. I meet with them pretty regularly and it' s about an hour and a half that I meet with them each time. I have a lot of time to ask questions and have them look at policy procedures and then we make adjustments if need be. It' s my request tonight that council once again approve city of chico ordinance 2576 authorizing the continued use of the equipment defined within assimilability bill 481. With that I will answer any questions you may have. questions or comments? if you do not have any of the military equipment do you still have to do this annually? That' s my first question. my only question. no it' s only if you have the equipment. If you don' t have any equipment on hand that meets the definition of the military equipment within assembly bill 481 then you don' t have to do an annual report. thank you. thank you. thank you. thank you. thank you. thank you. thank you. just to be clear there' s no real changes besides you talking about phasing out military actual military owned equipment but not really any additions to any arsenal? that' s correct. anything that was owned and acquired by or from the u.S. military from previous 1033 agreements it has been returned. we have taken seriously community input in holding that hearing before us. anyone else? thank you chief. how many speakers? okay. three minutes each. okay we have two speakers james hetchinson and ann palovka. speak to the chief of equipment if he wants. two drones. one drone inadequate. one drone probably very adequate for what is required. kind of response i got? none. none. because all they said was oh well we got this one great drone. great pictures great shot. nothing was said about the one where the attack was made. that's equipment. i also wish you to recognize what is going on here. you're talking about military equipment. they're two of the biggest religious holiday weeks. two of the major religions in this country. Ramadan for Islam. Easter for most Christians. you need to say on the top. that is about when you're holding this hearing at a time when other people have other people have the same interest. and when holding this hearing it doesn't mean you're getting a valid sample of the people of chico to speak on this issue. that's my concern. i'm concerned because i wouldn't go to this if i wasn't attending this kind of a meeting where we're talking about military equipment. so yeah it's a concern and this is what i'm trying to bring to you is you're going to understand that the community you're going to have community policing and understand that members of the community that place their own personal beliefs and religions and needs ahead of military equipment. and that they go a longer ways towards solving problems than any of this equipment does. and when i bring up equipment that i found to be questionable there was no response to it. you were here. you're all here. you're all talked to. like i said before about software correcting it wasn't about software. about hardware as i pointed out before. but this is what happens in these meetings. where only meetings at a time where a lot of the public because of their own conscious and real situations don't want to attend. so you say these 25 people represent all of chico? their feelings about it? about what was going on? no no i'll guarantee you that already. a lot of us didn't come just because you don't see it that way. you need to have hearings where people can attend without conflicting with their belief systems in an extreme way. thank you. thank you. our last speaker is ann palovka. thanks for the opportunity to speak with council members. it's a pleasure to be here tonight and also a challenge for me. i got a little cold so i'll try to speak up so you can hear me if my voice sounds harsh. that's why. i'm a member of concerned community for justice as well and i'm part of speaking with chief chief aldrich. and tonight we're requesting that council postpone the renewal of chico police department's military equipment use policy ordinance. because the policy does not really adequately address ab41 requirements for transparency and accountability. 481 requires that chico pd's policy address the purposes and authorized uses as well as the rules governing use of each type of military equipment which the law enforcement agency proposes to use. and policy 709 that's their policy that deals with military equipment is out of compliance in that respect. and secondly the chico pd military equipment use report lacks information on how the military equipment is used and the purpose of this use over this past year. that is what ab41 requires as well. so it's out of compliance in that respect regarding that aspect. and we ask that you postpone the approval of the report and policy. communities across the state are dealing with the same kinds of issues that their councils and board of supervisors as chico is in d county might be. we have a unique first in the nation opportunity to create expectations around the use of these records. and our council is obliged by law to review the military equipment use report annually which is now and either approve or request amendments to the policy based on chico pd's report on use of the equipment. we've looked at this report. it's a long 60 something page report. and we've done our job we feel and it feels like your job tonight as council is to determine whether or not chico police department is in compliance. please take the time to do this right and postpone the decision on this matter. ask chico pd to do this appropriately and amend their military equipment policy to spell out the legal and procedural rules for use of the equipment before you give them and ask them to amend the report so it addresses how and for what purpose the equipment is used. thank you. thank you. she's our last speaker. all right we will close the public hearing comment from council. we will now move to the thank you. could you speak to some of those concerns expressed about the report not including the actual use of some of these items? excuse me? are you speaking to the chief? no he's speaking to the chief. thank you. we list each time it was used the number of times each piece of equipment was used. that's a different reporting process we do in house. it's a use of force review. we have a whole process for that. so each time it is used it is used it is documented it's reviewed by three levels within the department and it adheres to assembly bill 41 in terms of if it was misused there's an investigation that follows internally. it goes through our professional standards unit. and we have a report that is and we have a report that is the times we have used this equipment throughout the year we have had zero violations of that policy. so I would say there' s very thorough documentation of each use. thanks. further comments? I would like to commend the chief for his efforts to engage the public and engage them before the general public. I also think that I will say what I said last year we need to trust the chief to decide what he needs to keep the community safe and his people safe. and I do. all right. further comment? I have some comments. assembly bill 481 is a partisan farce. that' s basically to burden local authorities and to make them call very public way. their police department for no good reason other than to create partisan rifts. it' s the worst of politics at its worst. it was passed by the assembly and senate completely on a partisan basis and undermines the political process and representation both of local governments and people of california. that' s my take on it. second. I just push back a little bit on that notion express my contrary opinion. I know this is a burden. it' s a big report we have to make. there' s plenty of reports going on at times. I think giving us a look at what equipment we' re using and gives us the opportunity to ask why and allows us to move in a direction that is less militarized. there is a tendency among people who get into policing sometimes to want to use more stuff like this. it' s an easy way to solve problems on each individual basis but turns into issues. ve seen that and that' s where this bill came out of is serious instances of police violence that have affected people. I think we' re doing a good job. we' re hiring community service officers which we can see is shifting some of the burden off of armed militarized responses into a more humane and caring response. I think that' s good and I' d like to hear how those efforts are going. last I heard we hadn' t filled those positions. I think we' if they would have wanted that they would have done it in a nonpartisan way. they would have done it together. that' s the way it should have been done. I wouldn' t endorse partisan politics in the state legislature where a nonpartisan body. we have a motion and a second. councilmember bennett? yes. vice mayor reynolds? aye. mayor coolidge? aye. carry 7-0. we move on to our next item. which is code amendment 2301 proposed ordinance in chico municipal code section 1944-040 downtown north district special standards. we report from associate planner molyne. mr. mayor I need to recuse myself. all right. conflict. I' m going to let you step out. hold on just a second for him to exit the chambers. we' ll go ahead and start. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . for ABC's considerations. These do not come to council. So as previously shared, the planning and police department staff are confident that the city's existing alcohol beverage zoning review verification process, as well as the state's PCN process, offer effective mechanisms for staff and council to oversee and propose conditions on any new proposed bar type 42 or type 48 licenses in the downtown district. Approving code amendment 2301 would provide a mechanism to allow new bars in downtown. Conversely, denying the code amendment would maintain existing restrictions, prohibiting an increase in the number of new bars in downtown. And with that, the community development director recommends that council consider the additional information requested in adopt. The ordinance by reading of its title, and I'm happy to answer any questions. All right, questions? Looks like none. Thank you. How many speakers? We have four. All right, so we will open the hearing. Three minutes, please. Okay. Greg Scott, followed by Sebastian Tamero. Good evening, Mr. Mayor, Vice Mayor, Council. Greg Scott, President of DCBA. I'm here to report the results of a college survey, basically a question-to-question response, or an email sent out to businesses downtown. We received about 135 responses, in which 77 were business owners, 22 were business employees in downtown, and 28 customers and a couple of students and others. 65% of those responding were against removing the moratorium. And 31 were in favor, 4 were unsure. I'm not really sure how that worked. But I hope you all had an opportunity. I think you were all sent the survey, and more importantly, the comments, because the comments had some very good information. So that's what I came to do as the president of DCBA. On a personal note, Assembly Bill 1013 goes into effect July 1st of this year. 1013 requires type 48 bars and nightclubs to provide a service to the community. And that's what we're doing. We're providing, on hand, tools for testing for drugs. Now, there's a reason for that, because people are still, I guess, roofing to a drink. Typically, type 48 bars don't open until late at night. They do absolutely nothing for downtown vibrancy. And that's my personal opinion. I have complete confidence in the city council and the staff and the police department to adhere to the guidelines. And I'm not going to be a victim of any of the current rules, even if this passes, to go through the process and do the PCN. The problem is that you all are going to be here forever. So once you remove the moratorium, if it gets out of hand, somebody's going to have to come back and do it again. And I just think it's best to leave it alone and let the police department and council deal with it from there. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. We have a question from Sebastian Tammariello, followed by Adam Samarimah. My name is Sebastian Tammariello. I'm one of the owners of Bianchi, E Street Public House, and The Artist. I sent you guys a letter yesterday thinking it was going to be here, but here I am. Just want to take a moment to add to what I wrote and read through it. Just have I reiterate some of the points I made. The main difference between a 47 and 48, which are the two kinds of licenses we have downtown, 48s are 21 plus, and there's no requirement to serve or offer food. The 47s that I own also require that we sell at least 50% food or more to operate as an ABC and city provision. The lack of food provision for 48s means they don't necessarily have to abide by restaurant hours. They don't have to open for lunch or even dinner hours. That means the majority, as he just said, these businesses open later. The earliest 48 that I'm aware of opens at four daily, and then there are 48s that open as late as nine o'clock, and only a few days a week. They don't even open five or seven days a week like some of the other places. So what's to stop a new existing business from coming downtown and deciding they want to open up just a couple or three nights a week, whatever time they want? Sure, they may fill some storefronts, but they won't feel filled by many of the existing businesses. It's mentioned that 48s are not readily available. What's to stop someone from moving a license from another part of the county downtown Chico? Downtown would seem like a great landing spot. Take my license, plop it down. You don't have to build out a building, you don't have to go out on an expensive kitchen and purchase the equipment that goes along with it. You don't have to hire a chef. All you need to do is put a bar in, get a nice machine, some bridges, start selling some drinks. That's at least how easy it sounds. A very low barrier to entry, and you have another business fighting for the diminished customer base that is our current state in downtown. Just had to tag 48 Bar that announced they would be closing outside of opening up as a pop-up for graduation week. And for good. I urge you to fix the other problems downtown before putting more bars in our already-over-saturated parking. Thank you. Thank you. Adam Semerano, follow-up by Karen Williams. Hello. I'm the owner of the history public-house-hand-mansion. I would love for there to be a drink-and-sour-stom-town if there was a ton of people downtown. I think as it is, we're kind of sharing people that actually go downtown. We have labor costs that are on the rise, food costs that are on the rise. And if you allow some of these little pop-ups, if they come, they could park right next to me. They could put one person in there, and then they could start selling the same thing I'm selling for half the price. And then we start a price war. So I'm against that. Thank you. Karen Williams is our last speaker. Karen Williams. Hello again, City Council. Here we are again discussing... Municipal Code 19.44. According to the November 23 Planning Commission Agenda Report, ABC states that there is already an oversaturation of Type 48 licenses. I haven't heard any public outcry for the need for more Type 48s. So I'm just wondering... How does this keep cropping up? The downtown bars are struggling as it is. I wish there was a need for more competition. But that fact remains that our businesses are struggling on a day-to-day basis. Especially with those increased employee costs. So I'm just wondering where this comes from. How do we find that the Planning Commission is recommending this, and how the City Council is listening to this? So I'm just wondering where this comes from. How do we find that the Planning Commission is recommending this, and how the City Council is listening to this? Am I able to ask questions? Does anybody know? Ma'am, just make your statements to Council, no questions. Okay, thank you very much. But I still wonder where it's coming from. And I certainly believe in the best of the City Council, that the public outcry would overweigh those individuals that might have your ear for putting this as an important factor. When there are so many other factors out there. If you're wanting to put in more bars in Chico, look outside the downtown area. For the longest time, us bars have been the scapegoat for all of the ills and evils that have happened downtown. And you want to add more? It just absolutely makes no sense. We've been a good business partner. I represent, by the way, I'm co-owner of Pistone, Maine and the Down Low. So we have a Type 47 and a Type 48. We have been a great business partner. And if you're wanting to increase the vibrancy of downtown by having more occupied buildings, Type 48s aren't going to do it because they will only open at night. So having a busy downtown is not going to help the public perception during the daytime hours. It's really only going to increase more people downtown. So I implore with the City Council to do the right thing and help us struggling business owners stay in business. Without it, we'll just have to move out of town. Thank you for your time. Thank you. She was our last speaker. All right. We will go ahead and close public hearing. And Council will comment. Any more? Several thoughts. The first one is I want to thank the DCBA for the survey. It had a lot of information in it. Very good information. It allowed us to, allowed me to have a good understanding of how the downtown Chico business community, specifically the drinking establishments, feel about the situation. So I do appreciate it and I want to say thank you. Number two is that the downtown community business community is going to be going through some very challenging times in the not too distant future. And any actions that could possibly jeopardize our existing, our current businesses. And thank you for showing up. Thank you for letting us know your thoughts. I don't want to be a part of the problem. I'd like to be part of the solution. So adding more bars to downtown Chico does not appear to be a good direction, given the fact that it is going to be challenging for a while. So I lean towards trying to preserve as much as reasonably possible our existing businesses. And perhaps take a look at this down the road, a few years down the road, take a look at it again. And I do strongly support the standard system of government and business community. So I would like to thank the DCBA. And I would like to see history change history change history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history downtown. I don't think that's really true besides that we put a hold on more businesses occupying those spaces. And it's true that it's not like double shift businesses. It's not all built in a day and at night. Some of them can. But a lot of these businesses, like some people have spoke, they operate as venues too. They really do add a lot of life. And there's a lot to be said about the creation and reinforcement of a district. It's a place that people come to, like Bourbon Street in New Orleans. We have plenty of examples of places that people like to come to. It's not just the people that are in Chico. It's actually, we are a destination for people to come and hang out. This was put in, I think this is important to also remember, it was not to protect the businesses that are downtown. That was never the reason. It was because we thought it was getting out of control, the kind of alcoholic atmosphere and stuff. And frankly, the crime in the 90s was really bad compared to what it is today. There were a lot of things that were much worse than we had. So I think we're at a point in the community where, in general, we should let adults be adults and people should be able to operate the businesses that they find are worth operating. And I think this does just a little bit, maybe nothing much at all, to allow downtown to flourish into something more. At the very least, we're going to remove this government-created secondary market for ABC licenses, which I take issue with. Mr. Morgan. Call. Mr. Morgan. I have one, because it always kind of bugs me, and we dealt with this, I think it was back in 2015 when I was first on the council, is the oversaturation. Generally, where you have a bunch of restaurants and bars, it's always oversaturated with alcohol licenses because you have a bunch of restaurants and bars. And other parts of the area, the city, which only had one or one out in the middle of nowhere, has no oversaturation because it's only one. But research and time, I think it's going to be a lot of work. Mr. Morgan. The idea of a bar that proves over and over again is a saturation. You know, grouping those together is better for both for public safety, but also better for all of those restaurants competing with each other and thereby creating more business. Because one restaurant in a city, let's say there was one bar, it would be busy. It would be really busy. But you get a lot, they can actually create even more of an atmosphere and more of a... Anyway, it's a mall versus a stand-alone. Mr. Morgan. this in the middle of nowhere. So I just want to make that point because I think it needs to be driven home. But at this point, I entertain a motion. I'll follow up on your comments. I actually had an interesting conversation with Addison today in the parking garage. And I will paraphrase a little bit. And he said this wasn't put in place to protect current borrowers, which is true. The challenge, I think the mayor is talking about a little bit of the culture of downtown. We can go back to the 90s, which you can't possibly remember. But we can go back before that and talk about pioneer days. While we had the President of the University here, we did have a big issue. And it wasn't about too many borrowers competing. It was, quite frankly, and he's a friend of mine, it was too many police cars lined up outside of LaSalle's. And now it's too many police cars lined up, I'm not going to name the places, outside of other places. If we're going to support the university and try and continue the safety and the culture that Chico has, adding more bars is a bad idea. I'm a free market capitalist, so Addison pointed out to me today, he used these words, that's not very free market capitalistic, and it's not. And I go back to the cannabis shops, which I opposed all of them. But one of your colleagues at that point told me, well, shouldn't we just have as many as we can, and the ones that will survive will make it? I said, that is actually the free market way to do it, but if you go to towns like Las Vegas, they're everywhere, and it's saturated. And it's a different atmosphere. And I think about Choose Chico coming up this weekend, or what happens in fall, adding more bars and seeing what the survival, the fittest is, I don't think it's a good idea. I'm going to vote against it, because the reason we didn't, if we do, if we approve it and wait to see what happens, I think that we have the chief up here a few years from now going, you know what, we can't deal, we don't have enough police officers to deal with the party atmosphere that we've recreated. The police department and this council and other councils have done a very good job of making it that environment. So I will make the motion to change the code. I will make a motion to reject the change to the municipal code. I will second. I have a motion and a second. I think it's worth pointing out what you're describing, we're trying, what we do with this code here is we're regulating underneath the level of the state already regulating. So this concept of saturation does not come from the city of Chico. We didn't invent this. This is what the alcohol and beverage control department, whatever, says. And so Butte County, and the city of Chico, we're not going to change the The state is already over saturated by a long shot. So it's not like we can really have it let it spin off like marijuana stores in Las Vegas. That's just not within the cards because we already operate underneath the state of California. And these regulations exist and this is what the community development director's recommendation stated in here is that we have public convenience and necessity. There are requirements that all these businesses have to adhere to in order to operate. It's not just a free game. They're, even if we were to lift this ban, it would still be very far from what a free market capital would be. So I think that's one of the most way of approaching this would be because there are so many onerous regulations as it is. All right. I have a motion and a second. So voting yes means you don't want this. So the motion is to reject the ordinance. Thank you. Yep. Okay. Council Member Bennett. Yes. Council Member Morgan. Yes. Council Member Tandon. Yes. Council Member Van Overbeck is recused on this item. Okay. Let me just get that in there. Council Member Winslow. No. Vice Mayor Reynolds. No. Mayor Coolidge. No. Okay. It fails 3-3 with one recusal. All right. You can run up the flagpole with a 3-3. I'm not sure you're going to get anywhere. Just saying. All right. We just move on. All right. All right. Okay. You know, let's take a quick break. Ten minutes. Thanks, guys. Thanks, guys. Thanks, guys. Thanks, guys. Thanks, guys. Thanks, guys. Thanks, guys. Thanks, guys. Thanks, guys. Thanks, guys. Thanks, guys. Thank you. Thank you. consideration of resolution establishing shopping cart retrieval fees. Charlene is back again. guess who' s back? this I want to tell you a little bit about how this has been going. We implemented this ordinance in the state of California. All of our major retailers are on board now with shopping cart retrieval companies which is amazing because these companies are coming up weekly and patrolling the areas around these businesses and picking up these carts before we get them. We are seeing a reduction in carts back at our yard. We have high compliance. All of our major retailers with these businesses are coming up Moving forward, I think it' s important to have a resolution in case we come across a retailer that is not on board with this or we are having problems. Right now I don' t have any problems. I haven' t had to threaten anybody with finding them. These fees would be if a retailer does not pick up their cart within a minimum of three days after receiving notice from us. Either I call them directly or one of my officers will call them or their retrieval company and let them know where their cart is or make a decision. make arrangements with them at our lot to pick up these carts. If they don' t pick them up, we would have an ability to charge them a fee for picking them up. The $50 fee is more of a fine if this is a repeat occurrence and retailers are consistently failing to pick up their carts more than three times within six months. That is what I got. Do we have any questions about this? We have a question from the audience. I recommend you and the staff for coming up with a more acceptable solution for the merchants. I think the first cut at this was a little too punitive for the merchants and they' re the victims of the crime obviously. Thank you for that. Any other comments? Or questions? Questions? Yes, go ahead. I just want to compliment you as well. I was resistant to this concept originally and I think your fine tuning and refinement is excellent. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Questions? No questions. Thank you. How many speakers? One. Three minutes. James Hutchinson. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . the city of caltrans to see caltrans let them know there is firm direction from the council to see some change in that area make sure it goes to caltrans district 3 but also I would intend to send it to headquarters because there' s a lot of caltrans direction towards improving pedestrian safety improving alternative mobility besides cars. On their areas in this area does qualify under caltrans description does a main send it to the same street because it' s through downtown. You can say more of highway 32 but at least because we have this project going on this is a unique opportunity to reimagine these streets and so I think it' s worth it for us to send a simple letter requesting they work with us and I would trust our staff would have the right interests of our city in mind in working with them. I wrote this letter as a draft I tried to use all language from the city to make it a little m open for any questions. questions for mr. Winslow? I think it' s a great idea to compliment you for moving something forward to make our bicycle community safer. It would be very encouraging if the state of california would actually do something for us instead of doing something to us. We' ll see how that works out. further comments? public comments? we do. history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history! history history history history history history toward Mr. Baldy building. And partway down, almost to this intersection area that Mr. Winslow was describing, I watched one car crash on a... and hit another car. This was at a distance. I thought, well, please show up quickly. As we moved along, we thought, okay, we just got out of that one. But two other cars crashed right near me. And I sat there. We just missed the car roll right out in front of us. I didn't really get it. I sat there thinking when I saw Mr. Winslow's piece, yeah, that's what's happening out here. On the way back from this meeting, last week, last week, I walked home to that same area. And I watched another car behaving in erratic ways, trying to... go through the corners there, trying to cut off the distance. And someone, you could kind of gauge that. They were trying to throw their high beams on people's cars in front of them. They'd come up behind them without any lights and throw their high beams on them. And this was right in the same old area, right near downtown, right here, immediate traffic. And a lot of people there, of course, don't know how that programs. Yeah. Mr. Winslow had a good idea. I think he's approaching the right people. It looks like I can't attest to it. But I 100% think that there's going to be anything done with it. I see too many good ideas go down the drain. But I think this is a good idea we're pursuing. Thank you. Mr. Erland, we have a speaker. All right. Further comment? Entertain motion. I think my only comment would be is just to make sure, Mr. Ottobon, that you're comfortable. I'm writing this and encouraging them to come along. And I support the idea. And then we just ask staff to create the letter so you can make sure that you get all the points that you need to hit. Nothing against your letter. It's great. But sure. Yeah, I did run it by Mr. Ottobon before I submitted it, just to make sure if there's anything blaring in error. Who's known? That's all. Yeah. I'll just make a motion to send a letter on the second page. City of Chico letterhead to contacts at Coptrans District 3 and Headquarters. Switch them up and Mr. Ottobon will furnish. Second. Clarification. City manager signing? Or the mayor. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's a clarification. Sure, sure, sure. Yeah. It's for the mayor. I mean, what? He said the city manager or the mayor. So, okay. Madam Clerk. Typically, when the council directs it, the mayor signs the letter on behalf of the city. Yeah. So, I'm not saying that's not a good idea. So, we don't mind just them looking it over before it happens? Yes, absolutely. Put my name to it. No offense. Sure. Yeah. You can read it yourself. But, yes, welcome edits or you can leave it open like that. The substance is understood. Was there a second? Yeah, there was. Okay. Thank you. Council Member Bennett? Yes. Council Member Morgan? No. Council Member Tandon? Yes. Council Member Van Overbeck? No. Council Member Williams? Council Member Winslow? Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds? Aye. Mayor Coolidge? Aye. Carries 6-1. All right. Items added after the posting of the agenda. We have 30 set. No. Nothing. April Fool's. Okay. Six. Reports and communications. The following reports and communications items are provided for the council's information. No action can be taken on items under this section on the agenda unless the council agrees to include it on a subsequent agenda. 6.1. City Manager's Report. Verbal Report. No report. Council Member S. All right. 6.2. Is there? 6.3. Council Member Quest. Pursuant to APMP 1010, council members have made a verbal request to have an item agendized at a future meeting after stating what the item would be. A majority of the council is needed in order for staff to agendize. Any council member requests? I had considered making a request. I just want to float it and maybe open up for somebody else to. It's really a reconsideration. On that downtown complete streets project, we sent it back for staff. I don't know that it was understood by everybody here that what that would entail is hiring new consultants. It was going to put it months out and that's going to make us miss the deadline for the active transportation program grant, which is once every two years. So I had a nightmare that 2026 came around and we had this great project planned and we applied for it, but we lost out to Modesto because the whole state of California is going the direction of doing cool projects and we become less and less significant the more that we delay it. I think that we should strongly consider reconsidering some of the designs that we've already been given. I think that they do satisfy a lot of the concerns that were there. We didn't have a formal vote at the end of that, but this would be an opportunity to reconsider a vote. If somebody else felt similarly, I would second it. I grew up in Modesto and I don't think we'd have any nightmares. Modesto will not beat us out on this. They will have a high speed rail stop. I think they're going to have some really competitive grant applications. Okay. Thank you. s get back to council member requests. I need to know what your request is. My request would be we reopen the discussion on the downtown complete streets project. All right. There we go. I actually was under that impression too. That would come back soon. I would just have a point of order to make sure that we can do that. Yeah. Can we do that? Because it' s been within how long? I don' t remember what the vote was and I just want to make sure that we' re within. The council can bring it back any time it wants based on council orals here. If the council has a motion to do that, the council staff can bring it back. Not if he was on the losing side. Bring it back. There was no vote in the end. I consider the third best poll on the topic yet. Yeah. Okay. Leave council member winslow. You voted yes for that recommendation at that time. You could make another motion. I would like to make a motion to reconsider. Since you did vote yes. We voted on like vaults and then like bike lane buffer style. Ultimately when it came to the priority of walking, biking, it was kind of do we adopt one of these alternatives or do we send it back? We did not take a vote. That' s correct. You did give direction to staff so you could bring it back based on that direction and have further discussion. Okay. Well, based on that, like I will make a motion then that we reconsider that decision, whatever that decision was. Bring it back for further discussion. Bring it back for further discussion in advance of the consultants coming up with designs many months from now. I second that. So. I' ll second. The issue is. We should have a discussion about it though. Yeah, but we' re not supposed to discuss it. We' re supposed to agendaize it then discuss it. Can we ask for Audubon to chime in? I feel like you were about to. I was about to say something. But we shouldn' t have a discussion. So then we' re having a discussion. So he' s made a motion. Right. We' ve seconded. Is there a timeline? I' m just curious. Is there a timeline when you want it back? Because it is supposed to come back eventually. But are you. This would bring it back sooner. Are you defining. Are you putting a deadline before the end of the April or the first because that will define it better because coming back sooner or later. Mm- I think that' s a good question. m just curious. Yeah. Normally council member requests, correct me if I' m wrong, we skip one meeting and they come back in the next. So it' would be one month from now that we would see it. But my last conversation with Mr. Auduboni, he said that the consultants will take months to come up with new designs. We' re looking to get into a more advanced stage so we address some of the concerns. There' e a lot of work that we directed them to do. And I don' t know that we understood what we were asking them to do. No. Madam Clerk. Yes. m wondering if you have any thoughts on this. How about if I' had to go with verbatim minutes on that particular item because while there were some actions taken on the vaults and some other areas and clear direction was given on second, third, and fourth as well as more general comments made for staff to look at different options, especially related to main and Broadway. And I would like to be able to provide those verbatim. Those comments and stuff to the council because I think if you saw what you guys actually directed, that' s what staff was working on to bring back to you. But it' s up to you. I mean, if you want to get those minutes and then make a decision at that point, that might . . . Do it at the next meeting. Mr. Winslow, was your concern that instead of having it just be re-looked at by staff and then being brought back to us that they' re actually going out to another consultant? Yes. Is that the concern? That is my understanding, yes. But I don' t believe at this point we could have everything together for an ATP submission in June. No. And so, yeah, I' ll take this opportunity, I guess, to communicate or update on what our intended plan of action is. So the ATP applications are due in mid-June. At this point, we aren' t going to have or not going to have a clear scope of work ready for that. So we don' t feel we' re going to be really competitive. So we' ve shifted our approach to still apply for the ATP in June, but as a design portion, not the construction portion. And what that would allow us to do is we already got $2 million in carbon reduction funding for design through BCAG. The intention would be to use that for nerdy engineer term, PANED phase, and get that started and come up with the concepts and start the environmental document. And what the ATP application would then do is do the construction. And history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history the design rfp program there' s an effort by that program to incentivize or fund early phases like design and subsequently future phases of construction. That' s where we' re shifting and our intention would be to put out a design rfp and further evaluate more in a more detailed way the different concepts we will bring back to council. thank you. re not supposed to be discussing this. here we are. wouldn' this be more officially done as a reconsideration of the vote? it would be more appropriate for that as a reconsideration. however, I believe we can have information from staff to help you decide how you want to vote for this particular item. but history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history council member van overbeck no council member winslow yes vice mayor reynolds no mayor coolidge never done this in doubt okay it fails six i'm excuse me one to six all right uh with that we will adjourn thank you very much we will see you on april 16th you
