 With that, we will call the regular city councilman in the city of Chico to order  and start with an invocation from Reverend Penny DeRosier. Did I massacre that?  All right, welcome. Thanks for being here.  Thank you very much. All right, if you please stand and join me in the Pledge of Allegiance.  All right, Madam Clerk, take the roll, please.  Okay. Councilmember Bennett? Here.  Councilmember Morgan? Here.  Councilmember Tandon? Here.  Councilmember Van Overbach?  Here.  Councilmember Winslow? Here.  Vice Mayor Reynolds? Here.  Mayor Coolidge? President.  All right, and speaker card announcement.  So anyone wishing to address the council on any matter listed on the agenda,  please complete a speaker card.  They are in the back of the room.  You'll turn them in to the city clerk over here on my left, your right,  and speakers are taken in the order received,  and once the first speaker begins, no additional cards will be accepted on that item.  So if you want to speak on an item, make sure to turn in your card  before you begin your speech.  Before we start that.  I do want to note that item 2.4,  the DCBA agreement is being pulled off the consent agenda  and will be agendized at a later date.  So if you want to speak on that particular item,  if your name is called, just tell the clerk that you want to have that pulled off  and you can come and talk to us about it later.  So item 1.6 is our closed session announcement from today,  and for that I will turn it over.  I'll handle it.  Oh, to Clerk Devin Crescent.  So the council met with staff in closed session regarding the items that are listed on the agenda.  No action was taken.  Updates were provided.  And that's the end of the report.  All right.  And then I have a presentation for the American Red Cross Month,  and I believe it's Katie Minoletti.  Is she here?  Hi.  I'll meet you right down at the podium.  Good job, Katie. Grab the microphone here. Welcome. Thank you. Thanks for being here. We're happy to do this. All right. All right. So I have to read all this good stuff. So whereas during American Red Cross Month in March, we celebrate the humanitarian spirit of Chico and reaffirm our commitment to help ensure no one faces the crisis alone.  the humanitarian spirit of Chico  and reaffirm our commitment  to help ensure no one  faces the crisis alone.  And whereas caring for one another is the  heart of our community, and exemplified  by the people of Chico,  whose simple act of kindness to the  Red Cross brought help and hope  in people's most difficult moments,  continuing the life-saving  legacy of Clare Barton,  who founded the organization more than  140 years ago to  prevent and alleviate human suffering.  And boy, would she be proud.  Seriously.  Whereas every day those ordinary  individuals lend a helping hand to make an  extraordinary difference for the neighbors in need,  whether it's providing emergency  shelter, food, and comfort  for families displaced by  fires or other disasters, supporting  military members and veterans,  along with their families and caregivers  through the unique challenge of service,  using vital life skills  like first aid and CPR to help others  survive medical emergencies,  or delivering international and  humanitarian aid, and reconnecting  the loved ones separated by crises  around the world. And whereas their  support and volunteerism and generous  donations are critical to our community's  resilience, we hereby recognize  this month in March an honor  to all those who fulfill Clare Barton's  noble words,  you must never think of anything except  the need and how to meet it.  And we ask everyone to join in this commitment.  Now therefore be it resolved that I,  and your crew, to marry the city of Chico,  on behalf of the City Council, do hereby  proclaim March 2023  as an American Red Cross month.  I urge all citizens  to reach out and support the organization  and its noble humanitarian mission.  So, and I can say this,  and I'm sure everybody here would agree,  that this organization  has probably touched every life in this room.  I know it's touched mine several times,  whether it was learning CPR,  whether it was learning going through first aid training,  and also later on during  the pandemic. And so, I'm very grateful  to have disasters that  defiled my life.  They were there. And I can't thank you enough  for everything that you do for our community,  as well as the Red Cross. Thank you.  So.  Thank you.  Thank you so much.  I just want to say thank you  for having me here tonight.  I'm the brand new Executive Director  with the Northern California Chapter  of the American Red Cross  Gold Country Region.  And we have 17 amazing  volunteers who live right here  in the Chico City Limits.  So tonight is all about them.  This entire month is really for them.  And we'll be celebrating them at our  Volunteer Appreciation Dinner on the 16th.  So, thank you so much for having us,  and I'm just grateful to be here.  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right.  And from there, we will move onto the  consent agenda. All matters listed on the  consent agenda can be considered routine.  And thereby, can be enacted by one  motion. Are there any speakers on consent?  We do. We have one.  Nicole Nava.  All right.  Three minutes.  Thanks. I wanted to direct my  comments to the  item related to the  Tax Accountability Act.  And I just want to note I could see on the agenda where it noted an objection it looked like to that act for the city council to want to draft a letter.  And I just want to note that, you know, we're all struggling across the nation.  I think we're all struggling, especially in California.  Everything is way expensive here.  And we have a lot of our taxes directed at the schools.  They're supposed to be directed at the roads and other things.  And yet those things, we have people failing in school and we have roads that are not great.  And so I think that the heart of this initiative is voters are concerned about what is happening with our taxes.  They get concerned when there's not a sunset clause in these.  You know, locally here we even had some of that discussion.  A lot of the voters passed.  A specific measure.  And I think there's been misinformation about whether that would or would be impacted with this initiative.  And my understanding is that it actually would not.  So it would be nice to know and have that clarified.  Because I actually like a lot of what's said in this.  Because as a taxpayer, I feel like we should be the ones that are the arbiter of how our money is getting spent and be able to vote on that collectively.  So I understand.  I understand the concern that was expressed as I read it in the accompanying report.  But I'm just hoping that maybe there wasn't some misinterpretation or something which can happen.  Sometimes state, like advocacy groups and other things, can get confused and there can be a telephone game.  And so if it is true that it would be impactful for that measure, I get it.  We worked really hard to get that put through because we want our roads fixed.  But this has way broader implications than that going forward.  And I think the taxpayers deserve that we maybe press pause and just make sure of things.  Thank you for your time.  Thank you.  She was our only speaker.  All right.  Thank you.  And then do we have any council disqualifications or no votes?  I was going to abstain from 2.4, but since we're not doing that, but I did want to pull 2.2, actually.  But I would move to approve the rest.  All right.  So absent of item 2.4 because it was pulled off the agenda, item 2.2 being pulled off by Vice Mayor Reynolds.  All right.  When you're ready, are we?  Did we have a second?  Yeah.  Who was the second?  Okay.  Thank you.  Okay.  Thank you.  Council Member Bennett?  Yes.  Council Member Morgan?  Yes.  Council Member Tandon?  Yes.  Council Member Van Overbeck?  Yes.  Council Member Winslow?  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds?  Aye.  Mayor Coolidge?  Aye.  Carries 7-0.  All right.  Vice Mayor?  So I just wanted to pull 2.2 and wonder if we shouldn't.  Okay.  maybe put that to another meeting and re-look at it.  It just seems like there's a lot of conflicting information.  It sounds like it could affect our Measure H,  but I think we also need to look at the overall  region scope of it.  So I don't know if staff wants to address it or...  I'll just add one thing.  I have conflicting information versus what's in here  versus what's coming out of James Gallagher's office.  So I'm reluctant to approve it,  not knowing for certain what it means.  And I don't trust the League of California Cities at all.  Is that all?  Move to table?  Move to table to another meeting.  Second.  All right, we have a motion on the table.  Okay, Council Member Bennett?  Yes.  Council Member Morgan?  Yes.  Council Member Tandon?  Yes.  Council Member Van Overback?  Yes.  Council Member Winslow?  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds?  Aye.  Mayor Coolidge?  Aye.  Carries 7-0.  All right, thank you all.  That so ends the Consent Agenda.  Item three, Business Room Floor.  Members of the public may address the Council at this time  on any matter not already listed on the agenda.  The Council cannot take any action at this meeting  on request made under this section of the agenda.  How many speakers?  We have 10 so far.  All right, three minutes.  Is that an additional one?  I'm sorry, we do have 11.  All right.  And I don't know what's going on over there.  So do you want me to go ahead and queue them up?  Okay, so I'm going to call two names and if you could line  up in the middle aisle.  Robin Engle followed by Kim Knott.  Three minutes each, Mayor Coolidge?  Yes.  Okay, thank you.  So Robin Engle.  There we go.  Nobody should forget.  Good job, everyone.  Good job, everyone.  Good job, everyone.  Good job, everyone.  Good job, everyone.  Good job, everyone.  Good job, everyone.  Good job, everyone.  Good job, everyone.  Good job, everyone.  Good job, everyone.  Good job, everyone.  $65 million for LaMoffa's Paradise Pipeline is going to take our clean water.  $640,000 is the restarting salary for Attorney Ewing, who cost us $850,000 in legal fees.  $873,200 to operate an ice rink, including locking the plaza for approximately 230 days.  And those numbers are my well-researched estimates, because those numbers are withheld from the public.  $184,000 is the cost of four sweeps. We've had many more than that.  $50,000 went to Dan Lee's friend, Paul Webster, for, I don't know what, making a tax-paid trip to Chico, I guess, after she was off of council.  And $50,000 went to violate a citizen's free speech at council meeting.  Under.  Mayor Morgan.  These numbers, the tip of the iceberg, total over $160 million.  How much has council spent to address effectively our housing crisis?  Zero.  Not a single penny.  Rest in peace to all the victims of council's frivolous spending, greed, and unconstitutional cruelty.  Thank you, Councillor Winslow.  Thank you, Councillor Davis.  Kim Knott, followed by George Deeds.  Well, good evening.  I haven't been here in a while.  It's good to see some new faces.  A couple of things.  I was in this council when Marsh Jr. and I came here looking for relief from a homeless encampment.  That was.  A homeless sanctioned camp that was going to be put right next to them.  And council delivered and listened to them and went ahead and made the right decision not to put this next to a school.  And last week I listened to the people from Heritage Oaks who are right next to Tiger Ponds.  And they came in here with very compelling stories about what's going on in their neighborhoods.  And I guess my point being is that.  If people have an issue, they have a venue.  They can come here.  They can gather their neighbors and come here and get a hearing.  And in general, get action.  I hope that the people at Heritage Oaks get action soon.  Because it was very sad to hear the stories, quite frankly.  And I also hope that the people that are camping next.  To Heritage.  Get the help they need.  The people that want help.  That will accept help.  And I also expect that the drug dealers that are preying on a lot of people get the justice that they deserve.  Where I'm going with this a little bit is I read today about this internal affairs committee.  That decided against setting up.  A.  New.  Device.  To.  Invest.  To reach out.  About quality of life issues.  We have a venue right now.  For doing that, which is.  What I'm doing right now.  And I just don't think that we need.  What I consider it almost to be a shadow government.  Out there doing whatever they want.  When we do have this.  And lastly.  If we're going to have a commission about anything.  I think.  I think.  It should be about.  What happened that got us into Warren versus Chico.  We have never gotten an explanation.  About what advice.  Mr.  Ewing was giving.  Whether that advice was taken.  Nobody's ever mentioned that.  And I mean.  You people run through elections.  And three of you are up for election next time.  And we still don't know what happened.  As a city.  We deserve to know.  The conversations that went into.  Those decisions.  That got us sued.  That lost us a lot of money.  And that we're still dealing with.  Thank you for your time.  Thank you.  George deeds.  Followed by Lynn.  Belante.  Hello counselors.  My name is George deeds.  And today I come to you as a volunteer ambassador.  For the treatment advocacy program.  Treatment advocacy center.  Out of Arlington, Virginia.  They got hold of me in November.  And they had me go to a zoom meeting.  Where the who's who.  Of mental health advocacy was all there.  All the big names.  Lynn Gibbs.  Pascinini.  Glad.  Anybody that's done anything was at this meeting.  And what they wanted.  And if you don't know what they do.  The treatment advocacy center.  They do all the mental health numbers across the nation.  Local state.  And national.  So a lot of people have been getting a hold of them for a lot of years.  And that's how I came across them.  Before I came over here to start doing the Laura's law.  I.  Researched what I needed to do.  And that's one of the outfits that I ended up calling.  So they got hold of me in November.  And I'm at this zoom meeting.  And one of the big wigs said, hey, you got our attention.  What is it that you want.  From us.  And they said, we want to unite families.  So we're on the same page and we want to start in Maryland.  And so that's what they did in December.  They started in Maryland.  And they got all the advocates in Maryland together.  That they knew because they're all calling them anyway.  And.  They were talking about where they were talking to each other and talking to each other and talking to each other and talking to each other and talking to each other and talking to each other and talking to each other and talking to each other and talking to each other and talking to each other and talking to each other and talking to each other and talking to each other and talking to each other and talking to each other and talking to each other and talking to each other and talking to each other and talking to each other and talking to each other and talking to each other and talking to each other and talking to each other and talking to each other and talking to each other and talking to each other and talking to each other and talking to each other and talking to each other and talking to each other and talking to each other and talking to each other and talking to each other and talking to each other and talking to each other and talking to each other and talking to each other and talking to each other and talking to each other and talking to each other and talking to each other and talking to each other and talking to each other  I came back and it's still here.  That's because we need something a little bigger than us.  And so now I am part of a team that all we're doing is uniting families so we're all on one page.  And I want to let you guys know when these votes come up because we need your vote.  And I know you know families out here that are living with a mental health stigma that they don't want to just pop up and say anything.  But we have a Facebook page now that they can all go to.  We have an email system that they can all go to.  And that's wonderful news for all of us in our community.  So that's what I've been doing.  Well, I just found out on Friday.  So today I went to chat and I went to the Iverson Center and I was here to let everybody know the good news.  So I'm going to be out there doing it and I'll hold myself accountable by coming back and telling you guys where we're at  and keeping you posted about what mental health laws need to be passed.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Just get back there.  So Lynn Beliante followed by Loretta Torres.  Hello, my name is Lynn Beliante.  I was here four weeks ago speaking to you.  And first of all, I want to say thank you very much for getting on it so quickly,  going out and assessing and enforcing at the primary alternative.  And that's going to be at the primary alternative campsite.  It started the very next day.  And my concern, what brought me here was the secondary site shared a property line with the school.  I didn't want to see it go to the need for a second site.  And I realized two more spots had to be made to be able to enforce at the first site.  But hopefully, you know, they won't even be needed.  And along that line, I had some suggestions to make.  I'm requesting that more regular enforcement occurs at the primary alternative campsite.  This is the first time it's happened since it opened last June.  I'm thinking maybe a monthly basis.  Assessment needs to occur on a regular basis so it doesn't get out of control like it has the last several months.  Tents have now been placed down inside the channel a little ways down.  And that's a flood control zone.  And maybe those tents could be part of this site.  They're very close.  They're just right down inside the channel there a little ways south.  I don't believe there's a dumpster there anymore.  So you probably want to put a dumpster back.  And maybe this time it should be larger than just a mini one.  I have a very strong suggestion about the parking lot.  It really opened a can of worms when a parking lot was put there.  Large boulders were put there to delineate the parking area.  And car campers, it just turned into car camping.  If what's trying to be done is to provide a parking space for the legal campers who are there,  I don't think that's going to happen.  I don't think that much space needs to be allotted.  There's room for them if they have a car to park it just right outside there.  There is quite a bit of ample space right outside the site.  Things really escalated when the parking lot was delineated.  I don't think there's a need for a parking lot.  I don't think it was ordered.  I don't know.  Anyway, that's just my feeling about that.  It would also allow for more tent space.  Also today, several campers said,  that they went there not knowing what the alternative site was for.  That it's for when you're assessed and you can't go to the pallet shelter or the tour shelter.  Maybe you need to put up a sign.  And then my last, I really want to make the point that  I'm wondering if maybe the city has opened itself up to liability on some of these issues now.  If anybody is harmed, you know,  nearby residents, residents of the assisted living facility nearby,  a dementia unit, the school that's right there,  the students and employees, the businesses across the street.  You heard from the gentleman four weeks ago.  Employees are being harassed and threatened.  And just another reason why you, and the campers,  the campers that are supposed to be there.  They can't get the services they're supposed to get.  So thank you again very much for really getting on this quickly.  Thank you.  Loretta Torres followed by Nicole Nava.  Loretta Ann Torres.  And I'm just a little small thing here.  I'm asking, please consider sending a letter of endorsing Councilman Gallagher's bills number SB43 and SB363.  They are aimed at those on our streets who need mental health and addiction help.  And a few speakers ago,  he mentioned the need for this.  And I'm seconding that.  I believe it would be a positive thing for Chico  because it would help us with our homeless population.  So please consider doing that.  Thank you.  Thank you, Loretta.  Nicole Nava followed by Bill Monroe.  Thank you.  Good evening again.  Three quick things.  So the first is I want to refute what I said.  I want to refute what a prior speaker said regarding the police department being the highest paid throughout our state or one of.  I do not believe that is accurate.  I believe more statistically accurate statement would be that of all the general funds,  Chico has one of the lowest throughout the state given, you know, our city's population size.  And of that, there is a portion of that allocation that does go to the police department that does look significant given the size of our general fund.  And the fact that it hasn't been able to grow commiserate with the population we've taken on and other things going on.  So just wanted to get that out there.  Statistics are important.  Number two, quality of life.  Let's talk about that.  Another speaker brought that up and noted about business from the floor.  Well, I actually intend to speak about something similar to the speaker who just left.  And guess what?  We have three minutes, two left, where I'm having to hit things because to me this is important.  These are important topics.  But guess what?  I'm talking at you.  I'm talking with you.  Whereas when there would be this quality of life initiative and an ad hoc committee type thing where it forms just to discuss something, dissolves when the things are done, that is an opportunity to speak with you.  Those representatives that are a part of that group.  That is very different than talking at you.  And so I just I think a good way to maybe think about these things in the future for an opportunity is to try like pilot programs.  Just maybe then if we're not ready to proceed.  And then if we're not ready to press the button on a committee, we publicize the form more.  Nobody knew about it.  So the stats might be low, Councillor Winslow, but that might not be indicative of what will be going on later.  And then at that time, we might want to bring it back, consider it.  Things like that.  So I just think it was maybe just quick off the mark and sounded kind of toned up to some of the community.  And it sounded like it would be very representative with each of you picking one person from your area.  So I think some of the concerns about being a shadow government, I think that's something that we need to think about.  And then I think the other thing that I would like to say is that the other things that I would like to say is that the !  I would like to say is that the first one is that we need to have a real time dashboard of those individuals to help them be able to get conservatorship that they may need to get their really grave severe issues met.  The second one, the 363, deals with having a real time dashboard for mental health beds that would be available and addiction treatment beds that would be available throughout the state of California.  Kind of vital information for your local NGOs, other service providers.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Bill Monroe followed by Wade Davis.  Hi.  I live on West 4th Avenue near Enloe.  And I would just like to speak to the quality of life issue, the measure L and the committee meeting about that.  I agree with Mr. Van Overbeek and Addison Winslow in opposing the creation of a monthly meeting that would basically double up on what goes on right now.  And that's where we see where we see where we see where we see where we see where we see where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where where  way to report nuisances.  And  so if somebody  has created nuisance  on public land, which is the  whole thing of  this Prop L business,  there's  ample opportunity to report it on  that. And  city will redirect  those complaints  to the proper agency  to take care of it, whether it's  police or fire  or public works or  whatever. So  anyway, I don't see any real need.  I thought that the L  thing was kind of more of a political  deal to kind of get  people riled up about the nuisances  in Chico,  which is a lovely city.  It's a beautiful city.  And it really isn't full of  nuisances, but  for when those  things come up, we already  have a process.  We report them. And so  that's my thoughts.  Thank you. Thank you. Wade Davis  followed by Cicere Sherry.  Casey Reynolds,  you're directly  involved in the systematic  exploitation of Ed and Yolanda,  my friends. Sir, we're  not going to make personal  attacks on a council member  from the podium. Can I speak to the facts?  You can make  plenty of comments  about their actions that they took.  We don't want you insulting them personally.  I understand. Thank you.  You  and your partners  involved in the Miller Mansion  scandal  have no mercy.  No one is safe in this  community. It took me three  years to begin to expose  your involvement in the  Miller Mansion.  You placed many homeless into the Miller Mansion  under a COVID fund to house the homeless,  but you charged them rent  along with your partners.  You did this completely unregulated  and even placed homeless people in your own program  and never even ran background checks on them  before placing them at the mansion  where eight children were living.  All of this was done on a property that was not in the  property owned by Ed and Yolanda  Niedeross without their knowledge or consent.  The less fortunate,  I got to leave some of that out because I want to comply,  but the less fortunate seem to be victimized and you're good at it.  I'm sorry if that was too far.  Not even the elderly or children or disabled people are safe from your ice cream.  I'm done.  Thank you.  Ciceri Sherry followed by Patrick Newman.  I remembered to queue up this time.  All right.  This is just real quick.  We still need 24-hour sanitation downtown.  There are still people there who were never assessed  and there are people there who were not successful in the pallet program.  So yeah.  Real toilets, not port-o-potties.  Ones that go flush, soap, the whole sanitation package  is what I'm talking about.  And drinking water as well.  That's it.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Patrick Newman followed by Sasha Ana.  There's always a deep history to all these things.  And mental health is one of them.  Go all the way back to the Lanterman Act and look at how that's evolved.  You're not going to solve a mental health problem in a context where you don't have housing.  The most destabilizing thing you can do with people is dump them on the streets.  All of you would probably be mentally ill within six months if you were living on the street.  You don't fix the housing problem, you don't fix the mental health problem.  The question of whether or not to have a quality of life commission.  Here again, history.  We had the Greater Chico Homes Task Force for however long it was.  20 years? 25 years?  What was that forum for?  It was to address most of what would be talked about,  in this new forum, except that it was a holistic approach that involved everybody in the community  talking about where we might go with the issue.  Of course we went almost nowhere.  So there you go, you have these forks in the road.  What creates that fork in the road is whether or not you have a moral basis for your actions or not.  And this recurs over and over again.  Because if you have a moral basis, that leads you to a human rights perspective.  Every single one of these things has human rights.  There's human rights dynamics in them.  But we don't refer to those first before we start taking off with solutions.  And I went out to Eaton and Cohasset today.  I wanted to see what the water situation was like out there.  It's my third visit out there.  I met a 68-year-old woman who lost her mobile home.  She had some medical bills and was evicted.  Living in her car.  Anybody who thinks about what this winter's been like, even for five seconds?  . . .  What kind of society?  Where's our moral compass as a society where we don't have a moral basis that leads us to a set of human rights principles that leads us to a place where that doesn't happen?  And then you look at that camp.  And you have to ask yourself, if we think about something like right to rest, what do we have there?  How many people in Chico will go out there and walk around and look at it?  The camp that's being proposed across the street, diagonally, I walked around there.  There's standing water in the campsites.  So once again, you have this history of sweeping and then making these kind of responses that end up punishing people.  Over and over and over again.  Why?  Because there isn't a moral basis and there isn't a set of human rights principles first.  And that's what happened over here on the plaza when the toilets and the water were shut off again.  You don't even have to look at the moral part.  You can just look at the legal part.  It wasn't legal under Warren v. Chico, which you agreed to.  But again, no moral compass, no human rights understanding, and everything follows from there.  Anyway, I'm out of time.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Our last speaker is Sasha Ana.  Good evening.  Council members, I want to take us back a few steps.  Throughout 2020, 21, 2022, we've been in a state of crisis.  While talking about COVID, and talking about COVID throughout 2022, Operation COVID Rollout, regurgitation of state sponsored propaganda and misinformation aimed at increasing and not decreasing hysteria at a really sensitive time, fearmongering that Chico City staff and elected officials got caught up in themselves needs to be addressed.  It just happened.  It needs to be talked about what happened.  Chico's complicity of restricting social movement, abdicating social norms, imposing baseless theatrics, not based on facts nor science, is shameful.  Apologies large and small are in order for losing sight of rational thought, healthy skepticism, and protecting the civil rights of all residents, guests, and workers in this city and in this county.  We the people are protected by a U.S. Constitution and a U.S. Bill of Rights for a reason, and that reason is government overreach.  Yet Chico, council members bent over backwards to aid the endless restrictions promoted by Operation COVID, and the perks rolled in.  City Council made no meaningful effort to weigh the risks versus benefits of a lockup for a city not experiencing a major health disaster whatsoever.  All based on accountability.  We had a case-demic, ACA, PCR cases that had nothing to do with a person having an active infection, and that was based on PCR over 40 cycle thresholds, and that was intentional.  I wrote about it in the very beginning of COVID.  Some of you maybe actually read my emails, I don't know.  But that's come out all the way through COVID.  If you run cycles high enough, everybody tests.  Water tests positive.  Social, business, medical.  Restrictions were without precedent.  Restrictions were capricious, new rules and theatrics, plexiglass in these council chambers, for instance.  We all remember that theater.  Lacked logic or sound judgment or common sense.  Restrictions that were the direct result of a bizarre mass psychosis of fear that ruled the day.  We the people expect higher standards of rational thought than this.  It is truly well beyond just embarrassing.  The fact that Chico City Council essentially gave no apology to this community for its jumping aboard the very crowded misinformation bandwagon is not only regrettable, but against your oaths of office.  For those members not having seats at that time, you're exempt.  The community at large needs a council that can separate facts from fiction.  This did not happen during Operation COVID.  Let's hope it never happens again on the next pandemic coming down the road.  Thank you.  Thank you.  She was our last speaker.  All right.  Thank you very much.  And we will move on with the public hearings, of which we have none, to the regular agenda, item 5.1, Board and Commission Analysis.  And we have a report by our esteemed clerk, Deborah Pressel.  Okay.  I'm going to stay where I'm at.  Hopefully that will work.  Thank you, Mayor and Council.  As you're aware, at your meeting of February 7th, the Council was gracious enough to allow me to present an overview of our boards and commissions.  It hadn't been done in several years, and it's something that we do from time to time just to evaluate whether or not we're on track.  Are we still working on the same mission, the priorities of the Council?  So at that meeting, Council, based on that overview, asked,  staff to bring back possible modifications related to amending the frequency of meetings for the Bidwell Park and Playground Commission and Climate Action Commission,  and to provide a draft policy statement that might limit commissioners' abilities to agendize individual requests that have not been referred by Council or staff,  and to also provide an analysis on the consolidation of the Architectural Review and Historic Preservation Board duties in with the Planning Commission.  So I'm going to talk a little bit.  Okay.  In my staff report, we talk first about the frequency of meetings.  During that meeting, we did discuss the fact and the number of meetings that were held.  And right now you have an Arts Commission and an Airport Commission that meet quarterly, so they meet four times a year.  And then you have the Planning Commission and ARHPB Board that meets up to twice a month,  and that's all based on projects that are coming through the pipeline.  And so those are all driven by...  What's going on in our community.  In addition, the Bidwell Park and Playground Commission meets monthly, as well as the Climate Action Commission.  In 2022, the Bidwell Park and Playground Commission held nine meetings, three were canceled.  And the Climate Action Commission canceled one of theirs.  So there was an overall discussion about the possibility of instead having them...  Instead of having the monthly meetings as an absolute schedule,  that we would actually change it to they would meet whenever there was an item that needed to be addressed.  So after further discussion with staff on the Bidwell Park and Playground Commission,  this board or commission actually has a responsibility of approving some permits,  whether that's for park events, races in the park, those kinds of things.  So the staff in Public Works had recommended that we keep it at monthly meetings,  especially with their capability.  So they had the capability of canceling a meeting if there wasn't any item.  In addition, if the council later on agrees with limiting perhaps agenda requests by commissioners,  that would also help the Bidwell Park and Playground Commission.  So right now, we were still thinking about keeping it at monthly meetings.  In terms of the Climate Action Commission, again, discussion with the planning staff,  they indicated that monthly...  may not be needed, but definitely they would be open to having quarterly meetings.  Again, we could also move to have a meeting whenever it's needed,  and that way if you had two items or two meetings that you needed right after each other,  then you guys, they could call for it.  If you have quarterly, then you have to wait.  So that is the benefit of having them...  calling up a meeting when you actually have an item.  But again, I will leave that to the council.  I'm going to go...  through all the points unless you want to talk to me individually,  like right now, about just the frequency of meetings,  or if you want to hear the whole presentation, what would council like?  Keep going?  With the presentation, the whole presentation, and the individual questions?  Is that all?  There are three separate things going on here that I might have some questions on each of them,  but if that's okay with you, I'll wait until the end of the presentation,  and then take them one by one.  Yeah, I think otherwise we're just not going to be able to get through the presentation.  Okay.  All right.  Thank you.  So...  Anyway, so that was on the frequency of the meetings.  So commissioner requests to agendize items.  So we have a wonderful group of volunteers and citizens  who want to participate and help us with...  help the city,  and they get appointed to a board and commission.  And so it isn't about limiting what they do.  It's about making...  making sure that everything that is done at these meetings  represent the priorities and the direction of the council.  And so, as I mentioned in February,  number 10 of the Code of Conduct specifically talks about commissioners,  that final Code of Conduct was about not getting into the operations of the city.  You aren't...  Commissioners aren't supposed to be delving into the budget.  I mean, obviously,  if they have a general question,  are you funded for this or that?  But in order to agendize a discussion about perhaps measure H funds  might not be appropriate  since the council hasn't even had that discussion.  So, again, it isn't about limiting them.  It's about making sure that when they're there,  the work that is needed to be done will get done.  And so in regards to that,  I did draft some...  a draft...  a draft statement that would go into APMP 10-1,  and it would just basically say that the work of each advisory body  is driven by council policy,  referral for recommendations or items brought forward by staff  in order to fulfill the responsibilities of the city  and its work for our community.  Individual board and commission members are prohibited  from agendizing personal requests to discuss potential ideas  or to bring back discussions related to the operations of the city.  Items for commission review and discussion  are determined by council action  and or by referral of an item by staff.  And so how...  you know, what would that look like?  So if a commissioner had an idea,  they could reach out to a council member and say,  I really think this might benefit this particular commission  and or something that would help our community.  And then if a council member wanted to take that matter up  and bring that forward, they could do that.  Right now, we have...  we have individual nominations of our commissioners  who were appointed or will be appointed  by individual council members.  So that is a possibility.  It doesn't cut that off  and preclude anyone from bringing this amazing idea  because we want input.  But I think what the intention was after talking to staff,  when you have nine items on one commission  that are driven by commissioners,  what are the items that might not have gotten done  because of the discussions of those?  When council sets priorities through your budgetary process  as well as every single meeting,  you take action and you provide direction to staff.  And so that was our...  that was the recommended statement  that we came up with to add to AP and P10-1.  And again, we would be training all of the boards  and commissioners as soon as we get them all appointed  and we get through this process.  Then they'll do a full day of training with myself  and my staff.  And we will go over the nuances  of how do you navigate this if we do change it.  So then we're on to the planning commission's  possible bringing in of the duties  of the Architectural Review Historic Preservation Board.  It's a discussion that's...  I've been here 23 years.  It's a discussion that's been going on quite often.  And we've had presentations by the planning staff,  staff as to the benefits of having ARHPB.  And over the years,  it's gotten more difficult to recruit.  When they added the historical preservation component,  two members have to have a specific background.  There's already three members of them  that have to have certain criteria.  And so I think that council has talked about it over the years.  And so planning staff met and they talked about it.  I don't know if they talked about it a couple of times,  but I know that they really spent a lot of time.  How would it look if the planning commission  would absorb the duties?  In 2022, there were eight planning commission meetings,  16 canceled.  The ARHPB also had...  They had 11 meetings and I think 14 got canceled.  And I don't know how that actually works  when you should only have 12 per year.  But anyway, but sometimes they can actually have a special meeting.  So anyway, I think that staff came up with the benefits analysis,  impossible limitations if you did consolidate.  First of all, our historic preservation component  of the ARHPB is a state of California,  it's city certified local government status  with the state of California.  And two of the planning commissioners,  if they're not, they're not going to be able to do that.  And so if you were to consolidate,  and then we were only recruiting for seven planning commissioners,  and let's just say that they had either a subcommittee  or on...  If the planning commission met the first Thursday  and the ARHPB came two weeks later,  you would still need to meet that criteria  in order to qualify for that distinction  for the historic preservation.  And one of the benefits that staff came up with, was,  was that they were able to do that.  And then the other benefit was that the planning commission  would be more engaged and knowledgeable  of all development activity proceeding in the city.  Of course, the planning commissioners that are,  there's seven and then if we went with five or three  as a subcommittee, those members would take  on the additional work of covering for the ARHPB.  And so if you did also do that, then the Municho Commission,  the city council, the city council,  the city council would be able to do that.  So we would have less structure.  We could, we would amend the code to reflect those duties  being moved over and how it would look.  We're not really, really sure,  but if you give that direction tonight,  then we would bring an ordinance back that would reflect  how that would work and how that would mesh.  But we would obviously want your input on that.  And so I am just open for questions at this point.  And then we can, I know we have quite a few speakers  on this item, so I want to just open it up  for your questions right now.  All right.  Any, I have a question for the clerk.  Before we start, how we want to go through this.  Do we want to go through each individual item first?  I think so.  Yeah, there's a lot of stuff.  I think that'll be easier.  Madam Clerk, which item do you prefer we discuss first?  Okay.  So we're going to talk about frequency of meetings.  Do you want to just start at the top?  Okay. And then we'll move on to the next item.  And then we'll work our way.  That's fine.  And covering all committees, yes.  So my question is, if we go to an as needed meeting,  who calls the meetings?  It would be staff because it would be based on the needs  and the importance and priorities.  Okay.  If council referred an item to the Commission or a board,  then obviously council would be referred to council,  staff would take that immediately back  to their next regularly scheduled meeting  or call for a meeting.  So it would be  staff that would be calling for them.  But as it relates to frequency of meetings, we're only  at this point referring to the Climate Action Commission.  Right.  Right.  Okay, other questions on frequency  of meetings?  So you're giving us two options  or offering, proposing two options.  One for the Climate Action Commission was going to  do meetings as needed and the other was  quarterly. And right now  the Climate Action Commission is looking at reviewing the  Urban Forest Master Plan. I think next  year there's a review of the Climate Action  Plan that would require,  as I understand, some more frequent  meetings. I'm wondering if  it makes sense to combine the  two and have both as needed because sometimes  there's going to be more work to be done. Sometimes  the commissioners and staff are going to be ready to see  more things and then have standing  quarterly meetings so that there never is a  period where the commission isn't  meeting for an extended time.  You could set  that up. I think it may be a little confusing  only from the perspective that  you know, are the  meetings are going to happen if they  if they're needed. And then if you  have a meeting, let's say in February  and your next quarterly is in April  but you've already tackled  what you might have talked about in April. I just  think that there's some  nuances there. But again, we can  pencil that out and see how  that would work. If you did,  if you did it as needed, then obviously  that urban management plan, all of those  documents that need to be reviewed, they would  have consecutive meetings. They would just call for  those because staff knows that they need to be  reviewed and those recommendations need to go on  and be forwarded to someone else or to another  body or to the council. So I mean, you can  capture it either way.  My concern that I'll just state and then we can hear  public comments is that as we have volunteers  stepping into these positions who are looking to assist us, we need to have a  meeting that is consistent with the city with climate action and climate action isn't  something that we're necessarily succeeding at or we're  finishing that it could be demoralizing to see  the meetings go down to fewer, not knowing when the next meeting is going to be.  Council Member Winslow, if we can just, commentary after and questions now?  Yeah, that would be.  If you don't mind. Thanks.  Okay. I believe Mr. Bennett, you have a question.  And this is going to be a suggestion for when we start to discuss the items.  I just, I want to make a suggestion now. I'd like to go, I'm going to go to the  House House House House House House House House House House House House House House  House House House House House House House House House House House House House House House House  House House House House House House House House House House House House House House House House House  House House House House House House House House House House House House House House House House House House House  House House House House House House House House House House House House House House House House House House House House House House  House House House House House House House House House House House House House House House House House House House House House House House House House  I think that would be the easiest  and most productive manner in which to proceed.  Okay.  All right, do we have,  I don't necessarily disagree with that either,  but let's save that discussion as well for after,  and then we can move through all the questions.  So if no other questions on that particular item,  how about number two then?  In terms of how the revisions say P&P 10-1,  do we have any questions for the clerk  about that item in particular?  All right, and then three,  any questions about the architectural review  and historic preservation work?  I have a question.  All right, I have a question.  So I've been through the process as a builder,  where you have a meeting with our architectural review board  and you have a meeting with the planning commission.  So if the architectural review board becomes a committee  of the planning commission,  do you still have to have two meetings  or would it all happen in one pass?  I'll turn that over to Brendan.  So there are only certain applications  do require going to both the ARHPB  and the planning commission.  In this case, if they were a subcommittee  of the planning commission, it would be one meeting.  Those were some of the highlights I highlighted  or that were presented to the staff report  and possible reduction in fees, et cetera,  because of less meeting times, less staff reports,  things of that nature.  Okay, so it would result in a reduction  in the number of meetings that a developer would have  for those projects that require going to both.  For sure.  Thank you.  All right, Council Member Wenzel.  This is kind of technical  because in order to maintain  our certified local government status with the ARHPB,  we need to have commissioners  or board members have certain qualifications.  Is that then gonna apply to all of the planning commission?  Well, that's something that we will have to grapple with.  I believe we would need two of the planning commissioners  to have this and the criteria  in the code right now for ARHPB.  Regular members, five members,  three of whom are engaged in the visual arts field,  such as architects, landscape architects, artists,  or designers, and at least two of whom  have professional experience in the disciplines  of architecture, history, architectural history,  planning, archeology, or other historic preservation  related disciplines, such as urban planning,  American studies,  American civilization, cultural geography,  or cultural anthropology in order to request appointment  and consideration for the board.  So that's two members that would need to meet that criteria  if you were to maintain that,  if that's the wish of the council  to maintain that certification.  My only concern is how that conflicts  with the structure we have of individual nominations.  I mean, say that Tom nominates somebody  with no experience at all, and one of us needs  to nominate an architect,  and who has to nominate the architect?  So when we get to, if the council moves forward  and just keeps ARHPB separate,  I will bring you a matrix that indicates  which applicants meet the criteria and which categories.  So I bring those forward to you,  and you have that as a summary.  On the ARHPB, it's a five-member board,  and so it's not individual appointments.  But for the Planning Commission, it would be.  As long as that seems simple enough for you,  it's fine with me.  I'll do whatever the council wants.  All right, yeah, my question was along the same lines.  So if the Planning Commission was doing this,  they'd have to incorporate the two members.  And then how do you designate,  or how would we propose designating who has to?  Well, and the next item is the appointment  of Planning Commissioners.  And that wasn't part of the recruitment.  No, no.  I understand this question was just asked.  I'm just, I didn't know if you had a...  She's going to bring a matrix.  I was going to say .  But that's for ARHPB.  Right.  So in regards to the Planning Commission,  and if they were to take on these duties,  the council would probably need to possibly re-recruit  so that you could ask them to fill out the application  so that they, and let us know if they meet that criteria.  So that's the first thing.  two members.  Brendan and I have talked about it,  and we believe that maybe we could do that in the next round.  We could, if it is absorbed, the duties,  and they set this subcommittee that the next round  in two years we would make sure that we get the two members  that need to meet a certain criteria.  And we may, within this group of seven...  Already have it.  Have that.  And of course, we would probably reach out to the state,  and then we would have to do that.  And share with them what's going on.  There's a process.  You know, get some advisement from them.  But, you know, we don't want to stop you from progressing  on first identifying and appointing new Planning Commissioners  as we're going through this transition.  So we don't have perfect answers to every single question,  but I think we can handle it, manage it.  And I also think that some of the people that we've identified  as possible Planning Commissioners probably do have the criteria  needed to retain our CLG status, certified local government.  But how many times, I think it's important to, you know,  let the Council know how many times we've utilized that.  Yeah, we've really enjoyed and celebrated our CLG status.  We have not really had the capacity and staffing  to maximize the benefits.  We've been mostly doing reporting on an annual basis,  but it does provide us opportunities to do some things  that our General Plan asks us to do,  update our historic resources inventory,  so funding is available.  But we have not utilized that status generally speaking.  Well, I think we used it once on a Mills Act.  And we can still do that without that status.  I think, you know, there are things that we do still to protect.  You know, we have the framework that our General Plan  and the policies we have are still there to do the things  we want to do, preserve our older buildings and Mills Act  and things like that that we utilize.  So I don't think we're leaving anything out there,  but we just were letting you know that's one feature of this  if you gave us direction to have the Planning Commission  to absorb the responsibility  of the Architects Review Historic Preservation Board,  this is a nuance, but we can manage it  if you give us that guidance.  All right.  Sounds good.  So why don't we take public comment now and then we'll go  to either further questions by Council members  or Council discussion after on each individual item.  So we have 11 speakers.  Okay, three members.  All right.  And if you could go ahead and the first two,  go ahead and head to the center aisle.  Kim Knott followed by Nicole Nava.  Yeah, hi.  I just had a couple of comments about the selection process.  And I'm no expert at this at all and I haven't been versed in it,  but it seems to me that maybe we shouldn't have active realtors  on the Planning Commission.  I think that there's a real room for conflict there.  And I think there are active, at least one active realtor  who has been nominated to planning.  I just give, I think that gives them an advantage  that they shouldn't particularly have.  And then also, I don't know that these should go  to anything other, these appointments should go  to anything other than technical people, technocrats, if you may,  who have a real knowledge.  But I think that's the general knowledge of the subject.  And it shouldn't just be a political payoff for something  or other, someone who may have lost a recent election.  And so that's just what I've got to say.  Thank you.  And Nicole Nava, you pulled your card correct.  Okay. Thank you.  Vivian Connery followed by Eric Nilsen.  Thank you.  Hello. I'm Vivian Connery.  I'm a freshman at high school.  And I was just wanting to talk about the change in frequency  of the environment, or Climate Activism Commission,  or Climate Action Commission, sorry.  My family owns a cabin in the mountains.  I grew up in the town of Butte Meadows, Jonesville.  A cabin that was hand built by my father and grandfather.  For my entire life, I've loved playing  in the surrounding forest and streams.  It's my special place.  Unfortunately, the area around it has become increasingly plagued  by wildfires, so much that the fire season has become a time  of constant anxiety for me.  And this is not just something that I've made up.  CalDAP predicts that by the end of the century,  there will be a yearly average of 63 hectares burned  by wildfires in Butte Meadows.  Over 48,000.  And that's more than in years past.  This dramatic increase is directly linked  to human-caused climate change  and leaves me even more worried for the years to come.  I know that I'm not the only one here who has a place or hobby  that faces devastating impacts due to climate change.  To me and to all the others who face these challenges,  climate change is not a small inconvenience to be dismissed.  We can see it as it truly is, an immense problem  that requires the utmost focus.  For you to minimize the amount  of time the Climate Action Commission has  to spend on protecting our environment,  it would be like saying that our places, hobbies,  our very futures do not deserve to be protected.  So please consider wisely.  Thank you for your time.  Thank you.  Eric Nelson followed by Justin Peen.  Good evening.  I recently learned that the City Council is considering reducing  Climate Action Commission meetings from monthly  to quarterly as well  as curtailing the Commissioner's ability to agendaize items for meetings.  I speak tonight both as a Board Member of the Butte and  Watermelon Council and as a citizen of this community.  Both actions, in my opinion, are short-sighted and misguided  for the following reasons.  One, the climate crisis is only going to intensify,  and without meaningful action on the local level everywhere,  it will intensify more quickly.  Two, the latest report on the Earth's loss of biodiversity,  that is the animals and plants that sustain us,  is a wake-up call and intimately connected to our well-being.  I'm very grateful to the City Council for their support  and support of the City Council's efforts  That loss is a result of reduction of natural habitat  and global warming.  This is, in part, why 8,500-plus citizens signed the referendum  in opposition to the Valley's Edge development,  one that will result in increases of carbon to the atmosphere  and loss of natural habitat for the creatures that help sustain us.  Three, previous climate models have predicted the increase  in the number of heat days our community will have to endure,  and given the present trends, they are only predicted to continue  to increase dramatically.  In addition, the City Council's commitment to the climate action  impacting public health from reduced water, frequency and intensity of wildfires, and air quality.  For the data on heat days and other climate change impacts on our community,  please refer to the 2018 Climate Change Vulnerability Assessment, City of Chico.  Now more than ever, we need informed and visionary governance  to help ensure greater resilience in a healthy, sustainable environment for our citizens.  The Climate Action Commission is a vital tool to provide you with the information and guidance  and strategy and solutions, not only to help us prepare for the challenges of the climate crisis,  but to build a healthy and resilient community for our children and many generations to follow.  I urge you not to reduce the Commission's meetings and responsibilities,  but to prioritize and increase support of their work for the long-term well-being of Chico and the surrounding area.  Thank you.  Thank you. Justin Penn, followed by Eric Chisler.  Sorry, I probably...  I scribbled. It's Justin Peake.  Oh, thank you. I wasn't sure.  I want to recognize how awesome this process is, and I appreciate the opportunity.  I'm here to comment on the proposal to increase the number of meetings by the Climate Action Commission  from one meeting a month to, like, four meetings a month.  I think that's what I understood you guys were doing.  Oh, it's not what you're doing?  Oh, it's the opposite. I'm sorry. I can't fathom that it would be the opposite.  Let me go on.  I have a quote.  There is still time to save the world's people from catastrophic consequences of pollution,  but time is running out.  Carbon dioxide is being added to the Earth's atmosphere by burning of coal, oil, and natural gas  at such a rate to cause marked changes in the climate.  This quote was by the president of the American Petroleum Institute  at the organization's annual meeting.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you. , thank you.  As I envision, the most optimistic vision of a Climate Action Commission is that we are trying to become more climate resilient.  And by limiting the number of meetings that we have is going to do the contrary.  So I hope that you use reason and logic and facts and you consider that we shouldn't be voting to reduce the number of meetings.  We should be voting to increase the number of meetings until we have a handle on the crisis.  And also, I just want to encourage you guys, you have an opportunity, you're in a position to make real change, positive change.  And I really don't see why you're not excited to or prioritizing to become a more climate resilient community and even go beyond that and maybe shoot for being, you know,  one of the most significant.  But I do think we're going to have to do a lot of work to make sure that we're not just sort of sought after cities in the northern state or even the state as far as being, you know, conservation, making conservation a priority.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Eric Chisler followed by Chelsea Barron.  Good evening.  Let me first say mea culpa for my ponderous and less than direct fashion.  This is perhaps unfortunately my way.  I can't help but consider a proposal from last night's internal affairs meeting to create a plan of action.  I think it's a great opportunity to create a quality of life commission and to be stopped in my tracks by the irony.  Quality of life.  Let's wonder aloud for a moment about what constitutes this thing we're calling life.  Let's consider the story that hangs in the balance between the adamantly proposed need for such a commission and the supposed irrelevancy of one considering our impact on the climate.  What does it say that the same force is insisting upon such a thing as a quality of life commission?  See no merit in a commission aimed at uplifting the by-laws.  It's a question of the biological systems which underwrite our capacity to breathe, drink, and eat.  The answer thankfully isn't hiding behind a bush waiting to pounce upon us unawares.  Life as conceived of by this arrangement is very simply put, us.  And by us I mean those of us already benefiting from the current economic arrangement.  Maybe I should say rather than us, some kind of royal me.  Those of us already benefiting from the foresight of those who came before us.  Those of us already benefiting from the foresight of those who came before us.  Or not.  But let's be honest, we mostly mean those of us already experiencing the upside of things.  Those of us who consider ourselves already on the receiving end of quality.  Which elucidates what is meant by quality.  The uninterrupted and unquestioned continuation of things working out for us.  What we mean by quality is our capacity to be comfortable in a deeply discomforting time.  An insistence that the upside continue unabated for the royal me.  That the troubles of the time appear elsewhere, out of sight of our enjoyment of what's working out for us.  That, my friends, is the perspective of adolescence unchallenged.  I think we can all agree that when we strip away the political fantasies, there is only one definition of life.  Everything that makes living possible.  And that in the face of this reality, quality of life means only one thing.  Working for a better day on behalf of what makes life possible.  And in that working for a better day on behalf of those yet to come.  Who will live in the wake of our enthroning the royal me.  The kids and the world are watching.  They are ready with the question, did you know what was happening?  And what then did you do?  We, my fellow citizens, are their fate.  What kind of fate will we be?  Thank you for your consideration.  Thank you.  Chelsea Baron.  Followed by Camberley Michael.  I remember being a student at Chico State and being proud of this town's accomplishments in climate action.  Now I'm saddened because I want to live in this town.  I want to be here for my future and yours.  As well as yours.  A climate action commission is supposed to act on the issues of climate change.  And I think it's time to help be part of work that I do.  California climate action core.  I'm a fellow.  I do environmental engagement across the state.  There's Oakland ones.  There's LA ones.  And there's Chico.  State ones.  Like me.  I don't want the commission to go from monthly meetings to quarterly meetings.  I still want more for our city for climate action.  They are reviewing urban forestry right now.  But next year it will help our city with climate action plan and the general plan.  An important part of living into our future.  The Commission and I still want climate action so we can meet our climate action goals for the city.  If people only meet when an item is brought up, they will never meet because they're not going to be any steps forward.  The Commission needs the ability to agendize items.  They need that ability because the City Council probably won't put them on there.  Not with enough votes.  I teach kids about climate action, K-12 in fact.  They get scared when I teach them about the urban forestry that isn't going to save them.  I teach them about the fires and I teach them about how we can diminish crown fires.  We set things on fire in front of them, they get scared because they're traumatized.  We don't do it to traumatize them.  We do it to teach them the importance of a forest.  Being mitigated, of a forest being helped.  We do this weekly.  Making the climate action a monthly meeting is the minimum.  They shouldn't be meeting monthly, they should be meeting weekly, daily even.  To their heart's content, agendizing items.  I don't know if that's allowed but they should at least be allowed to meet monthly, not quarterly.  And they should be able to agenda as items.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Kimberly Michael Green.  Followed by Genesis Espina.  Good evening, Council.  My name is Kim and I facilitate climate cafes here in Chico at the South Chico Community Assistance Center.  I do this monthly.  And climate cafe is a space for people to come and gather and talk about their thoughts and feelings around the climate crisis.  It was developed by the Climate Psychology Alliance.  And it might sound silly.  But when you know that the time to act is running out.  That we are already feeling the effects of a chaotic and unstable climate.  And we're already feeling the effects of extreme weather, wildfire, drought, flooding, and desertification in all the surrounding areas like Berry Creek.  Recognizing that climate change is already here.  It has a tendency to cause anxiety in any reasonable person.  Couple this with the knowledge of the complacency of our institutions.  And you get feelings of betrayal.  By knowing that we are in a climate crisis and acting as if we're not.  Institutions are betraying the people's best interests.  To even consider deprioritizing or defunding the Climate Action Commission is a perfect example of this institutional betrayal.  I'm not a climate activist.  I'm a human rights activist.  And I respect that attitude of everyone around me.  The very institution's we rely on to act in our best interests are actively betraying young folks, marginalized groups and future generations and it's not just our future.  It's our dreams, it's other species, it's ecosystems, it's also our economy and our stability and our community.  And it's not just our future.  And it's not just our future.  And it's not just our future.  And it's not just our future.  And it's not just our future.  And it's not just our future.  And it's not just our future.  And it's not just our future.  And it's not just our future.  climate action plan and have the ability to agendize items in the City Council.  And in the spirit of the Red Cross, right, which you talked about in the beginning of  this meeting, let's do the noble work of taking climate change seriously to preserve the future  for all of us instead of just turning a blind eye to an ongoing crisis.  Our goal is to reach carbon neutrality by 2045. If the Climate Action Commission doesn't have  items to talk about at their meetings, then maybe someone's not doing their job.  We should be thinking about this all the time, every day. Climate change is  the most pressing issue of our time. Thank you.  Thank you. Genesis Ospina.  Followed by Emily Einspar.  I believe two of the most valuable things Chico has are its parks and its agriculture.  The climate crisis is real, and over the last few years, we have all been affected by it in many  ways. Fires, droughts, and failed crops, just to name a few. I believe it would be a very  irresponsible decision to minimize the number of meetings with the current reality we are facing.  I am also very disappointed by the fact that the Council does not consider the climate crisis a priority.  I believe it is all of your responsibility to take these issues seriously. I urge you to educate  yourselves on the issue and become more proactive. With proper planning and restoration projects,  we can still save ourselves. The people of Chico deserve a Council who actively works with its  people to protect them from current climate dangers. If this is something you have shut  yourselves out of because you are scared or overwhelmed by it, I invite you to join us at the next meeting.  We are excited to welcome you to the next Climate Cafe where you can talk about these issues and we can work together.  Thank you.  Thank you. Emily Einspar followed by Katie Posey.  Hello. I'm here to speak regarding the Climate Action Commission meetings being changed from monthly to quarterly.  My name is Emily Einspar. I'm a Chico State graduate from the field of anthropology.  I've been in numerous grassroots organizations in Chico promoting climate awareness and food sovereignty.  I was a part of the Valley's Edge referendum and have had the privilege of being a part of the Climate Cafe  is where I get to see firsthand how climate anxiety affects our community.  The Climate Action Commission advises Council on members concerning climate action, adaptation, and resiliency.  The committee serves as a voice for Chico's community grievances about the Climate Action Plan  and keeps Council's decisions in accordance to community concerns.  Changing the meeting to quarterly would not do justice to the climate crisis.  It would only reduce the urgency and importance of the climate crisis and its efforts in Chico.  I do not need to remind everyone that we are on a ticking time clock when it comes to climate action.  There is always new information, efforts, and steps being taken by community members.  And in short, there is always more work to do and more things to talk about.  So I urge the Council to continue to keep the Climate Action Commission meetings to at least once monthly.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Our last speaker is Katie Posey.  Thank you.  Good evening, Council.  I just wanted to say something about item two that is about changing the system for commission members' agendizing items.  And I appreciated the presentation.  And so I'm just going to share a couple questions I had because I understand the motivation behind doing that.  I did wonder.  And you might not want to share this.  Which commissions, was it across all commissions that there were a high number of items being agendized?  One thing I thought about is I just was concerned we don't want to go from one extreme to the other.  So I understand you don't want to have nine agenda items that are brought by commission members that end up not being relevant.  But then we don't want to limit commissioners that have expertise and knowledge in certain areas, those items getting on.  Now, I understand you want to go to the system.  But I just wondered if you could talk about the system of commissioners would contact council members.  So I just wonder, though, because some commissioners will have been nominated by certain council members, would they go to that specific person?  And then those that were voted on maybe not by a specific one, who would they go to?  Because I know you all are busy.  And so you might not get back on e-mails.  So I just wonder if it might create more work.  One thing I was thinking about is, for example, the arts commission.  So one of the roles of the arts commission is to make recommendations regarding the marketing of Chico as an arts and culture destination.  So it seems that members of the commission might have unique ideas about that.  So I understand that they can then approach a council member.  Again, my concern is would the new system create more work and potentially be more drawn out?  And, yeah, I just was wondering if maybe a better route might have been a system for considering the rights of the commissioners.  I know that there's a lot of work that needs to be done.  But I'm just wondering if there's a way that the commissioners can then approach the commissioners and ask them to consider the work and urgency of the request that are made.  And then when a member of a commission might request a matter to be agendized, could the chair and the staff member consider the validity within the approved scope of work and urgency of that request before asking the commission to consider it for discussion?  So those are just a couple ideas.  And I believe that supportive relationships with council and city staff are the foundation of this successful opportunity.  But I don't think we're going to have a collaboration of any commission.  So I'd like to see that relationship continue to be strengthened and improved.  Thank you.  Thank you.  That was our last speaker.  All right.  Thank you, everybody.  If my colleagues will entertain it, I'd like to take these in the same order and go one by one here.  But we might need to amalgamate a few of them.  Let's start with any further questions on any of the three.  Some of the speakers may have insisted.  I'm going to take a few questions.  I'm going to take a few questions.  I'll open with a motion just to make it easy.  Okay.  So, Mr. Bay, you're not going to go by commission, which is what council member Bennett wanted to do, which I actually think would be confusing.  But you're going to go by item 123 as to city clerk Kasset and the action?  Correct.  Ideally.  Okay.  So, I'm going to take item 123 and make an opening motion on number one.  Okay.  We also have the matter of the APP 10-1, which is a separate issue, I believe.  Yeah, that's item number two.  It's number two.  Thanks for pointing that out to me.  Well, you know you're not very experienced at this.  Okay.  So, we're just going to take them one, two, three as they're listed.  I think for clarity that will be the most.  Okay.  So, I'm going to take the city clerk's number.  Yeah.  What a good idea.  So, my motion, the first one would be to make the motion that the Bidwell Park and Playground Commission change or stay whatever it is at once a month or as needed.  If it needed to be more than that.  And the Climate Action Commission be moved to as needed.  That's my first motion.  I'll second that.  All right.  I'm going to ask my question now, too.  So, Mr. Vick, could you, because you're probably one of the most schooled people on this, tell me, the Climate Action Commission, what is their actual duty that they need to perform?  I know they have a list of, you know, we heard plenty of lists of duties that they could perform, but they do actually have duties that they have to perform.  Key duties include prepare and recommend adoption of the Climate Action Plan.  Which they did.  Those were a very busy year and a half.  And then again, monitoring and measuring the success of the implementation of the cap.  Okay.  And then also advising the council on matters related to climate action, climate resiliency.  So, there are times where they're busier and there's times when they're less busy, to my feeling.  There will be a plug of general plan amendments coming up required by the state addressing the safety element that we need to implement.  And then, you know, the other thing that I would say is that, you know, if there's a lot of activity that needs to be done to incorporate about adaptation and resiliency, they might need to have back-to-back meetings.  You know, conversations, discussions.  There will be times of the year when there are a number of actions that are moving forward that are in the Climate Action Plan.  And those plug of activities could be two or three could be scheduled for one meeting and it would be a more robust meeting.  Sometimes they have the monthly meetings and there's an item that's, you know, 45 minutes to an hour.  So, again, when people suggest that the frequency of the meetings directly correlates to climate action in our community, I don't know that there's that direct correlation.  But there is a correlation to having items get to them and having informative and more robust meetings.  And then there is annual monitoring.  And then there may be a time where we need to, per our Climate Action Plan, update our Climate Action Plan based on that monitoring.  So, it would get busy again.  So, I'm happy to go with the direction that you're taking.  I'm happy to go with the direction of Council.  I'm happy quarterly and as needed or just as needed.  I feel that we will...  I was just trying to detail out their duties because I think there's a, you know, certainly people who, you know, truly care about the environment and believe, you know, that we need to do more on a daily basis could advocate for obviously having a Climate Action Committee that meets every single day.  But this committee actually has duties.  And those duties are assigned by the Council.  And those duties are assigned by various laws of the books.  And they actually have things that they need to get through.  And that's just the point that I was trying to emphasize.  And by the code that created them.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, all of which would be covered by meeting as necessary.  Yes.  Well, I'm not...  I'm just asking the question to get the facts in front of us because I know a lot of folks out there had concerns that they maybe were doing something against the environment by doing this.  But, you know, if I can pontificate for a second is...  You did.  Huh?  I'm allowed.  Just a minute or two.  You know, the City of Chico is actually, if you look at even just the last 10-year history between conservative councils and liberal councils, has done more to put us ahead of our neighboring cities on the environment than any other city in the North State.  So, and I mean, I can say that almost without...  With absolute certainty.  Without any doubt.  You know, I could have Mr. Gufferson speak for hours and I would love it because I love hearing about all the programs that the city's instituted to make our city a greener place and more carbon neutral.  So, I think it's commendable what our staff has done and how this community's functioning.  Not to mention the number of green businesses that we have locally.  So, I don't think anybody should doubt the fact that this city and both as a whole and as a government has...  Ever disregarded the climate or, you know, moving forward in that respect.  So, I'm sure some people would disagree with me, but if you look around in the other cities, we are certainly a leader in the region and the North State.  Mr. Mayor, I think that's great to emphasize the amount of progress that we've made in Chico across different councils and the Climate Action Commission is evidence of that progress.  The fact that we have a standing body that meets regularly in order to discuss these things as they arise.  In order to discuss new initiatives.  That might arise from the Commission.  Like we had one commissioner who was interested in electrification.  Was able to connect with a group out of Tehama County in order to forward that.  As the climate crisis develops and as changes to state law come into effect, we're going to see even more responsibilities than Mr. Veek outlined come up for the Commission.  In response to the motion that's on the floor, could I ask Ms. Preston?  Do we have any other commissions or boards that meet only as needed?  Don't have any standing, like regular meeting schedule?  No, this would be the first one, but the Council did consider that for the Bidwell Park and Playground.  They kept at it monthly.  I think, I hope it's evident what I meant by demoralizing.  That taking an action to de-emphasize the Climate Action Commission beneath any other commissions in the city is going to be rightfully looked upon by all sorts of people who might be interested in that.  Might be looking at Chico or might live in Chico.  Might seek to live in Chico as Chico de-emphasizing climate action.  And that would be an action of a new council to back step on what the previous council did.  And so I'm certainly going to oppose the motion.  I'd like to offer a substitute motion that we meet quarterly or as needed.  Which is a slight difference and given the amount of responsibilities that Mr. Veek outlined, I think it probably wouldn't practically lead to any change in the number of meetings that are going on.  So what was the motion?  The substitute motion would be to meet both quarterly and as needed.  So we would have standing quarterly meetings and then additional meetings could be called as the need arises.  Okay.  So my answer to your substitute motion is it's false logic to assume that when the Climate Action Committee meets or any of our commissions meet that anything is actually done.  That's number one.  Number two is it is not the point of any commission or committee to create any kind of moral anything for anybody.  And if we're creating commissions, we're creating them.  If we're creating commissions to keep people from being demoralized, we're doing something else entirely.  On top of that, every time we have a commission meeting, we're taking up staff time, we're prioritizing budgets, we're moving away from what our priorities really are.  So to say we should continue to have a commission so we do not demoralize the people that might be on it makes absolutely no sense.  Having said that, I will call the question and let's deal with it.  Oh, he needs a second for a substitute motion.  Do I have a second on the substitute motion?  Yes.  Okay.  And I will call the question on my original motion.  Madam Clerk, you can take your order.  Okay.  And so the motion was made by Councilmember Morgan, seconded by Vice Mayor Reynolds to proceed on the frequency of meetings for the BPPC, which would remain monthly or as needed, and then the Climate Action Commission would move to as needed, to an add needed basis.  Just a moment.  Let me save that.  Councilmember Bennett?  Yes.  Councilmember Morgan?  Yes.  Councilmember Tandon?  Yes.  Councilmember Van Overbeck?  Yes.  Councilmember Winslow?  No.  Vice Mayor Reynolds?  Yes.  And I'm going to say as needed because it allows you to actually still meet monthly if needed versus quarterly.  So, yes.  Thank you.  Mayor Coolidge?  I'll second that sentiment with the aye.  Okay.  Carries 6-1.  All right.  So, second question.  Review and approve program.  I'm sorry.  Proposed revisions APMP 10-1 regarding the ability of the commission to agendize on the item.  Council discussion.  Move to approve the proposed revisions.  Second.  All right.  We have a motion by Councilmember Morgan and seconded by Councilmember Bennett.  Do we have any further discussion on this side?  Yeah.  Can I just say that I think that the issue here of having too many things agendized for  commissions.  Sort of the flip side of having commissions that are meeting and not having enough to  do.  I think it might be an issue in some particular cases.  You know, you've mentioned, Mr. President, that certain commissions have or are asking  for discussions that are outside their own responsibilities.  I would suggest that we could find a way to rule out the certain cases and they don't  have the responsibilities without the City Council here interfering in the work of the  commissions.  When we have, we select people for these commissions because they may have expertise that they're  not interested in.  And we have a lot of issues that we don't hear.  So I don't think filtering any requests through the City Council is an appropriate way to  arrange the work that we have.  So I'm not going to support the motion.  So it's my understanding that, correct me if I'm wrong, Madam City Clerk, that a member  of the staff could agendize as well as the Council.  And if a member of a commission can't convince someone on the staff or someone on the Council  to support it, it's probably not a good idea.  So the work of each commission.  I think that's a good question.  But I think the work of each commission is really brought forward by staff.  And it's based on the city's priorities and the Council's direction and policies.  So if you implement a policy that affects the Bidwell Park and Playground Commission,  you're going to refer that to them for review.  It isn't about limiting them in curtailing what their thoughts are.  But as you'll recall, I mentioned that for this body who are, every one of you are elected  to serve this community.  And yet you can't get your items on unless you get Council members.  So you have to get Council approval to agendize those items.  And sometimes they get agendized.  Sometimes they don't because that may not be the priority of the majority of the Council.  So you have commissions that can put things on that they may not have, there may be a  disconnect as to what this Council's doing here in providing the direction.  And you're telling staff, we want you to accomplish this this year because we're approving your  budget that puts and implements these activities.  Yet you've got commissioners that have almost a better ability to agendize items than you do.  And that was why I brought that forward.  It isn't about curtailing their enthusiasm or their opportunity to bring in new ideas.  It really is to have it be, they can talk to staff and if staff thinks that that's a great idea  and that it could be something that could be incorporated in, I think that's fine if staff knew that it fit the priority.  And so I think that that was the intention.  It wasn't to silence them.  It was to encourage that more robust discussions at commission meetings that are in alignment with the City Council's priorities.  I'm sorry.  Short way of saying that is the tail is wagging the dog right now.  Well, yes.  I think this proposal is a huge step forward in making these commissions and boards more efficient.  And I'd like to say that.  I'd like to make a motion to.  We already have a motion.  We already did.  Yes.  And a motion and a second.  I made it while you weren't paying attention.  I just want to clarify that in order to have something agendized in a commission meeting,  currently the process is they have to convince a majority of their fellow commission members who are appointed by us  because they have certain expertise in these things.  And some of the mandates of these commissions, like the Climate Action Commission, as we just heard,  is to advise the Council on certain matters.  So how are they going to advise the Council on things by first asking the Council on what they could advise us for?  I feel like the whole tail wagging the dog thing is like the tail is there for a reason, right?  It helps balance.  It detects things that the rest of the dog doesn't understand.  I think that's probably a better structure for a dog.  That's why tails exist.  Some people cut the tails off.  That's not for a biological reason, though.  I feel like that is human interference in a way.  You're digressing.  You can definitely get rid of the humans.  Metaphors are dangerous.  Point of order.  We're not talking about dogs.  So if I could just quickly address that.  Because I just want you to understand that we once had a sustainability task force that had 16 members.  I used to staff that.  It morphed over time.  It became seven members.  It then went away.  It was supposed to sunset in 2015.  The Council at that time felt that it was critical to retain it.  So you can go back.  And it's morphed as time and as the needs changed.  And that's what every Council does when they come in.  They look at the priorities and they look at the needs of the community.  That's why we have a sustainability element in the general plan.  That's why there's all kinds of criteria.  That's why there's plans that the Public Works Director is implementing for his shop so that we can have a positive impact.  So it isn't about diminishing the value of climate action.  Or any of those concerns.  It's about making sure that those meetings are productive.  And I can tell you that if there is something that needs to be reviewed, staff's going to take that.  There's legislation coming down the pike.  Brendan's going to call for a Climate Action Commission.  And it's based on an immediate need and input that needs to be provided onto the Council possibly.  So, I mean, that's how I envision it.  Call the question again.  We have a motion and a second.  Okay.  And that was to implement the APMP modification on Council, excuse me, on Commissioner request.  Correct.  Council Member Bennett.  Yes.  Council Member Morgan.  Yes.  Council Member Tandon.  Yes.  Council Member Van Overbeck.  Yes.  Council Member Winslow.  No.  Vice Mayor Reynolds.  Yes.  Mayor Coolidge.  So, I would have rather have done this in regular discussion, but the question was called.  So, I don't like it.  I don't like it.  I don't think I can get a lot more questions asked by colleagues.  So, unfortunately, I'm going to vote no.  Okay.  It carries 5-2.  So, on item 3, Madam Clerk, I'm going to say this wrong, but my direction would be to  roll the ARHPB finally into the Planning Commission, which we have tried to do for 12 years.  no longer will we have a commission talking about the hue of a color of a building downtown.  And it's yellow.  That is my motion.  I realize, Mr. Beg and Madam Clerk, that there will be items that have to be worked out  on how we get the proper amount of commissioners with the proper credentials,  but I don't think that's going to be insurmountable.  May I finish talking before you second my motion, sir?  Yes.  May I speak to this, or is it over?  Pardon?  May I speak to this?  Yes, please.  And you know exactly what I'm going to say, but I'm going to say it anyhow,  because I think it's important.  Do you agree with me?  No, I don't.  Respectfully.  I am the only councillor sitting here  that was on the architecture  review and historic preservation board,  was in charge of it twice, actually, twice.  I'm the only councillor that was on the planning commission.  So I have a good, strong familiarity with the process,  with perhaps some of the complications that arise from time to time,  and that's going to happen regardless of how we structure anything.  There's going to be problems.  There's going to be hiccups.  There's going to be a bump in the road.  And that's just the way life is.  So my belief is that the two functions of the architectural review  and historic preservation board,  I'm just going to say architectural review, short of it,  and the planning commission are very distinct and separate.  One is land use decisions,  and one is an architectural review for the purposes of,  of,  of,  of building the city of Chico.  And I would say impacting the city of Chico  by producing a better product, a better visual product of a building.  And that happens quite often.  It has happened for many years.  There are architects, there are developers in Chico  that don't enjoy the process.  But there's also those folks that come to the city of Chico requesting a permit,  requesting a placement, requesting placement, requesting placement, requesting placement,  approval, the final finding that this application is complete, and there  are discussions with planning staff that evolve around this is probably going to  be a problem and you should reconsider it and maybe improve it because it's  going to be reviewed by a separate board of your peers. I'm going to say that  again, the separate board of your peers, citizens of Chico, which are going to  look at this project and make a determination about some aspects of it  to try and improve it. That's always been the course, that's always been the  objective is to improve it, to make it a better project so the City of Chico has  a better appearance, very simply. The recruitment of individuals that have the  expertise, the talent, the ability to both  make land use decisions as well as architectural decisions, I think it's  going to be problematic. I think it's going to be very, very challenging because I  don't think there are a lot of people out there that maybe have the interest.  We're talking about recruitment, so they may have an interest in planning or  interest in architectural review, but probably, I'm going to just jump out,  probably not both. They're going to be more focused. So finding those folks, and  we're talking about probably two or three,  that would be on planning but also make the decisions about architectural review,  I believe that's going to be challenging knowing that I sat on these boards, I  know the people, I know their personality, I know how they think, and I see two  separate ideas going on within them. Would it be beneficial? Of course, there  are  benefits to the process which have been brought out, perhaps streamlining, saving  some fees, but I'm also concerned about the unintended consequences of this  action and perhaps some problems down the road. Can we go back and change it?  Sure. We can always go back and change it so that nothing's going to be set  in stone, but I'd rather keep  the situation, this configuration as it is, I don't think it's broken. Say again, I do  understand there are complications from time to time, but it's not broken, so let's not  try and fix something that's not broken. I would really enjoy the decision that we keep  the architectural review board and planning commission separate and distinct due to the  fact that they do deal with very, very complex issues. I think that's a very important part.  Any other questions?  Any other questions?  find that a project is consistent with the general plan,  meets all of our goals, does everything we want  have happen and then the ARHPB finds that like  an affordable housing project is too tall or something.  It's sort of in contrast to other general plan policies.  I'm only,  I just wanna throw out a little idea  and maybe it's just doesn't make sense at all,  but for BCAG, Butte County Association of Governments,  they meet and then the Air Quality Management District  meets just afterwards,  cause there's a lot of crossover.  And the one, one of the minuses,  in addition to everything Council Member Bennett just said  of this action that I was thinking is right now  we have 12 experienced volunteers  and now we're gonna go down to having just five.  And I wonder if we could compress seven.  Well, yeah, yeah, sorry, you're right, seven.  I'm wondering if we could hold the meetings  whenever they are required to have two  in one single meeting date  and whether that would address some of the issues  of the  inefficiency of holding two separate hearings.  Does that make sense?  Retain two separate boards,  but have, make sure that the dates of the hearings  are the same day, whenever possible.  So I have a question for the city manager.  So if you go out here and you look at the square,  you look at the post office,  which is a stunning building and the old city hall,  and you look at the Breslauer building,  the Solarstein building,  what was the structure of the architectural review,  the committee at the time those buildings were built?  Probably did not exist.  Exactly, thank you.  I think he was there, he was there.  All right, yes, you did.  Council member Bimmit?  No.  Council member Morgan?  No.  Council member Tandon?  No.  No.  Council member Van Overbeck?  Yes.  Council member Winslow?  No.  Vice mayor Reynolds?  Yes.  Mayor Coolidge?  Aye.  Carries four, three,  and that will require a code amendment  and we'll be bringing that back after we work it all out.  That concludes this item, we'll take a break.  Be back in a minute. [inaudible] [inaudible]  Thanks everyone.  Thanks everyone.  Thanks everyone.  Thanks everyone.  Thanks everyone.  All right.  We will reconvene.  Item 5.2, appointment of members to the Arts Commission,  Bidwell Park and Playground Commission and Planning Commission.  And we will turn it over once again to City Clerk Deborah Crest.  Thank you, Mayor Coolidge.  And Council.  So we held the interviews a couple meetings ago,  or actually the last meeting.  I'm sorry.  I might be talked out.  So I'm going to spare you on this one.  So the nomination process is that the incoming Council members  who were selected in the last election actually make nominations.  Council discusses those.  And if they agree with those nominees,  then we need an actual formal vote,  which,  is a majority vote to actually confirm them.  The charter is specific that all board and commission members  are appointed by a majority vote of the Council.  So individual nominations are just you interviewed everybody,  you then selected from the applicants,  and you make a nomination.  And now the Council gets to discuss those nominees.  So for the Arts Commission, we have four spots,  but the first three, we'll deal with that first.  We have three four-year terms that are up this time.  And Council Member Van Overbeck selected Vianna Boreen.  Council Member Winslow selected Bonnie Pipkin.  And Vice Mayor Reynolds nominated Katie Posey.  I will talk a little bit in just a second  on the fourth position is a vacancy due  to an unscheduled departure from the Arts Commission.  And that has two years remaining.  And I will tell you that, you know,  on all the Chiefs that were turned in,  Gina Bax received five nominations to move forward  by the full Council to carry on into that two-year position.  So if that is something that the Council is agreeable to,  then we would have a vote on that separately.  So right now, I'd like to just open it up  for the three nominees for the Arts Commission.  If the Council members who nominated them want  to say anything, or if the Council members want  to ask questions, I will tell you that in the past,  there have been moments when Council members did not go along  with the nominee and actually voted against it.  And so it can or cannot, it can happen.  It doesn't happen very often.  But it's an opportunity for the body, at least for a majority  of the Council members, to confirm the individual nominations.  So again, for the Arts Commission,  for the three four-year terms.  I'm sorry, what?  Okay. We have one speaker.  Yeah.  So anyway, if you want to take that speaker first  and then have the discussion, that's fine.  Yeah, let's do that.  Okay.  So we have one speaker on the entire subject?  Yes.  Okay. Let's hear from her.  Kim Knott.  Why isn't there anything to do with the Arts Commission?  Okay.  Well, any of the commissions?  Are any of the commissions?  Is that, did you have comments for?  Arts Commission, the parks and playground planning commission,  appointees.  Right. It's all lumped together.  We're just dealing with arts right now.  Okay. So we all remember these names, I think.  Monica McDaniels, Jessica Giannola, Morgan Kennedy.  They were losers in the last election.  Okay.  And, but I don't really hear much about them anymore.  I think they've just gone on with their lives.  And that's the way, that's the way they just rolled out of there.  But the fourth losing candidate, almost on a daily basis,  is attacking her opponent who was victorious.  We're talking about Nicole Nava.  Point of order.  I don't think we're supposed to use some people in the audience or on the dais.  No personal attacks, please.  If you want to refer to a member of the public generically, you can do that,  but not any particular individual.  Okay. Now, aren't we allowed to comment on the people who?  You can.  We really don't want you standing at the dais attacking an individual from the community.  As you can see, you certainly want not the speaker following you to attack you.  Well, that just happened.  Well, they can attack what you say, certainly.  Okay.  So you can reference what she says, but not her personally.  There's a certain person who ran against Addison Winslow,  who won't go away gracefully,  doesn't have the demeanor or grace to be in a commission in this city.  Now, Save Chico won seven of eight elections in the last two cycles,  and this was the only one who lost.  She lost for a reason.  It was her temperament.  It's not—  How is this not still a personal attack?  Yeah.  If you can just—  Well, when are we allowed to—we're never allowed to comment on nominations?  Uh—  You can certainly speak to an individual not being qualified,  but in terms of saying they're not graceful—  Or you don't like their temperament?  Or you don't like their temperament.  That's—  You're appointing them to a board.  Isn't that a qualification?  Temperament?  Tom Van Orbeck's up here.  Now, now.  So—  Wait up over no personal attacks, Mr. Morgan.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'll be consistent.  Yeah, let—  So what am I allowed to say?  Mr. Mayor, can I handle this?  No.  No.  Let me do this.  So generally, if you're going to make an attack about somebody,  it's their position with the city.  So for example, if you wanted to attack me,  you can berate my decisions all day long.  If you want to say that, you know, my business is stupid and you hate it,  that's really, you know—  And what I do professionally is terrible, then no, you can't do that.  So there's a fine line between the personal attack and their position with the city.  If you say that one of these nominees, and even name the nominee,  doesn't have the temperament to perform the job,  that probably falls under the bounds of being okay.  If you want to, you know—  Isn't that what I just got admonished by Sean about?  No, I know, but if you want to totally berate them as a human being, then no.  Say they're unqualified, say they're not fit for the job, that's fine.  They are applying for a public post.  I think that the past comportment is a good indicator of—  And we can restart the clock, too.  Oh, it's restarted.  No, it's not ticking.  I was trying to—  Okay.  All right, go ahead.  Anyway, I think I've made my point that there are people who have gracefully comported themselves,  and this is someone who I think doesn't particularly do that,  and I think that this is a political appointee.  It's a—  It's a—  And I don't think that she has any particular qualification in this sort of—  in running parks and all that.  Now, I'm under no illusion that you're going to vote her down,  but I think that it should be known that this is the type of person she is.  All right, thank you.  He was our only speaker.  Oh, okay.  So—  So we are back to the Arts Commission.  There are three nominees,  Vianna Boring,  Bonnie Pipkin,  and Katie Posey.  And if the council wants to discuss those,  they can.  Discussion?  So my question is,  are you going to be asking us to vote?  I think I lost track of this one.  Are you going to ask us to vote  on all three at once or individually?  I can do it however you would like to do it.  We can do it.  That's why I'm asking if there's a conversation  or a discussion,  because I would take them as a group,  but I can do however you would like.  If you'd like them broken out individually.  We usually do this as a group.  Do we not?  Do it as a group.  Okay.  If anyone wants to pull an individual name out,  they're more than welcome.  Okay.  Thank you.  So as a group,  each individual commission.  Okay.  So we are on the Arts Commission,  and I'm open to the...  So I can move to approve all three nominations?  Yes.  And you're...  Just...  Was there a second?  Yes.  Okay.  All right.  Council Member Bennett.  Yes.  Council Member Morgan.  Yes.  Council Member Tandon.  Yes.  Council Member Van Overbeck.  Yes.  Council Member Winslow.  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds.  Aye.  Mayor Cooley.  Aye.  Carries 7-0.  So that's the three.  Then we had one at large that had to be selected.  You have Gina Bax,  who received five votes for our nominations.  Would the council like to confirm that?  And if so,  if someone can make a motion to do that.  I'll go for Gina.  Second.  I have a motion from Vice Mayor Reynolds,  and we'll give the second to Council Member Bennett.  Which one?  I'm sorry.  Council Member Bennett gets second.  Okay.  Thank you.  I heard like three, so...  All right.  Council Member Bennett.  Yes.  Council Member Morgan.  No.  Council Member Tandon.  Yes.  Council Member Van Overbeck.  Yes.  Council Member Winslow.  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds.  Yes.  Mayor Coolidge.  Aye.  Mayor Coolidge.  Carries 6-1 to appoint Gina Bax to fill the...  to the two-year position.  All right.  And moving on to the next commission.  So the next commission is the Bidwell Park and Playground Commission.  And Council Member Van Overbeck selected John Blackley.  Council Member Winslow selected Rafael DeGenova.  And just as a reminder,  Rafael did not address the council at that meeting  because we didn't have him on our list.  And after some searching into our spam,  we found that he did have an application in,  and it did meet the deadline.  So that is the appointment by Council Member Winslow.  Vice Mayor Reynolds has selected Nicole Nava to serve,  and these are all three...  four-year terms.  And then I'll open it up for discussion,  if you would like.  All right.  Can I obtain a motion or further discussion?  I would like to suggest, and this is nothing personal,  but I'd like to suggest that Rafael DeGenova be replaced  with Jenny Shearer.  Okay.  All right.  So do you want to discuss that?  I'm going to modify that for a second.  Yeah, you got to make a motion.  The motion is to replace Rafael DeGenova,  got it there,  with an applicant, Jenny Shearer.  And that approves the whole plan?  With that change, yes.  Second.  Make a substitute motion to approve the nominees as listed.  Second.  Make a substitute motion to approve the nominees as listed.  So the substitute motion fails for like a second.  Madam Clerk.  Okay.  Let me get back to the original motion.  All right.  Council Member Bennett.  Yes.  Council Member Morgan.  Yes.  Council Member Tandon.  Yes.  Council Member Van Overbeck.  Yes.  Council Member Winslow.  No.  Vice Mayor Reynolds.  No.  Vice Mayor Winslow.  Vice Mayor Winslow.  I don't want to vote no on my own,  but I'm not comfortable with it.  Yes.  Mayor Coolidge.  No, because I don't agree with the change.  I thought we all deserve an appointment on a correct  consider.  OK.  Carries 5-2.  With a rivet.  Revision.  For lack of support of any of these individuals.  All right.  Planning Commission.  So on that one, we have Council Member Van Overbeck.  Hold on, Madam Clerk.  I do have a question on this.  So the consolidation of the Planning Commission and ARAHPB,  when would that come into effect?  Well, staff, we are going to work together.  We are going to work together on that.  And it may be the next round of applications when we select.  As Brendan mentioned, he would contact the licensing board  and let them know.  And we would work towards incorporating  those requirements in.  Sure.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  So Council Member Van Overbeck selected Mark Wolfe.  Council Member Winslow selected Margaret Scarpa.  And Vice Mayor Reynolds selected.  And Vice Mayor Reynolds selected Brandy Laffins.  And so I'll just let you discuss that or entertain a motion.  Move to approve the nominations as listed.  Seconded by.  A motion from.  I have a substitute motion.  Okay.  Hold on.  Motion from Council Member Winslow, second from Council Member Tandon.  Got it.  And then a substitute.  Yep.  Got it.  Council Member Morgan.  Place Margaret Scarpa with Bob Evans.  Move to approve.  Move to approve.  Bob, Mark, and Brandy.  Second.  I'll say that Margaret Scarpa is one of the most qualified people that we could possibly  find in the City of Chico, especially somebody in a younger age group, which is in short  supply on our commissions and for volunteers generally in the city.  Point of order.  We have a motion and a second.  Yeah, he's able to comment.  Motion and a second.  That's the rules.  He's able to comment.  Okay.  Thank you.  Thank you.  We'd have very, very little opportunity to have somebody who works for the Housing and  Community Development Department of the state overseeing important and changing policies  that we're having to deal with as a city.  She has years of experience working as a long-range planner for Yuba County.  She has worked for the City of Chico as a Civic Spark fellow in the Community Development  Department.  And has land use and planning certificate.  And a degree in geography planning from Chico State.  We would be very hard pressed to find anybody with those sort of qualifications, especially  in a younger age group.  I think she'd be fantastic on the commission and it would be quite an offense to I think  the majority of the community here to be replacing a nominee with somebody else with no stated  reason.  Further comment?  If not, I have some.  So, the question, Mr. Mayor.  Is if I wanted to make a replacement or an alternate person, can I do that now?  But we've already done the substitute motion.  Currently one substitute motion on the floor.  You can make another substitute motion.  You can have three substitute motions on the floor at a time.  Okay.  Okay.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Well, I'd like to make a substitute motion to, and this is not personal at all, but we  did hear from someone earlier.  We heard earlier about realtors being on the planning commission and maybe conflicts and  actually on the application there was a comment about possible conflicts of interest.  We just had a planning commission meeting last Thursday that ended up with six, not  seven folks and we did have a little complication with that.  So, I would like to, my motion is to replace Ms. Laffins with Ken Rensing who has a good  deal of experience, been on a planning commission before, an excellent mind, I think an excellent  decision maker.  So, that is my motion.  All right.  Does that leave, is your substitute motion a substitute motion of my motion or a substitute  motion of the original motion?  So, you, could you clarify?  Well, it's the latest one.  So, you take the most current substitute.  So, we, is there a second on that one?  On Council Member Bennett.  To replace.  I'm sorry.  To replace Brandy Laffins with Ken Rensing.  Well, we have to wait.  I may.  Okay.  You may.  And that would leave Wolf and Evans.  Because his substitute motion was a substitute of mine or is it a substitute of the original?  It was.  Yeah.  Who, so is yours, Mr. Bennett, is yours Markwith, Margaret and who did you say or is it the  one that Sean said?  I don't know.  My substitute motion was just to replace Miss Laffins with Ken Rensing, period.  Okay.  So, Markwith and Margaret Scarpa would also be part of your motion then, too?  No.  No.  So, then it would be a friendly amendment and then —  So, that would be — and then —  — and then —  — and then —  — and then —  — and then —  — and then —  — and then —  — and then —  on the second substitute motion.  Okay.  Hold on.  Was there a second?  Waiting to hear.  No.  So.  Okay.  So it died for a lack of a second.  I will make a third and final substitute motion,  and I would encourage my colleagues not to venture down this path  only for the reason that I believe that appointees are sacred to the person  except in extreme circumstances.  I would hate for the fortunes to be reversed and councils to do this.  We had this issue when, in fact, we didn't have direct appointments,  and the council as a whole made a decision of who sat on the boards,  and what we ended up with is a board completely slanted one direction or another.  And the whole reason why we did direct appointments is so that there would be more balanced boards.  So I would make a substitute motion for Mark Wolf, Margaret Scarpa,  and Brayden.  That's the original motion.  No, it was.  That's not?  Yeah, it is.  Is it?  So Margaret, okay.  So that's, that, that.  So can I substitute with the original motion?  No, you can't.  You cannot?  So that's out of order.  So we vote on my substitute motion.  All right.  We vote on Sean's substitute motion.  Just add one more point of discussion to this.  I think as you were alluding, Mr. Mayor,  that removing nominees as an act of political retaliation,  is something that is going to reverberate in the community in this process for a very long time.  All right.  Madam Clerk.  Okay.  Council Member Bennett.  Could you please repeat who is actually on the list for us to vote on, please?  It is Mark Wolf.  Hold on.  Let me get back to the motion.  It is Mark Wolf.  Mark Wolf.  Margaret Scarpa.  No?  Okay.  So.  Mark Wolf, Bob Evans, Brandi Laffin.  Bob Evans.  Yeah.  So actually my substitute motion to approve Mark Wolf, Margaret Scarpa, and Brandi Laffin.  Well, that was out of.  That's the original motion.  That was your motion.  You're right.  Okay.  Hey, it's.  Okay.  So.  It's getting a little confusing up here.  All right.  Go ahead.  All right.  So it's Mark Wolf, Bob Evans, and Margaret Scarpa.  Is that correct?  No.  No.  Brandi Laffin.  Yeah. Brandy Laffens. I pulled my substitute motion.  That's the first substitute motion.  You guys can't figure it out anyway.  Just go with the original one.  No, no, no.  It's Mark Wolf.  It's Brandi Laffin.  And it's Bob Evans.  That's the first substitute motion.  Correct.  Correct.  So.  And I happen to agree with that.  So I'm going to second the motion.  You just withdrew it if I can do that.  You can't.  You can't.  It's to make it work.  You can make the third.  No, you can't.  It's already been three substitutes.  Yeah, mine didn't count.  So.  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.  We have seven motions that we've just gone through.  Would someone like to make a new motion?  Okay, if we could.  And just confirm.  Please.  Because I have it as Mark Wolf, Bob Evans, and Brandi Laffin's now.  Is that correct?  And who made that motion?  Call the question.  Question's been called.  Was that what you were in motion?  Not my motion.  That was Sean's motion.  That was Sean's motion.  And then.  Okay.  Second.  Second.  Got it.  All right.  He tried to withdraw, but I don't think he withdrew.  He did withdraw his substitute motion.  We're back to the original motion.  He needs substitute motions on the successive motion, right?  Mr. City Attorney.  Okay.  I'm a parent.  So we had a withdrawal.  And they thought the planning commission meeting was bad.  Okay.  So we had a withdrawal of the motion.  Can we reinstate that?  Is it my call?  Is it?  The vehicle.  All right.  Let's take the substitute motion first.  And which one?  Mark Wolf, Bob Evans, Brandy Laffins.  Which is our move on my nominee.  Yes, it is.  Okay.  So Mark Wolf, Bob Evans, Brandy Laffins.  Motion by Morgan, seconded by Van Overbeck.  Is that correct?  Correct.  Got it.  Okay.  Council member Bennett.  Yes.  Council member Morgan.  Yes.  Council member Tandon.  No.  Council member Van Overbeck.  Yes.  Council member Winslow.  No.  Vice Mayor Reynolds.  Yes.  Yes.  No.  Mayor Coolidge.  No.  It fails 3-4.  All right.  I'll make a motion to approve Mark Wolf, Margaret Scarpa, and Brandy Laffins as.  You don't have to make a motion.  It's already on the floor.  No.  No, because it was.  It's okay.  So it's the three.  Revert back to the original motion.  You're right.  Okay.  Revert back to the original motion.  Sorry.  There's, you know, 12 motions there.  So we're.  So we're.  Revert back to.  To Addison's original motion.  Correct.  Yeah, I haven't had to do.  I haven't had to do three.  Who seconded Addison's motion?  Tandon.  Council member Tandon.  Council member Tandon.  All right.  And that's the existing current list.  Yes.  Okay.  Council member Bennett.  No.  Council member Morgan.  No.  Council member Tandon.  Yes.  Council member Van Overbeck.  Yes.  Council member Winslow.  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds.  Yes.  Mayor Coolidge.  Aye.  Carries 5-2.  Oh, wow.  I'd take another break.  No.  I'm kidding.  Kidding.  Please.  All right.  Substitute agenda item.  Item 5.3, consideration of approval of the supplemental apportionation budget modification number 2023, PWE-08.  And we have that.  Good evening, everyone.  Good evening, everyone.  Good evening, everyone.  Good evening, everyone.  Good evening, everyone.  Good evening, everyone.  Good evening, everyone.  Good evening, everyone.  Good evening, everyone.  Good evening, everyone.  Good evening, everyone.  and Director of Engineering.  I wanted to speak with you for a few minutes  about the supplemental budget amendment  that I've been working with finance,  and I've actually been working very closely  with operations and maintenance,  not just me, but my team and Eric and his team.  It's number 2023, PWE-008,  and it would budget Measure H funds for this fiscal year  and TDA-LTF funds.  The proposed scope of work for this supplemental  is to create two new CIP projects,  one that would be funded with $4 million of Measure H funds  for this fiscal year.  So as you may or may not know,  the Measure H tax, the 1% tax that was fortunately approved  by Chico-Wins in the last election,  starts on April 1st,  and we're going to have three months of that tax  being collected for this fiscal year.  So Engineering and O&M has been working very closely  on scoping.  We're doing some work that's shovel-ready  that can be done this summer,  and I just wanted to go through for a few minutes  what we recommend doing this summer.  We recommend taking $3.25 million of that Measure H funding  for 10 miles of slurry seal,  which would also include applying new pavement,  striping, and markings at the Amber Grove neighborhood,  Denali Drive to Eaton Road,  East Lassen Avenue from Esplanade to Floral Avenue,  East End of East,  and East Avenue from Cohasset to Manzanita.  We also recommend budgeting $750,000  for 0.2 miles of 3-inch grind and overlay  and applying new pavement, striping, and markings  on El Paso Way from East Lassen to El Verano,  which is right next to that work  that we would be doing on East Lassen.  Another part of this supplemental  is to move $515,000 from the Lower Park CIP  to create a new pavement,  striping, and markings at the Amber Grove neighborhood.  from the Upper Park CIP to the Wildwood Park Parking Area E  for another shovel-ready project that's 1.6 miles of cape sealing  and applying new pavement, striping, and marking.  And this would be Upper Park Road from the Wildwood Avenue roundabout  to Bidwell Park Parking Area E.  And I have a handy-dandy map.  I hope you can see this.  The Amber Grove neighborhood contains 5.9 miles of road  that are at a PCI of 70, and due for slurry sealing.  If we do not get on top of this slurry sealing  and do this work in the next year or two  or in the next foreseeable future,  these roads will drop down into poor condition.  Same with East Lassen Avenue.  PCI of 60, 2.2 miles.  El Paso is a PCI of 15,  so those are in good condition to slurry seal.  East Avenue from Cohasset to Manzanita  is a PCI of 15.  And then we have Upper Park Road.  That's a PCI of 68.  That's about 2.4 miles of work.  And that is also a good candidate for the slurring sealing  that we could do this summer.  Upper Park Road is a PCI of 60,  and that would be 1.6 miles of park.  The considerations that we took under advisement  when we were preparing and coming up with this list of work  was readiness for construction this year.  For example,  does the road have to be built?  Does the road have existing sewer and storm drain?  Does it have existing sidewalk curb and gutter where needed?  And minimal design required,  because whenever a design is required on right-of-way,  it's a one-to-three, possibly even five-year process,  considering if we have encroachments  or we have right-of-way acquisitions  or we have to move power poles  or we have to add utilities  and we have to do all that design work.  So these projects are shovel-ready construction.  And bid packages can be put together,  and we can be out to construction this summer  on these projects.  And another factor we considered was the need  to preserve the roads in good condition  before advanced deterioration sets in on these roads.  So we were looking at roads that had a PCI of 60 good,  70 very good.  And so I listed out the PCIs here  of the different roads that we're recommending for slurry seal.  They all have a PCI between 60 and 70.  So we're looking at roads that have a PCI of 60 good,  so they're good candidates for slurry sealing.  And another consideration we were thinking of  is minimizing the lifecycle cost for pavement.  It is very important to do slurry sealing work around the city  because it's much more cost-effective  than waiting for the roads to drop down into poor condition  and then having to do overlays and reconstructions,  which are much more expensive.  So I wanted to...  I pulled this from the 2022 PMP presentation  that I gave last year,  and I just wanted to show you kind of why we wanted  to pick these roads that are at a PCI of 60 or 70.  And if you can see from the curve here,  and you can see my arrow here,  you can see the first 75% of the life  or the first 15 years of the life  is pretty much a flat curve.  The deterioration...  There's not much deterioration in the road.  But as soon as the road hits about a PCI of 60 or 70,  you can see the curve starting to become vertical.  That's the...  That's the advanced deterioration stage of the road.  So we want to catch these roads  before they start going into advanced deterioration,  and then we have to do much more expensive overlays  and reconstructions on these roads.  So this is a typical pavement lifecycle curve  with slurry seal,  so it shows how we're catching the road at PCI 60 or 70,  returning it to excellent or 100,  PCI of 100, excellent condition,  and then allowing it to deteriorate  over the next 70, 10 years.  So we're preserving the life  and reducing the lifecycle costs of the road by doing this.  And so this chart shows the magnitude  of what I'm talking about here.  Slurry seals are about $260,000 per mile  for a road that has two lanes in either direction  and eight-foot shoulders on both sides.  And if you look at reconstruction costs,  they're about $2.6 million per mile.  So once you start getting up into overlays  and reconstructions,  you've either doubled, quadrupled,  or 10 times your price.  So it's really important that we get on these slurry seals  and get these done.  I also wanted to show the actual condition slides  for my 2022 presentation,  just in case anybody didn't remember.  Of course, this is excellent.  This doesn't require any work.  This is a very good condition road.  This is a candidate for slurry seal  either now or over the next 20 years.  In the next five years,  there's only one linear crack.  This, believe it or not,  it's in a PCI of 58,  is not a candidate for slurry seal.  So we have been receiving some letters  and some phone calls from people concerned  that we're doing these slurry seals  on better-conditioned roads  and their roads are in worse condition.  Unfortunately, the roads they're probably talking about  are roads that are already in poor condition  or they require design work  to bring them up to current standards.  So in summary,  this road right here is not a candidate for slurry seal  because it has too much alligator cracking on it  and all those cracks will just propagate up  through the surface of the sealant.  This road is also not a candidate for slurry seal  and requires design.  And same with this road.  So unfortunately,  it does appear to the public  that we are proposing to work on roads  that are already in good condition  and leaving the poor condition roads behind.  It's just that right now,  to get shovel-ready projects ready to go,  we're trying to focus on the slurry sealing  and next year we're going to be putting forward  a mix of various projects  that would address the poor condition,  fair condition, good condition roads.  So just to summarize our current...  And one other thing I wanted to point out  is this $4 million for Measure H  and this Upper Park Road project  that's part of this supplemental budget amendment  is in addition to the current pavement management plan,  we're also working on a road management program  that we are still...  O&M is still undertaking  and so is engineering.  So we do one annual road rehab project a year,  which is two to four miles  and approximately $2 to $3 million  using gas tax  and infrastructure replacement fund.  O&M does about 450 repairs per year,  500 tons of asphalt  and 11,000 pounds of crack sealer.  And the maintenance funding  is about $2.4 million per year  and the capital funding is about $2.6 million.  So the total from other funding,  not Measure H,  is about $5 million.  That is continuing.  And so just to give you a summary  of where we are  with the annual road rehab projects  that are funded with SB1 gas tax,  we finished Pine, Mulberry, Cypress this summer  or last summer, last fall.  And now we are in design...  We are in bidding for East Avenue  from Esplanade to Cohasset  that is due to be constructed this summer.  And then we're also already in design  for Rio Lindo Avenue.  And we plan for that to be in construction next summer.  And that's Rio Lindo from Cohasset Road to Esplanade.  And that's, again, still moving forward  even though we have this additional $4 million  that we're requesting for Measure H  for slurry seal.  And so this is a map showing the 2023 road rehab project.  That's for this summer,  East Avenue from Esplanade to Cohasset.  And so my recommendation is to improve  the supplemental appropriation,  which is for 3.25 million of Measure H  to slurry seal Amber Grove,  East Lassen, and East Avenue,  and 0.75 million of Measure H  to Brine and Overlay El Paso,  and 0.515 million of TDA LTF  moved from Lower Parker Road  to Upper Park Road to Cape Seal,  Upper Park Road.  And as I noted earlier,  we are going to be submitting a mix next year  of slurry, overlay, FDR,  and design to reconstruct poor condition roads.  So that concludes my presentation.  Does anybody have any questions?  All right, questions?  Council Member.  Yeah, so what is the cycle, design cycle,  if you have to redesign a road?  You know, roads in such poor condition,  that you have to take it down to the,  completely reconstruct it with the base rock and everything?  It just depends on all the factors on the road,  like do we need to move power poles,  do we need to add utilities,  do we need to add sidewalk curb and gutter?  It can be anywhere from a one to four or five year process,  depending on what factors are involved.  Okay, so where I'm going with this is,  I get your logic,  why you want to do it this way,  but it's going to be very hard to explain  to some constituents who live in the avenues  and some other places where the roads  are of really poor quality.  But you're saying that there's no way to address that  in this building season, by this summer,  no matter what we do, because of the design cycle?  No.  Okay.  Not the avenues.  The avenues is a three to five year design.  So what pavement condition is most of the avenues in?  I, it's probably the pavement.  But if it was in good condition,  you could do asphalt overlays.  Could you not?  If it was in good condition,  we could either slurry seal or overlay it.  But the problem is,  is design would still be required on the roads  to add curb gutter sidewalk and whatever else the community wants.  But you don't have to add curb gutter and sidewalk  unless you're doing a complete street.  If we do an overlay or greater,  state law does require us to build.  So even for overlays,  you have to do complete streets?  Yes.  Plus another component of consideration in the avenues  is there are a lot of areas that require storm drain additions  and there are some areas that have no storm drainage.  A lot of people there don't want storm drains too.  I found that out when I walked in,  which I never imagined.  But we have been putting,  we have been developing this year's four million  for Measure H,  and next year's request for Measure H,  and we have submitted for money for design  to get started on the avenues  and other neighborhoods as well.  Council Member Williams, what are you?  Being that within the avenues  and some of these other central neighborhoods,  like Chapman Town,  some of the roads are in better condition,  could we be applying slurry seal to some of these streets  as in this first project here  without requiring years of design?  We can,  right now,  we were trying to package up something  that we would get the best unit price on  that would be all close geographically together  and we found,  you know,  Cal Park,  areas in Cal Park and Amber Grove  were,  you know,  purpose,  perfectly situated with the PCIs  where they were to get a good economies of scale  with a contractor out there and out this summer.  But we could make substitutions,  but I would recommend,  we're going to try to get to all the slurry sealing  over the next two or three years.  I think that's our workload for slurry sealing  is about two or three years worth of work.  I'm assuming we continue to get Measure H funding.  So if everybody could just be patient  and then wait for our plan to come out through the budget,  which is the 23-24 budget process,  which we're going to have meetings over that  over the next few months.  We have more projects that we're going to be requesting money for,  for Measure H.  I'll say my opinion,  but do we have other questions?  All right.  Let's see if I would comment.  Any speakers?  No.  Okay.  So moving on to just comment.  Mine?  Oh.  I just think the optics on this are terrible.  I mean,  I can't get around it.  I've got,  I don't know,  40 emails already,  probably 20 phone calls.  I typically get all the emails  everybody else up here gets.  So that's probably a combination of everybody's  because they sometimes email the counselor  and then email me.  I think the optics on doing Amber Grove,  and I understand the reasoning behind it,  but right out of the gate doing this  will put our community on its heels.  I just,  I can't see it happening any other way.  The initial reaction to anyone hearing this  when all those roads are in so much worse shape.  If we were doing slurry sealing around the city  in various locations,  then I could see it playing out to be something better  and actually selling the community on that.  I just think the Amber Grove aspect  is going to be very hard to sell  when we picked one of the nicest neighborhoods  to do slurry sealing in the entire city.  I mean,  El Paso and the other road,  that's fine.  I have no problems or issues with those whatsoever.  It's just the slurry sealing of that particular neighborhood.  And I get the,  you know,  it's a condensed area  and I understand all that.  I just think the optics of it are going to play terribly.  So,  Vice Mayor.  That.  So what I was going to start to say is,  like,  the thing we do worst in this city  is explain to the public  and let them know the story of how we're doing  and why we're doing it and where we're going.  And I think if people could understand,  I mean,  we have,  what,  you know,  eight people in here right now that are listening to this  and the other 20 at home that are watching.  But just explaining,  I mean,  it's taken four budget seasons  and pavement index,  you know,  presentation coming back for us to figure out  or at least me to figure out why we're doing it.  So,  economically,  absolutely I want to fix it when it's $260,000  instead of $2.6 million.  That makes complete sense.  But I also don't want to play  and pretend to be staff.  And I know you guys are an amazing staff that sat  probably for hours and hours and hours and hours  to come up with this plan.  So I don't know if there's a plan B  or if we're voting on a plan A or plan B  or we go,  yeah, we want to move forward with this,  but can we get anything else in there?  So,  I don't want to direct staff  because that's not our job,  but I really want,  and the other question is,  if we can't get anything else done by the summer,  then absolutely we need to do this  and then we need to explain to the public.  And Mr. Chief.  So,  hold on,  I think Mark's got something.  Yeah,  I was just going to give some background as to  how did we come up with this?  And after Measure H passed in December,  the question was,  how can we get,  thinking we were going to get between five and six million,  likely in a quarter,  we'll feel much better about that  after we get a few quarters of actual experience,  but how could we deploy four million Measure H funds  over and above all the road work  we were already going to do?  And how can we do that  so that we can get it done this year  and most cost effective?  We have the database of all the asphalt condition query.  This is what comes up.  We have the data on the road work  as being the most efficient use of  how can we get four million out there,  preserve as much asphalt as we can  over and above the road work that was already scheduled.  And again,  that's how we got here.  It wasn't  trying to  come up with some sort of a balance.  It was strictly,  how can we get the most  for our four million,  quick,  and actually do it this summer?  because we're not a lot of time left.  Okay, Councilman Winslow.  Well, so, wait a second.  I won't talk to you.  I agree with the things I heard from Mayor and Vice Mayor,  and, you know, the optics is a real concern.  I think part of it, I mean, from an engineering standpoint,  looking at citywide PCI, I see why this is the smartest thing to do.  But it does conflict with what we want the community to see  coming out of these funds.  I also want to mention that we're looking at a—  it's possible that Measure H is contingent on a ballot initiative  that we're talking about that we're going to discuss at a future meeting,  and so we could be looking at limited funds.  And it certainly doesn't look good to be selecting in a neighborhood  which, if you look at, like, by census tract, is the wealthiest,  it's the lowest poverty rate in the city.  I wanted just to contrast, like, some of the projects we're looking at here.  El Paso serves anybody in the area as transportation value  because it connects one arterial to another.  It flows all the way through.  There's also a variety of income groups that live along there.  There are low-income apartments, and there are single-family houses  with lots of homeowners.  Well, in contrast, Amber Grove are sort of these dead-end streets  that are, in essence, private driveways.  They serve no transportation value for anybody else.  On El Paso, there's also infill development going on,  which is generating more tax revenue.  For the city, while that sort of thing, I doubt we'd even see many ADUs.  I could be wrong in Amber Grove.  I don't check backyards there, so I don't know.  But I don't expect we're seeing a significant increase  in tax revenue coming out of those areas.  And so there is an economic strategy towards focusing on our investment  in particular areas where we can see infill and redevelopment  because that improves the value that we have in that land  that we're getting out of that infrastructure.  I don't know what other projects are possible,  but I think that holding out on the Amber Grove one  and exploring the idea,  of other projects would be,  that's something that I would be in support of.  And one thing I would throw out there is if we could look in,  apart from just pavement condition,  sidewalks, where sidewalks already exist,  so they don't require reengineering,  but sidewalks are broken up by old trees,  stuff like that, especially in the older neighborhoods.  I would be supportive of something like that.  Thanks.  All right.  Council Member Van Overby.  Yeah, so what I'm hearing is that  the reconstruction of the,  very poor roads is not something that's going to happen this year.  So really the only thing that we can do is slurry seal.  And so the question is, do we accept the plan as proposed?  And I get the logic of it completely.  Or do we look for some other locations where we can do slurry seal?  And because even though I hate to say that we can't be,  we shouldn't be driven by optimism,  and we shouldn't be talking about slurry seal,  and we shouldn't be talking about slurry seal,  and we shouldn't be talking about slurry seal,  and we shouldn't be talking about slurry seal,  and we shouldn't be talking about slurry seal,  and we shouldn't be talking about slurry seal, All right, Council Member Mori. So I appreciate what Vice Mayor Reynolds and Council Member Van Oldenburg said but at the end of the day, and we haven't talked about this in a long time about making data-driven decisions,  decisions but the skipper was very eloquent in the way that they queried all this i i think i've  heard eric's uh pavement management speech 22 and a half times i fell asleep once um sorry  but only for half a minute so we either follow the data and we protect the taxpayer dollars  or we try to make ourselves feel good by moving it around based on some other indicator  councilmember winslow gave a few i'm not saying any of them are bad but at the end of the day  the professionals that deal with the asphalt said this is the best way to protect the economics and  the tax base of the citizens that voted for it does it look bad it does but we can go pick it  another way and we'll do it wrong and we'll pay more for it in the long run  and you'll have to pay for it in the long run  to explain that all right councilman you know i completely agree with mr morgan said that you  know this is the most efficient way to utilize the tax dollars but on the other hand do we have  could we get maybe other roads that are pci 70 or above that we could do but it seems like  this neighborhood you know because i'm pretty sure there are other roads in the city that  would qualify for that slurry seal as well there are some other roads and peace in that range of pci 60  to 70 and we're going to be bringing those forward as part of the budgeting process for fy 23 24  and keep in mind slurry seals are pretty easy for us to get together and get out to bid so if we get  an early decision on the budget we could actually move forward with some of those slurry seals for  fy 23 24 this summer as well so that's why i was saying if we're going to be able to do that  and if everybody could just be a little patient there's not a lot of slurry sealing work out there  in the city most of there's 267 miles of road that's already in plus of road that's already  in poor condition and needs either overlay or reconstruction probably mostly reconstruction  and redesign but the roads we do have that are in pci 60 to 70 that are candidates for slurry  sealing that we probably have two or three years of work for that workload and so yeah  councilman  you !  so i want to thank council member morgan i think you summed it up very well it it doesn't look good  to some of the city citizens but we finally have the ability the plus side we finally have the  ability to do something and you have made the recommendation you are the experts i've always  supported staff so i think we ought to move forward with this considering the fact that  it may not look good to some people but overall we're making a step forward and that's that's my  feeling but thank you for that comment  is there a motion council member  i will make a motion to approve the  the pavement plan as proposed by staff  sorry?  council member morgan yes  council member morgan yes  council member morgan yes  council member morgan yes We can do that through the budget process, which is coming up in the next month or two. Yeah, two. And it's very hard to answer that question  council member morgan yes And it's very hard to answer that question to the community and say, hey, you know what? We've got other stuff coming up. And, you know, I mean, I've heard conversations that the avenues will be redone  the avenues to be redone because of the engineering side in 27 so that's great to tell folks but  i'd rather tell them look we're focusing on roads throughout the city that are  in good condition rather than saying we're you know in doing slurry seals rather than saying  we're focusing one particular neighborhood that happens to be a very affluent neighborhood  in terms of managing the program i mean you could pick probably any other neighborhood and it would  have better optics i mean you could connect your routes or we almost picked cal park so that would  have actually been worse optics and i told my staff to go back and pick something else well  how not to use data to make something look better so we feel better so we can explain  not exactly  what we're doing what we're doing is debating the point and the value of nice roads to the  entire town rather than just one particular neighborhood is what i'm doing but we have  a call for the question but substitute motion could we look at more primary and secondary roads  to starting still first instead of getting into the neighborhoods and tertiary roads  um we can but maybe not for this summer is that a substitute motion  okay  may i um offer a recommendation maybe friendly amendment to that to flesh it out a little bit  i think that we all agree here that uh lassen avenue east avenue and el paso are all good  projects that we want to see go forward and i think there's many question about it  because in the budget process we're looking at a wider range of slurry seal anyway  would it not be much of a burden to staff to come back at the next city council meeting to look at  some alternatives for just this the slurry ceiling that currently were the money that we're currently  looking at with the city council meeting and then we're going to have to look at some alternatives for  that portioning to amber grove and consider alternatives to that  so if i can rephrase maybe can can you use the data that you have to find a less efficient way  that will cost more in the long run okay and bring it back to council and honestly that's the truth  if we start breaking it up excuse me one moment so we have a second we have a motion in a second  we had a substitute motion made by council member tandem is there a second to council member tan's  motion  to approve the other projects and come back with some other viable options  do we have a second  do we need to accept his amendment  yeah i'm not sure what was the friendly amendment  the friendly minimum was to do what she said which was to have staff come back with some other options but also approve the other three projects  okay  sure  okay friendly moment is accepted  i can second that too  yeah well that's the  that comes  that comes  yeah yeah  yeah yeah  okay council member bennett  no  council member morgan  no  council member tandem  yes  council member van overbeck  yes  council member winslow  yes  mayor vice mayor reynolds  no  mayor coolidge  yes  carries 4-3  all right thank you  thank you  thank you  thank you  thank you  thank you  thank you  thank you  thank you  thank you  thank you  thank you  thank you  thank you  thank you  thank you  thank you  thank you  thank you  be reclassified to a management analyst position.  This allows for greater flexibility in staffing and, as mentioned, is cost neutral.  Additionally, the currently open senior plan check engineer position  has been recommended to be changed to senior plans examiner  in order to better fit with the needs of the department.  And again, that's a cost neutral change.  The third item is a modification as a result of auditing approved budget  versus actual staff assignments.  An administrative assistant was reclassified as part of the 2022-2023 budget  to administrative specialist, but the cost change was not captured in the budget.  This change does result in an increase to the budget of $26,000.  And again,  the position reallocation upgrade was already approved.  The budget was not modified accordingly.  So this is just a correction of something that was already approved.  And then the last item is a reclassification of a senior maintenance worker position  to field supervisor.  A class analysis was done that included an extensive field study interview  with the department and the employees' immediate supervisors.  And it was recommended that...  The position be reclassified from senior maintenance worker to field supervisor  because the job was being performed at the higher classification on a consistent basis.  It will currently impact the budget this year approximately $6,500  and increasing year per year as the employee moves up the steps  to a maximum fiscal impact of $29,000 annually.  And that concludes my report.  And I'm...  I'm happy to answer any questions you might have.  All right.  Questions?  No questions.  All right.  Thank you.  Any speakers?  Nope.  No speakers.  Entertain a motion.  No.  No.  Perfect.  Motion from Vice Mayor Reynolds,  the second from Council Member Tandon,  Madam Clerk,  when you're ready.  Council Member Bennett?  Yes.  Council Member Morgan?  Yes.  Council Member Tandon?  Yes.  Council Member Van Overbeck?  Yes.  Council Member Winslow?  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Council Member Reynolds?  Aye.  Mayor Coolidge?  Aye.  Carries 7-0.  All right.  Item 5.5, Vice Mayor Reynolds requests DCBA event in City Plaza.  Vice Mayor Reynolds?  Thank you.  So what I am asking for this evening,  and I gave you a brief description,  is that the DCBA is proposing to do a new event downtown  that would replace the Taste of Chico.  And the conceptual idea is a lineup of a concert in the plaza,  completely shutting down, closed off, fenced in,  and a concert in the plaza.  And a lineup of four to five different bands,  downtown eateries bringing food down,  all kinds of fun things happening there.  And it would be a 21 and older only event.  And in order for the most participants to come  and enjoy the wonderful music and food and beverage there,  it would be nice to have some beer and wine.  So I'm asking that we do something similar  to like what we did out at the golf course.  Our code allows, we have 12.18.01,  or six zero for the golf course that allows them to have that.  And I'm asking that we possibly direct staff  to allow a by permit only use  that we would allow out.  If all the list of 25 things,  I'm sure that the city is going to make the applicant do,  if they're able to do that,  that we would allow that type of use in the plaza.  All right.  Questions for Vice Mayor Reynolds?  Speakers?  Is this for this particular one event only?  No.  Anybody could apply for it.  I'm setting it up that anybody could apply for it  if they wanted to rent the plaza  and jump through all the hoops and do the thing.  I'm sure that not very many people will want to do that  because it's going to be a big lift.  But absolutely, I would like it to be that anybody  who wants to host something downtown would be able to do that.  Thank you.  We have one speaker, Greg Scott.  Come on down.  Waited long enough?  Man, I guess.  Well, I come here as the president of DCBA  and probably more importantly as bar owner.  I support everything that Vice Mayor Reynolds just said.  We're very well aware of the consumption rules from ABC  in both closed environments and open environments.  And I just want to point out this proposed music festival,  I think our plan at last, we had 105 volunteers  and that didn't count our security yet.  We have met with the city, we've met with PD,  we've met with a lot of folks and I think our last count  of page for the planning was about 15 pages.  So I don't think anybody's going to just come out here  and willy-nilly go out and do something like this.  Part of our focus area, our four focus areas,  are the open space.  that we brought to you,  we the DCBA brought to you,  one of the things was upgrading the events,  making the events something more  than just the old normal thing.  Like I said, we expect upwards of 1,500 to 3,000,  I hope I don't jinx it,  1,500 to 3,000 people.  And I'd like to reiterate what Vice Mayor Reynolds said.  I spend a lot of time on golf courses.  Bidwell Park's one of them.  And I guarantee you  that all of our servers will be SafeServe certified  and we'll monitor it much better  than they do at Bidwell Golf Course.  So I hope you support it.  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right, questions?  Yeah, I want to thank Vice Mayor Reynolds and Mr. Scott.  This is exactly the kind of event we need to have  to revitalize downtown.  And unless we pass this,  we're really hindering our ability  to get people downtown at these events.  So.  So I'll make that a motion,  if that's okay,  to direct city staff to allow  and create a code amendment  that we can,  following the municipal code,  like what we did for the municipal golf course,  that we'd allow alcohol in the downtown plaza  and figure out what all the rules and regulations are.  And then I would add to that  that I think since this is going to be a big event,  it's going to be a very, very seldom occasion that happens.  I think the city manager could probably approve these  because it might be one or two a year  and save the time of having to go in front of a commission.  But I'll leave that up to my colleagues  if they're good with that.  All right.  I second.  Motion and second.  Okay.  Council Member Bennett?  Yes.  Council Member Morgan?  Yes.  Council Member Tandon?  Yes.  Council Member Van Oberbeck?  Yes.  Council Member Winslow?  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds?  Yes.  Mayor Coolidge?  Aye.  Carries 7-0.  All right.  No items posted after the agenda.  Item 5.66, reports and communications.  Following reports and communications,  items are provided for the council's information.  No action can be taken on items under this section  unless the council agrees to include it  on a subsequent section of the agenda.  Item 6.1, city manager's report.  No report.  Thank you very much.  Item 6.2,  is the monthly financial reports,  which are attached to the budget,  or to the agenda.  6.3, sunshine draft MOU for information only.  6.4, council member request pursuant to AP and P-1010.  Council members have earlier requested  that the agenda is at a future meeting.  After staying with the item,  a majority of the vote of the council is needed in order  for staff to agenda.  Council members may also submit requests in writing.  We have a request, the first one from Council Member Van Oberbeck.  We will let you take that away at this point.  So, we have a request from the council member, Van Oberbeck.  So, all of us know the importance of the downtown  to the success of the city and therefore the university,  which is our largest employer and largest contributor  to our economy.  If our downtown is troubled, we saw it happen  to the university in Poland.  There are two things that are common  in the revitalization of downtowns.  One is to make them more pedestrian friendly,  and the second is to honor their history,  to differentiate them from the rest of the city.  And to that end, I would like,  to change the, have the city, the council consider changing  the reference to downtown Chico to read historic downtown Chico.  All right.  Do you have a motion?  I have a quick question.  In the staff report, it referred to changing the references  to downtown Chico.  And Chico's public documents and signings.  So, but I don't think that was discussed before.  So, is your concept to actually change the documents?  Anything that says downtown Chico to historic downtown Chico,  which would be problematic?  That would be a decision for the city manager, but I,  I'm the city manager and the city clerk, excuse me.  But I would presume that if we change the name,  then we only need to be concerned  with what we're doing going forward.  We don't need to retroactively change those, right?  So now we're discussing the item that we're supposed to be voting  on whether we're going to discuss it or not.  Yeah.  So let's just vote whether we'll discuss on it or not.  Do we have a motion?  I'll second the motion.  All right.  Mr. Nanodrak, will you consider your statement on motion?  All right.  We have a second.  Madam Clerk.  Council Member Bennett.  Yes.  Thank you.  Yes.  Council Member Morgan.  Yes.  Council Member Tandon.  Yes.  Council Member Van Overbeck.  Yes.  Council Member Winslow.  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds.  Yes.  Mayor Coolidge.  Aye.  Carries 7-0.  All right.  Next request is from Council Member Tandon, support of SB 43 and 363.  Council Member Tandon.  Ms. Chauvin's suite, would you just like to identify  the request to the Chico City Council members to create a letter of support or endorsement  for Senate Bill 43 and 363?  Just agendizing a discussion.  Second.  All right.  We have a motion from Council Member Tandon, a second from Council Member Morgan.  Okay.  When you're ready.  Council Member Bennett.  Yes.  Ms. Tandon.  Yes.  Council Member Morgan.  Yes.  Council Member Tandon.  Yes.  Council Member Van Overbeck.  Yes.  Council Member Winslow.  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds.  Yes.  Mayor Coolidge.  Aye.  Carries 7-0.  All right.  I believe Council Member Morgan has one as well.  So I would like to request a possible discussion to update AP and P-1010 when it comes to Council  Member requests.  We agreed years ago the last time we upgraded AP and P-1010 that Council Member make a request  from the dais.  If their colleagues voted no, we would like to have a discussion with them.  Any questions? That kind of morph in the wording also does say morphed into the written request coming first. So what happens is we have items on the agenda  Any questions?  Any questions?  Any questions?  Any questions? to be discussed, but they're not really on the agenda, which puts the mayor in a very, very bad place which puts the mayor in a very, very bad place on business from the floor. Somebody comes and discusses something that's on the agenda to be discussed, but isn't really on the agenda, giving the public two bites at the apple  and giving some council members a chance to get public influence on something that has not yet been agendized.  So the discussion we would have was, do we want to change that so we make the request from the dais,  then the summary comes out, which is a cleaner way to do it.  That is my motion.  A seconder?  A seconder for Vice Mayor Reynolds.  Mignola.  Council Member Bennett?  Yes.  Yes.  Council Member Morgan?  Yes.  Council Member Tandon?  Yes.  Council Member Van Overbeck?  Yes.  Council Member Winslow?  No.  Vice Mayor Reynolds?  Yes.  Mayor Coolidge?  Aye.  Carries 6-1.  All right.  We will adjourn to our next meeting on March 21st at 530,  followed by the adjournment of the City Council Meeting at 6 o'clock.  Thank you.
