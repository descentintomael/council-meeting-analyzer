There we go. All right. Thank you. Yeah, let's pray.  My father in heaven, I thank you for your grace and kindness to us. I thank you for the beautiful city of Chico in which we live.  And I ask for your guidance on this meeting tonight. I thank you for our governing officials.  You work in and through human government, and I ask that you would lead in every way that we as citizens might live a peaceful and quiet life in this city.  I pray for your blessing upon this place. And Father, I thank you that you hear me through your son, the Lord Jesus. Amen.  Amen. And Pastor Jarrett is from Living Hope Fellowship. I'm sorry I didn't mention that earlier.  Please rise for the Pledge of Allegiance.  Salute and pledge.  I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.  Roll call. Council, uh, city council. Can you call our roll, please?  Council Member Goldstein. Present.  Council Member Hawley. Here.  Council Member O'Brien. Here.  Council Member Van O'Leary.  Council Member Wilberbeck.  Here.  Council Member Winslow.  Here.  Vice Mayor Bennett.  Here.  And Mayor Reynolds.  Here.  Speaker card announcement. Anyone wishing to address the council on any matters not, uh, or list on the agenda should first fill out a speaker card found at the back of the council chambers.  Once completed, turn your cards into the city clerk and the speakers are taken in the order received.  Once the first speaker begins, no additional speakers will be taken on that item.  Um, persons demonstrating rude, boisterous speaking out of, um, the public hearing.  We will not be allowed to address any matters on outside the city council's jurisdiction or engaging in otherwise disruptive behavior will be called to order.  If such conduct continues, I may call a recess requesting removal of such persons from the council chambers, adjourn or take other actions as necessary.  Um, the first thing we're going to do is have a quick moment of silence for Maureen Kirk, who we recently lost.  Um, for those of you that did not know or just as a reminder, from 1994 to 1998, she was a Big Bull Park and Playground Commissioner.  Um, in 2020.  She was the first person to serve as the city council's vice mayor.  She was elected to council on December 1, 1998.  She was elected to council in December 5, 2000.  She was vice mayor.  In 2002, she became mayor of the city of Chico and in 2004 became vice mayor again and then went on to serve over at the Butte County Board of Supervisors from 2007 to 2019.  She was an amazing woman and so we'll just take a moment of silence for Maureen.  Thank you.  So first we have a proclamation for Arbor Day.  If I could have...  .  .  So, are we on?  Are we on?  Hello?  Hello, hello?  Try again?  Okay.  There. Oh. Now we're on.  Now we're on.  In honor of Arbor Day, it was back in April 29th, and apparently we didn't get this to you right on time, but whereas in 1872, Sterling Morton proposed to the Board of Agriculture of Nebraska that a special day be set aside for the planting of trees.  And whereas this holiday, known as Arbor Day, was first observed with the planting of more than a million trees in Nebraska and is now observed throughout the world.  And whereas trees clean the air, moderate the temperature, produce life-giving oxygen.  Provide habitat for wildlife, cut heating and cooling costs, and reduce erosion of a precious topsoil.  And whereas they are planted trees...  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  29th, 2025 National Arbor Day and encourage all citizens to support our urban forestry  program, helping to protect our trees and woodlands for the present and future generations.  Awesome.  I'm so sorry.  I'll get back to you.  Thank you so much.  Thank you.  Okay, consent agenda.  Oh, wait, sorry.  Closed session announcement.  I'm going to turn it over to our city manager to give our closed session announcement.  Thank you, Mayor and Council.  On item 2.1, the Council voted unanimously to appoint Ryan Jones of the Jones Mayor Law  Firm as the City Attorney for the City of Chico, effective December 3, 2025.  And provided the city manager with the authority to enter into an agreement with Jones Mayor  that will be brought back to the Council in January.  And we will begin transition work tomorrow.  On item 2.2, conference with labor negotiator, no final action was taken.  Council did provide direction.  2.3 was not heard tonight.  And 2.4, no final action was taken.  And Council provided direction.  All right.  Thank you very much.  Consent agenda.  All matters listed under the consent agenda were considered in nature.  Do we have any speakers?  We do.  We have one.  All right.  Stephen Hazel.  And Stephen, I wanted to let you know, do you need the microphone?  Would you?  You're going to be able to get up.  Okay.  So you put three cards in for consent, and you speak one time.  But he does want to talk about three different items.  Right.  Right.  But you speak at one time on all items.  So go ahead and just talk about the items on consent.  2.1, 2.  No.  They're taken in its entirety.  So I thought you could give them three times.  That's kind of ridiculous because that could be each one.  There's four items.  Every item is one, two, three.  So go ahead, Stephen.  Go ahead and approach the microphone and go ahead and start speaking.  I'll time you for three minutes, and you can address all your concerns on all three items.  I thought you could talk about the two points, 2.1 and 2.6.  Everything under the 2.1 is all one agenda item.  So you get three minutes to talk about all the things on two.  Well, I thought.  2.1.  When you pull an item, per item, you get three minutes per item.  You can see in other cities.  I was sitting in the vice president in Santa Clara, and we always, there could be 30 items.  You get each item if you want to pull one.  Okay.  So you need to start on all the things on 2.0.  The first one is 2.1, which is standard roadway because you don't have a problem with, you know,  I live at Jarvis Gardens.  If you have a problem, you know where I live.  I live at Jarvis Gardens.  It's a park.  It's apartment 217.  I look over at Miriam Park, and I'm upstairs.  You see, actually, I see a lot of people.  Of course, there's public safety with people in the mediums, but I don't see them upstanding  or next to the sidewalk adjacent to any driveway exit and entry points on public.  See, that's wrong because remember your protest you had all King's Day?  All kinds of people got S-plained.  What, did they violate that?  Yes, they did.  They didn't violate that because any entrance along the roadway.  So, and when you protest, if you're out picking any company, you have a right to do that.  Not mediums, but on sidewalks, no.  I thought maybe 10 feet back, but no, not even 10 feet back.  You should be able to go up to the edge right there, but not in actually mediums.  So, and also, when you had protests on Elon Musk, well, everybody's out there.  They violated that rule everywhere.  You can look the other way on those guys and not do anything.  You know, go back on a woman's right to choose.  Remember that one?  Even though I respect women's right to choose, but you just can't have full term abortion.  You've got to be an idiot.  But still, all those people, I go out there and protest with you.  I'm God and I accept, you know, rape, incest, and a life of a mother, of course.  It's not absolute if you talk to me, see.  But with putting that, you're just, I saw Winslow on TV saying, it's just an ordinance.  You have an ordinance.  It's just against the homeless, which is true.  Where are they going to get money?  Okay.  I saw a guy cut across where a discount grocery is.  And that was kind of, you know, BS.  He should be going up the street with two eyes.  That should be illegal.  And standing in the middle.  They're standing in the middle right now.  But standing on the sidewalk to the corner, no.  You can't make that unlawful.  I don't care if it's a retail, whatever.  You're saying retail any entry point.  So anyway, all your protests you do, you'll be selected.  And you're going to let these guys slide and it fill the booth.  And you're going to let these guys slide and it fill the booth.  See, it wouldn't affect that.  So if you just say medium, it won't affect any other thing.  Because I'm about freedom.  I'm Berkeley.  I'm freedom of speech and all that stuff.  But what you're doing is you're really violating your constitutional rights straight up.  Because that is, if you can't stand near the edge just because you think it's going to  prevent people from panning, that's BS.  Because that's about it.  And the other point about what you said.  You said you're going to schedule meetings.  I wanted to say that you're going to have the item reconsidered action at all for whatever  preceding meeting.  You should just have that on the agenda.  You have the ability to reconsider any action.  I should be able to come up here and request it.  But only the ones that are fully affirmative would trigger.  You guys.  All right.  That's your time.  Thank you, Steven.  Thank you.  He was our only speaker on that.  Okay.  Do we have any council member disqualifications?  No.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah. .  Okay, so it was a motion and a second to approve the consent agenda as read, which also includes an ordinance of the City of Chico adding Chapter 10.36 to Title 10 of the Chico Municipal Code prohibiting pedestrians on medians and other roadway areas.  Final reading and adoption. By reading of title only, with it noted that there were three no votes from Councilmember Goldstein, Councilmember Hawley, and Councilmember Winslow. Noted for item 2.1.  So on the rest of it, Councilmember Goldstein? Yes.  Councilmember Hawley? Yes.  Councilmember O'Brien? Yes.  Councilmember Van Overbeck? Yes.  Councilmember Winslow? Yes.  Vice Mayor Bennett? Yes.  Mayor Reynolds? Aye.  Carrie Sperling? Aye.  7-0.  Thank you.  Public comment. Members of the public may address the Council at this time on any matter not already listed on the agenda and are within the jurisdiction authority.  The Council cannot take any action at this meeting on requests made under this section of the agenda.  How many speakers do we have?  We have three.  All right.  Okay. And I'll call the first two.  And if you could go ahead and line up.  Stephen Hazel, followed by Steve Gonzalez. [inaudible]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you. Yes, Steven Hazel.  Steven Hayden.  As a member of the public, I notice  all the votes are, it's all R&D.  Republican, Democrat,  whatever that is.  The question given  isn't  conservative or  liberal. It's R&D.  My mom's a fifth grade teacher.  She still has a question to the class.  You don't claim it and  claim it as R&D because  what's happening is, how many other  parties are there? There's established parties.  There's Peace and Freedom. There's  Libertarian Green Party. There's actually  American Independent. I'm actually  independent. I'm I.  The answer isn't R&D.  It's I.  What you do is you define it.  It happens nationally  and it trickles down to here.  I always say, crept and started at a local 11th.  It's at the White House. What we're left at,  it was 6-1  until a new group came. Now it's 4-3.  We see that regularly.  I'm like, 4-3, that's George Bush.  He's 43.  Now, 4-3 is my birthday.  I'm December 6th.  That's my birthday.  I told you, Donald Trump got up at 6-12.  Time me.  It's bad.  Now, I always say,  not dumbing it down, but Frost and Snowman,  remember Karen,  3,000 force cents to go to North Pole.  It was 4-1 o'clock.  It's just to give you indication  of what's going on here because  not just 343 firefighters,  but the location,  I found, I actually located,  was me, it was my intel.  That's why five of my members are dead in your cemetery.  Right there on Mangrove. You go to the  torpedo, turn right, wind around.  You're buried right there.  It is on track.  I'm talking about within your district  because I gave a tip of life.  34-7 was my tip.  Someone did like the other  point that Bush and Cheney were involved in 9-11.  You guys  try to ignore that. Too bad.  Because he was.  The other guy opted to meet his 6-3.  Well, that's George A.W. Bush.  He's safe. That's it. That's 6-6-6.  It is.  He's under the W. I always say,  I always pull out an A.W. root beer  and you're A.W. 1-2-3.  So I'm 1-2-6.  See, you're short X-Y as you always say.  That K-Z. You know where you are,  you don't know why, and then you die.  It's a game of words, Waldo.  Under the W, remember this bad madman world?  The palm trees  could figure it out.  Mr. Hazel, you're off topic. This is your warning.  No, I'm not.  How am I disrupting? I'm explaining  life right there. Because what happens is  you're taking and you're defining  what you're thinking.  Because what happens is  the guy, your guy, I voted for him.  Okay, Donald Trump.  Because he probably said the world's going to end.  And guess what? What happened?  He's involved.  Saudi Arabia, he's in the...  Whatever.  He's bought paper by Saudi Arabia.  And they hit us on 9-11.  So is this guy.  Okay?  It's crazy.  Donald J. Trump.  That's fine. Thank you.  Okay, so Steve Gonzalez  followed by Cynthia Perrine.  Good evening.  I'm here to talk  just briefly about  ramification  that happened when you  actually were able to  remove some homeless people  from around the Municipal Center,  which I think is great.  I'm sure a lot of people appreciate that,  coming to the Municipal Center  and not having to step over people  and be exposed to certain other things.  But I want you to realize  that a lot of these people,  or some of them,  have just moved over here on the block of Wall Street  on the west side of Wall between 5th and 6th.  And unfortunately,  you know,  I think we all have to be careful.  We all have to put up with this.  We understand the terms of the Warren Agreement  and the state of affairs.  But this is particularly troublesome to me  because you've got the Boys and Girls Club  just sort of right across Caddy Corner.  And, you know,  the kids and the staff and the parents,  they're getting exposed literally  and figuratively to some things  that are probably not  in the best interest of  raising healthy children.  So I don't...  expect you to do anything.  I don't know that there's anything you can do.  I'm just here, you know,  registering my complaint about this situation  and hoping that you can take some action  at some point in time  to maybe return Wall Street  to what it was prior to the action  you took here at the Municipal Center.  Thank you very much for your time.  Microphone, sorry.  Cynthia Perrine.  Thanks.  Okay.  I'm going to talk to you about bike transit.  And I'm going to say thank you.  Isn't that fun?  So I've been talking to you  for a couple of years now  and saying please get better communication  about the leaf pickup.  And the leaves have been being picked up  and the social media posts are working.  I know what to avoid,  where to avoid, and that's cool.  Something that still needs an enforcement bit  is that I still see on a daily basis  landscaping companies  going and picking up their leaves  from their landscaping jobs  and dumping them right into the gutter.  And it specifically says on the social media posts  and on the city website that's not allowed.  And it's those piles of leaves  that are getting dumped right after  the leaf pickup happens.  And so it's just something that's still,  it's getting better,  still needs a little bit of attention.  And I think it is the education part  and the outreach is working.  I saw it at least.  I'm not even on social media that much,  but somehow those landscaping companies  are still getting away with dumping a lot of stuff  at our roadways and blocking our roads.  So that's all I wanted to say.  Thank you so much.  Thank you.  She was our last speaker.  All right.  We have no public hearings.  And we have introduction of an ordinance  adopting the 2025 edition  of the California Billing Code Standards  and local amendments.  And we have Dale Fletcher,  Deputy Director, Building Official,  and Paul Ricketts, our file marshal tonight,  I believe.  Hi.  Good evening, Mayor, Vice Mayor,  and Council, City staff,  public,  and the town,  and the city.  I just want to let you know,  Dale Fletcher, Building Official  and Community Development Deputy Director.  So I just wanted to kind of bring up  a little bit of things.  Every three years,  the Building Standards Commission  goes through a process of adoption  of the new codes.  As part of that adoption,  the state will work with  International Code Council for that adoption.  And there's a base code that's there.  And on top of that base code,  California takes it and modifies it.  that we set to fit the needs of Californians.  And so that's kind of the basis of the code.  And when the Building Standards Commission adopts that,  it's an automatic adoption.  And that includes all jurisdictions  within the state of California.  So this is a process that we go through.  And it's an opportunity for City Council  and for staff to take a look at the ordinance  and take a look at the codes.  And we can apply more stringent requirements,  which we try not to do.  But at the same time,  it gives us an opportunity to kind of discuss what that,  those requirements may look like. So that's what I'm here for today and hopefully I'll make it  quick and we can get out of here. There's quite a few codes that are a part of it. I can remember,  I don't want to date myself, but when I started in 91, we only had two parts. It was part one,  and then it was the standards. And now we have 12 volumes. So, and it doesn't seem like it's  getting any smaller. It seems like it seems to be expanding a little bit. So I'll get on with this.  And because there's so many, I'm going to have to read a little bit, but every three years,  California Building Standards Commission adopts the latest model building codes,  which encompasses the building, residential, mechanical, plumbing, energy, electrical,  fire, historical building, existing building, green building standards, wildland, urban interface,  which is a new one that we probably heard about, which is all referenced as the 2025 California  building codes. If you ever get a chance to talk to me directly, a lot of times I'll call it the  model codes because it's so vast and not all of them are specific to building.  So I throw that little nuance in there. To ensure the city is consistent with the state law,  it is important to update the city municipal code to include the 2025 California building codes,  which goes into effect automatically on January 1st, 2026. The California health and safety code  does allow for the amendments to the California building code when deemed necessary and reasonable  due to local climatic, geographical, geological, aha, there we go, and topographical conditions.  It is, it has,  typically been the recommendation to staff to keep modifications to the California building standards  code to a minimum to maintain conformity with other jurisdictions throughout the state. However,  there are certain local conditions that do warrant modifications. Staff is recommending that the  re-adoption of previous council enacted local amendments related to the fire regulations  regard locations for above ground tanks, storage of liquefied petroleum gases,  restrictions on fireworks, and providing addresses at the rear of properties where  water is being used. The state has also recommended that the re-adoption of previous council enacted  restrictions on fireworks, and providing addresses at the rear of properties where  parking lots and alleys provide vehicular access to properties and to update existing references.  The ordinance before you provides the adoption of the 2025 California building code and makes the required findings and determinations to support the local minor local amendments. Staff recommends that council introduce the ordinance today.  That's really all I have. But if you have any questions, I'm happy to answer them too.  Any questions?  So Mr. Fletcher, thank you for your  mercifully brief  presentation.  Yeah.  So the items that are unique to  Chico, are there any  beyond the ones that you mentioned?  Right. So there are  the ones that we had originally adopted  or that had been presented in the  2022 code adoption  were specific to emergency shelters.  It was in appendices within that building code  and that is carrying over.  They changed the letter of what that  was. I think it was used to be in Q and now it's in P or I've got the two switch, but that's one that has switched. And they because they've rewritten the way that format is and they put in a lot of the stuff that the city of Chico had provided earlier within our ordinance under chapter 16 R and that it's carried over into the building codes themselves. So we just adopted that portion of it. The other one is grading. We have our own grading ordinance in 16, but we also have some of the appendices that have been adopted. So we're going to be doing that in the next few weeks. So thank you for your attention. Thank you.  Yeah, I just want And those are really the large ones that we have and those are consistent. We took actually one of the appendices away. We didn't adopt that one, which was more to patio covers. We didn't carry that one forward because it's already built in. So everything that we had within the patio covers, we took away there.  Yeah, I just want  Yeah, I just want  Yeah, I just want  Yeah, I just want And those are really the large ones that we have and those are consistent. We took actually one of the appendices away. We didn't adopt that one, which was more to patio covers. We didn't carry that one forward because it's already built in. So everything that we had within the patio covers, we took away there. I didn't see a reason to have multiple code cycles or code adoption if it's already covered. So we were trying to clean up that ordinance in the same way or our municipal code at the same time. So you're very welcome. Thank you.  adoption if it is already  covered. We are trying to clean  up that ordinance in the same  way or municipal code at the  same time. You are very welcome  thank you.  council member holley.  thank you so much for the  concise and clear presentation  and the attached staff report I  should have emailed this to you  but I am just thinking of it  now. I am curious if the city  has any standard operations  when it comes to public  communication with the code  changes and what that will look  like.  yes.  last 2022 cycle we actually held  a seminar meeting here on the  significant changes. We have  already posted those changes on  our website. I was just talking  to Tom councilman. We were  discussing having a meeting  coming up with the board of  realtors and the city of !  councilman. We have been  working with the city of  councilman. We have been  working with the CVA group  trying to bring those things  forward so everybody has an  opportunity to ask questions and  to learn what that looks like.  It is important because it  affects all of us. It affects  me as a consumer and as a  homeowner all the above the same  way it affects everybody in here  and I can say there is so much  that is put into these volumes  that it is hard to navigate.  Having that community outreach  is very important to me and  sounds good. Let us know if  you need any help doing outreach.  we actually talked about a  little bit of having a meeting  here. We have a great team. I  can't say enough about them  whether it is the time when they  meet the public at the counter  or during the plan review  process or the inspections. It  would be nice to be able to  bring them in and introduce them  to all of you and let them talk  about their expertise because  every single one of them bring a  great wealth of knowledge in  different ways whether they are  a contractor. We are pretty  fortunate. We have three  certified building officials in  our department which a lot of  communities don't even have one.  They are struggling. We probably  the best certified group that  you have got out there. Well  from Sacramento north I know  there is nobody that carries  more search than what we have  right here in Chico. We really  think that part is important.  Education, knowledge and sharing.  All right. Any other questions?  All right. Thank you very much.  Do we have any speakers?  We do not.  All right. Consider a motion.  Move to approve.  Second.  All right. We have a motion and  a second.  All right. And that's a  motion and a second to introduce  ordinance of the city council of  the city of Chico amending title  16 R the Chico municipal code  relating to the adoption by  reference of the 2025 edition of  the California administrative  building reference standards.  Electrical, mechanical, plumbing,  residential, energy, historical,  existing, green building, wild  land, urban interface and fire  codes and standards. As well as  the adoption by reference of the  2024 international property  maintenance code 1997 uniform  code for the abatement of  dangerous buildings and amending  adding or repealing provisions  in title 16 R of the Chico  municipal code for the  city's building division and fire  department. And that was by  introduction by reading of title only.  Council member  Goldstein. Yes. Councilmember Hawley. Yes. Councilmember O'Brien. Yes. Councilmember Van Overbeck. Yes. Councilmember Winslow. Yes. Vice Mayor Bennett. Yes. Mayor Reynolds.  Aye.  Carries 7-0.  Reports and communications. The following reports and  communication items have been provided for the council's information.  No action can be taken on  items under this section unless  the council agrees to include it on the  subsequent agenda. City manager's report.  Got a quick one for you. Tomorrow at the  alt site you'll see the addition of a  small construction trailer that  the Jesus Center  and their team will be using  for their on-site activities.  Due to the work that  Amber Bass and her team  at the Jesus Center started back in June  we appear to be on trajectory  to have as few as six  camps within about the next two weeks  on-site.  And perhaps as low as seven  authorized occupants on-site.  So definitely  reducing the impact  that that facility has  on the neighborhood.  Alright. Thank you.  Trash and exploitation information only.  Council member request pursuant to  ATP and P-1010. Council members may  verbally request an item be agendized at a future  meeting after stating what the item would be. A  majority vote of the council is needed in order for  staff to agendize. Anybody have anything?  Council member Van Overbeek.  So I was at an event  on this past Tuesday and  an 84 year old woman  who's married to a friend of mine  had been struck by an electric bike  in Bidwell Park and broke her  leg and was otherwise pretty  seriously injured.  And then over the weekend I almost got  taken out by a kid on a  you know, it's basically an electric motorcycle  going 30 miles an hour.  So we need to  have a, I don't know whether it's a  policy issue but we need to address  this. I don't know whether it's  Chief, whether it's just an enforcement  problem. But you know we've got these  four classes of electric bikes  you know on one side,  on one end of the spectrum they're basically  electric motorcycles and they can go 70 miles an hour  and on the other  it's you know pedal assist.  So you have to pedal before the motor  kicks in. But we need  to come up with a set of rules  so that unless you're  your vehicle is licensed  under the state of California  so you have to have a proper license  to operate it on a public road.  Council Member Van Overbeck I hate to be rude  but you're just supposed to like say what  you want to talk about and then you can make your argument once it's agendized.  Thank you. That's why you're the mayor.  I'm sorry. I just want to keep us in order.  So I would like  to agendize a  discussion of how we  make Bidwell Park safer  from electric  bikes. I'm going to second that motion.  Council Member McEwen?  Can I perhaps suggest that we look at the city as a whole?  In that?  Just yeah just e-bike  regulations.  Yeah I think that's a great idea.  So I'll accept that as a well  friendly amendment. That's a friendly amendment that  I will second as well.  Alright we got a motion and a second with a very friendly amendment.  Okay Council Member Goldstein?  Yes.  Council Member O'Brien?  Yes.  Council Member Van Overbeck?  Yes. Council Member Winslow? Yes.  Vice Mayor Bennett?
