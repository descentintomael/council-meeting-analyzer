I know we're missing one of our commissioners tonight, but we put this off last time. So should we take a vote on whether or not we're going to do that item tonight? Madam Chair, it's up to the Planning Commission. You know, whatever you're most comfortable with. If you'd like to do it tonight, you can certainly do that. If you'd like to wait until you have a full commission, you can do that too. Whatever is your preference. Okay. How does everybody else feel? I'd like to nominate Rich for chair and vice chair. And liaison? No, I guess I can't. All three. I'll second nominating him for one of them both. I don't know. All right. Back to seriousness. I'd like to move that we go ahead and select the chairman and vice chairman. Because Bryce has already been doing it for an extra six months. Yeah. If you prefer to do that, that's entirely fine with us. That'd be good. Then a motion for a nomination. Actually, if I could just interject real quick. So for the chair and the vice chair positions, you don't have to do a formal motion or anything. What we'll do is we'll. We'll open up the nominations for the position of chair. And then once there are no more nominations coming in, I will then. Or Nicole will call them in the order received. And once they receive. An individual receives four or more votes. They become appointed as the chair. And then we'll do the same process for the vice chair. If that's okay with the commission. That's how we do it at the council meeting. Sure. And is that like a secret ballot type of thing? No, it'll actually be a roll call vote. Oh. Once we get the list of nominations. Okay. So I would open up the nominations for the position of chair. I nominate Tony Scott for chair. I'll second that. Do we need to? No, you don't need a second. It's not a motion. It's just if you want to nominate any others, you can. Are you serious about nominating Rich since you already said it? No. I'm going to give him bad time. It's always fun to nominate the person who's not. I was watching for. I was driving through the neighborhood. Okay. So are there any other nominations? Okay. I move to close the nominations. You don't have to do that, Commissioner Wall. You don't. So what we'll do is we'll do a roll call vote on Commissioner Scott serving as the chair of the planning commission. Commissioner Wall? Yes. Pullen? Yes. Commissioner? Commissioner? Commissioner? Yes. Commissioner Cooper? Yes. Chair Goldstein? Yes. Okay. Then Tony Scott is our new chair for the planning commission. And I'll go ahead and open up the nomination for the position of vice chair. I nominate Rich. Second. Rich Hooper? Okay. Any other nominations? That's a good question. He's currently serving. Isn't he currently the vice chair? No. No, actually. I think Lupita was. I think. He hasn't been vice chair or chair yet, so I thought that would be a good idea. Okay. Rich Hooper? Is it Rich? Okay. So we'll do a roll call vote for Rich Hooper serving as the vice chair. Commissioner Wall? Yes. Commissioner Pullen? Yes. Commissioner Scott? Yes. Commissioner Dermedy? Yes. Commissioner Cooper? Yes. Yes. Chair Goldstein? Yes. Okay. So I will turn it over now to Chair Scott to take over the meeting. Well. Oh, you need a selection of alternate liaison. I apologize. For ARHPB. I'll nominate myself for that. Okay. Are there any other nominations? Seeing none, we'll do a roll call vote. Commissioner Wall? Yes. Commissioner Pullen? Yes. Commissioner Scott? Yes. Commissioner Dermedy? Yes. Commissioner Cooper? Yes. Chair Goldstein? Yes. Okay. Thank you. And now I'll turn it over to... Do you want me to move Bruce or keep doing that? You might want to move chairs if that suits the planning commission. Sorry. Normally the chairs are to the middle. I'm so confused. Should we all just rotate one? Musical chairs? This is why they're laughing's fun. Congrats, Tony. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I'll throw it at you, Matt. Ooh, aggressive. Okay. Are you ready, Nicole? All right. So we'll move to Item 2, Consent Agenda. This can be passed with one motion. Do we have a motion to approve the minutes from June 17, 2021? I'll make a motion. Okay. Commissioner Pullen, is there a second? Second. And a second from Commissioner Wall. All in favor, signify by saying aye. Aye. Any opposed? Okay. So that motion carries 6-0 with one absent. Item 3, Business from the Floor. Members may address the commission at this time on any matter not already listed on the agenda, with comments being limited to three minutes. Do we have any business from the floor? We didn't receive any cards or anything. Does anybody hear? Anyone's not here to not speak on agenda item. That would love to speak tonight. Great. So we'll move on to Item 4, Public Hearings. And Item 4.1, Parcel Map 21-01. And I will turn it over to Associate Planner Tina Wilson. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Is there any ex parte communication on this item? I'll start to my right. No. None. I have none? No. Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Chair Scott and members of the Planning Commission. My name is Tina Wilson, and I am the project planner for this item. The project is located northeast of the intersection of Bruce Road and East 20th Street. The site is designated Neighborhood Commercial on the City of Chico General Plan Land Use Diagram and Zoned CN. Bruce Village Commons Vesting Tentative Parcel Map, PM 2101, is a proposal to subdivide a previously approved vertical mixed-use project consisting of 60 affordable senior housing units and approximately 10,000 square feet of commercial space in a three-story structure into condominium units. The approximately 2.5-acre site is 325 feet wide by 350 feet deep and relatively flat. A previous entitlement for the site includes AR 2103 to authorize the architecture and site design. The Architectural Review and Historical Preservation Board approved this project on April 21st of this year. The proposed condominium project would have, no effect on the previously approved project. All land use restrictions and conditions were addressed in the previous entitlement on the property. New conditions specific to the condominium project, which is before you tonight, are contained in the conditions of approval in the subdivision report. The applicant has chosen not to include a condominium plan at this time. Pursuant to section 66427 of the Subdivision Map Act, the City cannot require a plan. The project has been determined to be categorically exempt under Chico Municipal Code section 1.40.220 and pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act Guidelines section 15332 for infill development projects. Staff has received two public comments regarding the project. One is an email received after 4.30 this afternoon and a printed copy has been provided to each of you. The second was a phone call asking about the affordability of the project. Based on conversations with the applicant, the proposed vesting tentative parcel map to create condominiums would not change the project itself. The applicant has informed staff that the development would serve seniors aged 62 and older with income levels between 30 and 50% of area median income. In conclusion, staff recommends that the Board adopt the required findings contained in the agenda report and approve the proposed project. The project is subject to the recommended conditions. I am available to answer any questions. Thank you. Thank you. Are there any questions? So I got a question. I was confused as the question was brought up on here. So they are still going to be seniors housing? That is correct. But they're just converting so later on they can sell these as condos or break it down, right? Yes. Okay. Yeah, as you know, because I called you, I was wondering the same thing but also about the affordability. Okay. I guess specifically I'm interested in knowing their metrics for affordability. You gave me a figure. I believe it was 30 to 50% of average or median income in the region. But how are they getting subsidies to make it affordable? How exactly is that working? That is not something that staff has required so I would defer that question to the applicant. Okay. Any other questions for staff? One. Go ahead. One of the emails that we received, she was asking about the Bruce Road widening project. Well, I'm calling it the Bruce Road widening project but she's asking if it's going to be widened. So was she informed about the development out there that the city has planned? At this time, we didn't have time prior to the meeting to do that. We have a lot of questions that we have to respond directly to her. Okay. We can reach out. That would be great because I think part of it is also a lot of these questions is just informing the public. And, you know, the city's got some great plans in the works and so I think it would be great that the neighborhood out there knows about it. Thank you. Thank you. Anything else? Thank you. Thank you. We will now open the public hearing and begin with the applicant. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Welcome. Good afternoon, members of the Planning Commission. My name is Mike Dormer with the firm of Sherrod Dunlop Sawyer representing the developer. Our firm is only doing the condominiumization of this project. We're not doing the civil design that's being done by a local firm. But as Tina mentioned, the condominiumization is in no way going to change anything that was previously entitled. In fact, the only reason that they do this, they primarily do it for the commercial spaces to give anybody that wants to potentially purchase airspace that ability or they can certainly also rent airspace. It also is a vehicle to help establish which areas and which spaces maintain which components of the project. So I'm here to answer any questions you might have. Does anybody have any questions for Mr. Dormer? No. Okay. Chair Goldstein? So to clarify, you probably don't have an answer for my previous question. I don't think I do. If it was the same question, no. Well, just so you know, there's a grant that was provided. So it is subsidized housing. That's how they're able to afford a lower rate. You know, it's just not out of the goodness of their hearts, although they are good guys. But, you know, they do have to make a living. So, you know, there is a grant involved here. They've done this. They model in other communities pretty successfully. Okay. That's perfect. That's what I was wondering, how they plan to make it affordable. Sure. Okay. Thank you. Any other questions? Thank you. Thank you. Do we have any public comment? Okay. Any public comment? Okay. With that, I will close the public hearing and bring it back to the Commission for any questions or motions. I'll make a motion to the Planning Commission to adopt Resolution 21-05, approving the parcel map subject to the attached conditions. Thank you, Commissioner Wall. And do we have a second? I'll second that. Thank you. So we have a motion and a second to that the Planning Commission adopt Resolution Number 21-05, approving the parcel map subject to the attached conditions. Is there any discussion? Seeing none, all in favor signify by saying aye. Aye. Any opposed? So that motion carries 6-0 with one absent. Thank you. I guess I could knock the gavel for you, officially. Thank you. Item number 4.2, Plan Development Permit 20-03, Chico Eye Center. And Planner Kelly Murphy will present the item. Good evening, Madam Chair and members of the Planning Commission. My name is Kelly Murphy and I am the planner assigned to the second project on our agenda this evening. So the applicant proposes to construct a new commercial building on a vacant 2.3-acre site located on the northwest corner of Esplanade. The site is designated Neighborhood Commercial on the City of Chico General Plan Land Use Diagram and Zoned Neighborhood Commercial with airport overflight and planned development overlays located also within the northwest Chico specific plan area. The proposed building would accommodate medical offices and retail space for the Chico Eye Center, which are principally permitted land uses in the CN zoning district. The proposed building would have a footprint of approximately 16,000 square feet. Other site features would include a covered pickup and drop-off area, commercial trash enclosure, parking, and landscaping. The project sites a triple frontage lot bounded by Esplanade, DeGarmo Drive, and Bodero Lane. The proposed building would be situated at the center of the site oriented toward the Esplanade. Landscaping features are proposed around the building. Wide landscape buffers are provided between the parking areas and adjacent streets. A total of 74 trees are proposed throughout the site. The 41 trees intended to shade the parking lot would consist of Chinese pistache and sawleaf zelkova species, while a variety of oak, maple, ginkgo, crepe myrtle, and magnolia trees would be planted to further ornament the site. Per the requirements of the CN zoning district, a minimum of 10% of the site shall be landscaped. The project proposes to landscape approximately 36% of the site. With parking lots and parking spaces, the project will be located at the center of the site. The parking lot shading estimated to reach 50% satisfying these requirements. The project's architecture is reflective of a familiar design aesthetic used for medical offices with stucco siding and a neutral color scheme, well-defined entry, and a minimized number of windows, particularly along the south elevation of the building. Stone-clad columns identify the main entrance. The port-cochere serves as a prominent architectural feature ensuring the visual prominence. The port-cochere serves as a prominent architectural feature ensuring the visual prominence. The port-cochere's design combines a large escalating escalating escalating escalating escalating escalating escalating escalating escalating escalating escalating escalating escalating escalating escalating escalating escalating escalating escalating escalating escalating escalating escalating escalating escalating escalating escalating escalating escalating enhancing the neighborhood identity. A covered trash enclosure is provided in the parking area at the rear of the building and would utilize similar materials. I have two more slides showing you a little bit of the building in a more realistic sense. A little bit of history on the site. The subject property was originally approved for development as the commercial component of the mixed-use DeGarmo Terrace subdivision and planned development permit. Phase one developed multifamily residential uses along Bodero Lane. However, phase two, which proposed future development of five commercial buildings offering a mix of restaurant, office, and service uses never commenced. A modification to the approved site plan to reorient the placement of the proposed commercial buildings was approved by the Planning Commission in 2015. Despite all efforts, there remained a continued lack of interest in the multi-tenant commercial site. No extensions of that PDP were requested since modifying phase two in 2015, resulting in expiration of the previous permit approval. As such, it was determined a new planned development permit shall be processed for the site. The applicant has submitted an application for a planned development permit in accordance with the code which states that the first development permit of a vacant site in the PD overlay zone shall be required to submit a planned development permit for any allowed use. Consistent with the development standards for CN zone properties and lots with a PD overlay, the project would be located on a corner lot greater than 7,000 square feet with at least 25% of the site devoted to landscape and usable open space areas. The project would also be consistent with applicable building coverage, height, and size. The project would also be consistent The proposal is consistent with various policies and actions under land use goals two, three, and four, as well as community design goals two and five. The project would provide customers and nearby residents increased access to medical services and a retail space where associated eyewear products may be purchased. Development of the project would result in a better distribution of these uses and contribute valuable services to residents in North Chico. The project would be compatible with its surrounding land uses and enhance walkability of the existing neighborhood with improvements to sidewalks and circulation and new landscaping and site design would improve aesthetics along the North Esplanade corridor. The project parcel is identified for mixed use commercial development in the Northwest Chico specific plan. The Chico Eye Center proposes a single commercial building to be used predominantly as medical offices with a separate retail component allowing customers to purchase associated products. The project would be consistent with various policies The project would be consistent with the adjacent multi-family residential buildings along Bodaro Lane, as well as the aforementioned smaller commercial building at the corner of Esplanade and Bodaro. Development of the project site would achieve the overall mixed use goal for the Degarmo Terrace subdivision as envisioned by the Northwest Chico specific plan. The Northwest Chico specific plan also provides design guidance for mixed use development projects. The project contains design elements such as the Porco chair that require the building to be set back further from the street. Sidewalks encircle the building connecting the front entrance and parking area along Bodaro Lane directly to the adjacent public streets. The building would be single story with varied roof lines and architectural features that define the main entrance and create visual interest at the pedestrian level. The project's site's unique in that it has four wings. frontage on three streets, making it virtually impossible not to locate parking between the building and any street. However, in an effort to address guideline number four, the compact parking spaces originally proposed between the building and the Esplanade frontage have been eliminated. Overall, staff finds the proposal to be moderately consistent with the design guidelines of the Northwest Chico-specific plan. The project is consistent with the city's design guidelines that call for commercial buildings to use appropriate massing and materials to provide a pedestrian-level scale. The design does well to identify the main entrance of the building, avoids a flat or monotonous roofline, and includes variation in depth of surfaces and surface materials to add visual interest to walls. Design guideline consistency is further enhanced by screening of the HVAC units with roof parapets and lessening views of parking areas with large landscaping buffers. The project has been determined to be categorically exempt pursuant to CEQA section 15332 and fill development projects. The project was also previously determined to be consistent with the Northwest Chico-specific plan EIR, which was certified at the time the specific plan was adopted. No new environmental impacts have been identified that were not contained or analyzed in that EIR. Staff would like to acknowledge the EIR and the EIR's role in the development of the project.

To achieve further consistency with the specific plan. It was a design guidance item to not provide any parking between the building frontage or the building and the street frontage and to have buildings that directly enter onto the street. However, due to the unique site having three street frontages, they decided to make the building most visually prominent from the esplanade, which would be the main frontage, and locate most parking to the sides or rear of the building. Thank you. Thank you. Great answer. Kelly, would you mind going back to the history slide? Sure. I really appreciated that. Of course. So one thing, and I know the answer, but maybe for those who are new, the last two numbers on a plan development permit, does that signify the year that it was approved? Yes. Typically. So I believe that would be 2011 was the first approval and the modification followed in 2015. Okay. And so for 10 years, this has been, the thought is we planned for what we think could go on a piece of property. So with this land, we thought it would be something that would have a great commercial mix with restaurant office service uses. And so for 10 years, it was, we had a permit for that and nothing happened on that. That's correct. Okay. All right. Great. Thank you. Any other questions? That was a really good one because that was something I thought about and forgot to ask it. So thank you. Like the history of the site. Yeah. You know me. I like to ponder like, well, what could go here? So that's a really good example of a site where we're changing the use now. So thanks. Any other questions for staff? I will turn it over to our applicant, Greg Bites. Thank you. Good evening, commission. I'm Greg Bites. I'm the architect for the project. I have one minor correction that just kind of expands on the concept that the owners have made, gone above and beyond to try to fit into that model. I'm going to go ahead and ask you to answer that. So the first thing I wanted to ask you about is the multi-tenant format. There were actually two plan development permits that were, one that was approved about 15 years ago and then a second 10 years ago. Wow. That moved the buildings around, redesigned and neither. Having said that, I think the staff report was pretty complete. I'm here to answer any questions as well as members from the owners and contractor and civil engineer. Okay. So does anybody have any questions? I've got a quick question. So I'm always about the neighborhood and obviously there's houses right there and I think this is an optimal for those neighbors pretty much. I mean, the best case scenario, right? But I think, are they weekend after hours? I mean, they're pretty much an eight to five place. Are you aware of that? Correct. Yeah. Mondays, Mondays, or Saturday and Sundays are probably closed as well. So. I believe so. Yes. Yes. Okay. So, yeah. So, I'm going to ask you about the So, my question was, no worries if you don't know this, but what might be some reasons why this wasn't chosen to become a multi-use site? Nobody took interest in it. I don't know the details. I mean, it was vigorously marketed by the realtors for...I'm not privy to the details of who was or wasn't interested. But obviously, there wasn't enough interest to make it financially feasible. Okay. Thank you. Sure. Anything else? Thank you. All right. Thank you. Do we have any further public comment? I just got really loud. Okay. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. All right. Mr. Stevens, you don't want to come up? No? Come on, Jane. Not all night. All right. With that, I will close the public hearing and bring it back to the Commission. Are there any questions or motions? Well, I'd just like to make a comment that the parking, bicycle spaces, and the landscaping all exceeded the numbers. Some quite significantly. And I think that's a kudos to the owners and designers on that. I'm curious. Isn't there a 50% shade cover requirement for all parking lots? Does staff know the answer to that? All paved areas exclusive of entrance drives are required to be shaded at 50%. And the project proposes 50% shading at tree maturity. Okay. Nice, thank you. Good to know for reference. Well, I'll make a motion that we adopt the resolution number 21, or sorry, that the Planning Commission adopt resolution number 21-06. Do I need to read the rest of this? Mm-hmm, the whole line. Sorry, did you say go on? Yep. Oh, okay. I'll second. All right. It's been a while since I made a motion. Can you tell? I think they'll need you to say the full sentence, Bryce. Okay, I just, there's a parenthesis in it, so. Okay, I move that the Planning Commission adopt resolution number 21-06, attachment A resolution 21-06, approving plan development permit 20-03 for the property identified as APN006-820-013. Okay. Second. Thank you. So we have a motion by Commissioner Goldstein and a second by Commissioner Wall. All in favor that the Planning Commission adopt resolution number 21-06, approving the plan development permit 20-03 for the property identified as APN006-820-013, please signify by saying aye. Aye. Aye. Any opposed? A motion carries, 6-0 with 1-0. Anyone absent? Thank you. Item 5, regular agenda, we have none. Item 6, reports and communication. Bruce. Madam Chair, we don't, I don't have anything to add to reports and communications. We're going to need to cancel your next meeting because we don't have any agenda items for that. Okay. Great. And then while we have you here, I know we have some new commissioners. Do you know with COVID restrictions lifted, is there a chance that we'll have to put in if there will be any training opportunities that are planned. We're keeping an eye open because we have money in the budget to send you to the Planning Commissioners Institute, the new Planning Commissioners. And yes, we're keeping an eye open. They don't have it in person yet, but if they do, and we'll let you know if there's any virtual ones. I mean, if you can do any online ones too. But yeah, we'll keep an eye out for those for sure. Thanks, Bruce. All right. All right, item seven, adjourn. All right, everyone. That's it? I'd like to thank Tony for doing such a great job just stepping in like that. He gave me an easy one this time. Yeah, that's it. There we go.
