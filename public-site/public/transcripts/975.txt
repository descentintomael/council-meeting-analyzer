But it's great to see because even though they're in the far north region, it does cover various areas too. So we also had Mayor Steinberg from Sacramento was on the call as well, and it was pretty cool. And you guys are going to tell us a little more about the proclamation here, and then we'll have you tell us a little bit about it too. So whereas the Sacramento County Office of Education hosted the NorCal Cyber Mayor's Cup 2021 in partnership with the California Community College Far North Regional Consortium, and whereas the NorCal Cyber Mayor's Cup is an annual event bringing together students from middle schools, high schools, and colleges across the region to compete in single-day cybersecurity competition, and whereas the NorCal Cyber Mayor's Cup brings away awareness to the cybersecurity careers and provides students an opportunity to engage in team-based learning, and whereas the Pablo and the Other People team from Chico Senior High School includes students Connor Denhart, Della Earhart-Evans, Pablo Ragoza, Samuel Zwinger, and we're coached by Jonathan Andrew. I'm sorry if I've massacred your names. Be it resolved that I, Andrew Coolidge, Mayor of the City of Chico, on behalf of the City Council, do hereby congratulate these students and urge members of the community to learn more about cybersecurity as well. So thank you for leading the way on that. Thank you, Mayor Coolidge. Hi, I'm Wendy Porter, and I work with the North Far North Regional Consortium. I help our Far North seven community colleges align their tech programs with the needs of our industry, and a big part of that is developing their workforce. So the Mayor's Cup is actually, it takes place all over California. However, what it allows us to do is do localized regional competitions. So these guys can compete with other people who are in their league. They don't get taken over by San Diego because they're so amazing down there, but soon we will. So this year we had middle school, high school community colleges compete, and it was, let's see. A month-long event. So the goal of this isn't to just let the kids have some fun doing a competition. It's to bring community awareness to cybersecurity skills that are needed in our community. So right now we have over close to 80,000 open cybersecurity jobs in California. So it's really important to get students aware of these programs at our community colleges and to succeed and go into the workforce. So with that said, Modoc County actually won the middle school competition. College of the Redwoods won first and second place in the community college competition, and Mendocino won third. We had Ukiah High who won second place for high school, and Povlum, the people from Chico High, for the high school awards. So we're very happy and excited for them. And I would like to let you know that none of this could happen without the faculty members. So Jonathan Andrew led his team, made this happen for them. Well, not all the way, but you just can't do it without that faculty champion. And the important thing there is the high school faculty getting involved with the local community college faculty really drives awareness to this need. And the reason this is a Mayor's Cup competition is because we want to bring the community, government, and industry partners in as well. So with that said, I'm going to turn it over to Jonathan. And why don't you show the trophy, too? So, this one, this one. Oh, the small one. Yeah, sorry. The Steelers trophy. Yeah. So thank you again for inviting us to come here and present this to the whole council. The Traveling Cup, like you said, goes to the mayor of the city that won, whereas the high school gets their own individual trophy that stays permanently with them, as well as they get medals and coins and all those fun things. I'm really proud of you. I'm really proud of this group because they're a diverse group, not only in who they are, but what classes they come from, from what I teach. Not one of them is in the same class. Not one of them is in the same subject. I don't even teach him in class. So that's really neat to be able to have them come together this way, especially in the year that we had, to have them make this success happen. So thank you. And then thank you for Wendy for keeping me informed as to when due dates are. All right. So thank you very much. Yes. I'm going to be proud to display this in the city. I didn't break it. And I didn't either. And we won't. And hopefully it will be back in Chico again next year. So we'd love to see that. And thank you so much. Can we get a picture? Sure. We can do that really quick. All right. I'd probably be that one person who broke the huge trophy. All right. Thank you. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yes! Alright, there we go. Okay. One, two, three. Thank you so much. I have a couple things for you too. Is this for members of the council? Yes. I don't have one for everybody. Alright, we'll share. Thank you. Alright, now we'll move on to presentations from Caltrans. Chris, are you here? I was told to be nice to you too. I heard that. Welcome. Thanks for being here. Thank you so much. Let's see here. Oh, perfect. Perfect. There we go. So, thank you for the warm welcome. My name is Chris Ledeas, as mentioned. I am a project manager for Caltrans in District 3 in Marysville. And today I'm here to talk to you guys about two separate projects that we have ongoing for the Chico area that will get constructed this year. The first project is on State Route 32, also known as North Avenue. And this project is a safety project. It will involve rehabilitation, have some complete streets elements. We have a lot of work to do.
