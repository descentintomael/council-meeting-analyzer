 Thank you. All right. All right. Okay, so welcome and good evening. We'll start the regular 6 o'clock meeting of the Chico City Council and call the meeting to order. And invocation is Police Chaplain James Burkett. Welcome. Thank you, Mayor, Councilman. So let us calm our hearts and minds and souls as we begin to call the meeting. Let us begin. Lord God, we just thank you for being a part of our life and walking with us and walking with the city, watching over it and guiding it, guiding these council members to do the things that need to be done to help this city grow, survive. We thank you for your presence in their hearts and minds and their thoughts and guide them. And help us as community to be responsible people of this city to help us to grow and be healthy communities. So Lord, we just ask you to guide their decisions today, help them to seek your wisdom as they make decisions for the betterment of this community and protect all of us. And we want a reputation and reputation and reputation and reputation and reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation!! reputation!! reputation a republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. Madam Clerk, could you do roll call, please? Council Member Brown, Council Member Denley, Council Member Huber, Council Member Morgan, Council Member Tandon, Vice Mayor Reynolds, Mayor Coolidge. Mayor Coolidge, if I could interrupt before you get to the consent agenda. Sure. I would like to request an item be added to the agenda that arose after the posting of the agenda that I believe requires immediate action, and I'll explain the agenda item quickly, and then the code section that would allow or disallow my request. There's been a number of emails going back and forth between a member of James Gallagher's staff, City Manager Mark Orm, the City Attorney, some of our own other staff, and myself, that involve acting Deputy Director of Codes and Standards, Housing and Development, Community Development for the State of California, and it presents a possible removal of obstacles to an emergency situation, and I have to give credit where credit is due. Mr. Gallagher's office reached out to the state to learn more about what I'm going to refer to as Sprinklergate, and it was a request of Mr. Gallagher's office. Mr. Huber's that made them reach out to the state and get some information, and we've gotten that information, and I would normally wait until the next agenda to do that, but because we are in somewhat of a crisis situation with the weather and the homeless population. So in order for that to be added to the agenda after the posting of the agenda, the code section says upon a determination by two-thirds vote of the members of the legislative body that be present at the meeting, or if less than two-thirds of the members are present, which is... a publicable, an anonymous vote of those members present, that there's a need to take immediate action and the need for action come to the attention of the local agency subsequent to the agenda being posted. So I would like to move that we add this item to the agenda and ask the city clerk for a roll call vote to deal with it, and also looking at the size and length of the current agenda and not being at all optimistic that we will get through it, I would just assume deal with this first, if possible. That's my motion. Yeah, and I do thank Councilmember Huber and Morgan for following up on that. I think it's a great thing. I just recently become aware of it myself, so I think we probably should take a vote and make that's a motion. So we'll... I'll second it. Thank you. Councilmember Morgan, can you just succinctly...I think what you're requesting is a discussion about building code and the sprinklers specific area to that. Specific to...um... Sheltering. And the emergency shelter ordinance and the various and multiple constraints that we believe have to be met in order to provide shelter. Okay, thank you. And there may be some difference of opinion coming from the state. Okay, thanks. Thanks. Alright. Okay. Councilmember Brown? Aye. Councilmember Denley? Yes. Councilmember Huber? Yes. Councilmember Morgan? Yes. Councilmember Tandon? Yes. Councilmember reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation N-2920. The public may view the meeting on Comcast Channel 11 or via streaming video found on the city's website. Public participation during the meeting in the Engage Chico Civic Engagement Program was available for citizen input on individual agenda items prior to the meeting, and that was accessed through the city's website with closing comments at 4 30 this afternoon. Public comments will be accepted by email during the meeting prior to the close of comment on any one item. The public is encouraged not to send more than one email per item and not to comment on numerous items in one email. So if you have concerns on multiple items, send multiple emails. So item number two, moving on to the consent agenda. The consent agenda is for those things routine and nature and can therefore be enacted in one motion. Do we have any comments on the agenda? I believe we did through Engage Chico, but any further? I believe we received one from Sue Steiner in your public comments via your email. And then let me just, I apologize, I've got too many agendas here. We did not receive, oh, Melanie Welchel, I apologize, and Sue Steiner were comments on the consent agenda. So you have a total of two in Engage and one in your public comments. All right. Has everybody read through this? All right. Any no votes or disqualifications from members of council? All right. Entertain a motion. Second. I have a first and a second. Madam Clerk, if you could take the roll. Okay. It was a motion by Councilmember Morgan, seconded by Council, excuse me, Vice Mayor Reynolds. And it also included on there an ordinance of the City Council of the City of Chico amending Title 10.52 of the Chico Municipal Code relating to abandoned vehicle abatement and amending, adding, or repealing provisions in Title 10.52 of the Chico Municipal Code for the administration of enforcement by the City's Code Enforcement Division. That was the final reading and adoption. Councilmember Brown? Aye. Councilmember Denley? Yes. Councilmember Huber? Yes. Councilmember Morgan? Yes. Councilmember Tandon? Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds? Yes. Mayor Coolidge? Aye. The consent agenda carried 7-0. Thank you. Okay. Business from the floor at this time. Members of the public may address the council at this time on any matter not already listed on the agenda by sending an email to publiccomments at chicoca.gov. The council cannot take any action at this meeting on request. May be under this section. Clerk, how many comments do we have? Okay. So, business from the floor. We received 42 in the Engage Chico platform and you have those in hard copy. And then I believe you also received public comments emails prior to the meeting and that was from Heather Schaefer, Nicole Nava, Phyllis Sandy, Jim Alexander, and Pam Woodson. And if you would like, while you're reading the Engage Chico, I'll read the names of those individuals who submitted. Yeah, that'd be fine. I do need a few minutes to read through the last few on Engage Chico. I'm sure everybody else probably does too. Okay. Go ahead. So from the Engage platform, Jeff Creed, Kirsten Norris, Andy Wilhoit, Ruth Sarnoff, Elizabeth Elliott Carter, Take Chico Back, David Peterson, Sasha Sarnoff, Mark Kloelokian, Michelle Cooper, Kimberly Burke, Jacqueline Glover, Mark Ruffner, Fred Ludwig, Casey Kroninger, Michael Lang, Juanita Sumner, Ashley Jones, Deborah Jones, Matt Dutton, Heidi Witzel, Louis Nava, Kelly Stevens, Jackie Smith, Tom Daz, Catherine Doshman, Jessica Montgomery, Kathy Whiteley, Kelly Cummins, Michelle Burton, Megan Zimmerman, Erica Witowski, Karen Wilhoit, Gary Vertel, Amy Marie, Jessica Haggard, Stephanie Giacovelli, Kim Dietz, Chanel Fowler, Susan Smead, Daniel Rodriguez, and Nicole Nava. And just to double check, Danny, did we receive any additional comments on business from the floor? There is one additional one from Mike Trollender. Okay, so there's another one in your email inbox from Mike Trollender. And a question from a fan wrote a comment a few months ago. And a comment wrote a comment a few months ago.

Thank you. Does anyone need more time? More time? Okay. Take a few more minutes. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Chico obviously the ones that come in email are not shown to us but while we take time to review comments I'd encourage the general public to do that as well. All right everybody ready? Okay so we'll move forward with item 4 public hearings hearing 4.1 hearing on appeal of the City Manager's administrative review affirming the Public Works Director engineering's determination that the sewer fee calculations for PM 15-03 were applied correctly to the Chico Municipal Code section 15.36 190 and this is continued from the October 6 2020 council meeting with additional supplemental information and an appeal by Northstar Engineering. So I believe Mr. Ottoboni has a presentation or Mr. Manager. I can go ahead and take that real quick. As a matter of efficiency this was brought forward at an earlier meeting it was delayed until now and I think that staff has had an opportunity to sit down with the appellant and your city attorney representing the City Council with regard to this matter was successful in coming up with a solution that would I think believe I believe would allow the appellant to either agree to or not and so I'm going to pass it over the city attorney. And I believe that there is a consensus that this is that we found a path forward so with that City Attorney Jarrett. Thank you Mr. Ormond. First Mr. Mayor we should recognize that this hearing was begun at a time prior to three members of this current council being on the council. So we need to for purposes of continuity here identify that and then each of the members state that they indeed have revoked the council's decision. So I believe that there is a consensus that this is a path forward. So with that City Attorney Jarrett. And a comment from a reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation So reopen the public hearing at this point. I'm new to this still. So let's reopen the public hearing at this time. And we allow no more than 50 minutes for public input and council discussion questions for staff, 10 minutes. And then our appellant is Jamie Jinn, spokesman for the appeal. Applicant was Jim Stevens on behalf of the project appellant. Applicant rather, additional speakers. Okay, that's for me. So do I need to close the hearing now or do we move forward? We move forward after comments and everything else. At this point, we have additional information to add into the hearing. That information includes the staff reports that are prepared. And as Mr. Orme described, we've had, I've had discussions with Jim Stevens on behalf of the appellant and have better understood what the appellant's contentions are. And after doing so, tend to agree with some of their contentions. And in the process have found a middle ground here of sorts to present to the council. And that would be that the applicant record an easement, granting an easement along to these pieces of property, to these parcels that are being created, and that there also be a maintenance agreement associated with this sewer line going across these properties. If you were, everyone recall, the issue here is a contention by the appellant that the fees associated with requiring the appellant to connect to a sewer that will not be built in Hagen Lane, which is the sewer line that is currently in use. So the fees associated with that are essentially duplicative and would not be required since they already have a sewer line available. And so in lieu of making them pay those fees at this time or ever, as long as they have this alternate sewer method of access to the sewer line along to a reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation! reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation All right. Anything further from staff? No. And I did actually mislist that the appellant was Jamie Jim, which is of course on item 4.2, not on 4.1, so my apologies. All right. So moving forward, any public comments on this item? We received one additional comment, and that was from Ruth Sarnoff in Gage Chico on this public hearing. All right. That one kind of came in late, so if you haven't looked at that one, let's take it a second. So what is staff's suggestion in terms of how we approach this? The recommendation would be to take the staff's suggestion and put it in the public hearing. Okay. So we have a testimony of Mr. Stevens. I see he's in the front row here. And then if there's anyone else who needed to speak via email, also address that into the record as well. Perfect. Mr. Stevens. And then at the conclusion of those two things, if there is email testimony and Mr. Stevens needs to rebut it, then he would have time to do that. At that point, close the public hearing and then have discussion and then a vote. All right. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Good to see you back. Congratulations to the new councillors. I'm Jim Stevens, representing the applicant, Mr. Seidenglanz, who owns the property on Huss Lane and Hagen Lane. And I appreciate Councillor Morgan's suggestion at our last hearing to come back because in my presentation, which was lengthy, and there's lots of kind of idiosyncrasies with this issue, I believe that I brought almost as much confusion as I did clarity. And so it was a good opportunity to come back. And we met again with the city attorney and city manager. And I believe we came to an agreement on an acceptable solution as the city attorney has just laid out. We prepared the draft languages. He and his assistant have fixed those, actually. And we agree with everything that we've... we've seen so far. So as he stated, we are not taking service on Hagen Lane where we were asked to pay fees for. And so we agree with this solution and I'm happy to answer any questions if there are any. All right. Any questions from council? No. Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. Seidenglanz. Have we received any comments? Just the one in Engage from Ruth Sarnoff. And I can hand that to... Mr. Stevens to see if he'd like to rebut. Unless you want me to read it out loud so he can rebut. Go ahead and read it out loud. Okay. Regarding this parcel map, appeal of staff decision, list of issues relevant to the appeal requested by council at the October 6th, da-da-da-da, raises obvious questions. What is not obvious is where in the 1991-92 Chico City Plan do you show data ensuring water sufficient for continuing growth on your California hazardous waste superfund? And if so, what are the plans, legal clause, blocks need for EIRs and CEQA? So... Mr. Stevens, do you want to come back up and respond? Mr. Mayor, I would also add that there was an email sent titled Item 4.1, but the content of it talks about Item 4.2. Okay. Gotcha. So... And we've had a lot of people replying to 4.2, so I can understand the confusion. Correct. It's why I didn't actually note that. Yeah, thank you. Thank you. So, yes, I believe the concern is for proximity to the existing TCE plume that stems from historical uses from many, many years ago that flows south and west, just like the ground does in all of our area. And there is a plume out there, but it was recognized years and years ago, and it inspired Cal Water to construct... Okay. ...a water line down Hagen and actually further to the west of the railroad tracks just to avoid any potential domestic contamination through an individual well. All of development in this project are on California Water Service, and they are tested regularly and provide safe and clean water for our community. Any other questions? All right. Thank you for your time. I had a question for the city attorney. Fire away. Me? Mr. Gerard, if the appeal is to be granted, is the text in the supplemental information email that you sent us, is that text adequate for making that motion? It is. Yes. Okay. So I'd like to make a motion that we grant the appeal with the... Okay. ...the condition that the applicant make adequate assurances that the subject property will always have the right to connect to the sewer system at Hess Lane as follows. One, applicant shall record an easement granting the subject property perpetual access to connect to the city sewer system in Hess Lane. And two, ensuring that the existing lift station be maintained or alternative means be established to maintain the connection to the city sewer system in Hess Lane. And two, that applicant shall enter into an agreement with the city to be recorded against the subject property. Stating that the city is waiving sewer main installation fees because the applicant has provided feasible alternatives means to access the city's sewer system and that the city reserves the right to charge sewer main installation fees if the subject property can no longer access the sewer system connection at Hess Lane for any reason. All right. Do I have a second? Second. Okay. Madam Clerk, please. Take the roll. Council Member Brown. Aye. Council Member Denley. Yes. Council Member Huber. Yes. Council Member Morgan. Yes. Council Member Tandon. Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds. Yes. Mayor Coolidge. Aye. Carries 7-0. All right. And at this time, we'll close the hearing to the public on this item. Move item on to item 4.2, appeal of use permit 20-07, Greenfield and Esplanade Apartments. And here... I'm hearing of City Council, which will conduct a public hearing regarding an appeal of the Planning Commission's decision to approve a request to authorize multifamily residential development in the office residential zone district. And should we do ex parte communications or anything along those lines prior to the report or after? It's up to you. I mean, if Mike wants to go ahead and start with the report prior... I want to say something before Mike starts. Okay. Okay. Fire away. So, I don't think this is likely to... I don't think this is likely to work, however. We're under the public hearing portion of our agenda. And this isn't a public hearing. I know we're going to talk later tonight about how we're going to conduct our meetings in the future and what's the emergency and what's not. When to let the public in and when not. And when the Zoom meetings will work and when not. We've gotten... I don't know how many emails... I can't speak for everybody else. I live in District 1. This is in District 1. I've gotten a lot of emails, a lot of concerns. And I'll talk about that when we do ex parte communication. To not allow the citizens of this area to come in who actually paid for this appeal as a group and express their concerns, I think, kind of denies them the right to what a public hearing is. I know that this has been put off once. And I don't even know if I can do this. But I would make a motion that this be put off again until we can let those people either back in or they can get on a Zoom meeting and express their concerns. About the very homes that they live in and have invested in. So Mr. City Attorney or Mr. Mrs. Sorry, Madam Clerk. What would be the process for not listening to a public hearing? At this point, make a motion to open a public hearing for purposes of continuing it to a date certain. No. So make the motion to open the public hearing. move it to a date uncertain until we can allow a real public hearing? So typically you move a public hearing to a date certain so you don't have to re-agendize things. When that date comes up and the condition still exists, you would reopen the public hearing for purposes of continuing it to another date certain. Okay, this whole thing could be a matter of fertility. So Madam Clerk, if I were to put this off for a month, the chances that the Zoom meetings would work? Percentage? 100%, 50%, 20%? So I'm trying to think if we can pull that off. I would say absolutely. I don't know what my situation will be with my being out, but I believe my staff would be able to adequately address that. The Zoom components are being installed this month and should be in possibly by next week. But we'd like to test it and be able to really test it to see if we can get it to work. Okay. So I would like to see that the public, this will be the first time the public will be commenting on items at an actual meeting since March via virtual attendance. So I'd like to work out the kinks so by middle of February, I can see it running smoothly and knowing that it's in place. In February? In middle of February. So I would make the motion to, I got to say this right, open the public hearing and then delay item 4.2 until the second meeting in February. And then I don't know if you're going to be holding the second meeting, so I don't know. That could push that off until later, depending on what happens later in the meeting. I'm just trying to make it as soon as possible without being too far out. So just how many similar appeals or items have we gone through during? Well, as council, obviously not all of we have we gone through since. Have we done any? We really haven't had appeals at the council level, except for the one that we just heard prior. And that was during a time when the council opened up the meetings up and allowed him to come in, Mr. Stephens, to address. So the appellants and the applicants are able to come in, and we do provide the public comment portion. We also have public comments coming in via the public comments in addition to just regular emails to the council. So I do want to just note that we're not precluding public testimony. It's just in person is what I believe Council Member Morgan is talking about. Thank you, Madam Clerk. That's absolutely correct. And I will say this, and I've said it before. I'm not going to say it that way. I'll say it a different way. Okay. When you mentioned in person, there is something incredibly different, especially when somebody is talking about the investment in their own home or a community that they've lived in for 20 plus years that does not come out via email. It probably doesn't come out via computer either, via Zoom. Personal is best. I don't know when that's ever going to happen again. So I'm trying to get to a happy meeting instead of just reading about somebody saying, gosh, there's going to be a whatever looking in my backyard. It doesn't matter. It doesn't have the same effect. So that's the reason for my motion. I'd second the motion. Okay. We have a first and a second. Any further discussion? I thought you had a motion. Microphone. I just assumed you wanted to comment. Sorry. All right. With that, we'll take the roll. Okay. And then just for the record, I would like to note that we did receive 18 comments from Engage Chico as well as three from via public comments, three emails, and then we also received six regular emails to the full council. And I will call for the roll. Councilmember Brown? Aye. Councilmember Denley? Yes. Councilmember Huber? Yes. Councilmember Morgan? Yes. Councilmember Tandon? Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds? Yes. Mayor Coolidge? Aye. Carries 7-0. All right. So we will not open our public hearing. We do appreciate you coming, Ms. Shin. I thought we did open. I put a note that he opened the hearing and then continued it to the second meeting in February. And we do not close it at this point? We don't close it because it will continue. All right. All right. Thank you. That was an excuse but we got it. All right. So at this point, and will we save those or can we at least save those future notes and emails regarding that? Yes, I will bring those forward at that. And they may submit new ones or maybe in attendance or however we're going to be holding that. So absolutely. Okay. And just a note, if you're at home watching this either on the computer or on TV, that this item will be continued and that an application will be made available to you. February meeting when we have Zoom capabilities. Hopefully we'll be able to take your comment personally. So please make a note of that and that would technically fall into the third Tuesday of February. Alright. With that we will move on to the regular agenda. Item 5.1 CalPERS Pension Costs and ULA Restructuring Presentation. You actually made a motion and a second and it was voted on to hold the discussion from the first item, I believe. The item that arose after. Oh, you are correct. Alright, that's why. Okay, so I guess we call this inserted 5A or something along those lines. So, Mr. Morgan. So before I begin my commentary I think it's only appropriate to hand the floor to Council Member Huber that had the foresight to make a request that one of us probably should have thought of a long time ago that led to all this. I don't mean to put you on the spot, Mr. Huber, but I don't want to steal thunder that is rightfully yours. Well, I'm just so delighted that you brought this up this evening. Thank you. So, when we had the discussion a month or a month and a half ago about sprinklers being sort of the obstacle to being able to open safe space, you know, it became clear that we were sort of bound by some things that we didn't appear to be able to overcome locally. And so I thought of Assemblyman Gallagher and I wondered if he would be open to trying to bring that forward in some way so that we could overcome that locally and I was delighted to find out that he was open to doing that. And I just found him very receptive. I just gave him a call. I had only ever talked to him, you know, just sort of in passing at a couple of meetings. And I found him to be very receptive and that was two weeks ago I called him and then I hadn't heard anything more about it until this evening. So, I'm just thankful that he took the ball and ran with it and now it's in your court. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Hubert. So, let me begin, because this is complex, with a little bit of what I believe the history to be and I will do my very best to leave opinion out of it. And the reason I point out that it's very complex is I don't think necessarily anybody is truly at fault. Whatever. So, we declared an emergency shelter crisis it had to be some years ago because Mayor Coolidge was here when we did it. And we had a lot of people who were here and that supposedly opened up all kinds of possibilities for emergency shelter and things. And then we had the fire and we had COVID and we had all those different things happen. In the past, we've had a number of homeless providers, shelter providers do a great mass of different things as far as sheltering people. We've had low barrier shelters and no barrier shelters and high barrier shelters and we've had people apply for different shelters and it's gone many, many different ways. One of the sheltering programs that I was more familiar with because Ms. McLaughlin took me on a tour of it was Safe Space. And Safe Space, from my perspective, worked fairly effectively using churches and gymnasiums and they were in different places all the time and I'm not exactly sure where they got their funding and I went out on a Friday night and wow, you're really making a difference. And it was eye-opening. And so, move forward and suddenly Safe Space this is my opinion, at least how I believe this worked, was told, oh, you can't do this. You can't do this anymore because you have to have a building with sprinklers on it and then this has to have this and then all of a sudden we started looking for different possible shelters for the city to partner with whether it was True North or someone else to do some kind of emergency situation. We looked at this building and that building and I'm trying to leave all these things out because I don't remember what we're allowed to talk about and not. And there was this constraint and that constraint and this had to have sprinklers and that didn't and this couldn't happen for this reason and the airport was too far away because it wasn't close to transportation and it was an emergency declaration so you could do it but then it had to have sprinklers and then you were going to have a warming shelter and a warming shelter was okay as long as they didn't sleep because if they were going to sleep it had to have sprinklers and I'm just like, and people wonder why California is such a mess. Right? And both sides of the aisle are getting blamed for it. My side is getting blamed for it. Here's moving people out, you don't care where they go. And the other side is getting blamed for you've been here for two years and you haven't solved anything. That was a little harsh, but I know that you've gotten some of that flack unjustifiably. So, we get this letter from Kyle Krause acting deputy director of codes and standards and I'm not going to read the whole thing this is basically what it says. The intent of the emergency housing provisions in the appendix A allow newer existing buildings, cabins, tents, manufactured homes, RVs, etc. to be used for emergency housing without requiring a change of occupancy. It gives the authority to the local enforcing agency, that would be us, to determine fire and life safety requirements but does not mandate the installation of sprinklers or change of occupancy. And it goes on, generally emergency housing is a temporary use and does not require a building to be reclassified and modified to include fire sprinklers. And this is like on the letterhead of the housing and community development. I'm like, here we go. Right, let's go out to our shelter people, let's go out to safe space, you're good, talk to your churches, do this, do that. So then there was some disagreement as to is that what the code really meant. The way I read this email, I personally would not have answered back and said, well I read the code a different way. But somebody did. And they said, well here's all this other code that says this, that, the other thing. To which the housing and community development guy in Sacramento, who is the ultimate authority, said yes, privately owned and operated facilities that are not owned and operated and maintained by local governing body, either by actual ownership or an instrument such as a contract or a lease, may not be eligible. It doesn't say will not be eligible, does not be eligible. May. Has the operation of the private facility may not be to the standard of the care that the governing body would provide for a public facility. May, may, may. So there's a lot of mays in there. And then these guys go back and forth and they disagree on a bunch of code that none of us would ever want to read unless you've prior read the King James Bible. And then maybe it would kind of make sense. So the reason I bring this up, there is some disagreement. There is some gray area. There are people all over the community and they're saying a variety of different things. None of them are saying, you know, throw these people out of the park. There's some people that would like the people out of the park. There's some people that say they've got to have somewhere to go. There is a homeless solutions coordinator that I don't see in the audience. Oh, she's right there. That's why I didn't see her. She's right in front of me. And Susie, please come up when I'm done with this, and Tony as well, that worked for a month. We're looking at this, we're looking at that, we've got this code, we've got to hit this, we've got to hit this. We've got to get on this facility and then somebody else didn't want to be a part of that. And there was this code and that code. And we're sitting here going, this has got to be one of the most compassionate communities in California. I don't mean that in any negative way. We want to help those that want to be helped. For sure. And our hands are tied this way and our hands are tied that way. COVID is coming down. We had the presentation from the county. The county came in and said, I'm paraphrasing, the governor is giving away millions of dollars and we didn't apply for any of it. We're giving it to new people. Thanks. Go back to where we came from. So here we are. There's disagreement. What this council needs to know, my opinion, this council needs to know, Ms. Jarrod, this is where you come in. What is the truth? In Roseville, they are housing homeless individuals in churches. They're doing it in Yuba City. These are not facilities that are owned or operated by the city. So are they ignoring the code that is so deep that they can't find it? Or did they perhaps not read it? Which I would probably recommend. I am pretty sure Mr. Krause of the Housing Community Development Agency was with a pretty big red flashing light saying, Chico, do whatever you want. We're not going to come get you. We're part of the problem. He didn't quite say it that way. But when he's saying the intended emergency housing provision is to allow existing buildings, cabins, tents, manufactured homes, RVs, etc. Is there a municipality in the state of California that owns RVs and tents and cabins? Why is it in there? We need an opinion. This is why this is an emergency. We've got a homeless solutions coordinator working with various agencies that want to do things and are being told no. We have large donors that are wanting to make a difference and are saying there's nothing you can do. We have a police department that's been tasked with restoring the gem of Chico, Pidwell Park, to its former nature. Someone's telling them we can't really quite do this because you can't do this over here, but we don't know that we can't do this. All I know for sure is there's a lot of different opinions and other communities are moving forward. Why isn't this one? Should we hear from staff? Mr. Orem, do you have staff staff is happy to comment on it, but I think that the city attorney could probably bring clarity to the legal constraints of the varying buckets. Why don't we start there? I will apologize to my colleagues and the public at home. This was an emergency measure. If staff seems like they are unprepared to answer my questions, it's because they didn't know. This all happened late yesterday and today. I didn't know how to move forward. I said, hey, council, can we talk about this at the next meeting, the next meeting? But if we can do something tonight and Safe Space could open a church tomorrow, for the first time in eight years, we've done something immediate that had an actual impact on somebody's life right now. No pressure, Mr. Chair. None. All right, thank you. As Mr. Orem pointed out, there are essentially two silos here that we need to identify One deals with the housing crisis declaration and rules applicable to that. The other deals with private development. And that is covered in a different section of the government code dealing with navigation centers. And so staff has been diligently trying to assist in both of those realms, in particular the navigation center aspect. And that's where staff has been going around trying to help providers find a building with an existing use. And these private nonprofits are looking to open these. Under that body of the law, the city does not have any oversight, does not have any ability, essentially, to stand in the way with a discretionary approval. And the intent here of the legislature is to make things happen quick. So I think that's the first thing Under those uses, there are some aspects of the building code that would come into play. And I think that's where some of the issues with which portion of the building code to apply and how to apply it have been raised and being seen as the city sort of getting in the way when in fact identifying what building code applies. The other silo is the housing crisis declaration. And that is when the city actually takes on the development or opening of a housing shelter. That needs to either be a city-owned property, city-operated, leased by the city and someone else operating it. And under that scenario, then there is broad waiver that can happen. The issue with the RVs and such, that is applicable under the California Building Code Appendix O kicks in there. So, can safe space open at a church? The honest answer I give you having very short notice on this is I'm not entirely sure. But we're getting closer and closer to that. And I think that we're at a point where the HCD has replied back that the government code dealing with the housing crisis allows local government entities to use existing facilities as shelter without requiring strict compliance with the building codes. But private facilities that are not under the control of the city may require modifications to be used for purpose other than the original intended use of the building. Yes. The may there, I don't know that it's entirely permissive as in may or may not. I believe that it means that... Correct. Well, it's not a statute either. That's HCD articulating that. So, I think the one I'm not sure fire way to address this would be for the city to get involved and do the lease and then have the operation happen by Safe Space. By doing it that way, you're under the housing crisis declaration and the waivers that are associated with that would apply. So, just let me ask you a question for clarification. So, if the city of Chico were to go to Safe Space and say, we will rent those facilities on your behalf for a dollar, we're good? Yes. Is the city then in the sheltering business and we're taking on the liability of opening and running a shelter? There are immunities in that housing crisis declaration code that apply. I believe the there are immunities but, you know, you can sue a ham sandwich, they say. I think that we would I haven't heard of any lawsuits being levied against shelter providers, but you know, we would probably want to have some assurances there in the form of operational standards and insurance provisions and things of that nature. And then having a hand in it. So, any further questions from council for Mr. Jerry? All right. I We have some Well, I might have some for Susie. Okay. But I don't want to cut off anybody else. Go ahead, Ms. Rounds. I have some comments, but I think I'm going to wait until we hear from Susie and then we'll All right. Okay, yeah. See if I can settle down a little bit. So, if we do it through the city, it sounds like we have a very strong position. If we chose to not do it through the city, then we go back to the May, and it's a more risky position to do it from. Would that be a correct understanding of what you said? Risky in the sense of, are we really doing our job to apply California building codes? Yeah. That's where I see the risk. All right. So, can we Well, obviously, I think we'd need to find out how some of these other communities are doing it as well, if they're acting under that code. And obviously, it's not at your fingertips right now. But All right. Susie, why don't you go ahead and just add to our conversation here. I think we'd love to hear your thoughts on this. I'll do my best. Yeah, I have worked in multiple jurisdictions where different ordinances that Mr. Jarrett has explained have been in place, and I think Mr. Morgan mentioned Roseville. So, I was the Continuum of Care coordinator in Placer, Nevada counties for over two years. And I worked with the Gathering Inn. The Gathering Inn is a nomadic shelter. Changes every night to a different church. I don't know, maybe a half a dozen to a dozen different churches. I called them a little bit before this evening and asked if anything had changed since I had worked with them. And they confirmed that in their county, it is not required to have sprinklers. That program has been in existence at least six years that I'm aware of and maybe longer. Placer County, big county, have a substantial homeless problem like we do. So, it sounds like something that we should probably be addressing to solve our problem like they are. All right. I have a question for you, too. So, how quickly do you think safe space will be up and running? I'm pretty sure they're listening right now. So, they're probably making moves and chatting about it as you guys are speaking. Probably rather quickly. And do you think they'd enter into an agreement where we pay a buck, give them a buck kind of thing? I would venture to say they would. All right. Any questions? I was going to ask, I think, Mr. Mayor, the question you did, I was going to ask Susie, you're the homeless solutions coordinator. Is that your actual title? I'm missing it. Yeah, as of today, yes. Oh, I just called you the homeless czar and somebody said, well, that's disrespectful. I'm like, no, it's a perfect... I get called lots of things, it's all right. So, if we gave direction tonight, and I know you're doing this anyway, everybody's listening going, okay, this, that, the other thing, this is a path forward. You're fairly certain in what your next move should be? Yes. Who to go talk to, all those things? Yes, I am. Okay. Thanks. Do we even need to make a motion about anything? Susie? So, since we don't have anybody from Safe Space here, they weren't aware that this was coming up, do you have a sense from them as to whether, because they've sort of been rebuffed with their attempts to try to get a church set up, do they have some churches sort of on standby in case they could? None I would say that are on standby because they were told they needed to be sprinklered, but I'm sure they have connections for churches that they've used in the past that weren't sprinklered that would be interested in working with them again. Okay. Thank you. You're welcome. All right. And I think to make it official here, we probably wouldn't need to move forward on a motion, but let me do this for one second, too. So, Madam Clerk, have we received any comments on this item since we began speaking? No. Okay. Just... you know, waiting for the public to weigh in. My thought here, and I'm not sure about anybody else's, so please chime in, is if we move forward with the direction that Mr. Jarrett outlined as obviously clear, and Mr. Huber, thank you for bringing this forward. I can't tell you how indebted our community is to you for this because it is very, very important as we all realize. So I'm glad we made some movement along that side. I think we're But that being said, can we also move forward in both directions at the same time? So whoever wants to make the motion here, can we move forward on, you know, making this happen with Safe Space, but at the same time having him further the conversation and look into that May question, whether we can run these as a private base as well. So... In that second part, I'm understanding what you're recommending is that that would be authorizing me to... and the rest of the staff to reach out to these other cities figuring out how they're doing it as well. Absolutely. Absolutely. Okay. I mean, we might as well move forward with both solutions as quickly as we can. I think that's the purpose of us talking about it tonight. So... So I would make the motion that we activate our ability to be able to allow or engage the city with local churches and with Safe Space to arrange a lease contract that will allow them to start operating as soon as possible. Part one. Part two would be that we direct the city attorney to investigate what's being done in other communities if it is different than the city running the shelters and how that would work. I'll second that, Mr. Huber, and to follow up on... I'm not sure this is where you're going, but later on in the agenda we had an item that we asked the city attorney, you know, can you find a way to make this happen legally? And we got a very thorough and very good analysis. And one of the reasons that we went to a not in-house city attorney is the amount of experience you get in an office that represents different municipalities and different agencies. So I'm partially complimenting you for what you've done for later work, but also to follow up with Mr. Huber's comments to know that what you're hearing is our desire to find a legal way to get around these things. And this is a long second, I'm sorry. But also, if Tony's back there, I did not mean to make you feel attacked but I think what came out was both sides were right. And I know you're just looking out for the city and I appreciate it, but at the same time we had to ask the question and do what we did. So, good job by everybody. Alright, further discussion? I just want to clarify the motion. Is the motion to move forward on having the city look into leases, or are we going to be discussing that further after the motion? Just to clarify. So the purpose of the motion was to approve the city to move forward with leases. At least with safe spaces, my understanding. Yes. It doesn't have to be, but a similar type. Okay, thank you for clarifying. My one thought and concern on the city taking charge on part of it is I do not want to be taking the onus off of the County Department of Public Health right now for providing shelter, so I do get nervous with the city getting involved. I would love to hear more about the safe spaces or any other shelter options on a private thing. It's just my thoughts. Alright. Vice Mayor? I just I'm a little bit frustrated, so bear with me. Mr. Huber and I had a meeting with our entire staff just about a year and a half ago talking about this exact thing, and I essentially almost nothing has changed since that time. So I'm I don't want to point fingers or call out staff, but I think when we have a meeting and everybody comes together that was in that meeting, when we were talking about Fair Street and there was HCD funds and there was a provider that was willing to run it, I think staff would automatically try to turn over every rock and do everything possible to try to make things happen. And from what I can tell, I don't think the housing crisis was still there then, and the private development versus navigation centers was there then. So I'm just super bummed, because we had a great team that came together a year and a half ago that were working on this, and it makes me sad that it didn't happen sooner. So to those out there that think we've been doing nothing, I assure you there have been many, many meetings, and Mr. Huber can attest to that, and I'm just disappointed. I'm glad we're moving forward. I'm not sure that I completely understand the private development versus nav center for the public. Because it's called a navigation center, Mr. Jared, then that's what allows you to have different if it's a private entity and it's a navigation center, that's what allows the special use in being to not have sprinklers. I'm not certain. I don't know that it allows it to not have sprinklers. I believe it actually requires sprinklers at that point because that is a, with the HCD's comment this morning about 1045, was that changing the use would require application of the building code. Okay. Alright. Thank you. Alright. I'd just like to add one more thing, and you know, I appreciate your comments about my involvement in this, but it wouldn't have gone anywhere if it hadn't been for Assemblyman Gallagher working with Councilmember Morgan. So I really appreciate their part in that. Noted. Alright. Ms. Preston, do we have any comments that come in in the last few minutes? I just want to double check here to give the public an amount of time. No. Okay. Mr. Jared, the thing that I would say too is if you're able to find that answer out quickly and you need council to reconvene to address that, I think we're all willing to do that. So under an emergency type movement forward. So the sooner, the better. Absolutely. To round out the discussion here, the Housing Crisis Declaration that Chico adopted in October of 2018, my recollection, I'm looking for it right now, but my recollection is that it does require council to acquiesce to plans like that. So we likely would need to come back. If not, then it falls under the city manager's authority to simply proceed. So, um... Our city manager also has the emergency authority under the emergency that we're in right now to be able to do some of this stuff so we don't have to have emergency meetings, correct? Well, and that's a kind of a third silo here that I opted not to discuss. There is, you know, if we were to really talk about, you know, the housing, I think it would be defensible if the housing crisis we're talking about was due to the natural disaster we're talking about. We have a population that is, you know, the epidemic is exacerbating but really didn't cause that. So I wouldn't say to go that route at this point since we have these two other options. Alright, well, I do remember that very, very well. That particular meeting. And yeah, I think we can make some movement there. But come back to us as a council as a whole, I think Mr. Oren will indicate to us whether or not we need to set a meeting to move forward on that or whether he can move forward with the direction that he has. Madam Clerk, I do see one comment. And I know this is odd because of the way this item has been approached, so I'm actually going to read this one. This is from Dennis Finger. And the comment is, I support the council's motion to activate the ability to engage with the city with safe space, allowing them to operate as soon as possible. The housing crisis is a dire situation with houseless folks in danger of harsh winter conditions. No housing shelter is currently available and this motion would enable safety over the winter, which I fully support. So I do apologize to our community as we're moving forward on this as an emergency issue that we have not amply allowed comment on this issue. But with that, Madam Clerk, could you take the roll on the vote? Okay. Council Member Brown? Aye. Council Member Denley? No. Council Member Huber? Yes. Council Member Morgan? Yes. Council Member Tandon? Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds? Yes. Mayor Coolidge? Aye. Carries 6-1. All right. And I think with that, we're going to take eight-minute break. Eight. Eight minutes. We'll see you then. Expected we'll move forward at this time on the regular agenda with Item 5.1, CalPERS Pension Costs and UIL Restructuring. Presentation, Mr. Dahl. Thank you, everyone, and good evening. And this is going to be very exciting and a fun-filled ride tonight. As we talk about CalPERS, it's like one of my favorite topics of all time. And I hope it is yours. No, I'm just teasing you a little bit, but Finance Committee met back in September, and we discussed pension obligation bonds. And the recommendation from the Finance Committee was to bring it to the full Council for further discussion. So that's what we'd like to do tonight. We have representatives from NHA advisors that are going to come and share a presentation. Before they come, I want to kind of give you a little introduction here from a staff standpoint of what the City has done to deal with the CalPERS issue. And when I say the CalPERS issue, just as a little background, we're part of the CalPERS retirement system. And in that, it provides us a monthly retirement when people retire. The City pays for part of that, and the employee pays for part of that. Every year, CalPERS does an evaluation, and they say how much, if we had to pay out all the benefits to everyone, how much would we owe, or is there enough in the fund to cover it? Presently, our plans, we've got one for the miscellaneous plan, and then for the safety plan, those are roughly about 65 to 67 percent funded. That means there's 67 cents for every dollar of liability to pay. That's not a horrible thing. I mean, it's not great, obviously, but there are some organizations that are far worse shaped than that. That liability right now is approximately $140 million for the City of Chico. So we're faced with what do we do to minimize that or reduce that? Well, the City has been working on these for this issue for quite a while, and so I just want to spend, if I can, about five minutes just to outline what the City has done in the past, and then I'll lay a foundation for talking about pension obligation bonds. So the City, again, is powered by CalPERS, and back in 2013, the Governor Brown at the time proposed this new California Public Employees Pension Reform Act, PEPRA. What it did is it allowed for new benefit tiers and new benefit formulas. And a benefit formula is basically set up to tell you how much you will receive when you retire. So a classic member is someone that was in a CalPERS plan before 1-1-2013, and for miscellaneous plans, those individuals receive a benefit of 3% at 60. Under PEPRA, it went to 2% at 62. It doesn't sound much, but it's a big benefit. So, there's a big difference there. The other thing for a safety plan is 3% at 50 is for the classic, and it went to 2.7% at 57. So, a big difference there. For the City, we are, presently our makeup is 45% of our staff are on the PEPRA plan versus the classic plan. That is dramatically increasing as we go forward each year. Back in 2013-2014, during the Great Recession, there were pay reductions that came and hit almost every employee that was here. For approximately 12 years, there have not been COLA adjustments for most city employees. There's a few of the bargaining units, for instance, there with like the water pollution control plant. I think that those employees may have had a slight adjustment for COLA, frankly, because they couldn't get anyone to work out there because the salaries were so reduced. So, there are some instances where COLA's have been, but generally speaking, COLA's have not been in play for employees, although they may still get a step or a merit increase if available. Back 20 years ago, the employees used to not pay their share. You have, as I mentioned earlier, the employee share and the employer share. Back then, the city paid for both shares. That was a nice perk if you were an employee, but that no longer is the case here. The employees pay their share. We as a city pay our share, but what has happened over the last few years is negotiations have taken place where employees now pay a portion of the employer percentage. And most of the bargaining units pay at least 3% of what the city pays. These negotiations have brought savings over $500,000 each year by picking up the employer's share over the last few years, $500,000 annually. As I mentioned earlier, that $140,000, that's called the unfunded accrued liability. And we make a separate payment on that each year, and we can have the choice to make that on a monthly basis or on an annual basis. If we make an annual payment in July of each year, that saves us one month of interest. So over the last four years, we've almost saved a million dollars by prepaying that. So we've focused on doing that. The other thing that we created a couple years ago is a Section 115 trust, putting dollars into that trust that can later be used to pay for the pensions in future years, pensions that are liabilities in future years. City management, our city manager has been quite involved with interacting with CalPERS leadership and being part of the solution, interacting with them and saying what can we do to help? So that engagement has taken place. And then internally, what we've done the last few years, and those of you who have been on the council for a few years have known, is we spend time on a five-year projection. That used to be an afterthought in our budgeting process. Now it's right. It's usually one of the first things we talk about saying, okay, if this budget is approved, how does it affect five years down the road? And then we also created financial emergency budget policy that we looked at this last year. And what that entailed is if we ran into financial issues, that told us what to do. So when we were dealing with COVID, we looked at that policy and said, okay, what are our processes that we need to go through if we need to enact a budget? And that's what we've done. So that's what we've done. And that's what we've done in our budget emergency situations. So we've gone through and we've done a lot of things. Now on this slide here, it shows some further options. The item highlighted in yellow there is what we want to talk about today. The other options there is a fresh start accounting or 10 years or 15 years. That would take that UAL, that unfunded accrued liability, and contract with CalPERS and say we're going to, instead of paying this off over 20 to 30 years, we're going to pay it off over a 10 to 15 year payment plan, which we go, hey, that might be great. CalPERS charges a rate of 7%. That sounds great, but we're in a situation where we have to watch our cash flow. So we don't have extra cash sitting around. So this is not a viable option for us. The last item there is reducing staff and services. And that's, no one wants to reduce services. So that brings us to where we're at on the pension obligation bonds. I'm going to sit down and talk to and allow our outside experts to come in from NHA advisors. They helped us with the sewer bond refinancing this last year. And they also provide these services. So tonight we're here. We're going to be talking about and a discussion of pension obligation bonds. Please feel free to ask questions. The presentation is set for about a half hour. So that's what we've tried to really do that. We could probably go on for quite a while. But we won't do that. Staff would like to come back at our next meeting and get your direction on what you would like us to do going forward with that. So no decision needs to be made tonight. Just more listening to the process and education. So with that, Eric Scriven is here and Mike Meyer is here from NHA. And I'll turn it over to them. Okay. Good evening, Mr. Mayor and members of the City Council. I'm Eric Scriven. I've been here before. We also refinanced our redevelopment debt a few years ago and some consulting projects. So thank you for having us. I'm going to we're going to tag team this a little bit. Mike and I will cover this in tandem. I'm going to cover the first page, which is really your what you're going to pay. About five years ago, your unfunded liability as capital was $1,000.00. And that's what you're going to pay. And you're going to pay $100 million. And what Scott said was $100 million or thereabouts. Now it's $146 million. And the problem is it's an escalating payment structure that is hard to budget around. And I don't know that it's helpful for you all to know, but it's not unique in California. Many, if not most, if not all of the repayment shapes from CalPERS to public agencies in California look like this. So we're here to provide a high level education process. It's really scratching the surface. This presentation can go 30, 40, 50 pages. We cut it down to 14 to stay within 30 minutes. We hope to get questions that we can respond to. We're going to focus on certain portions of the presentation. But the theme is that you have this debt and that one of the things that you're going to be able to do is to get the money back. And one of the options is to refinance, but the operative word in our mind is restructure so that it works for the city's budget in the near term and long term. Mike? Good evening, Mayor, honorable council members. I'm Mike Meyer. I manage our pension group. The concept of restructuring the UAL program is a very important one. It's a very important one. It's a And the UAL with CalPERS involves the city issuing debt or bonds and using that money to pay off all or a portion of the city's UAL with CalPERS. So essentially converting the 7% debt with CalPERS into lower cost bond debt. We'll get into the market, but current interest rates for other cities who have issued pension bonds have ranged from about 3 to 4% over the last year. The typical structure that is very much used for doing a UAL restructuring is known as a pension obligation bond. This is an unsecured debt, which means the city doesn't have to pledge any collateral, but it does require a fairly unique court validation process. And that's a process that takes about 3 to 4 months. It does not lock the city into issuing a pension bond, but it does provide the city the authority to issue a POB now or any time down the road. As I mentioned, one of the benefits of restructuring the debt is a lower interest rate. The other primary benefit is really to have a clean slate to be able to restructure the payments in a way that are more sustainable over the long term. As the finance director mentioned earlier, there are risks with pension bonds, and we have a couple of slides that talk about those risks as well. Before getting into the financial structure, I want to talk about the benefits and risks. Before getting into some of the benefits, risks, and what a restructuring might look like for the city of Chico, we have a couple slides on the market. Slide 11 here lists some of the cities who have issued pension bonds in the last year or so. The rates on those bonds range from about a 260 up to a little over 4%. And that is really dependent on the state of the market, how long the debt went out. So what was the rate of the debt? Was it a 15-year bond versus a 25 or a 30-year bond, as well as the credit rating? So obviously a triple A rated city is going to have a lower interest rate than a triple B rated city. So one of the benefits that we mentioned earlier is the ability to have a clean slate to reshape the payments in a way that are more sustainable over the long term. So on slide 12 here, we didn't obviously have enough space to do that, but we did have enough space to show the restructuring strategy of all the cities we looked at on the previous page. So we pulled out a few here. You'll notice the blue bars represent the UAL repayment schedule with CalPERS. This is very similar to the city of Chico's, escalating payment shape through 31 with a decline over the next 15 or so years. In the orange line, that depicts the new repayment shape that these cities set up using the pension bond structure. You can see on the bottom left, the city of Hawthorne, that's one extreme where they went out a full 30 years and had level payments, whereas on the top right, you could see that the city of Riverside chose to just eliminate that peak over the next 15 years, but then have declining payments to kind of mimic the current shape. And then you have a couple of cities here, Ukiah in the top left and West Covina on the bottom right that were somewhere in between. Where they had kind of an escalating repayment shape for the first 25 years or so, and then with Ukiah, they had a declining payment shape in the last 10 years. So it really meant to show that the strategy of smoothing out payments is very common, but there's a lot of ways to really slice and dice a restructuring, whether that be the term or the level payments versus escalating payments, as well as the payout. So what we're looking at here is what is the payout size. A lot of cities have chosen to fund a fraction of their unfunded liabilities, so 40 or 50 percent. Some cities have chosen to restructure the full 100 percent. So in terms of what a restructuring could potentially generate for the city of Chico, there are dozens of options that we can look at from a structuring perspective. This is a fairly complex type of financing. But we wanted to start with what we can look at from a structuring perspective. simple and high level and so we assumed three different terms, a 20 year, a 25 year, and a 30 year, and for each we assumed that the city would structure it to have level payments. We also assumed that 85% of the unfunded liability would be paid off, which would bring the funding ratios from the high 60 percentile to about 95%. And then we are assuming interest rates from a couple of recent pension bond transactions, which as you'll see are in the mid to high 3%. We're also making the assumption that these bonds are callable, which means that the city would have the ability to refinance this debt or pay it off in 10 years. And so slide 14 is a graphical representation of what these options look like. And again, in the blue bars, this is your current repayment schedule for the $146 million UAL debt with CalPERS. And then the colored lines are each of the three options. So the orange line is the 20 year maturity, the teal line is the 25 year, and the royal blue is the 30 year. And you can see, very similar to a mortgage, the longer you go out, the lower your annual payments, the shorter the duration, you'll pay more on an annual basis. But, you know, we're not going to be paying that much. So we're going to be paying that less over the long haul. The next slide is a summary of some of the numbers that are tied to that graph we looked at on the previous page. And so you can see here in the columns moving from left to right, that goes from the shortest maturity of 20 year up to the 30 year on the right column. And as you move from left to right, you can see that the interest rate shown in the middle row moves up slightly. As you move out longer in maturity. So right now, 3.5% we estimate for a 20 year deal, moving up to close to 4% for a 30 year. I would say these are slightly conservative in the current market, but we want it to be conservative at this early part of the evaluation process. From a present value standpoint, the savings are in the relatively similar ballpark. So it ranges from about $34 million. On the 30 year up to $41 million on the 20 year shorter scenario. But where you see the big difference is if you look at the bottom of the chart, the cumulative savings versus the savings over the next 15 years. So if we look at the cumulative savings, the shorter maturity maximizes cumulative savings. There's about $60 million over the term versus $14.7 million on the 30 year. But if you look at the first, the next 16 years, it's the inverse. And so the longer maturity, the 30 year, because you're able to bring down your annual payments lower, that maximizes the savings over the next 15 years. That's about $74.5 million of savings over the next 15 or 16 years versus the 20 year scenario, which is about $43 million. On an annual basis, the savings range from about $2.7 million to $2.7 million. Up to $4.6 million through that the next 16 years, which is really where the city is facing the larger cash flow challenge. On slide 16, we just talked a little bit about some of these takeaways in terms of the present value savings as well as the tradeoffs between a shorter and a longer maturity. The one thing we didn't touch on is a word we like to use a lot, which is reduced. And that's the And so one thing to keep to consider when you look at different options, is that you're going to have to look at how much you're going to be able to pay for the next six years. And one of the big things that we're going to be looking at in terms of the future options of a pension bond is how much resiliency is in that structure to handle the future ups and downs. And so there are a lot of folks that may gravitate towards a shorter maturity because the interest rate might be a little lower, but your annual payments are higher in the beginning, which doesn't create as much capacity to handle any future shocks. And so during a lot of our work during these processes, one thing we like to look at is resiliency to future economic shocks as well. I'm going to turn it back to Eric to talk about the risk slide. We're moving right along. This is great. Maybe pause at this moment. Are there any questions on sort of the very high level restructuring? Options in the tradeoffs? Short, long, flat? I had a quick question. So have you done cities that are at shorter time periods than 20 years? We have, yeah. I think we did a water district that was very short, 15 years, I believe. 18. Okay, 18. Okay. I'm assuming the cost savings. There is no one size fits all. It's a completely personal, you know,! The elected body determines what they, the pros and cons on the risks and benefits and cash flows. So, yes. And then have you had any cities that you've worked with who've had to do a second bond for any reason or to handle any additional? No. No. Yeah, that has not happened. We have gone back to some of the earlier cities. These were small transactions that we did four or five years ago. Very small compared to these numbers we're talking about, but still very important to those cities. And as we'll talk about on the risk, the more money you give to CalPERS, the higher the risk that you're going to have a market timing risk. You know, they have a bad year in that first year. We're going to get to that on this page. So that was one of the considerations for those cities four or five years ago where the last money you give and we can tinker with the shape and get you most of the benefit, but maybe not all the benefit. And since then, there's been ups and downs. You know, CalPERS has missed their mark, I think, three or four out of the five years. And they've added some base. And so we're looking at those cities to see if we can reach those were private placements, not public bond offerings. So we're looking at trying to tinker with that. So I don't know that we're going to do a new bond deal. We might be able to renegotiate with the private bank in those instances. Different kind of circumstances. But, you know, it's not static. We're not saying that it's static, but we're saying that the restructuring for many cities is worth evaluating. Thank you. Anyone else? Percy. I think, Mike, and we all know what the primary benefits are. The restructuring can enhance the sustainability in the near term and long term. There are some budgets that are in place. We're not going to get the savings. I would stress that the numbers that you saw on the previous page, those are compared to the existing CalPERS repayment shape. That's set at 7%. So to the extent CalPERS doesn't earn 7%, the savings are compressed. You've given them some money and they're not earning the 7%. So we're not going to get the savings that we should. We're going to get the savings that we show on the previous page, which are very, very large. We like to sort of condense it down to a very simple statement, which is over the long term, if bond rates are, say, 3% to 4%, over the long term, if CalPERS earns more than what your bond rate is, then you're going to be better off. You know. There are some nuances to that as far as market timing. But I think that's the simple way to look at it. And I think that that's one of the reasons why you see heightened interest by public agencies across the state, because interest rates are so low. So the benefits, I think we know what they are. So I'd like to read the risks, because the risks are important to understand. And there are ways that you can evaluate. Savings are ultimately dependent on future CalPERS returns, which are unknown at time of issuance, which is the primary concern of the Government Finance Officers Association. And there's no way to eliminate that. That is a risk that's present. Present value savings occur if PERS earns greater returns than pension bond interest rates, which I just mentioned. And there's no way to eliminate that risk. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to use the risk that they just stated. And near-term losses exasperate this risk given the large lump sum deposit into the market. We call that the market timing risk. You know, if you have a bad year, the year CalPERS earns negative 10%, the first year that you give them the money, that extra money that they earn that negative 10% on is what amplifies the city's position and the loss. So that is a risk. There are ways, we've been doing this with the cities that are interested in pursuing this, to evaluate those risks with a lot of statistical analysis and thousands of scenarios being run by the actuaries. And that's something that is helpful to do as part of a very comprehensive evaluation process that we advocate. So, and if I can just interrupt, so is some of that analysis done with, of course, more and more agencies pulling out of it and going to the bond in that respect? So will that have any effect? Say that again, sir? So as more cities take this route, it won't affect their returns at all in terms of their availability to CalPERS? CalPERS is going to have more money to invest? Right. Well, that's a great question. Does them? Does the fact that they have billions more that they're investing impact the rate of return on their investments? I can't answer that question. I can answer that question. Billions of dollars is not going to make CalPERS any more competent. I know. Nothing has proven it. Pardon my question. At all competent. Okay. Thank you. Any more questions on this page? As a firm, we tend to dwell on the risk. We want to make sure. That everyone is well aware that there's unavoidable risk with giving CalPERS money. They're going to earn a rate of return over a period of time. And the fact that there is some exposure to near-term loss is amplification. So that's an important thing that we make sure is clear. There are ways that you can evaluate that very clearly and understand, especially given how low we are in the bond market as far as interest rates, what? What the true nature of that risk is. That's something that needs to be done in every project we, you know, we recommend. Yeah. As Mike noted earlier, we showed three very high-level scenarios just to capture the imagination of what the impacts could be and show some numbers. There's a lot. There's a lot. There's a lot of ways that you can look at these and evaluate and structure these bond issues where you're trying to evaluate risk and reward. So sizes, how much money, how far you want to go to the funding status. Some want to get 100% funded. As I noted, some want to give CalPERS less but try to get as much benefit on the restructure. You know, we say that. It's very important to stress test. Do you just do your safety plan or miscellaneous? There's a tremendous number of iterations that can and should be done so that it can be fully evaluated. And as you noted or saw, the maturities, 20, 25, 30-year, there's a lot of conversations that typically revolve around that. Any questions? Any questions? So if the city council wanted on the 19th to continue evaluating a pension restructuring project, this is a schedule that it could pursue where, as we've spoken with Scott particularly, we highly recommend a full vetting public with council. We want to make sure that we have a full vetting public with council. Educational workshops, whatever needs to be done so that a proper evaluation can be done before you move forward with any kind of concrete action. That's the first thing. That could be January of 2021. It could be January, February, March. It could be whatever needs to be done to give a thumbs up or a thumbs down to proceed. Once you feel comfortable that it's something that might make sense, you can move forward with a process to proceed with. That's when you sort of move forward with preparing some legal documentation and approving those legal documents because that's what you need to do to proceed with the validation process. If you approve the legal documents and then proceed with the validation process, you're not committing to do a bond deal. What you are doing is starting a three- to four-month process, which does have hard costs. There's probably about $20,000 to $25,000 of legal costs to proceed with that validation, but that sets the table for you. If you want to proceed with a bond deal, you have to do that. And then the second two boxes are really just normal bond process where you hire your team, you prepare your credit documentation, your disclosure documentation, your documentation for investment. Once your validation proceeding has been completed and they always are approved, it's just a question of how long, especially with the courts being backed up with COVID. But once that validation is completed, then you can move forward. The council would have one last opportunity to approve the financing because the disclosure document would be brought before, which is called approval. Preliminary official statement. That would be brought before the city council for approval before any kind of bond sale would occur. Any questions on the approach if you wanted to move forward? Just a quick one. You guys are willing to come back here or the finance committee as we garner more understanding and questions? Absolutely. Absolutely. We recommend that you have numerous meetings to fully understand. Our job, as we see it, is to provide all the information that you need so that you fully understand. This is probably the most complex transaction, financial transaction, that a city can undertake. There's so many structuring items, but then you back off of that. You need to really understand the risks and, you know, CalPERS, what's going on with CalPERS. So it's a total package that you really need to understand. And we recommend that. And you do that, and we're willing to do whatever it takes for you all to be nodding your heads in full understanding before you make decisions. At any point, do you open that up to public for any public education type meetings? Or is that primarily just educating us, and then it would be for us to take out to the public? I think that we're willing to do whatever city council and staff thinks the best approach for the city of Chico. Great. Well, we have some very, very good tax and PERS watchers that hold our toes to the fire pretty carefully. And I know they would have a lot of questions that I might not even think of. So knowing that you could answer some of those, that'd be great. We've been through some very robust processes where we would sit down in smaller groups, sometimes with bargaining units as well. Whoever is interested and needs to have an understanding. That the city council really wants their feedback on. That's our job. Great. Well, I think the conclusion is that this is a very complex project, very impactful. The CalPERS costs are very impactful on the city. And you're not alone. Every city and public agency in California, perhaps the nation, is facing these issues. We think that it's very important, as Scott mentioned earlier, that you're doing your five-year forecast. This is a key component of that. We think that this process should be policy-driven. And with that thinking, the city might want to consider exploring a pension funding policy. Did they all weave together with your reserve policies? Honestly, Scott, I don't know. If you've already started that process. Or many cities that are undertaking this evaluation process for a pension restructuring. But just trying to put together a very comprehensive process. The policy, the pension funding policy is a good exercise to tie everything together. And make it work with the other policies in place. So, I think the takeaway from... This presentation is... It's a process. We think that it's a very important to think of it as a process, not a result that we're trying to get to. And the result will come from that. The result will be it's right for the city of Chico or it's not. With that, I'll answer any more questions. All right. Any questions? No? All right. Mr. Dowell, would you re-approach, if you would? Because I have a question for you. So, just when these gentlemen come back to us and present again, can we at least have something in front of us that includes their fees on this side of things as well? Yes. So, what we've done is we had already started a RFP process to get a financial advisor. So, we have already gone through that process. We're evaluating those processes. We've already done those proposals. And we'll be able to... We're hopefully in the next month make some conclusions. And then that opens the door for us to go forward with the next steps. And then we would know what the costs were. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Just so we know that up front in terms of what we're dealing with on that side of things. Yep. You know, when you do a home mortgage, you always want to know how many points you're paying. You bet. All right. No further questions then? And public comment? That's all right. Okay. On this item, I believe we received six comments from the Engage Chico platform. And Danny, did we receive... We did not receive any additional public comment emails. So, just the six comments in the documents you have in front of you. All right. Everybody wants to glance over those. We're not moving forward with action on this item. So, we'll just... We'll just review those. We'll take a minute to review those and we'll move on to the next item. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. Are we good? Mr. Huber, are we good? Okay. Anyone else? All right. Okay. With that, we'll move on to Item 5.2, Vice Mayor Reynolds' requests regarding meeting schedule. So, Vice Mayor Reynolds. Thank you. I just wanted to open up a discussion on how we should proceed forward, given that we're in a new tier and a stay-at-home order. I know we're in the process of getting Zoom up and going, as Ms. Presson informed us about earlier, in allowing public participation. I don't have, to be honest, a hill to die on one way or the other on this. I thought it would just be important to us as a council to have the conversation. Do we want to proceed forward with, you know, how do we want to proceed forward? Do we want to just have the first meeting of every month? Do we want to stay on our same meeting schedule? Where do we want to go? So, I just wanted to open it up and get the general feel from, you know, the rest of the council. Yeah, any comments? I had one, if no one else wants to go. I'd almost like to see us play it on a meeting-by-meeting basis. You know, I mean, certainly none of us were sitting back in March of 2020 thinking this would be here in January of 2021, facing what we are, unfortunately. But I do think bringing the Zoom platform on is really important. You know, I would say with the exception of a special meeting, if we have to hold one on any important issue moving forward, that I'd like to see us go to just one meeting a month. But I think we could discuss that at the first meeting of each month. So, you know, beginning of February, we'd have our next meeting, discuss whether we want to hold the second one. If Zoom is going to be up and ready, I think most of us would probably feel comfortable with moving forward along those lines, but certainly up to whatever you guys think as well. Mr. Morgan? So I could, I mean, we have to have the first meeting of the month by city charter. You know, at one point we went to essential city business only, which turned out to mean anything and everything. We actually ended up having more meetings than if we had just stuck with our two meeting per month. Hopefully as we cement forward some of the initiatives going forward, the policy is pretty clear and staff can work on a lot of stuff they've been working on for a long time. And we're not, you know, continually throwing new things on them. I appreciate the council on my earlier motion on the public hearing. And I have always believed that if we're going to do things that are going to affect people's lives and we're going to have government working, the people need to have a say. The email thing isn't good enough. Zoom is something that I can live with. And I think only then because I'm forced to teach that way. It's a horrible way to do it, but it's better than nothing. So. My comment would be the city clerk knows more about all of this than any of this, including when the Zoom meetings will continue. So what I'd like to see us do is to go to essential business only until such a time we can bring people into the chambers at, you know, 50% capacity or 25%. If I can go to Costco, I should be able to come and attend a council meeting. That's beside the point. Or until Zoom is working in such a way that we can have a public hearing and I can see somebody. And in some way feel the words that they're saying. And it sounds like that may be as early as February. Anyone else? Scott. Mr. Reber. So, you know, I'd like to not see us cut back on meetings if we don't have to. But I do think essential business is a worthwhile way to go with it. And I think what we need to do this time that we didn't do last time, is define what essential business is. Because with no definition, it ends up being a lot of things. I think we're facing that in society, too, to some extent right now. So any other comments? Yeah, I have some comments. I obviously wasn't around up here at the beginning of COVID and when we kind of made all the decisions to not have public here anymore. I am curious. I'm curious as to why we're not talking about maybe having people back in a limited capacity. We speak at social distance, like require masks. We do have temperature check abilities. I don't know if anyone else is even open to considering that. But I would like to see some sort of a limited fashion of in person. So whether it's lottery to get in or you come, if you really want to speak on something, and you want to show up hours early to wait outside, you do so. I think some people would. I don't know. I just want to feel the temperature. I don't know. I'm not going to be able to tell you anything on that because I am very open to finding ways to safely have people here in some fashion. So Madam Clerk, can I ask you a question along those lines? So because obviously we have the ability, or at least some ability, to broadcast from, you know, outside, if we had a tent outside where they just came, walked up, gave their comment in front of a screen, and walked on. You know, is that an option? Is that a potential? Well, I think we would have to take into consideration the weather. Sure. I think that during the summer when we were able, starting in August, we opened up, back up to the public. They had to wait outside. We had staff come in and mark the spot six foot so that all the social distancing requirements were met. We brought in an audio company that broadcast out so that people could hear the proceedings. There were no videos being broadcast. There was no video being shown out there. I will be completely frank with you. The reason that happened was because every single department in the city helped me pull that off for one meeting. It probably cost us a couple of thousand dollars for every single meeting to do that. But it was important because the council wanted the public to be able to participate. We have that protocol down. My concern now would be how do we get them in a safe spot that they're not getting rainwater, rained on, or freezing half to death and then getting them in. We can put the plastic back up on the podium. We went through a couple of different renditions of it just because we were trying to figure out a safe way. The problem with this facility, and if you look at the amount of people we can get in right now, if we keep department heads out of this room, we can still only get about 12 people in. From the public. To actually have a seat. That's if they were all socially distancing. The problem is that we don't have the plastic in between the seats. You're not really keeping them safe by setting them and bringing them into more of a congregation area. We can look at that if the council wants to do that. I would wager a guess we might need a warming tent out there. If we thought. We did keep people when it was very, very hot and smoky. We kept them in the lobby of the municipal building. And they waited to hear their name be called or they were lined up. My staff, the city manager's department, he brought his staff to help me pull that off. And they brought people over and lined them up and then we called them in. So we can do it. I'm not sure the weather would be conducive. To pulling that off successfully. And safely for our citizens. Especially as the COVID numbers rise. And then we're going to have them be in a tent area. I'm not sure how safe that is. And I'll turn it over to the city manager if you have any thoughts. We've talked about it. We agonize over it. Because the reason we exist is actually for our citizens. So. We'll do whatever the city council desires. Obviously. As the city council. City clerk alluded to. You're constrained on space. I mean it's obvious. With 12 seats. I think that council member. Denley I think outlined it really, really well. You would have to determine what that process looks like. Is it a lottery? Is it a first come first serve? And that in itself is complex. Let alone the logistics of staff to manage it. We will do whatever this council desires. It's my hope. As it is the city clerk's hope. Is that. This opportunity to utilize a technology to have that face to face. As much as it can be determined face to face. Or seen as face to face. Can assuage some of that desire to ensure that there is that personal approach to allowing the citizens to chat. And so. So I think that that's. Going through all the hoops. Trying to figure out how to get people in here. May not necessarily. Be as valuable as just getting the technology in place. Just just just a thought. However if we want to get folks in here we can. We can get 12 plus. The media spaces in the back. We've got some benches in the back for the media. Obviously we always keep that available for the media. Outlets. But whatever it is the council desires. We'll get it done. It's we did it before. We'll do it again. To get folks in here. And so. I know last time we didn't necessarily have them seated in here. But we will get it done. We have them just come in to speak. But if there's some seating arrangements we will. We'll figure that out too. So. My my last comment would be. Just to let you know that diversified will be in here. We've reserved the chamber all next week. They'll be installing new equipment. Because of how we run our meetings. It's granicus. And everything has to be integrated in in order for it to be streamed out. And so they will be doing that. They'll be bringing in the equipment. Obviously we need time. To test it. And to work it. You know. Work out all the kinks. I know that. And just so you know. Since we've had ten months of this. And some of you may even be questioning. Why can't we already have a technical. The technology or whatever. To actually address this issue. And we we tried. Staff tried. We we used WebEx. WebEx works great. When everybody is virtual. If it's a hybrid. It was very difficult to handle. Council being here. Or. Commissions being here. And then the public coming in. And other people coming in. Via WebEx. We're hoping Zoom will rectify that. It's a lot simpler. The majority of our citizens. Our citizens actually work with Zoom. And they know how it works. So we're working. We're working towards that. But. You know. It is my hope. That we have everything up and running. By the second meeting in February. And that we will have the system tested. And that we will have the system. And that we will have the system tested. And that we will have the system tested. And I think that. And we don't know. In most communities. And so. We did have council members saying. You know. This is done everywhere. Every city that I checked into. That was using WebEx. Or Zoom. Did not have. The high number. Of citizens. Who attended. And wanted to participate. We. Sometimes have 300 comments. In Engage Chico. So if those 300 people. Are not. In the council. We're. You know. Trying to be part of some. Technology. That. Was very. Difficult. To work with. In a hybrid manner. It was. It was not. Going to be successful. So. We will make sure. That Zoom is successful. I guess I'm putting it out there. That. It'll be on my head. And. If the council. Would. Just. Give us a little bit of time. To work that out. Unless you do want to bring in people here. We can line them up outside. And. We can open up the building again. Have the heat on over there. So that they can. Some of them be warm. But again. We can only maintain. So many people in that room. In order to. To. Socially distance. So it's all with. You know. Like. The city manager said. It's all up to you. And what you would like us to do. All right. Any more comments. Or questions. I got one. Two. Okay. A few. My. Fear. I think. I'm. With. Ms. President. I'd like to get people back. In here. As soon as possible. But if it's 12. It's. It's ridiculous. It's not fair. The people that don't get in. For whatever reason. Whether they stand out there. For 12 hours. Or it's a lottery. All the. The aspects. That Ms. President. Just talked about. Remind me of. All these business owners. That like. Moved everything. To outside only. And then the governor said. No. You can't do that either. So we could spend a lot of money. Doing all those things. And I could actually go backwards. Or. And a reputation. And a reputation. And a reputation. And a reputation. And reputation. And reputation. reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation office is feeling fairly optimistic about Zoom coming in and working. We're headed that way anyway. Move in that direction. Go to the least amount of meetings possible to do essential business between now and then, which could just be the elimination of the January meeting, the second January meeting. And then February 1st, first week of February, we have to have a meeting anyway, whether it's up and working or not. It's probably a trial. And then by the second week in February, we're full on Zoom, which is not ideal, but it is fair. The hard part then becomes for the city clerk and the mayor how to manage who got in line first. And if there's 300 people that want to speak on an item, it's 45 minutes out front with that. That was part of the job. Okay. Speaking of which, how many public comments do we have on this? We received 10 comments. And Danny, did we receive any public comments from emails? No. So just through engaged. And those comments came in from Julie Cambridge, Andy Wilhoyt, Peggy Gerolin, Mark Chakloian, Fred Ledwig, Casey Kroninger, Matt Denton, Catherine Deschbach, Stephanie Giacovelli, Nicole Nava. Does anybody need any more time with us? Alright. So I think at this point, I'd make a motion to not have our second meeting in January upon what I think was a decent suggestion. I agree with Mr. Huber that I think it would be very hard to define or at least tonight engage in the subject of defining what's essential. because it's unfortunately a loaded question nowadays. But maybe if we have the clerk bring back to us. And so motion for us to skip the last meeting in January, of course we have to meet, where the first meeting in February, and at that time get an update from the clerk would be my motion. Okay. Well, I'm sorry. I'm not redacting my second, but Vice Mayor Reynolds, this was your item. I don't mean to move forward so fast without you. Are we within the realm of? Yes. Second. And that motion. I think then we reassess on the first meeting in February. So it will be back on the agenda to, I'm hoping we will be in a lesser tier and we'll have Zoom up and going and we'll just continue on. My anticipation or hope is that we only have to miss the second meeting in January. And we don't even have to miss that one. But if that's the motion on the floor, I'm fine with that. And then hopefully we just carry forward and keep moving. We got work to do. Council Member Brown. We're specifically referring to the Zoom functionality becoming a plausibility moving forward in February. Yeah. Okay. Thank you. Absolutely. All right. Madam Clerk, would you take the vote? Council Member Brown. Aye. Council Member Denley. Yes. Council Member Huber. Yes. Council Member Morgan. Yes. Yes. Council Member Tandon. Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds. Yes. Mayor Coolidge. Aye. Carry 7-0. I see our city attorney or city manager. Fire away. Yeah, great. Just to be clear on that. I know that there was a public hearing for Miriam Park on one of their aspects of their projects that was gonna be coming up. We're gonna double check to make sure that it has to happen this month. If it does, obviously I'll be asking for it. I'll be asking for a special meeting. And then also if we come up with a leasable space pursuant to council's directive, we'll be asking for a special meeting for those. I just wanna make sure that those kind of things are still good to go. If there's, those would be considered essential in staff size, so. Yeah. Well, I think we could schedule, I think we're all in agreement that at least for one of those items we can schedule for sure. Got it. So I would, on the Miriam Park issue, if that needs to be, that meeting needs to be held, can we just try to have it the normal night would have instead of trying to coordinate all our different schedules? Yeah. As far as the leasing of a building, I'm pretty sure it would all come in at any time. Okay. I'll follow up on that. I'm hearing the speaker, everybody. Thank you. All right, thank you. Okay, we're gonna move on to council member, or to item 5.3, council member Morgan's request for commissions appointment process. Council member Morgan. Okay, so the attachment, the email I sent, to the master chief pretty, covers it pretty well. And I've seen it go both ways. And when I was first on council, we made appointments, and they still had to be confirmed by the entire council. So like if I, you know, tried to appoint someone to the planning commission that everybody hated, I would not get said person. So it's not like, it sounds like it's one person, one appointment, just you get to appoint that person as long as the council approves it, it's fine. And then we make appointments. And then we move to a different way of doing it, in which you got all of these different resumes, and all the different people that wanna be on different commissions. And you didn't get an individual appointment. And what could happen, and maybe did, is a council could literally make any commission be weighted as much as it wanted to be, either in any direction I wanted. And I'm not sure that that's super fair, and it's probably not best for the city, number one. And number two, for those of us who sat through it, we had a lot of fun writing down on the ballots over and over and over. Everybody write down, okay, these people got, then these people got the most, and I'm not sure anybody was really happy with the result. So my request, and I know, I keep wanting to call our master chief, city clerk, Presson has a report on how we might go back to doing this the way we did before. My request would be that we listen to her report and consider moving back to our prior, practice. Was that enough? Yes. Thank you. Well, you have the strikeout version of the policy. I put that in. I just actually went back to the old one that we had prior and reinstated some of those things. I did a few minor housekeeping items, because it seems like our appointments are taking longer. We extend the recruitment process when we do the, do not have enough applications for you to choose from. And so that is, we're currently doing that for arts commission and airport commission at this point. The rest of them have a substantial number of applications. And so we're good with everyone else, but just the airport commission and arts commission at this time. Again, for the commission and the board, the airport commission has five members, as well as ARHPB, which is the architectural review and historical preservation board. And they have five members. So those members, those appointments, like I believe we have two airport commissioner positions to be appointed, those are still done at large with a quick ballot. The beauty of this process is that the incoming council members who just got newly elected would make nominations and they would have a form and they would know that they get to select one person that they would like to, not just the one person, but the one person that they would like to nominate. So they would nominate for the Bidwell Park and Playground, the Climate Action Commission, the Arts Commission, and the Planning Commission. I then, and then you can also nominate people that you would like to serve on the airport commission, as well as the ARHPB. What happens is I compile all those and everyone, including the council members that are currently seated and still on the council, we have three of you, you would also make the nominations for, you know, for those at large positions and we would consolidate all that and bring it back. What has happened is that in the past when we've had 18 people for one position or for one commission, it takes the delaying and the going back and forth because it requires a majority vote, of four votes or more. And when you have that large of a number, it can get diluted very quickly. And so that's what would happen. We would have a nomination form. Everyone would get the form. The individuals who get to make nominations for their person on, and it's not their person but their nomination for a board or commission, they would get to put in that person. All the, the full council gets to interview every single applicant and we will be doing that, I'm hoping, in February as a completely virtual meeting. Where the applicants can be part of the Zoom meeting and actually present their information and you can ask them specific questions. The council then takes that information and goes out and goes, okay, I'd like to maybe talk to that person a little bit more and find out what they, you know, what more of their background or whatever, and then you guys make after that interview process, you have two weeks to bring me back the nomination forms. And then I bring, I consolidate all that information. I bring it back. Council confirms the four individual appointments for each of the bodies that have seven members. And then we vote as a, as a full council, you would vote on the remaining positions. It's real, it's, again, I've been here for a long time and we've done it in several different ways. And prior to my arrival, they used to pull numbers out of a hat. So truly, it can be whatever this council wants. It can be whatever it wants it to be. And I'm happy to facilitate that. All right. Questions? Council Member Brown. Ms. Preston, so under the process that you're currently outlining or that we're looking at moving to, there is still an application process whereby the entire public is informed that there are positions available. They submit their applications and it's simply that the council members who are up to nominate at that time, would take that list and nominate. And then they can nominate from that list? Yes. Thank you for asking that. That is exactly the process. We started this recruitment back in November, the first of November. And we've extended it through December. And now we're extending it again through the end of January for the Arts Commission and the Airport Commission. All the applicants have to be residents of the community. They have to be registered voters. This is all pursuant to government code and, I mean, excuse me, our municipal. Okay. And our charter. And they have to be a registered voter. And it can be 18 years or older. So we vet that. We make sure we have all of our applications. They have to submit an application as well as a supplemental that explains about what specific border commission they want to be on. They are also allowed to apply for more than one. And we have that. They get to make their first choice, second choice. And you as a body get to consider that. So it is a. It is a comprehensive process as well as very inclusive. And everyone will get to see every single application. I will be giving you all of that as a packet. Thank you. All right. Any other questions? So public comment on this? Let me see. I'm going to go to the next slide. We had one from Ruth Sarnoff in engaged. And then we also received comment via email through the public comments from Lee Smith-Peters. I believe you had one from Karen Lazalo as well. Okay. That one. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And that email was sent at 6.30. So if you haven't had time to read it, it's there. I would also like to note that we do have two, I believe two additional vacancies. One on the Park Commission. And I'm thinking. I know we have two vacancies. And so those will be filled at large on those particular commissions. So... All right. Does anyone want to weigh in? Mr. Humber? Yeah, I had an additional question that I didn't get around to asking earlier. So the process as it changes, if I'm understanding correctly, doesn't really change the breadth of people who can apply? Absolutely not. I mean, it is an open recruitment. Council has not seen the applications. Just because there are going to be appointments made by individual or nominations made by individual council members, I haven't given those to them so they can pick through them. I give the whole... The whole packet to the full body, every council member. You get to all review them. You get to all ask questions during the interview process. When you leave that meeting, you'll have a nomination form, and you will nominate who you would like to see in those positions. And those will be compiled. Some will have individual nominations if you change to this process. And then it's included in my staff report. And so everyone gets to see that. So how do the nominations... How much weight do the nominations carry in the eventual decision-making process? Well, I think that would be up to the council. But I know that in the past, when we've done this before, that the council can see that there's seven votes for... There's seven nominations for someone on the airport commission. That may make it easier for the council to just... Just come to that decision. You'll be able to see that. If there's six nominations for one individual, you'll see that as a body. But, again, you will also be able to have a discussion during that. And I would encourage the council to discuss. If you feel like, perhaps, could we add this person to this committee or commission because they bring this and this and this, that's all up to the council. And you still get to have that dialogue. In fact, to me, you may even be able to have more dialogue than what we do in the past by just doing our ballots. We just put the ballots up there, and then we start counting. So every council member is able to make a nomination for every open position? If you went... Yes, for any of them that are not filled or nominated by the four council members. So, yes and no to that question. I apologize. I apologize for the confusion. So if you move to this platform, before, every single appointee, even if we needed 21 people, all had to be done by an individual vote and a ballot. And we would... My deputy and I would sit here and we would tabulate until we got to a majority vote on enough people to take those spots. On the positions that are still going to be at large, which would be airport commissioning, and ARHPB, and then we have two vacancies with a remaining term of two years each, those would be all filled by the balloting. Again, though, you will see a nomination form that has been compiled from everybody. I will also receive nominations from the new... The incoming council members that were just elected in 2020 would get to make an individual nomination. And I will also receive a full nomination for one position on the arts commission, the Bidwell Park and Playground, climate action, as well as planning commission. And so there would be four of those positions on each of those four commissions I just mentioned that would be nominated by the council members elected in 2020. Those... And then they would serve for that four-year period. If the position... If this position is not nominated, the process remains the same in two years, incoming council members in the 2022 election would then make their selection for their individuals for that. And that's how it worked. Okay, so let me make sure I understand. So then those seats that were filled four years ago, those boards and commissions, will come up now for the four new council members to make nominations. So in those cases, the only people that we can vote for are the ones that are nominated by those four council members? You would have to vote to confirm the appointment. So if you're a council member, you would have to vote to confirm the appointment of any of those individuals. So yes, they may be nominated by an individual council member, but they have to be confirmed and voted on and approved by the full body. You would be voting on if you're... As you and Councilmember Brown and Vice Mayor Reynolds, you're still serving out the remainder of your two-year... of your four-year term with two years. And you would be making your appointments in 2022. Subject to the vote of the full council. So I recognize it appears to be confusing. It just takes what... So this discussion, you can see how long it has taken. There are times, and we have a large number of applicants, which I am so grateful for because we haven't seen that in a long time. And the balloting process used before took about two hours or so, if not longer, to get through. And so at the time when the council voted it in, they wanted to streamline and see if they can get concurrence by looking at the nomination forms. You will receive, as part of the packet, the nomination that Councilmember Morgan makes, for any of those four bodies. And if you have concerns or you would like to look at it a little differently, you could contact Councilmember Morgan or you could bring it to the council at the meeting and say, hey, you know, if we're looking at this and these are... they're tasked with these duties, maybe we could lean towards this. And there's open discussion on those appointments. We've seen that happen where the council didn't approve an actual appointment. There was a moment that was being recommended by a councilmember. So it does happen. But again, it is... we want it to... I mean, it has to be the full body that makes the final decision. It just seems to me, and I'll address you, Sean, since you... Did you bring this form? Yes, sir. Yeah, yeah. It seems a little more limiting to me in who we have a choice of. If we have a choice of, in a particular case, your nomination or Kami's nomination or whatever, we don't have a wide range of people to choose from. We have one person to vote on. That seems a little too limiting to me. I think I prefer the way it's been. So correct me if I'm wrong, Master Chief, just to embarrass her because she's probably watching at home, my planning commissioner, Tony Scott, I appointed her eight years ago, and she ended up staying on even though we changed the rules and came back. She's fabulous. So she would be my appointment again, but the whole body has to vote on her. So if everybody hates Tony Scott but me, she doesn't get in whether I appoint her or not. Doing it the way we currently do it, her name gets thrown in a hat, and we sit here and we sift through and we sift through and we sift through and we sift through. So it's not limiting at all. It's just a little faster because the same amount of people can get it. And the only difference, to be completely transparent, certainly I've had people reach out to me, oh, Sean, you won re-election. I want to be your airport commissioner. Well, no one's actually asked for that position. But I want to be a planning commissioner. I want to be this and I want to be that. And, well, I got one the other day. I sent it to Debbie and just said, here's one more person applying for whatever. You know, I have probably a pretty good idea who I'm going to nominate. I think my nominations will go through. It literally makes the process faster. That's all it does. It doesn't limit anything at all. As a matter of fact, it's more likely that if you have a majority council, that they could eliminate somebody somebody else might want because they'd never make it to the nomination. So let's use this council as an example and say that under the proposed new rule, you had a nomination. You could say, I nominate Fred Smith, right, and would have to go, you know what, Scott, we're not going to do Fred Smith. We've got to vote no in front of him. We've got to say, no, that guy's not going to happen. But under the old process, Fred Smith, who you know is good and great, you don't even get to make an appeal for him. His resume gets thrown in the hat with everybody else's. And then the council just sits there here and writes down going, I want this person, this person, this person, this person. And to make it clear, the five of us could put seven people on any commission and you'd never have a shot. It's far more limiting that way, which is why the old council moved it to that, in my opinion. Well, I think I remember when this came up last time, I did actually voice my support of the commission. I think it was a lot of people who were in amongst that pool of applicants. So it's not like we don't have the ability to state who we're supporting. I think we can still do that. I think we just get a wider range that way. Maybe I'm misinterpreting it, but that's the way it seems to me. Council Member Brown, do you have a comment? Yeah, I can't say I know which way is the right way. I hear your arguments, Council Member Morgan, and I have my primary concerns, where that's not the case. I think that people that we know personally, we would handpick, and other people wouldn't have the opportunity to use their voice or to share their skills and experience with us. So understanding the process a little bit better, some of that fear is assuaged. I think for me, I see the possibility that it could hurt the democratic process to switch back. And so I'm not going to support it. And I have to be honest that I don't know with 100 percent certainty which is the right way. It just seems to me that... Building some consensus, having those conversations amongst the Council, allowing the Council to each have an opportunity to use their voice and make their argument on paper or whatever else, creates a little bit more of a democratic process, even if it creates more of a hassle for us. So I can appreciate your arguments, but I am going to vote against it. All right. Any other comments? All right. Before someone makes a motion, I'm going to make a comment. You've got to take public comment first. We already did. You did? Yeah. I missed that whole thing. You did. I tried. I actually spent a long time, and I think Council Member Brown, I noted at the last meeting that your comment really made me stop and think about the entire process. You know, I'm kind of looking back over the history of what's happened, and, you know, conservative versus liberal or however you want, left versus right, however you want to characterize it. This community can be at times very divided, as we all know. My fear is that regardless of who's in charge, is if they're in charge for a total of four years, what I've seen looking back at Planning Commission or when it was an at-large process is all of a sudden you would have a Council that maybe is four to three and is all of a sudden stacked with seven Planning Commissioners that follow the four. And so to me, that just limits the voice from the other side, whether it's my side's voice or someone else's side's voice or whatever it is. So that's why I like direct appointments, because it doesn't shut down that entirely. You know, we've had Councils that are six to one. That's really rare. It's generally more five to two or four to three. So I think our commission should be four to three or five to two, and hopefully, like we seem to be doing, getting along on most stuff moving forward for the good of the community. It's not just because we need to get other people, but sometimes there's issues that come up, and I think you need that other opinion in there. So I think that's why I'd support it, but I really did appreciate your comment about it, and Mr. Hubroger's as well. You know, I think this is something we all kind of struggle with, and there are certainly opinions out there, but mine is that I think we'll get more diverse boards with some in-depth conversation on both sides of the aisle rather than one slated one way or another, depending upon the majority on the Council. So? That's why I didn't support something like this, if there's a motion. Is there any other comment? So I will make the motion to move towards the, I don't know what I was going to say this, Debbie, the prior... Just approve the AP&P with the changes? To approve the AP&P with the changes. And then I would like to make one comment while I wait for a second. And I, this could come out the wrong way, but I mean it as a compliment. And Mr. Huber, I think part of what you're saying is because I don't think that you necessarily see things as this side or that side as much as some other people. And I mean that as a compliment. I'll take it. Madam Clerk. Okay. Council Member Brown? Nay. Council Member Denley? Yes. Council Member Huber? No. Council Member Huber? Yes. Council Member Tandon? Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds? Yes. Mayor Coolidge? Aye. Carries 5-2. All right. With that, we're going to take a, really a 10-minute break. 10 minutes, 9 minutes and 59 seconds. See you then. Thanks a lot. Thanks a lot. Thanks a lot. Thanks a lot. Thanks a lot. Thanks a lot. Thanks a lot.

Public comment? Yes. We received 23 comments in engaged. And Danny, do we have any additional? I did see that one as well. And that one came in at 8.19 if you're looking for it on email. All right. So we'll take a few minutes to just read over the comments if anyone needs to do that further. I think there's a few in there I need to look at. All right. All right. All right. All right. So if everybody's done, I'll go ahead and make a motion that taking into consideration Mr. Hubert's comment as well is that we move this forward with the local government committee and then also bring it back to council for a future discussion maybe end of February because it's obviously going to take some time to drill down. And a lot of us want a reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation! reputation a little bit of that also in that funding and find out.

Yes. Council Member Morgan? Yes. Council Member Tandon? Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds? Yes. Mayor Coolidge? Aye. Carry 7-0. Thank you, Ms. Preston. All right. Next one was a community cleanup request that I had asked everybody to agendize as well. That one's obviously a little more simple, but it would include city staff time. But I think it is really worthwhile to put our own effort there and show the community that we're interested in doing so. You know, during the campaign, of course, you talked to a lot of individuals, and there seemed to be really a movement within our city for people to want to get involved. And that was regardless of their political background or opinion. And I think that's something that, you know, can unify our community a little bit around things, too. And people have their passions. Certainly some of them were bike trails. Certainly some of them were just their neighborhoods. But, you know, they all have ideas of, you know, just cleaning up Chico in general. And I think it's something that we could capitalize on and would help maybe heal our community a little bit. So that's kind of why I brought this forward. But I'd love to see us do it. Ideally, the structure, you know, where we pick a date in March or April, and then we have a backup date already planned in case of rain. That generally seems to work better, you know, to organize it with the city, but also to include whatever organizations want to participate or individuals. And give them an avenue for doing it. Of course, with COVID concerns, making sure that we, you know, obviously we've had cleanups during the pandemic, and they've worked pretty successfully. So I think we can figure that out. So that's pretty much the gist of it. So any comments? You're just asking for dates and to allow city staff to promote said. Yeah, I mean, obviously, I think we would have city staff participate. So there'd be some. Some costs from the city in terms of, you know, obviously, public works may be going out and participating or different areas of the city actually participating in terms of, you know, helping with hauling off of debris, things along those lines. Certainly in the coordination side, I think there's a lot of direction that we could take in terms of the promotion side. There's, you know, certainly city staff could assist in that as well. So that answered. So, yeah, but it raised another one. Okay. So I'm obviously supportive. I think there's going to be a lot of community members that come forward and it would be super if, you know, public works can, depending on where you end up doing this, have a dumpster or truck, whatever. But we have to be careful about requiring city staff to participate in a cleanup day on like a Saturday. Yeah. Yeah. Other than Mark, he's Mr. One. Yeah. You know, I. I. I actually used to organize these many, many, many, many moons ago. They were make a difference days down in Southern California. And we used to have one of the biggest ones down there. And it was it was a lot of fun. And I will tell you that I can't guarantee any anything, but on this front. But I will tell you that the vast majority of city employees are out there volunteering their time. There will be some employees that we will have to probably pay in order to do some of the, you know, trash pickup and stuff like that. But. But by that time, we should have our team that's going to be out there doing that anyway. That was approved by council and that public works cleanup team. They're finishing up interviews. And as you know, it's going to be a supervisor, two employees, and they're just going to be going clean up consistent constantly. And they should be in place by February. So we'll have them in place and we can hopefully find a way of flexing some time that week to make that happen. So there's no additional burden. But we'll figure that out if it's council's direction to move forward with this. We'll work through that. But I have a strange feeling a lot of people will be volunteering their time. I know I will. Me too. Yeah. All right. Did we ask for public comment? No, we haven't. So public comment. We have received 22 comments in the Engage Chico platform, and I will check with Danny to see no additional emails in the. All right. So if we want to take a few minutes just to read through those. And we'll move back to our discussion. Okay. Any other questions other than a comment from a panelist. Any other questions other than a comment from a panelist Any other questions other than a comment from a panelist Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. All right. Good to go? Give me one more minute there. It looks like you still got a page. All right. All right. Any further discussion? Council Member Denner. Yeah, I echo the sentiments of many of you. I think we're all on board with this activity happening. I think it would be really healing for the community to come together because I know that there are, being at cleanups myself, before you see people from all sides of the spectrum, when we all want this. And I think it's the same thing when we're cleaning up. So I think it would be really positive. My one hesitancy with, like, picking schedules or throwing dates out there would be to make sure that we've cleaned up the mistakes that have been allowed to happen in the environment before we have community members going out to clean them up. So I'd like to see maybe from staff some kind of an update on what we're thinking on a timeline for a good amount of enforcement happening with existing camps and things that are breaking the park rules ordinances to see what we might be looking at with dates because I'd love early spring or something, but that, I don't know. So can staff give an update on maybe enforcement of that ordinance? Yeah, absolutely. And I know that we'll be talking about that a little bit later, but bottom line is that staff is continuing to coordinate, and obviously over the holidays there were a lot of constraints. I'll just put it that way. But staff is looking to proceed with ensuring that the council's directive is implemented and that will be moving forward. You know, what we anticipate is by springtime, I think that with the momentum that this council has shown that they want to move forward with getting that cleaned up and getting folks into some semblance of shelter. I think I've heard that loud and clear. And so I think that one of the things that you'll find is that by spring I would believe that things would be orderly enough to get in there and dealt with. So I have high hopes that we will, to that point, I know that we'll be dialoguing a little bit later in a different venue over these items. So at this point in time, I'm confident that it will be far along of getting folks the help that they need and getting the parks back to the order that they deserve to be in. All right. With that, I'll make a motion that we engage in a community cleanup day. Leadership by Mark Orman. Second. All right. We have a first and a second. Madam Clerk, could you take the roll call vote, please? Council Member Brown. Aye. Council Member Denley. Yes. Council Member Huber. Yes. Council Member Morgan. Yes. Council Member Tandon. Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds. Yes. Mayor Coolidge. Aye. Carry 7-0. On this next item, I'm actually, I'd like to bring up something more comprehensive than this. So I'm going to actually, so you asked that we table this item, and I don't know yet how to do that. So how do we do that? Just continue it and table it to a date certain or just later. Can I do that or do we need a motion to do that? No. I mean, it's your item, and so if you're willing to delay it, you can delay it. The council can't tell you that you can't. So delayed. You want to talk about it? So delayed. All right. So delayed. Okay. Okay. So we'll move on to item 5.7. Items added after posting of the agenda. Consideration of additional options relating to the banning syringe exchange programs, adoption of an emergency ordinance, ban syringe exchange programs, adding Title 9.29 syringe exchange programs, prohibited introduction of ordinance, the ban syringe exchange programs, adding Title 9.29 syringe exchange programs, prohibited. Mr. Jarrett. Thank you, Mr. Mayor, members of the council. So at the last council meeting, the direction was provided for our office to look into options to address syringe exchange programs. And so we have done so. We looked at a number of other cities that have taken action to ban, regulate, or zone these types of uses. And we have come up with the discussion presented here as well as an order of emergency ordinance similar to what was adopted in the city of Oroville. We took portions of Oroville and portions of the Yuba City version and put it together in an emergency ordinance, which under the city of Chico Charter, the city council can take action on tonight as a best practice with any type of urgency or emergency ordinance. We also have a first reading to go along with that. And so that's presented as attachment B. The attachment A ordinance is identical in substance. It would, as an emergency ordinance, be effective for 180 days and would ban that type of business use from existing within the city of Chico. And if you passed it tonight, it would be effective immediately and be effective again for 180 days. So that's presented as attachment B. Therefore, if you wanted to make this a permanent ban, then the attachment B would need to be introduced tonight and action taken on that at a separate, regularly scheduled council meeting. We cannot have a second reading of an ordinance at a special council meeting. So that would then, because of your action earlier in the evening, second reading would occur first meeting in February. There's any questions? Stand ready to answer. Question? Okay. All right. Public comment on the issue. Madam Clerk? We received in the Engage Chico component 60 comments. And prior to the meeting starting, we received six email comments. And, Danny, have we received any additional ones? There are two additional emails. Okay. Can you tell us who the additional emails were? Nina Ortega and Stephanie Berry. Okay. I think I saw both. All right. So let's take a few minutes here to read over all those, if you haven't as of yet. I try to keep up on these during the day, but it's always a challenge. They come fast. So this one has a lot. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. All right. All right. Council, I'm going to go ahead and read the names as you finish up. Okay. Andy Wilhoit, Roxanne Eldridge, Marcy Pittman. Stephanie Stomp, Peggy Gerrolin, Mark Ketch-Loyan, Linda Wolfe, Michelle Cooper, Kimberly Burke, Lenita Federczyk, Jody Galloway, Fred Ludwig, Casey Kroninger, Michael Lang, Heidi Witzel, Ashley Jones, Matt Dutton, Jessica Montgomery, Jamie Stregi, A.J. Lung, Tom Daz, Randy Feiner, Kelly Stevens, Nicole McHenry, Linda Kalbra, Mark Ping, Megan Zimmerman, Jessica Haggard, Michelle Burton, Denise Parker, Karen Wilhoit, Lisa Salzman, Kim Dietz, Amy Marie, Catherine DeBosch, Jeff Creed, Jackie Smith, Louis Nava, Austin Barron, Kelly Moakley, Carolyn I, James Sequoia, Larry Coleman, Kathy Whiteley, Jacqueline Glover, and a few more. Erica Witowski, Garrett Smith, Caleb Hermley, Christy Brock, Rich Burton, Chanel Fowler, Susan Smeed, Julie Threat, Deborah Jones, Gary Vertel, Daniel Rodriguez, Jody Taylor, Michelle Rettlinger, Jamie Jin, and Nicole Nava. And then the public comments that were received earlier were from Colleen Brandt, Patsy Stile, Effie Hale. And then the public comments that were received earlier were from Colleen Brandt, Patsy Stile, Melanie Watschel, Peggy Hicks, and Roxanne Eldridge. Does anyone need any more time? Council Member Denley, I believe this was your issue originally. Do you want to add anything? I would make a motion. I'm just not sure that I know exactly how, but I would be leaning to make a motion to, after a full reading of the emergency, ordinance amend Title IX of the City of Chico Municipal Code to add Chapter 9.29. Correct me if I'm wrong on my language. Doing good. That'll suffice. So we have a motion. Do we have a second? Second. A motion and a second. Madam Clerk, or further discussion? For clarification, I'm understanding your motion to be essentially item recommendations two and three to add after the full reading of the emergency ordinance. And then introduce for first reading the version as attachment B? Yes.

Mr. Mayor? Yes. I noted one word that has been dropped on page... Line 21, Line 20 of both versions of the ordinance. In that preamble statement, it should say General Welfare, which it says General. I'll do it again. No. He gets to. And then also on page 2, Line 27, there is a word left out, Infraction or Misdemeanor. It's just the title of the heading. And so we just want to make it clear that those should be included. It does not affect any of the merits of it. Duly noted. Okay. All right. Madam Clerk, if you could take the vote.

All right. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for reading along with it. Not as bad as the first one. That was a short one. Not as bad as the first one. All right. We will move on to reports and communications. The following reports and communications item provided for Council's information. No action can be taken under this section unless the Council agrees to include it on the subsequent agenda. 6.1, City Manager's Report. Mr. Orme. Yes. Honorable Mayor, members of the Council, due to the lateness of the evening, I'll be short, but I do want to make sure. I want to make sure and just highlight the fact that Cal OSHA was here in the City of Chico over the weekend during the holiday. And in fact, they did visit 38 businesses and all of them passed with flying colors. It was really something that they, I don't think they've seen in many of the cities that they've visited. And so I want to give kudos to our local businesses for doing a tremendous job and just really want to say thank you. So, and so that was a good report for the City of Chico with the state's visit. So with that, thank you. Thank you very much. All right. Item 6.2% AP 1010. Council members may verbally request an item to be agendized at a future Council meeting after stating what the item would be a majority vote of the Council's need in order for staff to agendize. Council members may also submit requests in writing. Any requests? Okay. I have another, but I tabled one, so bear with me. I would like to make a request to look at a tax measure. Okay. Any other questions other than a reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation reputation!! reputation reputation Anyway, I know we move around our primary date in California occasionally. I've lost track as to when it actually occurs. Okay, so March of 2022, possibly having something on the ballot at that point, but I think it's worthwhile for council to at least discuss it, see if it's an option that makes sense for police, fire, and roads as we move forward. So that would be the item I would like to agendize. All right, a motion. I'll go ahead and second. Clerk, can you take the vote? Council Member Brown? Aye. Council Member Denley? Yes. Council Member Huber? Yes. Council Member Morgan? I generally make it a point to approve council member requests, and I will vote. Yes, on this one as well, but I do want to say I think it's a bit premature as we get into the budget. We don't know where we are, so we're going to end up convoluting these two discussions. I think this would be a little more appropriate a little farther down the road, but here we go, so yes. Council Member Tandon? Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds? Yes. Mayor Coolidge? Aye. Carry 7-0. All right, any further requests at this time? All right, we're going to recess in the closed session before we do that. We have comments. So, Madam Clerk, the number of comments on whose side? Tammy, do you have yours open there? Did we get engaged? There are no comments engaged. Thank you. All right, no emails? No emails. All right, perfect. Make sure to read those through if you haven't already, and we will recess for closed session, or meet in closed session, and then return for a final report out. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Can I have some of my beer? . . . . . . . . . . I'm not going to do the!
