 Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for this evening. Lord, we thank you that you are here. We know your presence here. Lord, we pray for our leaders. I pray that you guide them, lead them, and you protect them. I pray that for your peace in this meeting. I pray that may your will be done and may your kingdom come. We just pray that whatever you do and decide here, that we'll do it according to your will. In Jesus' name we pray. Amen. Amen. Thank you. All right. If you could please stand and join me in the Pledge of Allegiance. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. All right. Madam Clerk, can you take the roll? Council Member Bennett. Yes. Yes. Council Member Brown. Here. Council Member Morgan. Here. Council Member O'Brien. Here. Council Member Tandon. Here. Vice Mayor Reynolds. Here. Mayor Kulik. Present. All right. And we will start with the Speaker Card Announcement. Anyone wishing to address an item on the agenda should first complete a card. It's found in the back of the room and turn it into the City Clerk. Speakers are taking in the order the cards are received. So, moving on to the Consent Agenda. Do we have any speakers on this item? We do. We have six speakers. All right. And I would like to note for them that they can address all items. There are some that have submitted numerous cards, but they can, they have three minutes to actually address the whole Consent Agenda. Okay. Can you clarify for the public, Ms. Preston, if items are pulled, they cannot individually comment on those items. That's correct, right? I would leave it to the City Attorney and the Mayor. Typically, what we've done is we have pulled a few items. We take all the public comment at the very beginning of consent as allowed by the Brown Act. And then we, if Council has another item that they're going to pull for discussion, those speakers would have already been heard and their comments on the record. I just want to make sure the public is aware of that. Okay. All right. Do we have any desire to pull any items? Yes. I'd like to pull three items, 2.1, 2.6, and 2.9. All right. So, at this time, we'll take public comment. Okay. We'll take a few more minutes. Okay. I'm sorry. Let me just turn my mic up. It was a little too loud. And if I could ask the speakers, I'll call out two. And the second speaker, if you can go ahead and make your way to the back. Our first speaker is Nicole Nava, followed by Jessica Giannola. Good evening. I'm sorry. So, 2.6, can it be addressed or not? Yes. All the comments on consent can be addressed now, even if Council's going to talk about it. I just wasn't sure since... Okay. Thank you. So, first one is 2.3. I just wanted to make a note that the exempt surplus property that is listed on the agenda is in an interesting location in that it is adjacent to two maybe hot topics before the city. And I think folks should just be aware and be looking at what's going on in Chico. And one of the things is it's near the Comanche Creek Greenway. It kind of has access point at Ivy and another one over by Estes. And the other focal point would be the proposed property development, I guess you would say, by Dan Gonzalez, where they're going to have a big community meeting on it. And I think he does fabulous work. So hopefully it would be a project that everyone could be proud of. But there are impacts for the area. So I just want to bring that up because also it avoids CEQA. Well, I'm actually happy that sometimes that is applicable when we're talking about important things that could relate to providing housing. I think we need to start getting smart. And so I just wanted to kind of put that out there that I noted that that was on the last time and then got forwarded over to this one. So good on Dan that they're having a big meeting and people have the opportunity to go and see what's up. 2.6, ice skating rink. I'm supportive of things that are good for Chico, that are revenue generators, that are family oriented, that are inclusive activities. That would be the youngest person to the oldest person, right? I'm hopeful that by then we will get our act together and that downtown will feel safe enough for everyone to go. Because like, I think everyone has the push pull up. We want to go and we want to be supportive and we want to see our community have fun music and a neat activity. Great. What are we going to do that we're going to feel like that'll be okay for everyone to participate and that we're not going to look at stuff all along the borderline. The last time when we were in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in there were probably rodents when people weren't moving around right there. It wasn't good. That is not public health and public safety. So I would just say, let's take a look at that before we ramp up to this activity. And the last one would just be the park incident. That's up for $86,884 of modifications to the budget to look at that. Never did hear the outcome of how it was caused. I suspect that maybe won't be the case. It was up near Bear Hole. That's a lot of money. Yes, we need to pay it, but let's start looking at siting and enforcing illegal fires. Thank you. Jessica Giannola, followed by Angela Rison. Council, the ice rink, we have a housing crisis right now, and focusing on an ice rink, Paradise is right up there. I know it's a tiring subject, but it's a continued subject. Because it's still unresolved. Paradise is right up the hill. We should be doing our part. I go and enjoy the Paradise ice rink. I would not be going to Chico's Paradise ice rink, or Chico's ice rink. It's just not appropriate. It's like a slap in the face to our needs currently. Yes, it would bring people downtown, but it's just like, why are we living in two different worlds? We have half the population going, let's focus on real needs where people are suffering and dying, and we have people who say, well, let's have an ice rink. It's just not appropriate. It's just not appropriate. It's just not appropriate. Plus, it seemed like the funding was coming from sewers and bikeways and infrastructure. If I misunderstood that, that's just what my understanding was. All I've ever heard the last couple of years is our roads and how we need to fix our roads, and why would we be moving funding from that? If we could move funding from that, then we should be moving it towards housing resolutions, emergency housing resolutions. We've got to focus on that in the next couple of years. The ice rink, it sounds like fun. It just isn't a reality right now. In the future, I would love to be a part of that. My kids would love it, but it just seems so wrong focusing on an ice rink right now, pushing people out of the plaza. We know what that means. We all know what that means. Push them out so it looks pretty, bring people downtown, but we have this ugly reality. We have to focus on that. Thank you. 2.7, is that still part of it? Yes. Okay, 2.7, sorry. The fire chief is requesting a budget offset for the park fire. Gosh. I suggest taking some of that funding from the Chico PD budget and putting it towards our fire budget. We live in a fire zone. We have fire, fire, fire, fire, and if we're going to have any department that has more funding than the other, we need to weigh heavier on our fire side. So if we are moving money around, money around, fire. Fire is so important. It shouldn't be coming from any other program that is helping socioeconomically disadvantaged groups or our crisis. So if you can find funding there, I don't know who paid for this 600,000 or whatever tank. We don't need the tank. Seriously, this is Chico. Unless we plan on tanking our citizens, which is really concerning, funding, unnecessary funding, should be going towards fire, those kind of things. Angela Risden, followed by Grace Marvin. Good evening. My name is Angela Risden, and I'd like to talk about the fire, sorry, the ice skating rink. I'd like to just get more information about this. I'm going to go ahead and get started. I'm going to go ahead and get started. I'm going to get started. I'm really concerned about the message that we're sending about the use of water. We're in the middle of a severe water shortage and crisis. It just doesn't seem to be sending the right issue where we're supposed to be conserving water. We're asking people to sacrifice other ways, whether it's their farms or whatnot. So I'd like to have more information on that. Thank you. Grace Marvin, followed by Patrick Newman. Yes, I'd please like to address item 2.1, the ordinances. Originally, the city had placed the updating of camping ordinances under the consent agenda, meaning that it was not open to review by the public. But I downloaded those ordinances and saw that many of them involve cruel treatment of unhoused people and their property, and so need substantive revisions in order to make them just and constitutional. After all, Martin v. Boise prohibits the city from removing the homeless until and unless the city has enough to do with it. So I'd like to have more information on that. It seems to me that the city is placing the cart before the horse. Why update the ordinances now when we have not heard anything specific about how the city and the magistrate are supposedly coming together about providing appropriate shelters for 571 homeless human beings? Once such shelters are in space, in place alongside necessary services and the homeless don't need to stay in inappropriate places, then the city can develop rules protecting Chico's parks and other property instead of spending so much effort and money making rules that are exceedingly punitive to people who cannot find shelter now and cannot afford to be criminalized. After all, when homeless people seek jobs, a criminal history is prohibitive. How about making Chico a friendly, caring place where such ordinances are constructive rather than destructive? Why not take the time to consult with groups the city attorney said he would contact concerning ordinance changes? For example, Dunlap, Bynum, and Mittman developed thoughtful and professional reconstruction of these ordinances at no cost but their time and effort. Finally, moreover, why not declare a shelter crisis now and acquire the state and federal money Chico needs to create appropriate shelter? This is unfathomable to many of us. Thank you. Patrick Newman, followed by Bryce Goldstein. A reference was made on a Facebook hit piece about garbage in the plaza and other places. Just for the record, we and I personally have hauled truckloads of trash out of the plaza. Every time we've met there, we've cleaned up our entire area that we've been. So it's easy to run around and make a video of a bunch of trash somewhere and create another demonization. It's not accurate. It's not fair. Three items on the consent agenda, 2.1, 2.4, and 2.6. 2.1, the amendments. Dig deeper. Why, since 2013, have we needed to criminalize and criminalize and criminalize? And the answer is because we have a new kind of poverty that's spilling out onto our streets. That's a social problem that could have been easily resolved if we hadn't dug a hole for 40 years. Lack of affordable housing. Lack of decent services. I know lots of people on the streets. Lots of people on the streets would take decent housing if they could get it with the kind of services they need to go with it. So, criminalize, criminalize, criminalize. We should roll back our entire city code to 2013, strike everything since then, and start over again. That's what we should do. 2.4, pension obligation bonds. The fact is the city of Chico is digging a deeper and deeper hole because we don't have a sales tax. Almost all of you are conservatives. Six out of seven. So maybe you bristle at the idea of having a tax. I don't know. But the fact is for the last ten years, you haven't collected that revenue. Whereas 99% of the cities in Chico have. I mean, in California have. That's why Chico is in a very special category in terms of its bankruptcy level. The streets are falling apart. If you go through the numbers on infrastructure alone, you can see that it's a catastrophe. Pass the sales tax. Move along. The ice rink. It kind of tears your heart out when you spend years and years and years getting to know people who are actually trying to live in our public spaces. And it can't not be something that causes anger when you see that there's this ongoing game to make that space unavailable to people who need it. The person from Canyon Oaks driving a Tahoe or whatever we drive now to come down here to spend 20 bucks a pop to have their kids skate around in a circle. Wow. Wow. It's not the people who are suffering. I have a house. You have a house. Most of the people on the streets are desperate and suffering every day. Think about the impacts on them when you do these things. The other part of that is that, and that applies to this latest closure also. The other part of this is that on an environmental level, what's it take in terms of energy to keep an ice cube frozen in a city where it doesn't get below 30 degrees for two months? I mean, we're talking about our mountains are burning down and we're going to blow tons of energy to do this thing. The whole plan is absolutely ridiculous. I don't know anybody who doesn't think so. Thank you. Our last speaker is Bryce Goldstein. Good evening, City Council. I'm here to talk about item 2.6, the ice rink. And I might repeat what some of the other folks here said. I like ice skating. It's fun. There's a rink in paradise. This item lacks transparency, clarity, and fiscal responsibility. And I'm hoping we can get some clarity on it tonight. But the staff report didn't tell me what I needed to know. And I don't think that other people could find that either. Everybody agrees that we need to fix our roads. Most of us agree we need to be fixing the homelessness problem and the housing crisis. And this project involves using $300,000 of capital improvement project funds plus over a million dollars from kind of an unclear budget. And the city is the major source to run an ice skating rink for eight weeks when paradise has already operated a rink for years. This really doesn't seem fiscally responsible to me when we're dealing with so many issues as a city. I would support this if this perhaps was a year when all of our problems were addressed as if that would ever happen. And the lack of clarity in the staff report, as I mentioned, was an issue to me. I looked through the table. I looked through the municipal. I looked through the municipal budget. And I did find where the $300,000 was located in the recently approved municipal budget. But I'm not sure where these other $1.3 million are coming from. So that's kind of a red flag to me. And I hope that we'll find that out tonight. So as for the $300,000, I get that that was allocated to the ice rink. I personally feel that our community has expressed we need more of our funds in the budget to go. The rest of the funds in the budget were going toward fixing roads in other capital projects. But that was already approved. It's the rest of the funds that are more of an issue to me. And we could or you could, I mean, decide to reallocate those funds to something that your community would find more useful if you so chose the way that I understand it. So anyway, I think we should get more into the holiday spirit this fall and winter by supporting our neighbors in paradise and hopefully If you are really into the ice rink idea, maybe you could put some funds in to run a shuttle to get people up to Paradise and support their endeavor. Thank you. So that is our last speaker. I would like to note for the record, we did receive two additional cards, but the policy has always been once the first speaker starts, that additional cards are not accepted. So that is why I didn't call two additional names. All right. Thank you. Do we have any questions from council on any of those items? Including the ones that were pulled. I have a question. If no one else does. Well, I mean, since we pulled the items, we can certainly discuss the question. Do you have a question? I'd just like to register some no votes, but it's a season at the time. Oh, okay. No, no, we'll do that for sure. I just had a question. The ice rink, the report was a little confusing. My understanding is that it's a break-even, correct? It is. Just for council's clarity and the public's clarity. I'll have Director Ottoboni walk through that so it's very clear to everybody. So, Brendan, if you wouldn't mind. Well, and I would note, Brendan, before you started, too, we did discuss it in the budget discussion. Absolutely. Back in, I think, June. It was. It was highlighted by Brendan in one of his presentations. All right. Mayor, would you mind voting with us voting on the non-pulled items? We can certainly do that. Yeah. In fact, you know, it was dealer's choice. It doesn't matter to me. We can certainly vote. We can certainly vote on the non-pulled items first. Do we have any disqualifications on the non-pulled items? I'd like to register no vote on item 2.2 and 2.5. 2.2 and 2.5. Any others or any disqualification? All right. And that was with items 2.1 and 2.6 as well as 2.9 pulled for further discussion. So is... Correct. Is there a motion? I'll make a motion. Second. Second. Go ahead and take the roll. Okay. Council Member Bennett? Yes. Council Member Brown? Aye. Council Member Morgan? Yes. Council Member O'Brien? Yes. Council Member Tandon? Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds? Aye. Mayor Coolidge? Aye. Carries 7-0. All right. Ms. Johnson, you registered those no votes, though, correct? I did. Thank you. Yes. On the number 7. So, could we go through the polled items in order? Yeah, we can. I didn't know if we'd have any questions on each individual item. Do we have any questions for staff on 2.1? Yes. Okay. Fire away. Mr. Ewing, I believe these questions are going to be for you. Can you just explain what the benefit is to the City of Chico to vote for these changes? now, given the judgment and comments by the court about particularly the airport site and obviously the constitutionality of the ordinances prior to the original reading. Certainly. Certainly. Thank you, Council Member Brown. As I mentioned at the first reading on this item, the city's ordinances had been criticized by Judge England, by several members of the community, legal services in Northern California, the ACLU. Letters were brought to my attention or mailed to me challenging the ordinances facial validity. And I heeded the comments from those members of the community. And also from the judge. And strategically, my view is if you have an ordinance on your books that is deficient, that it's best to address the deficiencies sooner than later. So we undertook the exercise of taking a look at the case on point, Martin, and also we did a survey of other ordinances throughout the Ninth Circuit and also in the Ninth Circuit. And I think that's a very important part of the city of Boise itself and some other jurisdictions of which we're aware. And we undertook the cleanup this ordinance to make it more clear and less vague and less ambiguous to address the issues that were specifically attacked by different groups that I had mentioned earlier. And I believe that it benefits the city of Chico to have a facially valid ordinance on its books. And I think that's a very important part of the process in the in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in this ordinance has some problems here. You know, you should probably take a look at them. And we did. And we said, you know what, you're right. And this is ambiguous. This is not clear. So we're going to define camping better. We're going to define storage of public property better. We're going to clean those things up. So that's what we did. And we think that benefits the city overall. Thank you for that thorough response. You mentioned the letters that were received from other parties criticizing the merits of this particular set of ordinances. Have you had a chance to review those letters? Is there any you know, and the recommended modifications and comments? Do you have any comment on those? We did take a chance. We did take the opportunity to describe it as a roundtable, the communications that we've received from the folks that I just mentioned. And some of the changes have already been made. And some of them we thought, well, that's not really something we're going to do. But thank you very much for your input. That's the exercise that we went through. So there are in addition to the judicial record that we reviewed, we reviewed the letters from the different organizations that I mentioned. There are at least three. So Legal Services of Northern California, ACLU, also Ms. Dunlap. Also I had a conversation with Ms. Dunlap. And as I said, roundtabled with my brain trust. And we crafted what we believe would be the best ordinances for the city of Chico. Now a reminder to you, Council Member, and also to the public is you legislators, you know, you amend your ordinances frequently. So if it turns out six months from now there's something that needs to be tweaked or what have you, you can always do that. And I mentioned this at the last time that this was on the agenda. But these ordinances are predicated on the idea that the airport site is indeed inadequate or will become an adequate sheltering space. If it continues to be deemed inadequate, is it fair to assume that these ordinances would come back to Council for further modification? Absolutely. You can count on that. We are, as you know, mid-settlement discussions with the opposing Council and the Magistrate Judge in the case entitled Warren v. the City of Chico. So what we anticipate coming out of that case is new locations that would probably be addressed in this ordinance. For example, let's say, you know, location X comes out of the settlement discussions. Well, if location X is not mentioned in the ordinance now, I would need to bring it back to the Council for approval with the recommendation saying, I recommend that you put location X in the ordinance as a place where non-enforcement is going to occur because it's a shelter site or what have you. And so that would be my recommendation to amend the ordinance at that time. And so, since, in the sense where amid the settlement discussion, those locations have been determined, but that's something that I would anticipate. Is it reasonable to assume that there may be other changes to the ordinances themselves through these settlement discussion in the conversation? Could you say that one more time? Sorry. Is it reasonable to assume that throughout the settlement discussion in the conversation that are continuing, there maybe additional changes to these ordinances that we would need to implement? It's possible. And again, down the road, I would suggest, in the sense of when the discussion has been in progress in the settlement discussion in Not so much wordsmithing, I think, at this point. I think, you know, language is fairly plain. It's fairly straightforward. It's pretty consistent with most of the ordinances that we surveyed. However, I think the changes would be reflected in the geographic locations. That's what we'll be talking about. Thank you. You're welcome. All right. Any other questions? All right. So we'll go ahead and take this one. If we have a motion, a second. I have a motion. Item 2.1. I'll second that. I'll second. Madam Clerk, can you take the roll? Yes, just a moment. I just handed a card. And that motion would be for the final reading and adoption of Ordinance of the City of Chico amending titles 9, 12, and 12R. The City of Chico Municipal Code to regulate the act of camping and storing personal property on public property. Final reading and adoption by title only. Council Member Bennett? Yes. Council Member Brown? No. Council Member Morgan? Yes. Council Member O'Brien? Yes. Council Member Tandon? No. Vice Mayor Reynolds? No. And I'll preface that by saying only because I, it's the timing, not because I don't believe our ordinances need to be updated. Mayor Colinge? Aye. Carries 4-3. All right. Item 2.6. Mr. Alvani? Yes. Thank you. The floor is yours. So, as mentioned, in the fiscal year 21-22 budget, as part of our budget presentation, there was a capital project that was created for the ice skating rink in the downtown plaza. As we've gotten into the logistics of implementation, we've coordinated with finance on the best mechanisms to manage the revenues and expenditures of that. And we landed on the best mechanism is not through a capital project, but rather a fund. And so, coordinating with finance, the intent was to create a city recreation fund, essentially as an enterprise fund, that will then house the line item revenues and expenditures out of that. So, it is confusing in the supplemental in that, essentially, we're going from a capital project to a fund level management system of the revenues and expenditures. And then the fund level now includes two years. So, we're including revenues for this intended fiscal year with the first initial year of the operations of the rink, as well as next year's operations. So, when it all adds up, the first, I believe, four items in the supplemental, the first four line items, the rink sponsorships, admissions, and rentals, those are revenues. The next several items are expenditures. So, it kind of adds it all up and it looks like it's all expenditures, but it's both added up. So, it's a lot. It is confusing. So, apologies for that. It's important. Mr. Arlevani, for clarification, there is only $300,000 in expenditures? Correct. No, it's estimated about $400,000 in expenditures. Partially, that is going to be the operations of the rink itself. So, it is a DCBA event under the confines of their franchise agreement. So, they'll be providing the staffing and resources. And so, there will be ongoing operational costs. So, there will be a cost with that. That will be covered by the revenues from admissions and sponsorship programs, similar to how many, many other ice skating rinks in the state are operating. So, you're predicting cost recovery of the funding that's listed here? The intent, if all goes as planned, is we'll be able to pay back the initial investment with the revenues generated. And just because of all the confusion, that initial investment is $1.3 million or is it the $400,000 you just wrote? $300,000 is the initial city budget. So, that's the investment. The total operating cost for this year will be plus or minus $400,000. Okay. Thank you. I was just going to say, again, it's a DCBA event, so it's not a city. We're helping coordinate and set it up. DCBA is going to be operating it. And again, it's under the DCBA franchise agreement that allows those events to occur. If there's any questions, we'll be happy to answer them. If there's any additional questions, I'm available to answer. Question in the audience? Could you address the question of the amount of water used and the amount of PG&E? I believe I saw an email today that said that PG&E was something equivalent to about 15 homes. Yeah. It's estimated about 400 kilowatts per day is equivalent to about 15 homes of usage. And it's through a chiller system, which is a heat exchange, so there's no exhaust fumes or anything associated like that. It's just like an HVAC system in a home. Okay. So, but it does use energy. And then my second question was, I heard from somebody, but I have not contacted anyone in Paradise, that they were not having a skating rink this year, and it wasn't due to us potentially having one, but that just wasn't on their plan. Do you know one way or the other? I don't have any factual information there. Yeah, I've heard back and forth of whether or not they were going to hold it. So, we've made the decision for our community that this is a great opportunity to be able to bring families and patrons downtown for the holiday season. And then the last question is, when would be the drop-dead date that we would need to make the decision as to whether we went through with having this this year? So, say we approved everything tonight and said yes, that we want to intend to move forward with this, when's the absolute last time we can pull out without a penalty per se? That's a great question. The budget was already approved. We already have contracts executed with the company providing the ice skating rink, Ice America. So, at this point, we already have executed contracts and costs expended. Yeah, because this was approved originally in the budget. Correct. Yeah. As of July 1st, it became available for expenditure. Yeah. Do we have any other questions from Council? I have a few. I have a question for the City Attorney. Mr. City Attorney, since this is a DCBA event, and Skipper, you might need to get on this, too. Does the DCBA then take control of the City Plaza during the event? The clear meaning for the question is, at the moment, people are going to bring their young families to go ice skating in our City Plaza. And we can't do anything about it. Right. Does that change if the DCBA is controlling the event? They would be essentially licensed to operate, licensed by the City to operate. So, they would be acting like an agent of the City, if you will, or a licensee. Okay. That answered my first question. Thank you. And then my second question for Mr. Ottoboni. And I realized back in July, nobody, I don't know when the injunction started, so we didn't have the injunction, and we didn't know where COVID would be. My concern moving forward with the revenue side is if it were cold outside right now and there was an ice rink in City Plaza, nobody would go. And so, my question is one of timing. I understand people's concerns. Oh, you should put the money in the roads and all these things. I think we dealt with that. And I also think it would be nice to see something interesting, fun, better, good come out of this building and all the work of the staff and the taxpayers' money. I am concerned about the timing, which in July no one could have known. And we don't know what it's going to be like in November. Two weeks from now, they could shut the state down again. So, what do those contracts look like in that event? And you might not be able to answer that question. I don't mean to put you on the spot. But I guess my question might be, what do we do if this doesn't work out? Who is on the hook for it? The DCBA, I think, is struggling mightily already. And I don't want to become the pocketbook for the DCBA. I'm sorry, that was a very broad and general question. But it's something that wouldn't have come up in July. Mr. Morgan, if I may, can I add to your question too? Yeah. So, and I think the good perspective is I believe they were running most of the ice rinks last year. Correct. Like, they were running successful ice rinks. I believe so, with modifications. Yeah. Yeah, it's hard to forecast where we're going to be at. That is something we need to double check on and review in terms of clauses where, let's say it's November 1st and the conditions have changed and we're unable to proceed with it. That's something we need to have ready to go and analyze. We don't have that information currently right now. But we can follow up on that and get that answer. All right. Thank you. Thank you. I'd like to quickly follow up on the comment about Paradise. Was their ice skating rink and their seasonal attraction, which they've run for, what, about a decade now, part of the conversation as to whether we would move into this project? I don't know that there's really a mechanism to coordinate with them. It was a city effort. And so, you know, there's ice skating rinks all over the state. So we don't do a specific outreach. We've heard, again, some comments that they might not even be going at all. And so this was hopefully an effort for our community. Again, they're a very common thing all over the state of California. And it was an opportunity to hopefully bring patrons and families downtown, especially in light of COVID, and help businesses get through those times and restaurants and all our boutique shops. And retail uses. So that was kind of our focus. Sure. I can truly appreciate all of those valuable points. I think we talk a lot in this room about supporting our neighbors in the foothills. And I think that this is this could be perceived as a competing effort rather than supporting the folks who have run this event for so many years. And I don't know if it's happening or not either. I've read that it is. But I just think that that's a pretty big thing. It's a big concern of mine. Council Member Brown, I can follow up to that. I've actually had discussions with their mayor about it. So they are looking at the possibility of doing it. I'm not sure they've moved in that decision. They know Chico is looking at it and approved it in our budget. I believe Anderson is doing one. Sacramento always does one. There's a lot of other. Yeah, Folsom has one. There's a lot of other cities doing it. So they're becoming more and more popular throughout. But I have had discussions with Steve Crowder. I've talked extensively about it through when we were on the commissary committee. You mentioned that this is a DCBA project. Can I ask kind of how this idea came to fruition? Like what was the process for deciding to pursue this as an attraction? It's been a concept I think for three years. It came from our staff in engineering. Talking with the DCBA as an opportunity to do something in the downtown. And then over the course, we actually I believe originally requested in 2018 and did not move forward with it at that time. And then put it in the budget and presented it to council and ultimately it was approved. So it's been talked about for quite a while at the staff level with the DCBA. Looking at opportunities to enhance downtown. And if I can just add to that. In 2018 the reason why I didn't move it forward to council for consideration was because of the fire. Was there a short list of other projects that were considered for economic vitality in the downtown? I'm not really involved much on the DCBA board. But there's all sorts of other things. Parking has always been a hot topic of discussion. Both good and bad. And so yeah we've looked at, I guess I can say we've looked at multiple projects. The downtown parking lots. Main and Broadway reconstruction. Reconfiguration which is also a project that was approved in the last budget. Ways to enhance and revitalize downtown. Improve access through other modes of transportation as well. So yeah there's been a lot of different projects. Those aren't break even though. Yeah. Thank you. Alright. I have one more follow up question. Combination Skipper and Brennan. Because of my other concerns. Partially being COVID. Partially being COVID. Partially being I think the DCBA is struggling through no fault of their own. What would happen if we punted this until next year? That's the wonderful thing about four votes. Is you can punt anything you want. And we have to figure it out as staff. And we will figure it out. So if you punt then we will look forward to pushing it into a future year. And we have to look at the contracts as was mentioned earlier. But you know. That's why one of the things that we do constantly is evaluate timing on things. There is never good timing it seems during COVID to do anything outside of the norm. If anything it's pulling back on doing things. And so this was one of those opportunities that we tried to seize. And if council decides that it's not an opportunity you want to seize. Then that's obviously four votes to do that. So I was going to say you didn't answer my question. But you did at the end. Yeah. So I appreciate that. So then I'm going to. I'm going to make a request I think. Can we find out what happens with our current contracts? In other words if the money is gone because we already signed the contract. Then we might as well move forward and see if anybody shows up. But if there is a way that we can delay that. Because we just have no idea what downtown Chico is going to look like in November. For a variety of reasons. COVID only being one of them. Is that possible? So how important is that? Is it for us to vote on this consent item tonight versus finding out what those contracts look like? We can bring this back at the next meeting with the update as to what the contracts say. So we can push this. My suggestion would be that we table this item until the next council meeting. And we can find out what that wall looks like. Mr. Morgan. Yes, ma'am. Would you consider adding just one more discussion item with a little bit more breakdown about the environmental impacts that were discussed? I think that's what I just briefly touched on. Electricity. Water. I would like to see it written down if that's possible. And I would like the public to have access to it as well. If we're talking about it anyway. I know. Sure. Because you're Alex. Thank you. Mr. Morgan. And you know I love you. Can you clarify environmentally? Because it is an exemption through certain. Climate impact. And it's a city plaza intended for. She wants to know how many gallons of water and how many potential houses we could power and if we could solve the earth. Specifically. Yes. But specifically we have climate. We have greenhouse gas emission goals set or requirements set to by the state for us. Which means if we're putting stuff out we have to recover it somewhere else. So I'm just very curious kind of what that what that looks like. Especially as it relates to our climate action plan which should be coming to us. Are you looking for like a. Sequel analysis. Not. Okay. Nothing that in depth. Specifically. You know what it what are the energy costs and. Just just having it written down. I think you wrote something in an email to us. A little bit of expanding on that would be great for me. Okay. Just. Don't don't spend hours. No. I'm not asking for that. So that would be. Is that a motion. A strong suggestion. Okay. I'll make it a motion. I'd like. A suggestion to add a suggestion to. Oh, hold on. Let's see if we have a second for as much. I'll second that. All right. So go ahead. Council member. I just wanted to check in to see if I know that in this financial that you provided, if you can specify which is the revenue and what is so kind of explain it better. Yes. So. I accept that. I mean. All right. So. So. I'm not going to support your motion, but I'm not going to make a substitute motion, even though I really want to. The reason being is I know this has been talked about in the city for a long time. And I know other cities around us are doing the same thing. That events during this time have actually been really successful over the last course months. If you look at all the fairs in the north state and then taking place, I know this because I'm an event producer. Is they've all done. Better because people have a desire to get out and do things and they seem to do it in a very safe way. And a lot of those places had COVID restrictions in place and have done those very successfully. So I think this would be positive for our businesses that are aching in the downtown area. And I think it'd be a really good thing. I'm sure staff has moved forward on this spending some considerable amount of time. Would that be a correct estimation? So and I would guess if you're out getting sponsorships. Yes. And you're putting a hold on it and council is having this kind of discussion that is not going to help your sales at all. So I would say at this point in time, you're probably running pretty heavy on trying to get sponsors. So to throw a wrench into that, I think would be detrimental to the entire thing. So yeah, there are a lot on that just to be upfront is there are timing issues of trying to get sponsorships and things like a title sponsor and then getting production of signs and banners and all those types of things that come with that. So it's not like a decision we can wait till the last minute. There's material procurement, all those types of things that take time on top of everything else we're doing. So and have you guys sold any sponsorships as of yet or have any commitments? Without really going out fully. We've got one from explore Butte County so far. Okay. So is it possible to bring this back in two weeks? Yeah, we can do that with the information requested. And we can issue it to the board. It should be a pretty quick review of the contract. So it'll squeeze us a little bit on the timing, but we can certainly do that. Okay, good. Are you confident you can do that with that two minus that two weeks? Well, it won't be me, but it'll be our interim director. Well, you're in charge of the people who will be making that. Yes. Okay. All right. So no further comments. Madam Clerk. Councillor Svoboda. Yes. Councilmember Bennett. And this is just to bring it back in two weeks. I am going to support the motion. I think if we can make a better decision with a little bit more information, I think that's a plus. Okay. Thank you. Councilmember Brown. Aye. Councilmember Morgan. Aye. Councilmember O'Brien. Yes. Councilmember Tandon. Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds. Aye. Mayor Coolidge. Okay. Just to show my support of my other council members, I'll vote yes as well. Carries 7-0. I can see writing on the wall. All right. Moving on to our next item. Oh, 2.9. Sorry. Okay. So we have the amendment to the City of Chico budget appendix. Do we have any questions on that? Yes. I have a handful, but I wanted to make room if other people did. All right. Does anyone else have any questions on that? Go ahead, Councilmember Brown. Ms. Cannon, I just want to unpack a couple things that you noted in your report. First, can you explain why this cost is so high? I mean, the cost adjustment is necessary at this time? When this item came to fruition, probably at 2017, 2018, the idea was to make our park rangers become sworn, be better trained, carry a firearm, be safe. So when this all came around, the idea was to have two separate paths. What has naturally occurred over the past three years is these applicants go through the same post-academy, the police officer standards training. They go through our same FTO program, et cetera. So we've gotten folks on the hook, per se. They've gotten halfway through our process, and they're like, wait a minute. I can go be a Chico police officer and make 44% more. Why would I want to stay a park ranger? We've had one die-hard faithful, fantastic employee who's now actually one of our senior park rangers. He's amazing. But even he's asked that question. So after a huge, I mean, for three years now, I've had three vacant FTEs, and I cannot get bodies in the door. So this causes us to look and say, where do we need to make adjustments? And the suggestion was to put it up commensurate with our police officer level. Okay, great. So you mentioned these two paths, park ranger versus police officer. Given the training that park rangers are undergoing, it does seem that there's a little bit more crossover between these positions. Are park rangers doing police officer activity in the parks? There are very similar activities on both ends, yes. In fact, we were approached by our police officers. We were approached by the park ranger union saying, should these folks just become police officers? There are a lot of similarities, and then there's also differences where there's far more interpretive side, et cetera, as it exists with our park ranger classification. So there is an interest to keep those positions distinct, but we do want to pay them commensurate so we can actually get boots on the floor. Okay. I think one of my concerns is that it feels like the more we enmesh these positions, the more it looks like we're doing less park rangering and adding three additional police officers to our parks. Which for me is just call it what it is if we're going to do that. I'm obviously no expert in what inspires somebody to become a park ranger, but I do know that typically those positions are pretty distinctive. Of course, with some overlap in general. I want us to be able to retain our park rangers. I would be happy to see us align our park ranger salaries with other communities' park ranger salaries. Okay. But I think what I'm having trouble with or what's sticking for me is really the 2018 decision to arm our park rangers, to provide them with police training so they can be armed, and then pay them what a police officer makes so that they're not recruited to become police officers. I think separating that out seems a little bit wiser to me, and so I am going to vote no on this. I can't really support that. But thank you for your input. All right. Any other questions? No. This isn't a question, but remind me, one of the reasons, too, for wanting park rangers to stay park rangers and not go into the police department is because there was also the fear that if they're ingrained with the police department, it could be a department that could be cut, and then we would have no park rangers. So if they're running low, people are out on COVID, whatever, we're pulling from that, and then we have no park rangers. So wasn't that one of the reasons for the... That was a key concern. And the idea of potentially making them a police officer with a specialty assignment is the concern that if FTEs were brought down and we lost folks on patrol, we'd have to pull from those specialty assignments and then we would lose our park rangers altogether. So by keeping them as park rangers, we're making sure we have park rangers. Correct. And I mean, if I had my crystal ball, to be honest, I anticipate at some point this may morph into something different depending upon how recruitment goes, but this is one step towards the process to try to get bodies in the door. Thank you. And I just want to confirm. It's a great question. And Chief Madden, you support this? I do. Essentially, the bottom line is they're held to the same standard under commission post as a regular police officer. They're just assigned to the park and then they have a whole other set of interpretive skills that they need to have to police our park. So they have the same skill sets. They have to complete all the same training. They're just permanently assigned to the park as a sworn park ranger. So I do. Thank you. And I just want to confirm because I was the chief when this actually occurred that we did our best to make this work. We really did. And we do understand the distinction and the importance of that. But the disparate compensation, as Jimmy Cannon just stated, was too great to overcome. And if we're not careful, we're going to lose that program as well. We don't want to do that. All right. Any further questions or comments or questions? All right. Seeing none, entertain a motion. And move to approve. Second. A motion from Vice Mayor Reynolds and a second from Council Member Tandon. Madam Clerk, when you're ready. Okay. Council Member Bennett. I will support the safety measures for both our city park rangers as well as the citizens of Chico, yes. Council Member Brown. No. Council Member Morgan. Yes. Council Member O'Brien. Yes. Council Member Tandon. Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds. Aye. Mayor Coolidge. Aye. Carries 7-0. All right. I'm sorry. Sorry. Sorry. 6-1 is up there. I apologize. I may not be here at all, I believe. Okay. We'll move on to business from the floor. How many speakers do we have? Well, if I count correctly, 15. 15? 15. Okay. So members of the public may address the Council at this time on any matter not already listed on the agenda. So if it's a matter not listed on the agenda and you've put in a card, it's this time to address that. With comments being limited or as determined, well, usually when we hit 15, we go to two minutes. So we're going to go to two minutes. And the Council cannot take any action at this meeting on a request made under this section of the agenda. So go ahead. Okay. No. So Nancy Park followed by Robin Engle. And if you could line up, that would be great. Yeah. If your name is called and you're next, if you could just come and stand in the aisle or be ready to jump right in after me. Thank you. You're welcome. So the out-of-town consultant to whom you've given $50,000 is going to come up with a strategic plan to deal with homelessness in six months. Meanwhile, just last weekend, a homeless man was murdered. And another man is in the hospital. Due to violence at a place where unhoused people are living in tents. Witnesses say the assailants were shouting anti-homeless obscenities before they opened fire. For years now, people working with unhoused members of the Chico community have been advocating for housing or at the very least a supervised transitional facility of tents and or tiny house shelters equipped with toilet and shower facilities. 24-hour security. Some protection from the elements and social service workers. And yet our mayor calls this asking for the moon. Nonprofit organizations are ready to step and work with the city to make this a reality. Instead, people are being murdered. Meanwhile, we wait six months for the out-of-town consultant to come up with a strategic plan. It is not a crime to be poor. It is a crime to let the suffering of unhoused people and the homeless people that are living in the encampments go on and on for months and years. I have been in Chico since 1957. And I have never before seen this level of polarization and hatred towards fellow community members. I've always been proud to say Chico is my hometown. No more. Robin Engle follows. Followed by Angela Rysden. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . father, family man, Guy Steven Van Zant has been lost due to a very brutal hate crime this past weekend. On the other side of human suffering, there's greed. And I've stated some of these numbers before. The highest percentage of any city throughout the nation to spend on its police force, the highest percentage of its general funds is 51%. Where is Chico at? You know, 51%. Or inches from it. It's the highest again percentage of any city throughout the United States, including the huge cities of LA, etc., to spend on their police force. Our police department, as incredibly wealthy as it is, just purchased and bragged about its military tank, could not find the minor, the children, the minor kids who killed Guy Steven Van Zant in cold blood. They were reportedly either on bikes or by foot. The police department reported at least four different scenarios as far as the response time. It took them three minutes. No, it took them four. No, they don't know how long it took them. No, it took them more than 20. And our eyewitnesses and witnesses who heard and saw everything that went down reports that it took a good half hour or more. And they let Guy Steven Van Zant bleed out to death. How is it possible that you can't find this man, find these culprits, I mean, and save this man's life unless you wanted him to die as you do? That's right. That's broke and homeless. Angela Rison, followed by Jessica Giannola. Good evening. Still Angela Rison. Sorry. That's okay. The city can't have it both ways. You remove the support for providing basic sanitation needs for the unhoused. Then you callously work to prevent service providers from providing and paying for basic sanitation needs. Now you want the use of your actions or the lack thereof. Such as your refusal to address the July 8th court order to address the needs of the unhoused. To create a false sense of a new crisis and pass this urgency ordinance. You're right about one thing. There is an urgent situation here in Chico. We need to protect all the people of Chico, including our unhoused, including Guy Steven Van. Or as stated at the bottom of the city's press release in his homicide case number 21-00, 5313. The Chico Police Department is committed to ensuring the community is a safe place to live. I trust that commitment is for all of us. And that the police use the same dedication they use to arrest an unhoused person for diverting water for irrigation for his own or her own personal use like drinking water. Thank you. Jessica Giannola, followed by Lori Maloney. I get to talk quick. Let's see. I'll just skip right to it. Regularly you ask for respect coming from out here. Really it's respect for the criticism. And to remember that you're humans and that you have feelings too. So that when you go home at the end of the night, maybe you go with a little less guilt or a little less stress from our comments weighing on you when you go to bed. An important fact here is that you have a home to go to at night. There are people that your decisions impact that do not have a home or a safe place to sleep at night. And they remain in that situation to this day in large part because of your leadership and the things that you say or you fail to say. Yes, it's ugly. This entire situation is ugly and yet we are not seeing a connection made with you, our leadership, and the recognition for seriousness of our unhoused situation and what they endure each day that we leave them to their own. And that's also important because there are times that we lose our confidence and lose our confidence in our circumstances. Another death of a citizen occurred this weekend. Another person injured in an act warned from the misinformation that's continued and discounting their lives. And you make comments about the unhoused population as if they don't belong here, they're not from here, then your followers will treat them as such. When you make statements that we, the advocates, privilege enough to fight on their behalf, are asking for the moon or a ferris wheel, when we're asking for basic services. They've yet to understand, you have yet to understand the need, their needs. You place their lives, the citizens, at risk. We're asking for changes in billing codes, redirect funding, assisted services. We ask for all of that. These people are people. Last time someone was here, they mentioned 20 names of people who died, and there was no response to that. There was a next on the agenda, next. There was no acknowledgement for the people who are dying. These people are people. And we're forced to be on sides here. We should all be on the same side, the people. Lori Maloney, followed by Jesse Greig. Hi. My name is Lori Maloney, and I was born and raised here in Chico. I have helped homeless individuals and families in Chico for the last 20 years, and I currently work with a local nonprofit, Point of Contact. Anyone that's worked with the homeless in Chico or has been homeless in the last 10 years will know that one time we knew every homeless person on our streets. Now we have new professional transients coming here every day telling us their friends told them to come here. When we asked one group, why did you come here? The answer was Chico gave us Bidwell Park. They are here for the handouts and here to victimize our community. Point of Contact is helping people that want the help to get off the streets. We are here to help. We have helped people get into shelter, reunite them with family, connect with well-earned veteran benefits, relocate for employment opportunities, begin rehab, and in many cases, just simply given some people hope. But we need your help. We must not turn our backs anymore on criminal activity. We are inviting more criminals to Chico. Professional transients are coming to Chico daily and taking advantage of our community. Many citizens are dealing with issues, issues on their own, and not in a good way. There are solutions to these problems. What will you do to take this out of the hands of the citizens of our community? Jesse Grigg, followed by Barry Jones. Hello. My name is Jesse Grigg. I'm a descendant of the Morehead family who settled here in 1850. For 171 years, we've called Chico home. And in my 40 years on this planet, I've been here. I've been on the planet, all of which I've lived in Chico. I've watched our city decline due to the transient issue. Like Laurie just said, I knew the homeless and transient people when I was a child by name. They were friendly, they smiled, they laughed. It was not the issue we're dealing with today. This population occupied downtown streets and our crown jewel, Bidwell Park. With pressure from our community, we cleaned up the park and downtown temporarily. Thank you for that. In 2017, I wanted to open a business due to this issue. I chose not to open the doors downtown. We went to the south end of town on Myers Street. And we had a vision that that area would develop for not only us, but future opportunity for new businesses as well. And with the news of the development of the Comanche Creek Greenway, we got excited. It was a step in the right direction for development on that end of town. Unfortunately, it brought nothing but problems. On a daily basis, we deal with feces. We use feces and urine on our doorstep, use needles, vandalism, car break-ins, harassment of our staff and patrons. I personally have had knives and guns drawn on me. Nobody feels safe out there anymore. And I know this is a very difficult issue, but allowing them to occupy Comanche Creek and directly affect the livelihood of our businesses is not a solution. Please help. Thank you. Barry Jones, followed by Nicole Nava. Hi, I'm Barry Jones. I've been a business owner on Myers Street for 40 years. Been in this town my entire life. It's been a great place to live and a great place to grow up. It's not like that anymore. It's sad to see what's happening to this town and watch it, and I hear people that complain. It's tough. But as far as business-wise, the impacts we have, the things we see, people with hatchets running around, we see drug deals, we see prostitution, we see fires, and we just deal with it. We've tried to locally try to complain a little bit to the police department. They've been helpful, and we thank you for that. But still, the problems don't go away. And I'm one of many businesses down there. We just don't say anything. We just deal with it, and we get by. Impacts to my business, what this does, is it's impossible to find people to come to work. In today's environment, with everything we're dealing with, people don't want to come to work. They come down. I solicit people. It's such a great place to live. And you come down, you go to our parks, you see the Comanche Greenway, which should be a beautiful place. People go, I don't want anything of this. I don't want any of this. I can't get any talent. I can't get anybody to work. It's terrible. That's a very big impact. And what's scary for what I have right now, I have people my age. I'm in retirement zone, and the other people are in their 20s. All the young families are gone. They're all leaving. Oregon, Washington, Texas. I help 20 campfire survivors. I have two that are still playing with me. They've all left the area for those reasons. They can't handle the pressure. I know you guys have a lot of big decisions to make. I'm just trying to share with you our situation. I'm coming here tonight to support businesses on all of Chico, South Park Avenue, my situation, and Meyers Street. It's tough to come out and say something because we're afraid of ramifications or retribution or damage or destruction to happen to our business. But we're here to help. Thank you. That's fine. OK. Well, we're here to help. All I say is businesses are here to help you guys. If you can come up with a solution for us to help, we'd be glad to help. So Nicole Nava followed by Patrick Newman. Evening again. So solutions. There's a lot of people who talk about what do we do, what should you do, what should the county do, what should the state do, what should the feds all be doing. And I feel like universally we should all be agreeing that the solutions are for people to get treatment, whether for addiction or mental health issues. So what did I do? I've tried here. I've tried the county now. I went and spoke at the board. And I spoke individually to Assemblyman Gallagher and Assemblyman Kevin Kiley to figure out if they supported funding for the long-term mental health and addiction treatment. And if it meant like maybe realigning some of the money that's been going toward just housing first to go, OK, well, this is a type of a house. And people were supportive. And that did not surprise me. I was able to hold meetings with two different levels of assembly, the assembly committee and a Senate committee. And I have also written to meet with the budget and finance committees at both those levels. And I would love it if you guys could figure out a way to support that and make it known that we need the help. Because what I would like to do is those funds to come pouring into the California counties. You know, of course, I was like, hey, if it could be Butte, great. We could pilot whatever. But it needs to be brought. It needs to be throughout this state. And we all can do this. The money is there. It just needs to be applied meaningfully. I keep saying this. So but I'm a dog with a bone. You can see from my hat, I'm pissed. And when I get pissed, look out, because I'm a type A plus. And I'm going to town on this. And like it'd be super great if people everywhere could get in the trenches in the right places to do this. I'm bringing this here to just say what you can do as our council is do a letter of like endorsement, whatever, behind something like that. Because what I'm asking is for the county to control those funds, like how they implement. But that it be mandated and funded for you to receive them too. You are Chico. You are Butte County. So let's help our people. We're all capable. Thank you. Patrick Newman. Followed by Bryce Goldstein. There's lots of thriving businesses downtown. And one way to know that is to try to find a parking space sometime. So this mythology around the demonization of homeless and the notion that we can just keep talking about them as a criminal element, they're predators, et cetera, et cetera. It's a device. And I see that. And I see the utility of it. But when you get to know this population, you begin to realize that it's largely a fiction. And it doesn't mean it's not a useful fiction, but it's still a fiction. And the reality is that we have made serious mistakes in terms of providing affordable housing to people in our country over 40 years. And when we deinstitutionalized people in California, we were supposed to pick it up in the community. And we deinstitutionalized people for all kinds of reasons when they were institutionalized. In the 1950s and 60s, the communities were supposed to pick that up. Did we do it? No, we didn't. Now these people are on the streets. Most of them don't need to be institutionalized. What they need is housing. And that stabilizes people's lives. When you make poverty a crime, and this is what we've been doing systematically, every single person who's poorer becomes a criminal. And so yes, we can separate out real criminal activity from the activity that's called social crime, which is just people living in a public space. Do we do that? Do we do it carefully? Well, we should. But it's more useful in terms of a narrative to conflate the two together. Because now you can demonize the entire population. Get to know this population better. I came up here to speak about this recent shooting and the culture of violence that we have in this community that I've talked about here many times over eight years. I'm out of time. But there's a lot of elements to that culture of violence. And it ends up in the most violent, you know, violent, violent expressions. And that's what just happened on Saturday. So looking at that culture of violence and all the elements of it, we have blood on our hands. And we have it until we look at that culture. Thank you. ELIZABETH LITTLEFIELD- Bryce Goldstein, followed by Charles Withoon. CHARLES WITHOON, Good evening again. The murder at Taker Ponds this weekend was a hate crime. I want to see your current leadership acknowledge this and condemn this act of hatred, as well as, the hateful rhetoric that has permeated our community and spurred this cold-blooded murder. It's up to you to ensure we have shelters and housing and to keep our most vulnerable community members safe. And in my opinion, we have failed. And that has been visible with all of the homeless folks who have died in the past year and beyond. I believe it's over 20 people who have died without a roof in this past year. But the shooting of Guy Steven Van Zant, was an egregious example of how far things have gone within our community. If you go on any Facebook group meant to discuss local issues, you will find people who are voicing threats, oftentimes, not even veiled, towards people who are unhoused. And sometimes that spills over into voicing threats towards leadership and towards activists and people who want to help each other. And it's deeply concerning. I'm concerned. I'm concerned for my unhoused neighbors. And I am concerned for all of us, including myself. So I think we need to take prompt action. I would like to see every one of you make a statement about this incident and condemning violence towards unhoused people. And I think if we keep up how things are going, we're going to see more assault and murder. So I hope that doesn't happen. But on another safety topic, a bicyclist was run over by a truck and seriously injured today at Norton West Sacramento. And this is why a lot of people don't feel safe biking. But we continue to spend half of our budget on police when we could invest some of that on safer streets and better bikeways. So I hope we can all feel safer in Chico by multiple means. And that includes transportation. Thank you. CHRISTIE WOODARD- Charles Withoon, followed by Robert Baumann. ROBERT BAUMANN. Mayor, councillors, staff, thank you very much for this opportunity. Let's look at Eugene. 14 safe spot communities, three tiny home villages. Let's look at some Chico citizens. Colleen, 58 years old, born and raised in Chico, victim of domestic violence, been sleeping outside four years. Lindsay, this woman was 53 years old. She's five foot tall, 90 pounds. Passed away recently. She'd been sleeping outside three years. Sharon, diagnosed epileptic, waiting two years to see a judge for disability assistance, sleeping outside in Chico two years. Steve, break your heart. I took this photo in the plaza. This guy can hardly walk. Worked 40 years as a mechanic. Now he has degenerative arthritis. Landlord refused to renew the lease. He's been sleeping rough for three months. Shelly had a job. She got a concussion. She was homeless 11 months before she died. Patty was a friend of many people at Enloe. She worked at Enloe for 15 years. Got a back injury. She spent six years on the street. CHRISTIE WOODARD- Thank you. CHRISTIE WOODARD- In Chico. Carla worked as a home health aide for 30 years. Homeless for a year. Vanessa was an accountant. House burned down. Insurance didn't pay off. Lawyer fees left her on the street.

Go ahead. I'll add another name to that. Mary Lou Dawson. She worked in home health. She wrecked her back, like her partner, taking care of people doing hospice work. They got strung out on opioids. It took the life of her partner. She had to leave the house that they lived in, and she went into a little apartment, and I lost contact with her. And then I read in Naomi Klein's article that reached millions of people about what's happening in Chico that she had died on the street. This should never happen. I've been here since 71. It's a different place. And I think we need to be more careful and we need to work together to solve this problem. And it's not one thing is going to fix it. But people need a safe place to be when they're unhoused. Also, the community needs to be safe, not having people wandering through their neighborhoods because they've been pushed out of whatever shelter they might have. So I... left you a... It's being distributed, this photograph from the area that you have designated. It doesn't look terribly houseable, habitable, or friendly for young children and their parents. Most of the people there are in RVs. We can find better solutions. We have... We have people in our communities that are donating their time every week to help our community. So work with us. Thank you. Tracy Miller, followed by Chelsea Barron. Tracy Miller. Tracy Miller. Okay, Chelsea Barron. Hello, folks. I am a Chico State student, as obvious by my shirt. I go to the rec every week, and I go by the cooling center that was set up by the city. I would love to stop and get a drink of water, but I can't. The fountain is broken, and it has been broken since July 2nd when I found out. Um... I was kind of heartbroken because that's the cooling center where you can go if you're old and you don't want to pay for A.C. or if you're like me and a student and you can't really pay for A.C. But there's no water at the fountain. So I know that the city put it together, but I'm a little disappointed in it because now it's September and the fountain's still not fixed. So I'm wondering maybe if someone can help me or point me in the right direction towards where I can get information or maybe if someone in the parks department could bring a plumber because there's no infrastructure in the fountain either. It's just, like, gone. Yeah. A cooling center without water in the middle of a drought where there's no place to fill your water bottle seems a little bit strange, if not a little bit crazy. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

And if I think we can just do that with general agreement, correct? So anyone against that? And then if the council would entertain it too, I'd like to move item 5.2 ahead of 5.1 just because we have someone who's been patiently waiting in our audience, if everybody's okay with that. All right. So we're going to take item 5.2, which is joint public safety agreement by and between the city of Chico and California State University of Chico regarding cooperation between the Chico Police Department and the University Police Department. Chief Mapp, come on down. Or sideways. Good evening, Mayor, Vice Mayor, Council Members. Appreciate the opportunity. So as some may remember, back in 2016, the city was experiencing some higher crime rates in and around the south campus area. It was really causing some concerns for the Chico Police Department. And so leadership at that time, both at the city management level and the police departments, sat down and engaged the university on just how can we be a little more collaborative. For a university town, Chico's really unique in the sense that if you look at other towns, there's very few towns in our nation where the university is in the heart of the city. A lot of times you'll see that it's outskirts. So really. They have a police department. They're state of California police officers. And really what we could do to kind of combine forces, work together, create more strategies to create a safer environment for predominantly our student population. And that's what we did. And it was really symbolic for me at the level I was at the time in the organization. It really kind of sent a message that, hey, we need to be working together. Because these students come, they're our responsibility and the university's responsibility, you know, what they're in and around campus. So since that time, we've seen better collaboration there. I had the opportunity to meet the new police chief, came on about the same time I did. And we've been collaborating and trying to come up with different ways. So one of the things we thought of was some of the things that we were experiencing with the police department and our rising levels of crime, specifically violent crime last year, if you remember, which provided data for that. And actually, had to defer some of our resources to those more significant crimes, such as a violent suppression unit. Meant that we had a little bit less boots on the ground in and around the campus community. So again, in this collaboration, talking with the University Police Department, how can we, you know, maybe even add some more collaboration there. So, you know, as we walked, the chief, Dylan and I met, we walked the campus area. And what we realized, we have a lot of city infrastructure. Right in and around the university. We have a park, an amphitheater that really is probably more accessible from the campus than it is for the city of Chico police officers. And these are areas that the university, because it's so close that their staff uses a lot and they have access to that. And then as well as some of the environmental degradation, the creek runs right through the heart of the campus. And so basically it just approaching the university saying, hey, can we get some of that? Can we get some more help, some more collaboration and back you up as well? So if you read that original, it was a really give and take safety agreement. We're a little bit bigger agency, so we're a little more specialized. So we have some tools that they don't. So on more larger investigations that may have on campus, we would come in and help them. So really all this is, is just adding some language to continue to work with the university. And so we're going to go to the university police department and really focus on our student population in and around the campus with some influences there with the university, as well as the south campus neighborhoods where a lot of the students reside. So with that, I'll take any questions. But you have the president of the university here and also the Chico State police chief. Well, thank you. And I'd like to say thanks to the president. President Hutchinson for making this priority. And Anne Sherman is here, too, who is the VP for business finance, but our two chiefs as well. And Mr. Orem for making this happen. But do we have any questions for Senator? I'll just make a quick comment. So I just want to applaud Chief Mann and Chief Dillon for improving and updating this document. I, of course, was involved with the original one. They made this better. So thank you. So thank you to the chiefs. And thank you to President Hutchinson and City Manager Orem for, again, supporting us. Very important. And I think it sends a very important message. Thank you. All right. And President Hutchinson, you want to come forward? Sure. Thank you. Thank you. Mr. Mayor, Vice Mayor, council members, everyone. I want to commend the university police department and Chief Dillon, along with Matt. I have to get my Matt, so I'll mix that up. Matt Madden. Chief Madden. I really want to say that the university has always really, truly appreciated the relationship that we have not only with the city police department, but with the fire department as well, and also our shared use of resources as a community. It goes a long way knowing that we have this strong partnership. I think the amendments that are made to this agreement strengthen it. The fact that we will now have our university police department looking out over the amphitheater and into the park. And into Lost Creek a little bit and between 2535 Main is really, really important. And then knowing that the Chico, city of Chico is going to continue with helping us through funding of prosecutorial types of efforts that our police department brings forward is also really, really important. So I do want to commend my police chief and also Vice President of Business and Finance and Chairman, along with Chief Madden and the entire, both police forces. So thank you, Mayor. Appreciate it. All right. Do we have any public comment on this item? All right. Well, with that, I'll entertain a motion. I'll make a motion to approve. All right. I'm happy to second that. A motion from Council Member O'Brien. Second from myself. Council Member Bennett? Yes. Council Member Brown? Aye. Council Member Morgan? Yes. Council Member O'Brien? Yes. Council Member Gibson? Council Member Tandon? Yes. Council Member Reynolds? Aye. Council Member Coolidge? Aye. Council Member Carri, 7-0. All right. Thank you so much. Thank you. All right. So now we will move on backwards to item 5.1, American Rescue Plan Youth Program. Jennifer McCarthy, Deputy City Manager, welcome. Thank you. Let me just pull this up real quick. All right. Good evening. I'm Jennifer McCarthy, Deputy City Manager for the City of Tandem. I'm the Director of the American Rescue Plan Youth Program here within the City of Chico. And before you tonight is an item related to funding through the American Rescue Plan for youth programs here within the City of Chico. As a reminder, the American Rescue Plan was put together in an effort to combat the impacts of COVID-19 and help work towards economic recovery. There's a variety of different eligible uses for these funds. And before you, it shows the five prime areas that these funds can be used for, basically to support the health expenditures. To address negative economic impacts. To replace public sector lost revenues. To provide premium pay for essential workers. And to invest in infrastructure such as water, sewer, and broadband. So to move backwards a little bit, speaking of moving backwards, on June 8th, the Council heard a number of variety of different programs and projects that could be funded through the City's allocation of American Rescue Plan dollars. At that time, the Council requested that staff come back with proposed programs that could help work towards putting together solutions for school-age youth that have been impacted from the impacts of COVID-19. So for instance, social impacts, recreational, educational, mental health, etc. As a reminder, not only can the City utilize funds for youth programs, but in addition, all of the educational institutions within the City can also be funded through these programs. Our community also received funds, so that includes Chico Unified School District, Butte County Office of Education, Chico State, and Butte College. When staff looked into what would make sense in order to put together a program that really meets the needs of our youth, and when I say that, really looks towards filling gaps that aren't currently being met, we looked at proposing a program with the $500,000 that the Council was considering. And developing a program that would also have a positive impact on the health and safety a program that looked at providing funding for organizations that provided programs in the areas of social, emotional, or mental health needs. Staff is suggesting that perhaps we put together a program that provides grants to organizations that are already in place that do these services in our community but can't quite meet the needs of all of the youth that are out there that need these services currently. We could be looking at an application process where we have scoring related to a variety of different factors that would be put together if the council decides to move forward with this program. We'd be looking towards, again, existing organizations that have a proven track record that are focusing in these areas that you've shown here in this presentation. With funding at $500,000, we estimate that if we did 150,000 grants, we could provide to three organizations. We'd be looking at a program that provides grants to organizations that are already in place that are already in place that are already in place that are already in place. And it would make sense to look at a grant term that would be a year. And that way it could get you through the school year as well as funding summer programs as well. Also in our staff report, you see that after the June 8th meeting came up another potential program that might also be a good fit with American Rescue Funds. And I wanted to provide you a little information on that program as well. There is a bike path that runs along the side of Union Pacific bordered by Chattanooga. And it's a city-owned bike path that has a variety of different holes and needs of repair. This bike path is traveled by many youth, many students, and as I said, is in need of great repair. Because it is something that fosters recreation, it would be something that would be an eligible expense through the American Rescue Plan. The total way of improvements, as you can see in that orange line, the part of the bike path that is in need of great repair is the part that is in need of repair. And that part of the bike path where improvements are necessary run from Chico State up to West Lindo. The total cost of those improvements is roughly $667,000. City staff has had a variety of different conversations regarding this proposed program and has talked to both Union Pacific and Chico State about interest in partnering. And while there's been no formal partnership that's been made at this point, there has been some interest in potentially partnering financially. So today what we're really asking the council to do is to consider how you want to utilize these $500,000. Is it that you're interested in staff moving forward with putting together a program that provides grants to organizations that support the social, emotional, and physical well-being of school-aged youth in Chico? Or are you interested in having us consider the bike path program or potentially both? So at that point, I'm happy to answer any questions that you might have. I'm going to provide additional details. Does anyone have any questions? I have a couple. Sure. Anyone else? So the schools, all of the schools you mentioned, got a huge amount of this money as well. And huge is not an understatement. They did. I don't have the exact dollars, Mayor Coolidge, on how much they received, but they did receive funds. Their funds were a little bit different. Ours were through a fund that was specific to local government, but they had funds that were specific to educational. Yeah. I recall. You know, I think maybe when that original motion was made, it was, you know, with the grand idea in mind, but not necessarily maybe the best idea because it is, I think, being served by something else in the community. You know, my thought on the train track fence or bike path fence is that, so it's high-gauge steel, correct? So it's not as cuttable or it provides a safe area. It's not a... It's not a chain-link fence again, correct? I would have to possibly look towards either the city manager or Director Ottoboni to answer that. Yeah, it was kind of the tighter chain-link. It's still a chain-link type material, but it's a high-security chain-link that's, you know, supposed to be vandalism-proof and you're not able to cut it as easily or cut it at all as the current chain-link that's there. Okay. Yeah, my thought is that this bike path serves Chico High, Chico Junior, some respect. Absolutely. Emma Wilson, Rosedale, and Chico State. So, and I know train track incidents have been plagued our city for years and years. So, I don't know. Just throwing it out there. So, do we have any other questions? I don't have a question necessarily, but I'd like to make a comment. While I completely agree we should probably put a good majority of this maybe to the bike path, there are some entities... There are some entities that are filling places in our community that are not receiving funds from the school and that are going way above and beyond that I really think could use these monies. I won't say a name in particular, but there are organizations that absolutely are not being taken care of that are taking care of kids and have been ever since day one of the campfire and, you know, through COVID and everything else and never shut down. So, I would be, you know, amicable to doing, you know, maybe a 25-75 split or, you know, something like that. But I would like to put some of that money out there. If there's an organization that feels that they would like to apply for that. But I would like to make it a very specific criteria to ensure that it's not just going to, you know, the schools that have already gotten relief funds to provide those things. So, that's just kind of... You mean like groups like the Boys and Girls Club? Yeah. That could probably... Probably wouldn't want to mention anybody. Yeah. No, I get it. So, let's not do that. I agree with Ms. Reynolds. The fence idea I'm all for. I think some of the... Some of the organizations that the Mayor mentioned should help pay for it. I'm not interested in giving any money to any of these schools. They got plenty. The Boys and Girls Club specifically, and I know there are others. I know them as well, have done amazing, amazing things. And I am not a particular fan of nonprofits. I think everybody knows that. They're one of the few that does a really good job. So, I would like to see the fence done for no other reason than safety issues. I know what that trail used to be called. It needs to be fixed. So, if we can do something good for the youth that is really about the youth and still get that fence repaired somehow, I don't know how you can do that. I'm not asking for both. You're not asking for both? Well, I am. But I wanted you to say it. Certainly. Well, this is up to you how you're interested in using these funds, but certainly we could look at a split that had a certain amount of money towards youth programs that are run by nonprofits. So, if you're interested in using these funds, you can look at the! I think that's a good point. I think that's a good point. I think that's a good point. I think that's a good point. I think that's a good point. The agreement with U.P. says that we have to repair it, correct? Oh, it does? Yeah. It's not their fence. Yes. The agreement with Union Pacific was entered into a number of years ago and the city has all, by all means has to make any repair or maintenance to that fence. So, the city signed on to that many years ago. So, it's going to be this money or other money? The Uh-huh. So do we have any speakers on this item? Or did they all go? They all left. So if I wanted to make a motion, could we just say 70-30, 75-25? Okay, then I would like to make a motion that we go 70-30, 70% towards the fence, 30% towards children's youth, and that staff would bring back a... Do you need to bring back a recommendation on how we do the application process, or are you clear on that? I feel that I received clear direction that you're interested in social, emotional well-being, that you're interested in working with an existing nonprofit that's already providing these services, and that there's a scoring mechanism that weights those programs that are currently in use operating these services that will be able to... And then that it would be an amount up to the total amount. So somebody could apply for $10,000, or they could apply for the whole... While I'm seconding your motion, and Ms. McCarthy, that was an excellent answer. You're really good. What I don't want to do is that 30%. I don't want to give it to 30 different organizations. Right. A nickel here, a nickel here, a nickel here, a nickel here. Let's do something really good. And that may be two or three. And I know this is being a little vague, but have fun with your scoring model. Are you saying you'd like to limit it to two? No. Okay. I mean, I'd like to limit it to one. But that's probably not fair. But what I don't want to see is 20. We do this with other funds, and you're well-versed in strategy, and then we do a whole bunch of nothing. I'd rather do one whole really good thing, or two really whole good things, as opposed to locally sprinkled cherry dust on everybody, and now no one really has enough to do anything. So what if we add to that then to a maximum of three applicants? Two more. Awards. Yeah. I'm fine with that. Anybody can apply, but to be spent to a maximum of three. Kind of like the retail marijuana people, up to three, but that doesn't have to be three. But it doesn't have to be three. So is that a clear motion, Ms. Pressing? Okay. You got all that? So we have a motion by Vice Mayor Reynolds, second by Council Member Morgan. Further discussion? All right. Take the roll. Council Member Bennett? Yes. Council Member Brown? I'm going to vote no, but I just want to say I think it was a very worthy project. I just think you got it right the first time with the project that was compromised on for these ones. So I'm going to vote no. Thank you. Council Member Morgan? Thank you. Council Member? Yes. Council Member O'Brien? Yes. Council Member Tandon? Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds? Aye. Mayor Cooley? Aye. Thank you. Carries 6-1. All right. Moving on to Item 5.3, you're going to have to do this all alone. I know. Are you okay with that? I'm okay with that. Okay. Board and Commission appointments. Clerk Pressing? Thank you, Mayor Cooley, and Council. So at tonight's meeting, you're being asked to appoint two members to the Airport Commission, four members to the Architectural Review and Historic Preservation Board. That includes two regular positions and two unscheduled vacancies, as well as we have two members that need to be appointed to the Bidwell Park and Playground Commission due to unscheduled vacancies. As you know, normally the biennial recruitment starts in the fall of an even-numbered year. This one has been delayed numerous times, not only because of the number of applications or applicants that we didn't get, but also we... the Council asked for a legal analysis and there was some question. We had great citizen input in wanting to actually be appointed to more than one board, wanted to serve, and we needed a legal opinion on that. That is contained in my report that the City Attorney's Office provided. In addition, at the end of June, we had two resignations from Council, and then that also delayed the process, so that allowed us in my office to actually do another recruitment. As you will see, we don't have a lot of time. We didn't receive a high number of applications for both the Airport Commission as well as the ARHPB. I'm sorry, I'm trying to control the computers, too. Anyway, so during that fourth recruitment, we still didn't receive any additional applications. I do want to note before I go any further that the Climate Action Commission is still out there and still needs to be addressed and members appointed, and that will come forward at the next session. We will be able to do that at the next meeting. We just couldn't do it at this one due to it's a little different because there are seven members and we'll need individual appointments, and I need to work with our new Council members and get them the information to do those appointments. The legal analysis and what I, before I hand out the ballots, this will really drive what we do and which ballot you actually receive. I've been here 21 years. We've always had a standing past, you know, the practice that we only had citizens serve on one board at a time. Came up last year, people wanting to take on more work and want to help our city, and I think that that's commendable. It isn't something that we ever did. So in the legal analysis, and the city attorney can address it if you have any additional questions, he really, his office evaluated the nuances of being on the Planning Commission, which is quasi-judicial and has authority. And whether there would be a conflict of interest or incompatibility of two offices. So anyway, it is based on his recommendation in his report that the Council adopt a policy that would preclude serving on more than one board. Now we could say that maybe that's just for the Planning Commission because it's quasi-judicial, but I would ask the Council to consider formalizing our past practice of having one citizen serve on only one board at a time. I recognize in this day and age when we have less applicants that perhaps it would be nice to be able to pull into that pot of interested citizens. I'm just looking for direction from the Council. It would just determine if you want to move forward with memorializing our past practice, I would bring forward an AP&P amendment that would just note in there so that from here on out there won't be a question as to how many you can serve. So having said that, if you have any questions, I'm open for those and then I can pass out the ballot. One thing I will note, normally we've always done them for an individual board one at a time. You're going to get a ballot. I'm going to try to, we're going to try this. We're going to streamline it and it'll have the three bodies. It'll have the Airport Commission, we only have actually, if the Council votes to move forward with that policy, we would only have three applicants for the two positions. On ARHPB we have four positions to be filled and we have five applicants. Now on ARHPB it is a little more difficult to recruit because there are special requirements for that body. And then on Bidwell Park and Playground Commission we have two unscheduled vacancies and we have, let's see, three. We have six vacancies. We have six applicants for that. So I will open it up to discussion on that policy and then we can move forward with the voting. I would ask that you bring back that, that we memorialize that as a Council and make that a policy for the future so it doesn't come up again. Okay. Or make it a motion if we need a motion for that. Why don't I go ahead and do a motion for that? I'll take that motion. Thank you. I have a question about a different topic. Okay. I guess we'll do the vote on that and then we'll bring it back. Okay. All right. Council Member Bennett? Yes. Council Member Brown? Aye. Council Member Morgan? Yes. Council Member O'Brien? Yes. Council Member Tandon? Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds? Aye. Mayor Kuhling? Aye. And then I'll bring back an amendment to AP&P 10-1 to memorialize the citizens only serve on one board at a time and I'll put that on consent at the next meeting. Okay. Thank you. Debbie, can I ask you a question? Sure. We talked years ago after the architectural review board tried to change the hue of the color on the children's museum about, I haven't gotten over it obviously, about disbanding the architectural review board and making them maybe an appeals board. Would that make it easier or do we just make the council the appeals board and disband the architectural review board altogether? Because I do get a lot of emails that say the architectural review board will not be meeting this month. I get one like once a month. Well, you know, I would probably defer to Brendan on that in terms of the workload and the projects that go before ARHPB. In terms of an appeals board... Which Brendan? Because it makes a difference if I... Brendan Veague, I apologize. No, I'm just kidding. The short timer, no, no, I'm just kidding. But that would be absolutely up to the council, but I'll turn it over to Brendan Veague to respond to that. So what's the question again exactly? Because recently within the last three months I was asked how's the functionability of the ARHPB as well as the Climate Action Commission. And I tried to share the... I mean, the benefits it provides and the way it's, you know, putting all that responsibility in the hands of a single staff member has its challenges. And then having an ARHPB just simply be an appeals board, that's just time wasted as it's going to end up in front of council anyway. So I'm not sure the nuance of the question is... Okay, so then there's two different questions then. So if I'm hearing you correctly, your advice is take away ARHPB, whatever, I can never remember the acronym, and give that to a single staff member. That's too much work for the staff. It wasn't about the work. It was the responsibility. There are benefits. The reason we have these commissions and boards is to have electeds make appointments. Those are representations of our community. There are certain decisions that benefit from that environment. We have, I did share the last time we spoke on this topic, have pushed a lot of things down to staff. We've created lower and lower staff level decisions. If someone's going to repeat a similar building on the same parcel, we do that at the staff level, things in the downtown. But there are big, sometimes controversial projects. One will be coming up shortly, the ARHPB for Greenfield Esplanade. That's a good environment to have members of our community serving and functioning and interpreting. So that's actually a good point because that started at the Planning Commission, then that got appealed to the Architectural Review Board, and will almost certainly end up in front of us. Well, that decision got appealed to the council for the use permit. Now it's going to be approved. If the Council is coming back to go through the Architectural Review, yes, you're right. It could come back to you guys again on appeal. It's already in the form of some litigation as well. So that's a messy one. I don't like using the outliers as much to make things… Did you use it? I did. But my point in that case was that it is sometimes very difficult for a staff member to hold the line. It could be from a… I don't know. I don't know if it's from an aggressive developer, but it could also be from a frustrated neighborhood. A lot of the things where it's good to have that balancing act. Okay. So… And you know I think that I trust you and you're saying leave it there. It serves its purpose well. And there may be some changes in its form that will be dictated by some things that are changing with the state. We're having more and more of these objective development standards where we need to review our… There is some subjectivity as shared with this group. The color of the hue of the yellow. Which sometimes is a little bit… Sometimes can be very frustrating. It's one that you seem to never forget. So I understand that. Did he just take a cheap shot at me? No. Not a cheap shot. No, it's just a shot. Okay. There's a… Then we're fine. There's a lot of other shots. But that subjectivity is being taken away from us. It's something we should be more concerned about as a community to have some of that discretion in the quality of the built environment. But those objective development standards will likely result in us at some point coming to you and saying… We need to change. We need to change the structure of this board or change our findings in a way that will remove some of that subjectivity. Okay. Thank you. All right. Any other questions? Mr. Bennett. Since I've served on an architectural and historic preservation board for quite a few years, while I appreciate your comments, Council Member Morgan, and the fact that you're talking about that one particular instance, there's a countless number of other incidents where the architectural review board was successful. They did generate, I believe, a balance between what a developer, an architect, or somebody would like to see versus what might be best. And I say might be because it's so subjective. You are right. What might be best for Chico and for the neighbors and for the community to tweak the architecture? Well, the architectural review board, the historical preservation board, is far more positive, and it should be kept as is. There's going to be some changes. Reverend is very, very correct about that. We're going to have less… They will have less ability to make decisions because of the state, but I would prefer, respectfully, that we have more. keep it as is. Thank you. That's a way nicer answer than Brendan. But I appreciate both of them. I've got a question. Do we take speakers on this topic, I assume? We would, but we don't have any. Rare occurrence. What I'm going to do is I'm going to pass out the ballot. If you could circle the number that's indicated and then turn them in. I will just need a quick second to tabulate them by myself. At the end of it, we will have to select on A or HPB the two members who will take the longer term spots. We have two that will end in 2024, and then we have two that will end in 2022. But we can deal with that after. So bear with me as my renderer is not here. Thank you. I would never say that. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Madam Clerk, would you like us to take a five-minute recess? That would be lovely. Why don't we do that? Thank you. All right. We'll take a short recess, and then we'll re-enjoy. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . all in the Thank you, Mayor Coolidge. And was everyone okay with doing all of them at the same time? Because it did streamline it, even though it took me a while to tabulate. But anyway, I'm so happy because we don't have to do another round. Airport Commission, we needed two applicants. You have selected Mark Breckenridge with six votes, Martin Nichols with six votes, and it's just a majority vote of four votes. We'll appoint someone. On ARHPB, four positions to be filled, two of them long-term. It would have been a four-year term, but we're just now appointing them. Georgie Bellin received seven votes. Tom Thompson received seven. Oh, no. On the... Okay, so six. Apologize. I must have misread that. I will go back and double-check that. But she did get six. Tom Thompson, seven. Austin Barron, six. And Michael Guzzi, five. Bidwell Park and Playground Commission, Paul McCrary. Got five. And Frank Willis received four votes. So those would all be duly appointed. The only thing that we need to do on the ARHPB is to identify the two members that you would like to have the terms in in 2024 versus 2022. Can you repeat who's been appointed to the ARHPB? It would be Georgie Bellin, Tom Thompson, Austin Barron, and Michael Guzzi. Thank you. Mm-hmm. You can't do what you're doing right now. Is this a public discussion? I can talk to one other councilman. No, it's just Councilmember Reynolds. No, not all four of us, just Councilmember or Vice Mayor Reynolds and myself. We have a lot of discussions up here. So one thing I can probably... throw out there, as well as Brendan Veague, is that the ARHPB has specific criteria. And Tom Thompson is an architect. And so he meets that specialty requirement right there. They all have an interest in historic preservation. And I think in the sheets that I handed out to you, I indicate I believe Georgie Bellin is a realtor. She's the... She's been on there for quite some time and has served in prior years, years ago. And then I don't have my list in front of me to tell you what the profession of Austin Barron and Michael Guzzi is. So if you can look at those sheets in front, maybe that can help guide you in terms of ARHPB. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And you don't have to... I mean, it doesn't have to be a formal motion. There can be concurrence as to which ones you want to take the longer term. That's what I was questioning. I didn't know. I was just questioning that with Tom having the architect, that that's something that has to be on the board. And that was the question I was asking. Yes. We are not needing to do a silent ballot on this. We are going to make a... No, this is just a selection by the council as to who you would like to serve and in what capacity and how long. So it seems like it would make sense that maybe Tom and Georgie would be the longer terms and Austin and Michael was the other one that was appointed, I think. Right. And in addition, so we'll be getting ready for another recruitment because of the way this has taken so long. Those individuals that you select that are serving the shorter term can reapply and be considered to continue on in that capacity. That will happen in 2022. What? 2023. Well, right after. It's in 2022. We do it in the fall of 2022. All right. So we need a motion from someone? Just concurrence if you'd like. You can make it a motion if you'd like. It's whatever council would like to do. Then I would make that a motion for Tom, Georgie and Tom to be the four-year terms and Austin and Michael to be the two-year. Okay. I know, but she made a motion, so. Second. All right. We've got a second. Madam Clerk, you can take the roll. Okay. Council Member Bennett? Yes. Council Member Brown? No. Council Member Morgan? Yes. Council Member O'Brien? Yes. Council Member Tandon? Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds? Aye. Mayor Coolidge? Aye. Thank you, Council. I'll carry 6-1 for those two individuals to be appointed to the longer term. And then I will bring back the Climate Action Commission to you at the next meeting. All right. Thank you. Thank you. Appreciate you handling that on your own without any staff to assist you. All right. Item 5.4, Resolution Authorizing Grants. And a license to Carwood Skypark LLC. Mr. Alderman. Yes. Good morning. Sorry. Good evening. We're not quite to the morning yet. Sorry. Mayor, Vice Mayor, and City Council Members. Item 5.4 is requesting approval of a resolution to authorize the city manager to enter a grant of license with the owner of the Skypark Plaza, which is located at Skyway and Notre Dame Boulevard, also known as the Raley Shopping Center over there. So, at that corner. At the end of Skyway and Notre Dame, there is a small piece of excess city right-of-way. And after years of back and forth with the county, we determined it is city right-of-way. It's not state of California, Caltrans, or county land. And so, happy to bring this item forward tonight that would authorize that and allow the property owner there to put a pile-on sign for the Skypark Plaza at that location. That concludes my report. I'm available for any questions. All right. Questions? All right. Public comment? Chamber. All right. Entertain a motion. Move to approve. I'll second that. I have a motion from the Vice Mayor Reynolds, a second from Council Member O'Brien, a resolution of the City Council of the City of Chico authorizing grant to license to Carwood Skypark for encroachment on city right-of-way adjacent to 2485 Notre Dame Boulevard. Madam Clerk. You can take the roll. Council Member Bennett. Yes. Council Member Brown. Yes. Council Member Morgan. Yes. Council Member O'Brien. Yes. Council Member Tandon. Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds. Aye. Mayor Coolidge. Aye. Carries 7-0. All right. Item 5.5 has been pulled. Item 5.6, no items were added. Number 6, reports and communications. City managers. Any other reports? Yes. Honorable Mayor, members of the Council, I want to highlight a few things going on in the city that we are really excited about. Just going to focus on one department, though, because there's a lot of good stuff going on, so I'll be bringing back reports under my reports of different departments throughout the year. Public Works Engineering is where I want to focus tonight, for good reason. The team has been working diligently to complete some substantial projects for the city with some additional projects to begin shortly, which I'll highlight. Just recently, the Public Works Department of the City of Chico has been working on a project called Park Avenue Road Rehabilitation. I just drove down it today. If you haven't been able to drive on that, it's a smooth ride. That's between East Park and 9th Street, so compliments to them for completing that major roadway improvement. And a safety light installation at Marsh Junior High. I know the Vice Mayor was able to come to that, say a few words, and really appreciate that. That was a collaborative project with Marsh Junior and Chico Unified. And there's also a safety pedestrian crosswalk improvement as well over there. Also, this month, which you will see coming before you very soon, is Merion Park Roadway improvements is going to enable the private development of affordable housing. So another positive thing for improving the housing stock that we have. The City Council continues to forge ahead with making that happen. There's also a city safety improvement program. There's going to be 55 locations that you'll see throughout the city that get improvements throughout the entire city, from striping to slurry sealing, a lot of safety improvements that you'll see occurring over the coming months. And then one of the bigger ones, the Cohasset Road widening and bikeway improvements out at the airport. A huge safety improvement that will occur out there, and that will be occurring in the months ahead and hopefully weeks ahead. We thought it would already be started by now, but it will be coming sooner than later. We're also moving forward with a pedestrian scramble. When I heard that, I got a little bit hungry for breakfast, but it was not what I was thinking. It's just an active, it's just become active, and it's adjacent to the University of Michigan. It's at first in Warner. It's the first in the city's history of pedestrian scramble. What it does is it signalizes pedestrians to have the right of way in all directions. And then it goes to the next turn, and then the next turn. And so it's the first. We're going to try it out. Really appreciate Public Works Engineering for coming up with some of these ideas to see if they can work elsewhere in the city. So we'll see how that works out. We've got the scramble working. So there. And that's like a diagonal crosswalk, right? Actually, no. It's always. It's always. Yeah. But they can walk diagonally. They can go diagonal if they feel like it. But yeah. So that is, that's well underway. But mainly what I wanted to talk about with Public Works Engineering, there's a lot of great stuff happening. There's been a lot of great stuff happening over the years, which really gets diminished because so everybody kind of focuses on anything that's negative. And that is our Public Works Engineering director is leaving. And I will tell you that Brendan Ottoboni has been an incredible asset to the city. Over five years of dedicated work. I can't. I can't imagine being without him over the upcoming years because I know just how hard he works and what he's done. I just wrote down some words that really struck me about him. Competent, strategic, diligent, skilled, intelligent, trustworthy, an incredible public servant. And I also had on there creative. And when I put that on there, I was like, engineers aren't allowed to be creative. I don't think so. That's a unique quality. I will just call it innovative versus creative. And so we're really going to dearly miss Brendan Ottoboni. I'm going to say thank you to Brendan. His last day will be this Friday. And so I want to compliment you. I want to congratulate you and thank you for serving this community. I know you're still going to be around. You're still going to be serving us in some capacity. So I wish you well. And I will say, too, that Bob Murdock, who is going to be our interim director, is here. And he's in the crowd. I just want to introduce you formally to him. So feel free to say hi to him when you have an opportunity. We're really pleased that he was able to come up and help support us as we go out for this recruitment. With that, it's been an absolute pleasure, Brendan. Thank you for all your time. All of your due diligence and all your hard work. Thank you so much, truly. And that's my report. All right. Thank you, Mr. Ottoboni. Although we'll miss you. Wish you would stay. But still, we'll let you go. All right. Councilmember requests? I got one. Firewood? I would like to agenda a request that we would like to make. I would like to make a motion to approve the adoption of a report from Northstar on potential adaptations to the Green Line that would allow for more housing supply without threatening and possibly even protecting our chief and most important economic driver, agriculture. I imagine that will spur a lot of public discussion. And the way to start it is with the report that they'd like to make. All right. Second? Second, then. A motion and a second. All right. Councilmember Bennett? Absolutely. Councilmember Brown? I really wanted to support you on something, Mr. Morgan, but I can't do it on this one. No. Councilmember Morgan? I gave you your economic policies, like about give and take and compromise. I can't do it here. I'm sorry. Councilmember Harris? Conditional love. Yes. Councilmember O'Brien? Yes. Councilmember Tandon? Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds? Yes. Mayor Coolidge? . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Sorry. Sorry. Had to toss it in there. Any others? I just. The power's gone away. Yeah. Any other council member requests? No. Yeah. All right. Item 6.3 is on there for information only sunshine, draft MOU, International Association of Firefighters, IEFF. And at this point, we'll transition into closed session. But do we have any public comment for closed session? No. Have to ask. And then any disqualifications? All right. With that, we'll move into closed session and report out after.
