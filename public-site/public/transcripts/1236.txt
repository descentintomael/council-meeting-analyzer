I  Just actually wanted to do thank you  I wanted to thank you for the repaving of and it's separate and apart from closure discussion  Just full disclosure for the repaving of  Peterson Drive it has been fantastic  I also understand that on our city streets that Caltrans has done a huge project that's been disruptive  And so I'm happy to hear that hopefully soon they will get back to transitions because it's made it a little difficult  But I also wanted to say that I really appreciate the little  video clips that you share and just in light of things going on about  Freedom of speech ability to  Relate to one another and all that it would be super great if you guys could continue that and be  Relatable and be seen as the people that you are so that we can all understand what's coming up and  Be able to participate here in other venues  I know there's things going on in the park that are kind of really cool and interesting coming up  And of course, there's the downtown revitalization. So maybe if there's other ways you could kind of get info out rather than just  Having to be stagnant on the city  site  I know I'm hearing from people that they really appreciate when you kind of push it more outwardly so it can be easily shared  So that they can't feel like they can participate many people can't make it down here. So that's all I had tonight was a big  Thank you  Thank You Sam barber  Hello, I'm a little concerned a few meetings ago I had brought up  That I had witnessed a pregnant woman in her yard and she was you know  Freaking out in tears because her husband had just been kidnapped in front of her by an unmarked man  With ice agents and I think you all would you know say you support the Constitution?  And we'd understand that due process is not just for citizens. It's also for anyone on American soil  And it just concerns me that it seems that from what I understand all the Republicans on the council voted against even having a  conversation with the council about the  The !  Sanctuary city it seems disrespectful to a lot of the laborers in this city. I mean we're surrounded by farms  I think we all know that there are plenty of immigrant workers on these farms  Some of which are probably legal some of which are going through their process  This person that was taken had gone through all the legal processes their lawyer had told them that they were in legal clear  They were waiting for the papers to be processed. He went out to go get his garbage the ice agent showed up slammed him again  Against the chain link fence and took him to Bakersfield  so I just have a lot of concerns in regards to the  Constitutional rights of those people as well as the rest of us because if you aren't willing to take a stand  Against a fascist regime and government overreach. How am I to really trust that you're gonna protect my constitutional rights if their constitutional rights?  Apparently don't matter or maybe you guys don't think that it's a violation of their constitutional rights, but I think you should be open about that  Yeah, so I'm just really concerned for the public safety  I'm concerned about this fascist regime and the implications that's going to have on people's freedom of speech on the local economy  I mean if we don't have people picking these vegetables and fruits who's going to do it  I have a feeling it's not going to be a lot of you here  We're not really willing to do that labor. Those people are there some of the hardest workers in this community  They give a lot to our community and we wouldn't really be able to exist the way we do now without them  So I'm urging you to please reconsider and to do something. It's really disheartening to have  Some of the council members indicate oh we can't do anything when there's a federal agent  Like federal agency in town and they're just going about things the way they are. It's it's unconstitutional  It's illegal that kidnapping people off the streets. The police should be doing something about this as well  So just please do something seriously. Thank you  Thank you  And the last speaker is actually I'm going to read a letter into the record  I just want it noted for the record that we typically do not do this. However, there is a special circumstance  Around this so I will read the letter that we received  And this is from Andrew Merkel  public comment open session to the city  Council of the city of Chico clerk of the board wastewater treatment and engineering staff dated September 15th  2025 from Andrew Merkel in Chico, California  95926 there's an email address.

That'  s critical on this  project because in order to do  this work we have to take this  portion of the sewer plant  offline and do that during the  dry season flows when flows at  the sewer plant are less. In  addition to that we have to  work window to complete the work.  We advertise originally for bid  on July 8 we held a mandatory  pre-bid essentially what that is  we met on site with potential  contractors in order to bid on  the project you must be present  walk the job and then through  the process of advertisement  things come up and so you do  what'  s called the  pre-bid process.  s a total of four  addenda on this project and  ultimately we open bids on  August 5 at 2 p.m.  What typically happens on a  project when we receive and  verify bids first we have to  determine if they'  re responsive and  ultimately what we do is we issue  a notice of intent to award  contract to the lowest responsive  bidder. What that action does  and it initiates per our  specifications and code a  We have a five day protest  period where other bidders if  they disagree with that can  protest and so ultimately on  August 8 we received the bid  protest from lorraine brothers  construction in our teams  review and my determination we  denied that protest and then  ultimately responded with an  appeal on August 22 from lorraine  brothers construction.  So the legal considerations  ultimately as a public agency we  are governed by public contract  code and in the realm of public  contracts award must go to the  lowest responsive and responsible  bidder who meets all technical  and legal requirements and  secondarily cannot be waived when  they affect project scope  construction costs or competitive  fairness among bidders. In  addition in our bid documents we  specify all the rules and  requirements and the rules and  requirements associated with  these bidding procedures. There  are several items here that the  contractors must follow  essentially when we have those  addenda there'  s a specific form and  manner in which you must  acknowledge those changes.  So in our review and determination  this is our bid opening tabulation  so we do this on every project  when we open bids. As you can  see how we format this is we  received a total of six bids  and for each of those addenda  we have to go through the bid  document and ensure they'  ve met all that criteria. As  you can see here at the bottom  for the lorraine brothers  construction addenda one and  addenda three were omitted or  not provided and therefore that  was the basis for the  determination of being  nonresponsive. For context  addenda one was very minor in  nature it just changed the final  date of the bid questions that  mandatory pre-bid additional  structural cracks were identified  and additional project requirements  that modified the project  specifications and project plans.  So based on that and the not  providing the addenda three  specifically acknowledgement is  the basis for being nonresponsive  from staff' s perspective. So for  context specifically this is what  the addenda three looks like  this is the information in the  addenda. These are the project  plans that were associated with  that so there was additional  elements and cracks that need to  be repaired with additional  information. This is what that  addenda three or addendum three  looked like the acknowledgement  form that all of the contractors  have a signature line and  acknowledge that they'  ve reviewed that those changes  are incorporated into their bids.  that we received from the  lorang brothers construction it  was just a portion of the  specifications not on the city  form and therefore did not  acknowledge all of the scope  changes associated with that.  For context the other addenda  ms that were issued were  acknowledged on the proper form  so there'  s not confusion all the other  information that we need to  communicate with the contractors  submitted on the proper forms.  In terms of communication just  context our job as staff is to  give you information and make  sure as the city council you  have all the information. If the  appeal is upheld just  communication wise want to  acknowledge a couple of potential  things that can happen there could  be additional change orders  because what happens if the  appeal is upheld the likely  sequence of events would be we  would have to remove the notice  of intent to award that was  already issued to the other low  bid contractor that was  responsive wm lyle's and we would  have to issue a notice of intent  to award to the lorang brothers  that would then reinitiate a  five-day appeal period in which  all the other contractors that  bid the project could appeal so  the potential for receipt of another challenge from the other bidders  would be likely in that. Ultimately  that could lead to having to deal  with legal challenges or potentially  throwing out the bids all together  and re advertising and causing delays  to the project. What those delays  could result in is as I mentioned  before in the project timeline is  if we don' t get the long lead  materials approved and procured in  time we could essentially miss that  entire construction season next  summer and the project would not  start until the summer of 2027.  thank you.  thank you.  thank you.  thank you.  based on all that information  our staff recommendation is that the  city council denied the appeal based  on the director of public works  engineering determination that the  lorang brothers construction bid was  nonresponsive. That concludes my  report and I' m available if you  have any questions.  we will open the public  hearing.  actually before we open the public hearing does council have  I' m going to ask the  council member holly.  just real quickly I believe I saw  the other the next lowest bid was  around $800,000 higher than what the  lorang brothers submitted is that  correct?  yes.  I' ll get it right here.  yes.  and so the engineers estimate was  actually about 8.9 million so all bids  we have projects that were in that  6 to 6.5 million and they were  about 800,000 below.  it' s important to note just because  there may be the lowest bid or now  does not mean it equates to lower  in the long run at the end of the  project due to change orders and other  elements like that.  I was going to ask a follow-up  to that usually in your experience  bids that much lower than what the  industry average is. Are there other  yes.  obviously the basis for our  determination was based on the  requirements in my experience I' ve  worked in construction and estimating  sometimes estimators can leave out  elements of the project that then can  lead to again costly change orders  later on.  that is sometimes representation I  believe is roughly around 18% lower  and so that'  s a pretty substantial  amount to be left on the table. But this case specifically the focus is on the missing addendums that were a required step of the application process that were just not submitted. Correct. Councilmember Winslow. Yeah you mentioned that they did acknowledge some of the material factors in that addendum three the structural crack repairs. Did that account for the bulk of the costly items or do you think they really just didn't estimate the proper cost because they didn't actually notice all of the changes.  and it is and it is and it is  and it is and it is and it is  and it is and it is and it is  and it is and it is and it is  perhaps that could be asked to  them when they get up and speak.  All I know is that we did not  receive it on the proper form  that is acknowledged in the  bidding documents that identifies  and acknowledges all of the  changes associated with addendum  number 3.  no other comments?  we will open the public hearing.  I will call the  the appellant now has 15  minutes.  I will call carol loring up.  I will get it to be 15 minutes.  good evening.  my name is carol with loring  brothers construction.  I would like to let all of you  know how grateful I am to have  the opportunity to be here today  and to hear what I have to say  regarding the bid.  Mr. Ottoboni just explained to  you how the bid process works  the project that is in upcoming  and I am here to let you know  that I represent the loring  brothers and the people who work  for us.  I have worked in the office for  the last 35 almost 40 years for  my father mike loring who  established the construction  company in 1972 and he passed  away two years ago.  So my two younger brothers and  I are continuing on with the  company and for this particular  project we it is my sole  responsibility one of the jobs  that I have with the company is  putting the bid documents  together.  And I take that very seriously  it has a lot of weight behind it  especially when it comes to  a project of this size.  So I am here to let you know  that addendum 3 I did miss the  signature page the very first  page of addendum 3 I never ever  saw.  Electronically I went to the  site and printed addendum 3  and I never ever saw the cover  page.  I knew that there should be a  cover page but I never ever saw  it and I never ever saw it  again.  So I had to print the  documents that I did see and I  hand wrote at the top of addendum  3 that it was acknowledged and  then on the second page I had my  brother Charlie loring sign it  and date it.  Which is what we did with the  other three addenda.  Regarding addendum 1 Mr.  Ottoboni stated that we did not  have it in our bid package that  is not correct.  There were two addendum 1  that were issued.  I printed the first addendum  1.  It was acknowledged properly by  my brother Charlie also.  And so therefore I made good  faith effort with addendum 3  by printing the document itself  and having it signed and  acknowledged.  Our project estimator for the  job did have addendum 3 in its  document.  And he did know all of the  information that was involved in  addendum 3 and he did bid the  project accordingly with all four  addenda acknowledged.  And so therefore our bid I feel  on behalf of loring brothers was  responsive and responsible.  And that's kind of it.  Yes.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right.  We do not have any other speakers.  We have no other speakers.  Okay.  So you don't need to sit down and  let anybody else come up.  So are we going to take we don't  have any other speakers so there's  nothing for you to read.  But at this point we will close  the public hearing and we will  have council member discussion.  Who on council would like to speak  and go first?  Anybody?  No?  Do you have questions?  I'm not sure if this is for the  appalant or for Mr.  Adabani really.  I guess I'm still unclear on what  was missing if it was just the  signature page from the addendum?  That's correct.  It was just the signature page.  Okay.  The very, very top page.  So do you believe that all of  the main content covered by  addendum 3 that could have  impacted the final cost estimate  that all of that was in the  public hearing?  Yes.  That is correct.  Okay.  Okay.  Is this council discussion?  Are we asking questions of the  appalant?  I think we can do both at this  point.  Okay.  Just a general comment.  I think the consequences are far  too vast to approve the appeal.  I think it sounds like our staff  did exactly as they should have  done and we should stick to it.  Any other questions for the  appalant or I will let her sit  down.  Okay you can go ahead and have a  seat for now.  Thank you.  Carol?  Any further comments or questions?  I would like to know if director  of the appalant stated.  First off it is always an  unfortunate situation when these  arise.  Obviously ideally we don'  t have to deal with these.  We spell out very clearly in the  project documents how to do it.  How to go about acknowledging  these.  All the other bidders seem to be  able to submit it on the proper  forms.  There is very strict bidding  requirements.  If we receive a bid at 2 p.m.  If we receive a bid at 2 o'  1.  It'  s deemed nonresponsive as well.  The attention to detail is really  important and critical to create  fairness in the low bidding public  contract processes.  Unfortunately that wasn'  t met.  I believe if we did not deem this  nonresponsive we would likely be  dealing with a legal challenge from  the other bidders.  We follow the process for a reason.  a legal challenge.  Thank you.  this is a real thinker.  I don'  t read the whole thing and don'  t know the answer.  I need some overwhelming evidence  to not side with you on something  like this.  We save $750,000 by approving the  appeal and everything goes smoothly.  People probably forget about it.  Nobody ever thinks about it.  process we will hear about that a  lot.  consider a motion.  I will move to deny the  appeal.  I will second that.  council  mayor.  There is a resolution.  Thank you for that clarification.  I will state that.  okay.  councilmember  g  goldstein.  yes.  councilmember holly.  yes.  councilmember o'brien.  yes.  councilmember van overbeck.  yes.  councilmember winslow.  yes.  vice mayor bennett.  yes.  mayor reynolds.  unfortunately, yes.  the adoption of the resolution  that denies the appeal did pass.  7-0.  sorry.  please bid on things in the  future.  s nothing personal and we look  forward to hopefully having you  serve us in our community in the  future.  thank you.  all right.  public hearing 4.2 consolidated  annual performance and evaluation  report for cbdg.  ms.  mary jo alonzo our housing program  manager.  welcome.  good evening, mayor, vice mayor,  councilmembers.  my presentation tonight provides an  end-of-year overview highlighting what  housing completed last year and gives  the public an opportunity to make  comments on the report as required as a  condition of receiving the federal  funding from the department of housing  and urban development, hud.  the report is referred to as a  consolidated annual performance report  but I'll be calling it the caper for  short.  and the purpose of the caper is to report on the progress in carrying out the city's  five-year strategic plan for both cdbg  and home programs as well on reporting on the specific achievements of the annual action plan and the city's actions to further fair housing.  the full caper report was included with the staff agenda or staff report in council's agenda as attachment a.  this presentation will provide a review of the uses of the funding which focuses on supporting the five priority needs  that the council has set out in the  report.  affordable housing over the last  program year.  affordable home owner and rental housing assistance for the following projects.  the city partnered with and donated  land to habitat for humanity for the  habitat wisconsin project known as  roslyn court.  as you see above, habitat is currently  working on completing infrastructure and  the city has been  funding for the development of five  self-help homes.  construction is set to begin this fall.  last year was the final year of drawing  down retention funds for the affordable  housing development called the  foundation.  this is on park avenue.  the city contributed both home and cdbg  funding to support the development of  59 units.  43 of those received project based  vouchers and 27 are designated for  the second priority is homeless  prevention.  the city maintains a continued  partnership with the housing authority  of the county of butte and with other  participating social service providers  and we fund the tenant based rental  assistance.  last year we provided support for 22  households which provides rental  support up to 24 months.  public service funding was also  provided to chico meals on wheels and  peg taylor center.  cdbg disabled safe and living  independently at home.  the third priority need is homeless  services.  cdbg funds went towards directly  supporting homeless individuals  through programs provided by  catalyst domestic violence services  true north housing alliance chat and  community action agency.  over the past year over 1,000  the fourth priority need is  economic development where cdbg funds  were used to support small businesses  through training and counseling  services which are offered by the  small business development center at  butte college.  the program exceeded their goal and  provided counseling to 268 low and  moderate income businesses.  the program exceeded their goal and  also the final priority need is  neighborhood revitalization which we  utilize cdbg funding to support code  enforcement activities in low and  moderate income areas.  helping to prevent neighborhood  decline.  the slide show above shows all code  cases citywide with shaded areas  representing low income census blocks.  those dots on the map mark individual  cases.  reported.  for reporting we focus on cases that  are within those shaded low and  moderate income areas and report that  information to hud.  overall last year the hud programs  expended a little the home programs  expended a little over $258,000.  cdbg was $828,000.  we are wrapping up our cdbg  $2,000 in cdb funds which were  specific for coronavirus.  we received those in 2020.  over $1 million went to local  service providers to provide  services for individuals that were  affected by covid.  as previously mentioned four  educational workshops were held  last year with a total of 266  students.  we also regularly update information  and resources on our city's website  regarding for housing and tenant  protections.  I'm also going to take this  opportunity tonight to provide you a  brief update on recent affordable  housing developments in chico.  as you know following the campfire  special disaster recovery funding and  tax credits were awarded to butte  county.  specifically i'm reporting on the  projects that were funded by the  county of chico.  housing complex in chico.  more than 1200 units have moved  forward.  of those about 78% are now  complete.  22% is about 277 units are under  construction.  i have a small project summary  here.  there are additional details  available on page 15 of my  report that go through each  project.  support the income levels for  those units. Of the city'  s $32.5 million cdbg  allocation we were able to fund  and support three projects.

This concludes my report  I' m happy to answer any questions  that you may have.  Any questions for  Ms. Alonso?  Council member Winslow?  I noticed you said the amount of money we have  going towards the priority area of  homelessness prevention is about 15% of the  total. I wonder if you know about  how much the priority area of  neighborhood revitalization specifically code  enforcement is drawn out of this?  Specifically code enforcement is  140,000 so it'  s also about 15%.  Anybody else? Council member  Hawley? Just a comment thank  you so much Ms. Alonso for  the presentation and  information. I know that  the citizens I represent in  district 5 are really proud of the work  that you do. You should be proud of  yourself and your team thank you.  Thanks.  All right thank you very much  Ms. Alonso. Okay we'  ll open the public hearing how many  speakers do we have? We don'  t have any. All right we will  close the public hearing.  We'  re closing the public hearing  tonight. What are we accepting  the report?  Just accepting it. Okay.  So we don'  t need a motion or anything? We need a motion right  now. I would go ahead and do a motion so  that we can indicate. All right move to approve.  Seconded.  All right.  Got a motion and a second. Okay.  Goldstein? Yes.  Council member  Hawley? Yes.  Council member O'Brien? Yes.  Council member Van Overbeck? Yes.  Council member Winslow? Yes.  Okay.  Vice mayor Bennett? Yes.  Mayor Reynolds? Aye.  Carries 7-0.  And yes the public she did close the  public hearing. Is that okay?  Yeah.  We were thinking about leaving it open for 15 days but we went ahead and closed it.  I don' t think anybody wants to be here that long.  All right 5.1 Peterson Memorial Drive six month review.  Mr. Eric Gustafson,  director of public works and maintenance.  Operating  operations and maintenance.  Don' t forget operations.  Thank you.  You can go back to that if you need.  Laptop. I just have a brief map.  I keep pushing and I swear I' m not trying to prevent you from doing a PowerPoint.  There is some thought of that but no.  Okay thank you council.  Mayor, vice mayor, honored to speak to you tonight.  This is a quick item.  It' s just an extension from the February 19th direction from council to have a six month trial period to close the interior roads of Bidwell Park and lower Bidwell Park to vehicular traffic on weekends and national holidays.  So we started that closure in February.  Some key findings, you know, traffic circulation, vehicular traffic reduced overall obviously.  Parking access at picnic sites is eliminated during the closure days.  No significant changes.  No additional and additional and additional and additional and additional and additional and additional and additional and additional and additional and additional and additional and additional and additional and additional and additional and additional and additional and additional and additional and additional and additional and additional and additional and additional and additional and additional and additional and additional and additional and additional and additional and additional and additional and additional and additional and additional and additional and additional and additional and additional and additional and additional and additional and additional and additional and additional and additional and additional and additional and additional and additional and additional and additional and additional and additional and additional and additional and additional and additional and additional and additional and additional and additional and additional and additional and additional and additional and additional and additional and additional and additional and additional and additional and additional and additional and additional and additional and additional and additional and additional and additional and additional and additional and additional and additional and additional and additional and additional and additional and additional and additional and additional and additional and additional and additional and additional and additional and additional and additional and additional and additional and additional and additional and additional and additional and additional and additional and additional and additional and  So after these six months, we are here,  and we have discussed this at length with staff  and kind of determined three options to maybe guide a decision tonight.  The first option is to return it the way it was,  which is both roads are open to vehicles seven days per week,  11 a.m. to 9 p.m. in the summer months  and 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. in the winter months.  And I just want to make note that the way it was,  just to prevent any confusion,  this map is on our website and kind of gives a good aerial view, if you will.  The green section of South Park Drive right here is open to vehicular traffic,  and it has historically for decades has been closed to vehicular traffic,  starting at Caper Acres all the way to Cedar Grove, the Nature Center.  And then from the Nature Center,  all the way to Centennial, it opens back up to vehicular traffic.  So historically, that section is closed.  It's pretty narrowed.  It is closed to vehicular traffic, and option A returns it to this status.  So both Peterson would be open to vehicular traffic.  South Park Drive would be open to vehicular traffic,  except for that section that's notated in the red font or the red color on the map.  Another option is to open Peterson back up,  and the...  lower section of South Park Drive,  but then keep it closed from Caper Acres to Cedar Grove,  where it's traditionally closed,  but also keep this additional section closed  from Cedar Grove or the Nature Center to Centennial.  The third option that's kind of presented from staff  is the opposite of the trial period,  and this would close the vehicles Monday through Friday,  but open it back up.  So that's the third option.  and the reason behind this is that it's a little bit more  of a !  It's a little bit more of a !  and it's also it's also it's also it's also it's also  you have not had any serious  or you have not had any  incidents of traffic conflicts  with pedestrians or cyclists  during the six-month period?  none reported.  none reported? Any other  concerns you may have regarding  opening up specifically  peterson memorial drive to  traffic?  we tried this experiment I  think it was good. Nothing  happened so now we'  re considering what  to do next. I want to ask you  because you are the expert is  there anything else you told me  that?  you are the expert so I want to  hear if there'  s anything  else you may wish to share with  us regarding any reason  whatsoever not to open up  peterson memorial drive to  traffic?  no nothing comes to mind.  thank you.  council member goldstein.  thank you for the report. I  have a question you mentioned  there was no significant change  in pedestrian or bicyclist  activity how was this measured?  this was just from reports we  received if there'  s any issues or  attributes that were reported  so we didn'  t receive anything.  there weren'  t counts specifically so if  there was an increase of  pedestrians and bicyclists due  to the decrease in cars we  wouldn'  t specifically know?  no pedestrian counters or  video counters or bicycle  counters on the ground.  did we also not I guess not  that cars were allowed on  peterson memorial during certain  days but did we notice any  trends in more people driving at  times when the road was open to  nothing reported obviously and  this is from staff observations  as well we of course surveyed  our park division staff on what  they felt and saw and so nothing  was reported from them either.  okay.  good to know and as far as the  options presented to us did we  evaluate any specifics of like  costs and benefits of them or  are they just presented to us as  kind of ideas to shape our  decision?  correct the latter.  thank you.  councilmember o'brien.  thank you mayor so eric again  option a as noted by staff you  mentioned that vehicles are  prohibited until 11 a.m. which  has always been the case with  option a and other options exist  for those not wanting to use  peterson or south park drives  correct?  correct.  that'  s not the case for those with  ada related issues however.  that'  s my opinion.  so I hope and I think maybe we  have learned our lesson from the  previous south park drive  discussion I think we need to go  back to option a I think it is  the best fit for that part of the  park from my perspective and I'  m going to support option a.  I would like to know and I guess  we'  re not in discussion yet.  we have three.  are you okay taking speakers  and then we can come back to it?  yes.  okay and unless anybody else  has anything for mr.  gefferson.  okay so let'  s take our  speakers and if we have three  then three minutes apiece and  then we'  ll come back and pick up where  we left off.  okay thank you mayor.  first two speakers larry willis  followed by nicole nava.  good evening councilors.  I'  m going to be very brief.  this issue has been kind of talked  to death both here and the park  commission which thanks to you I  have the honor of serving on.  I may be wrong but in all the  discussions that we'  ve had there is a record  of zero automobile pedestrian and  bicycle incidents.  recently I understand on peterson  drive there was an elderly lady  who was  driving a motorcycle and she  got knocked down by a kid on an  electric scooter.  I don'  t think there'  I'  ve been in the  community for 48 years and as  councilor o'brien has pointed out  there'  s serious  issues in closing off those roads.  basically in the days that you  have it closed you are limiting  access to the amenities of the  park.  and it adds and adds and adds  additional and adds and adds and  adds and adds and adds and adds  and adds and adds and adds and  and adds and adds and adds and  adds and adds and adds and adds and  adds and adds and adds and adds and  adds and adds and adds and  adds and adds and adds and  adds and adds and adds and  is eroding  because I walk quite a bit in the park.  Anyway, very  briefly, for  both legal and just  general purpose, I  urge you to follow Councilman  O'Brien's lead and  put it back the way it was.  Thank you.  Thank you. Nicole Nava,  followed by Ann, by Kirk Kaufman.  Really quick, getting reports  they can't hear on the live stream.  Okay.  So, here we  are again on a park issue.  First off, I'd be remiss if I didn't  thank you all for your reconsideration  of the South Park side, so thank you very  much from hearing from your community.  It's appreciated.  And as Councilmember O'Brien noted,  hopefully people will keep an open mind  and kind of reflect on what people were  saying about the challenges, because those that  were applicable on the South Park side  are certainly applicable on the  Peterson Memorial Drive side.  And I will say, as far as  statistically and things  and some of it anecdotal,  is I was trying to track that  unofficially, of course,  and the picnic  areas were way, way  underutilized. We're in the park  a lot, and  you know, a lot of people, when they go for a  picnic, they have stuff with them. They have  the coolers, they have the kiddos,  sometimes they have the animals,  and you have elderly people with you, so  trying to traverse the  kind of pitted trails from  Valambrosia, where you can park,  and then you hope you get somewhere  where there is egress out onto  Valambrosia, then you have to traverse  the inside and then get, excuse me,  and then get to your spot.  So that makes it challenging for people.  And so, again, like  was raised before,  it's also just like,  I believe we need to go to be  as inclusive as possible.  So I'm not sure which direction  you're all going. I am very much in  favor of A. I've heard from  quite a number of community members who are also  in favor of A.  And I think you've seen  some letters and such  to that end, and on social  media we see it. I  will say that  if, for some reason, you deviate  from A, the next  one that would be slightly  amenable would be B. And I  know on B, though,  it was interesting because  the part after the Cape  or Acres exit,  up through, I want to say it's  closest to Cedar Grove area or whatever,  has not had traffic through it.  So resuming means, of course,  near that area to the end of the park  and, of course, to continue allowing from the opening  of South Park up to Cape or Acres.  And I think, really, that  has worked well. I feel  like the community understands  to play nice. And I'm going to say this.  Having that road be so fantastic  just changes the overall  experience because you are able to,  you know, traverse it more safely, whether  you're on a bike, a scooter, walking  in your car, right? It's not lumpy  bumpy, so you're keeping to where you're supposed to  keep instead of wildly swerving around.  And people don't expect that.  I would also like to just  close by encouraging you to deal  with the e-scooter, e-bike  situation. It is bad.  So I watch from my porch, and I think I'm going to  do some experiment of my own to go,  how many are going by and what is the speed?  It's pretty crazy. I see it every  day. I'm on my porch every day. It might  just want to do something there. Thanks.  Thank you. And our last speaker  is Ann Biker-Kaufman.  Hello.  I'm speaking on behalf of the  Chico Safe Streets  Coalition.  So first of all, we  love what has happened to Peterson  Memorial Drive. It is so  wonderfully smooth.  And  the signs that allow  bicycles in both directions,  which is really great.  We would like to advocate for option  C,  which is to close the road  Monday through Friday and have it open  on weekends and holidays.  It seems to us to be a really  good compromise. The main times  that people want to use those  picnic areas is on the weekends  and on holidays.  And it makes total  sense to make it possible for people  to get their stuff and  everybody to those picnic areas.  But  on weekdays,  that is not nearly  as necessary.  And it would be good  to try and keep  Peterson Memorial Drive as nice and smooth  as it is. And if we  take traffic off five days  a week, that would really help  reduce the wear and tear on the road  and help maintain it in its current  wonderful condition.  And  as far as ADA is concerned,  riding  in a car is not the only  way that somebody with mobility  issues can use the park.  When the road is as  wonderfully smooth as Peterson Memorial  Drive is now, it is  a great place to be able to  enjoy the park in a wheelchair  or on a scooter or  some  or with a walker,  which was absolutely impossible.  And so having it  closed on weekdays  allows even people  with disabilities to  enjoy the park  without worrying about a  car coming around the bend  that they can't quickly get out  of the way of.  So we urge  you to choose option  C. Thank you  very much. Thank you.  That's it.  All right.  Any other additional comments from council?  Council member Winslow?  Just my opinion.  It remains we've had a couple discussions  about this and different park streets  and how it goes.  I'm reminded of one of the comments when I  inquired about this after it only  occurred for a short time. There hadn't been  complaints received at that point.  But somebody did say, hey, I taught my kid how to  ride a bike out there. Where are you  supposed to go in Chico to do that if you don't live on a  cul-de-sac or something?  I also have an aunt who caretakes for a relative who  has cerebral palsy and so she's in a wheelchair.  They've been making use of the space.  It seems like it's a benefit not to have the concern that cars  will be driving right by. In a wheelchair you're a little bit  lower. That's a benefit. It's really just something we don't  have many places at all to do that.  As far as what time we keep it open to cars and what time we  don't, I think there's a lot of discussion that could be had  about that. The option C proposal seems very reasonable.  I still think we're in a situation where cars go  virtually everywhere.  I think we're in a situation where we're going to have to  have to have a lot of space. We've built it this way.  We've built it this way. Having some refuges out of that  is a benefit just for the mere fact of having diverse spaces  within the city. Everybody does get to use these.  We wouldn't say that a sidewalk is made more accessible by  having cars drive on it.  Council Member Hawley.  I'll come back.  After talking with some of the parks and playground  commissioners, I realized I should have thought more  seriously when I made this vote.  I think it's a good thing that we're doing this.  I find it really important and it really is and it really  adds and adds and adds and adds and adds and adds and adds and  adds and adds and adds and adds and adds and adds and adds and but really to me it's for commuters, which commuters are traveling at higher speeds there Monday through Friday, and I also think I should have considered more seriously the underutilization of the picnic sites, and Site 37 specifically that had been used for a lower cost wedding venue,  the park is a community  community and we have to be  able to provide that support to  the community and that'  s some of the  feedback our parks commissioners  gave to me which I wish I had  consulted staff about more.  Looking back I definitely  support c and I want to point  out also it does get a little  frustrating sometimes  homogenizing people who live  with disabilities just last week  I saw a father and son using  what looked like to me as a  diy mobility device where they  could sit side by side while the  father was pedaling and the son  was able to enjoy the views and  again that would not be possible  if it weren'  t for a smooth road.  The reason that another reason  I'  m supporting c is  because everyone across the aisle  can agree that that smooth road  has been pretty life changing for  anyone who uses lower park  regularly and I think that'  s a good thing.  s a good thing because the  fewer cars we have traveling on  this seven days a week the longer  it'  s going to take for this road to  degrade and the longer that our  citizens every citizen will be  able to enjoy the road as it is.  councilmember van overby.  I have a question for the  clerk first debbie are we going  to vote on these options in  sequence and the first one that  gets a majority how does it work?  if you want to vote on the  options and you select the one  that you want.  The council can choose to go down  the list and whichever one gets a  majority vote but really it'  s based on the discussion you  have and someone who makes the  motion.  I was the person who  originally proposed shutting this  thing down back in february and  there have not been any accidents  since.  to me it'  s more about what the  experience is to be in the park  when you'  re walking and not having to  look over your shoulder for a  car and my colleague Mr. Winslow  used the term of refuge.  I don'  t think option c makes any sense  because the whole idea is to  minimize the conflict between cars  and people and when you want to  do that is when there'  s a lot of people and a lot of  cars and that'  s on the weekend.  So opening it on the weekend and  shutting it down during the week  to me doesn'  t make any sense.  Maybe it makes sense to you Eric  but I don'  t understand it.  But having said that I have heard  from a lot of people who are  troubled by this because for all  the reasons we talked about and  I was particularly moved by a  friend of mine Michelle Shover who  used to run the poli sci department  and is in a wheelchair and that  she enjoyed going to the park on  the weekends for picnics and now  she can'  t do that.  So I'  m going to agree with my colleague  Mr. O'  bryan and support option a.  Is that a motion?  Council member?  I will make it a motion but I  think some other people have  questions.  I think we have a motion to  vote.  Council member goldstein wanted  to talk and vice mayor bennett did  too.  Let me take council member  goldstein first.  She pinged me first and I got  you I promise.  thank you mayor.  This is a different location than  south park drive to begin with  and we'  ve done the trial period.  We found that the main access  was the main issue was access to  the picnic sites and I'  ve experienced that meeting  up with my friends even if I bike  and so I was feeling pretty  confident that option c could be  a really good compromise for all  users of the park.  I really like the idea that we'  re making sure there are times  where people who need to be in a  car to access the park can get  there but then there are also  times where people who are  times where people can bring their  kid who is learning to ride a  tricycle or a person with a  wheelchair can use that fresh  pavement and we'  re considering as other  council members talked about the  longevity of our pavement in the  park.  I want to point out the automobile  pollutants are one of the things  I go to the park to get away from  and it is also about the experience  of using the park.  Again I want to make sure we'  re not precluding anybody from  experiencing the park however they  use it.  I'  m only going to support an option  that increases the ability for  people who aren'  t in a car to use the park  and get that full experience in  nature safely with fewer  opportunities for future collisions  and better access perhaps for  people commuting on a bike as  council member holly mentioned.  We need to be forward thinking here  I know we might be in a situation  where we might not agree on  something now we might be able to  revisit this in the future because  we'  re going to see more e-bikes  we'  re going to see more people  driving cars in our community and  more people wanting to walk and  bike through our park.  Whatever way this conversation  goes I know this isn'  t the end of it but I will only  be supporting something that  increases access for non-motorized  people non-motorized users of our  park.  I understand we have a motion  on the.  sorry go ahead.  we have a motion on the motion  we have a motion but we can  still continue discussion.  if I may make a subsequent  motion after vice mayor bennett.  I didn'  t actually have a second.  we still need a second.  vice mayor bennett.  first I want to thank mr.  willis for being chair of the  bidwell park and playground  commission you'  re doing an excellent job  I'  m glad we put you in that  position.  I don'  t feel I have the right to deny  people access to bidwell park.  I don'  t think any of us have the right  to deny people access to bidwell  park peterson memorial drive  specifically.  bidwell park is for all of us is  for all the citizens.  we have received a lot of  comments emails personal  comments from friends and some  people that aren'  t particularly friendly.  and overall the vast majority of  peterson memorial drive opened up  with the way it was.  with one letter from a gentleman  and said it so eloquently and  briefly.  let'  s not try and fix something  that isn'  t broken.  I think that'  s what we'  re looking at here.  with the probability of let'  s fix something before something  bad happens.  things happen.  we all know things happen.  with closing the park with the  like to say a few words to  someone who has an ad a issue  someone elderly such as myself  fortunately I'  m still in great  shape but there will be a day.  All of those people in whatever  category you want to place them  whatever classification you want  to place them leave bidwell park  open so everybody can enjoy it  that means leaving it open to  to get a car or a vehicle to get  to the park to enjoy it. Let'  s respect their  wishes let'  s listen to the  constituency and open it back  up. I'  m voting for option a.  thank you.  member wenzel.  right now upper park road is  closed on account of the fish  passage project I think that'  s correct.  we'  ve had it for the last five  I'  m hearing this  sense of absolute ism if we  deny cars for a moment we have  denied all these people ever  accessing the place but we'  ve been doing this I think  it'  s been quite successful I would  say except for the fact on a day  it wasn'  t close we had the park fire I  think it'  s a mistake to be leaving that  road open in general especially  when we have staff around to  vehicles but I think if we'  re going to make bad decisions  way that'  does have the benefits of all  worlds where weddings and things can be  scheduled on Saturdays but there'  s still a weekday and a  weekend day that people can use it in  the different ways that people use the  park.  are you ready for a motion?  I got your motion.  I think we got your motion.  I'  d like to make a motion that we  accept option a.  I'  ll second that.  we have motion to second.  I'  d make a subsequent motion to  have another trial period of  option c.  I'  ll second that motion.  just a second.  if I may discuss that motion.  sure.  I think that we are here as  decision makers to improve our  community and we saw that this  trial period on the weekends had  some issues and I think that  option c is a really important  way to take the good parts of it  which is increasing access for  people who want to bike or teach  their kid to ride a bicycle or  other such things and giving them  that opportunity for it.  But fixing the problem that some  people can'  t have a wedding on the  weekend or can'  t get to a picnic site on the  weekend. I'  m a big fan of trying option c  and I like the idea of doing  another trial period.  thank you.  anybody else?  council member goldstein.  yes.  council member holly.  yes.  council member o'brien.  no.  council member van overbeck.  no.  council member winslow.  yes.  vice mayor bennett.  no.  mayor reynolds.  it fails 3-4.  we'  ll go back to the original  motion.  council member o'brien to go  with option a.  and let us do the vote.  council member goldstein.  this is for the original  motion.  no.  council member holly.  no.  council member o'brien.  yes.  council member van overbeck.  yes.  council member winslow.  no.  vice mayor bennett.  yes.  mayor reynolds.  yes.  carries 4-3.  I have a comment.  the wording in the staff report  for option a is incorrect.  and director gustafson knows  about it and he corrected it in  his presentation.  but when you do the minutes if  you just use the language in  the staff report it will be  wrong.  I will go back and listen to  what mr.  gustafson said.  what we approved was taking it  back to the way it was before.  it is open to cars except between  caper acres and the deer pens  basically.  cedar grove.  which has been closed for 35  years.  11 a.m.  we will go back and look at  thank you.  corrections noted.  street lighting survey results.  brendan auduboni director of  public works and engineering.  yes.  good evening mayor vice mayor  and city council members.  item 5.2 is in follow-up from  city council direction for staff  to reach out and do surveys for  community feedback on lighting  we appreciate your help and  support in getting the survey out  and collecting that data.  the staff report identifies 147  responses that were received  amongst the various council  districts.  similar to what we would expect  the feedback generally consisted  of concerns of public safety due  to lack of lighting.  the majority of these issues were prevalent and incorporated into new subdivisions and development and so on. Maintenance issues were another item, so that's something we can address. But essentially this is information sharing and looking for council direction. We've highlighted kind of some of the complexities  and and and and and and and  and and and and and and and  and and and and and and and  and and and and and and and and  lighting. We have identified  with street lighting specifically  the cost variability depending  on where the electrical  connection may occur can really  add cost to that. Pg e alone  can be a significant cost if we  have to make a significant  electrical run to add new  lighting. That concludes the  presentation we'  re available for  information if you request or  have any questions.  Thank you.  Council member van overbrink.  I read the staff report and  found amusing there were a large  number of people concerned about  their ability to view the night  sky.  If you'  re concerned about that  you should live in a city you  need to go up to forest ranch or  someplace. I would argue we  shouldn' t consider those views.  I think the number one priority  has to be safety. When we look  listed in the data list it  should be what do we need to do  to make people safer both when  they'  re walking or cycling at  night and cars not being able  to see them and just in general  illumination I think tends to  suppress bad behavior. Those  are my comments.  Council member O'brien.  Thank you mayor and thank you  council member van overbrink. I  agree as well. It'  s about safety. I want to thank  brendan and the city clerk staff  for doing a fantastic job. This  is exactly what we should be  doing is receiving input from our  community and taking action. I  think that'  s important.  However I know this infrastructure  is very expensive but there are  some specific areas that I think  probably in each one of our  districts probably could be improved  for me. I'  ll speak for  district one. It'  s an area that was recently annexed. That'  s a major intersection in our  community. It'  s very dark at night and very  dangerous. I think we all have areas  like that within our districts that  probably need some attention.  Mr. Bennett.  I agree completely that safety is  the main issue. Thank you council  member van overbrink as well as  council member O'brien. That'  s the number one  issue. I think we'  s the number one  priority. I would ask I hate the  word staff. I would ask our team  to prioritize safety in  considering additional light  fixtures throughout our community  whichever district we'  re in. I  don'  t care but I think that should be  the top priority. Also have some  consideration. There were a lot of  comments about the night sky  which surprised me. A lot of people  re an expert in your  field. I leave it up to you to  make that decision. Thank you.  Council member  Wenzel.  Maybe if you have comments about  dark sky initiatives we all understand it better. It'  s worth saying. It'  s not about reducing the  amount of street lights you have. It'  s the design of the lighting. Make sure it'  s focused down so it doesn' t just spill over.  Some of the cheaper older styles of light would  throw lights out there or they'  d be  They got all these buildings in China. They got lit up and it'  s just for fun. It'  s doing less of that but having a more appropriate style. We  have specific standards for the foothills that I think are probably appropriate for  more of the city because it'  s a special thing but we can still add lighting in these areas. My  district for sure has a lot of areas annexed over previous decades that just never received  lighting at all. I think it'  s time we get around to that.  Council member  holly.  just real quick before we move on to public comment. Thank you again to staff for one putting  together the map of responses that was really, really helpful to be able to visualize those  clusters. And then also for breaking down input by district. I think in the future not that you  guys have ever not done this before but just because I'  m not as familiar with the other districts and my co-council members might be able to say the same.  That was really, really helpful to be able to get to the  other districts a lot better.  all right.  how many speakers?  council member o'brien?  no. I was going to agree with you. There'  s a lot of drawbacks to districts but there'  s also some pluses. One of the pluses is we advocate for those districts and we need to know what'  s going on in them as regards to public safety.  do we have speakers?  are you kidding me? Nobody'  s worried about the lights on their street?  not right now.  all right.  so what direction would we like to give to staff?  I think all the lights should go in district 2.  since we'  re advocating for our districts.  and oh, by the way,  bidwell junior high especially where we have kids traversing there'  e a couple of annexations over there.  those guys are really struggling over there.  guys and gals.  I have a question for you.  m going to ask this for Mr.  Aduboni if I may.  I'  m presuming that we'  re going to be able to only do a certain number of these every year for budgetary reasons.  can you give me an idea how much money we have available to spend on street lights?  how much available is a finance city manager city council question.  but  you should be a politician.  here we are speaking at a city council meeting.  I'  m going to ask this question.  I'  it varies greatly.  I think in the staff report we came up with a $15,000 to $20,000 per street light cost.  that includes the foundation.  again, a point of connection.  that can vary if we have to trench 1,000 feet.  maybe that'  s a little extreme.  but there'  e pg&e connection costs with that as well.  and the actual standard and everything itself.  if it'  s one off and one at a time, it'  s very inefficient too.  it'  s a little more expensive, higher unit price.  the intent for a lot of our road rehabilitation projects is when we'  re going through and rehabilitating the roads, we'  re doing complete streets.  we'  re looking at our active transportation plan for bike facilities.  we'  re adding lighting where it'  s needed.  we'  re closing gaps and accessibility for paths of travel with sidewalks.  the path perspective is a lot of those items would be addressed when we go in and rehabilitate the roads.  we'  re addressing those thoughtfully as part of that and doing all the underground work and then rehabilitating the pavement so we can leave it turnkey when it'  s all said and done.  where I'  m going with this is I'  d like to get a sense of the totality of do we need 1,000 street lights or 100?  I want to talk money with you, Tom.  how many can we do a year?  I would assume if we had a lot of road  s probably in the magnitude of thousands that would be needed across the entire city that are currently not there to meet our standards.  that'  s $20 million.  right.  it adds up very quickly.  that'  s why from my perspective there'  e an efficiency while doing it while we'  re doing other projects from a staff time perspective but also a cost perspective.  and it adds up and adds up and adds up and adds up and adds up and adds up and adds up and adds up and adds up and adds up and adds up and adds up and adds up and adds up and adds up and adds up and adds up and adds up and adds up and adds up and adds up and adds up and adds up and adds up and adds up and adds up and adds up and adds up and adds up and adds up and adds up and adds up and adds up and adds up and adds up and adds up and adds up and adds up and adds up and adds up and adds up and adds up and adds up and adds up and adds up and adds up and adds up and adds up and adds up and adds up and adds up and adds up and adds up and adds up and adds up and adds up and adds up and adds up and adds up and adds up and adds up and adds up and adds up and adds up and adds up and adds up and adds up and adds up and adds up and adds up and adds up and adds up and adds up and  my idea is for any pilot project we have to start as small as possible and for this that means about  $25,000 give or take so and that's just one street light that's one street light I know it's  no but that could also include smaller micro grants for like a couple hundred dollars to  install a light on a PG&E utility pole as was identified in the staff report itself  which I think is a huge opportunity but firstly where would that money come from my idea was  I was sifting through our approved budget for the year 25-26 and some of the allocated  monies from the general fund were towards council chamber upgrades.  It was.  I understand that the  $440,000 that was allocated to that I understand that this is a need and it was allocated to the  chamber upgrades for a reason and just so that we' re all clear on what the consequence of this  would be I want to read to you really quickly Mr. Sorensen's response he said I believe this was  adding to the project to replace around 30 year old workspaces in city hall mostly on the second  floor.  and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it  california and we'  re getting off at  late nights and at specific  intersections this is way worse  for example what councilmember  o'brien just talked about in  district one that is a much  larger need than maybe a major  road rehabilitation where we'  re  adding streetlights as part of a  larger project that doesn'  t mean the street  lighting needs are the highest  in that specific major road  rehabilitation project. Starting  small this is a one time one  year commitment and I would  really love a staff report if we  move forward with this but my  proposal is kind of a branch of  the capital improvements program  to direct staff to facilitate a  city street lighting grant  program to award one street  lighting installation and  support a hand-held street  I would like to see a handful  of low cost lighting solutions  for example leveraging pg new  utility poles if that $25,000  allows. I definitely don'  t want to  micromanage staff in this  circumstance I think we need to  trust staff with determining  which boxes need to be checked  by any community grant  applications but some of the  examples could be proximity for  k-12 schools or  k-12 schools or  k-12 schools or  having to be residential zones  but I think something that  would be a necessity is having  neighbor to neighbor  collaboration. So having maybe  five neighbors apply to this as  a group. Any thoughts?  thoughts?  may I ask for a clarification  were you thinking for the pilot  program the $25,000 coming out of the council chamber upgrades is that what you were thinking?  that's what I was thinking the  only other option I saw were the  station one and two upgrades  which are measure age funds and  I first hand had a tour of those  facilities and understand  that pressing need.  Right and I just want to let you  know that so the council remodel  is being funded by peg funds  that's public education and  government funds and it comes  from comcast and it can only be  allocated for technology and  funding in this room in order to  actually allow more of the public  to participate. So those funds are  identified and can only be used  for those types of capital. We  already did go out as well with  an rfp and awarded that and it  came in well under the $400,000  but we want to make sure that  just like tonight individuals  were saying that channel 11  wasn't being heard and stuff so  we have some immediate needs. But regardless I wish I could get some  I can't give you $25,000 for  one poll but you can't use those  funds for that.  I should have emailed you  too miss preson.  it'  s okay.  it'  s okay.  hold on city managers.  I believe you were referring  to a contribution to a project  as you pointed out replace some  30 year old workstations and  mostly on the second floor but  that'  s already gone out to bid that  money is already in company and  that'  it'  s a different expense.  that'  s what I was going to ask  because I know people have been  moving around up there and that'  s already started so I didn'  t know if there'  s anything left over from that.  that was going to be my next  question.  as it is we reduce the scope  of the project just to fit the  available funding.  that was also mentioned.  hold on.  m the council member  vandenberg.  overbeck was first I can comment  after that'  s fine.  we have very capable staff and  like I tell people they'  re almost always right.  I think we need to instead of  micromanaging this we need to let  the staff execute on this within  the whatever budgetary constraints  we have because we have design  criteria we have there'  s a number of criteria that impact  job is to say we want to do this  or not and our priorities should  be safety and if the night sky  is one we weave that in there and  then let staff come back with a  plan.  council member o'  ryan.  thank you mayor I would like  to come up with a top ten of the  worst areas.  this area in district one not  necessarily the worst but that'  s a major intersection west east  avenue and gwen we probably have  other areas within the city we  probably need to look at it would  be nice to come up with a list  doesn'  t have to be 100 doesn'  t have to be 50 but maybe 10 or  some other number that we can  look at you can bring it back as  far as the cost and we can  collectively vote on that.  I hate to try to steal money  right now from other places all  of those are mostly encumbered I  think getting some more information  identifying those areas that are the  worst of the worst what the cost is  and then bringing that back to council.  just a follow up question for  council member o'brien it is very  important that it'  s community led would we be pulling  that from the survey results that  were shared with us?  I think that has to be part of it  absolutely we did that for a purpose  so yes.  thank you.  I appreciate those comments I  think that'  s well put my only caveat and  thought of it rather than bringing  back a specific list of where we'  re going to add that we just give  direction more thematically based on  what we learned from here and I think  at least in three plus of our  districts it'  s these recent annexations that  lack even intersection lighting where  you can just go blocks and blocks  without anything I was looking in my  neighborhood I live more in the avenues  where we had some level updates  mostly sidewalks and it'  I think there'  s some  little gaps in it but I do recognize  especially reading the survey results  how many parts of the city my district  and otherwise that are so much worse  than that but I think maybe we can  settle with that sort of direction  this becomes a capital improvement  plan I think it already exists  street lighting improvements and we  look into funding it and subsequent  budget cycles.  vice mayor bennett.  questions throughout the community so  I'  m going to suggest  you make this a top priority in a  26-27 budget which is coming up really  soon it'  s only going to be a couple  months and we'  re going to start working on  that.  I'  d say you'  ve got a great vision but make it a  priority when you start working on the  next budget.  I have a quick question do we have any money set aside right now to start some sort of a project  project?  going to  council member holley  speaking of.  not specific for street lights alone in the past I can think of ivy street fifth street gosh I don'  t know was that 20 years ago maybe where that specific corridor was identified and a specific project was put together for that corridor but we do not currently have specifically identified and allocated funds for that source at this point.  at this point.  at this point.  at this point.  at this point.  a project that would be  probably operations and maintenance recurring expenses but not for installation just for ongoing maintenance.  I'  m trying to find the right  way.  in order to move forward with adding in new locations typically how we handle that in a project would be dedicated funding through a capital project and then what that allows for compared to an operating budget going through the cip project and then you can have a project that can be  and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and  re going to see how to  move this along and what I  would propose is that each of  us look at our districts and  based on the public survey and  our own observations prioritize  where we think street lighting  needs to go in our district  give it to director auduboni and  then you can roll all that up  and figure out the most  efficient way to do it over say  a ten-year period. I think we  need something like that in  order to prioritize it and not  only in our districts but  citywide.  it sounds like the first  step as mr. Auduboni was  saying maybe just identifying  that as a program through the  looking at the capital  improvement program so that  money is able to be set aside  because if there'  s no money  there'  s nothing we can do with that  information. Are these two  pieces first we establish that  within the cip and secondly we  the two separations part of is  what to do and the second is  how do we pay for it which says  when we can do it but where we  the high priority needs.  Each council person using the  public feedback and our own  observations ride your bike or  drive your car or whatever through  the district and see where you  think there are problems we give  that to director auduboni and  then when the budget period comes  around the next budget cycle  which we'  re going to start talking  about in three or four months we  can decide how much money we want to set aside for this. I would prefer that engineering staff pull that information from the survey that we have  budget that was given by the public rather than council members themselves.  I agree with that  people already took the time to fill out the survey  I mean we could also reopen it and add more responses but I think that the people know better than I do.  I think we'  re on the same page generally  like we obviously we talk and we talk about areas in our districts that need things I don'  t think there'  s a need to formalize a process for us submitting the input and that being held to a higher standard than other input that'  s given but I think that we'  re all who have been in this conversation and we have a lot of input that we need to get to.  re going to have to do that.  I think we'  we need the funding and the direction to find that.  what I'  m hearing and I think is reasonable is we can utilize the survey results, identify some priorities within each council district based on those survey results and feedback and then kind of break it up to where there'  s about an equal share of costs and that will help us kind of analyze what those costs might be so that we can be consistent within each district.  I think we'  I don'  t want to eliminate completely council input.  That'  s what we are elected to do is to represent our folks.  It'  s a representative republic.  Yes, take the survey.  Let'  s look at that.  Let'  s identify those areas but let'  s also have some input because that'  s our responsibility as well.  the other point I would make is there are some districts like mine for example there'  e a lot of new construction in district six.  There are very high needs.  all of district six goes to district two.  I was going to say the same thing.  different construction conditions mean they have different needs.  splitting up among city council districts is arbitrary and doesn'  t really give the highest good to the people who need it the most.  but it'  s good guidance.  if you notice that one district doesn'  t have any projects that'  s part of why districts are helpful.  Dr.  Radabona will be fair with the assessment.  I think we can move on.  I don'  t think we need a formal direction.  you'  re good.  I would say we will prioritize areas of high traffic.  Intersections and arterials, major collectors so those types of thoroughfares that carry higher volumes both pedestrians and bicyclists and cars are all safer.  and  and  and ! ! !  and  manager and finance director to  come up with those opportunities  and see what works best.  sounds good.  with that we'  re going to take a ten  minute break before we start on  wayfinding science.  .  .  .  if we would have done the  wayfinding report last time we  wouldn'  t have this problem.  5.3 wayfinding signage report  and I believe council member van  overbeck is recusing himself from  this.  on the advice of the city  attorney I own a building  site.  t know if you can see the  site.  we will come and get you I  promise before internal affairs.  5.4.  miss presson our city clerk and  brendan autobani director of  public courts and engineering.  I'  m going to turn it over to one  or both of you.  I'  m not sure who will start.  I'  ll start.  as you recall council at the  signs for the downtown area. And the plan was to create this ad hoc and have it start working on  it. I think the council at the time wanted to, there was a lot of information that had been  provided to the Internal Affairs Committee in April of 24. And that was a big presentation was  made by Nicole Farley from Explorer Butte County. So the council, I provided you all the minutes  from the IAC meeting of April 2024, as well as all of the documents behind it. As you'll recall,  I believe the county set aside $200,000 of ARPA funds to hire a consultant to prepare a plan for  county-wide implementation. And so,  in talking with Director Ottoboni and recognizing that both he and Director Gustafson both work on  signs and they work together and it's really more of a function of traffic engineering and  determining consistency. That's why I kind of wheeled him in and put his name on there. So I'll  turn it over to Brendan to talk to you about it. Thank you, Ms. Presson.  Yeah, just in terms of wayfinding, to Debbie's point, traffic engineering, that's more of a  programmatic function and understanding laws, consistency with other signs downtown for parking,  traffic regulations, and then obviously we coordinate closely with operations and  maintenance on installation application of those signs. As it relates to wayfinding,  there's also other background and history. At one point, I know  it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it and it  and whatever the direction is of  the council we'  re looking at  obviously we'  ll implement but wanted to  provide that context and  appropriate mechanism to maybe  move forward with something would  be creation of a capital project  so we can dedicate staff time  appropriately and come up with  actual plan that'  s implementable.  We'  re available for any  questions and insight if you  need that but we'  re happy to follow up  as you see fit.  any questions from the  dais?  how many speakers do we have?  we have one, nicole farley.  let'  s take that and then we can  carry on from there and decide  what direction we want to go.  thank you mary reynolds,  council members, thank you for  continuing to bring up  wayfinding.  this is a project that I  inherited when I joined the  explore butte county organization  in january of 2012.  can do in 2022 or 2023.  I apologize for that.  I would love to see it keep  going.  I want to emphasize if we as a  city of chicago continue to look  at ways to build out a  wayfinding plan that we do take  into consideration the $200,000  that has already been spent in  our community to create designs  for a wayfinding plan.  disaster plan do point to  visitor attractions as we were  looking at this through the  visitor lens but the designs  can go beyond the visitor  attractions and the  destinations we were pointing  to such as bidwell park and  downtown here in chicago.  look at the designs.  they were designed to MUTCD  standards which is federal  regulations as it relates to  streets and highways signage  designs so they can go on  streets but we also included  pedestrian signs at the request  of council member tom van overbeck  as it relates to downtown so  there are kiosks included in  there in the design implements  there is pedestrian signage for  walking districts and downtown  corridors as well as transit  the trail signage and kiosks  that we could implement in  bidwell park as well as other  parks throughout the county.  and then if any committee is  formed and you guys are looking  for outside participants I would  love to be included in that  since this was our wayfinding  project that we were able to do  in partnership with all of the  jurisdictions but funded by  butte county.  thank you.  and miss farley.  I was on internal affairs when  we adopted this and I was seeing  this is a really good firm  product I think it was less  apparent to me at the time that  we need next steps required  independent jurisdictional  funding but I wonder if you have  any feedback on what are next  steps for us in order to  implement this and should we  strategically determine some  locations or what?  so we in the plan kind of  again from a visitors lens and  driving traffic to our most loved  and beloved locations we  identified key signage  directs towards some of those  amenities and where they should  be placed.  so I think next steps if you  guys wanted to put a committee  together is what are the  priorities of council and staff  as to where you guys want signs  what kind of signs and then  identifying them so to build  them.  and then we have all the design  schematics so I believe you are  going to be able to identify  brazos team can possibly build  them or you can outsource them  if that'  s cheaper.  council member holly.  just a real quick question  for miss farley I'  m curious if  you know of any jurisdictions  who have moved forward utilizing  the blueprint that explore butte  county has worked so hard to  curate.  we do not have any  jurisdiction within the county  moving forward and primarily  go to do it in entirety was  about 500,000.  what we identified in the county  jurisdiction was about 500,000  and when this was adopted that  is a large sum of money for  higher priority needs that the  jurisdictions have identified in  terms of construction projects.  thank you.  vice mayor bennett.  I want to thank you for  sending me the information.  I'  ve been through it three times  now.  include the county folks is  excellent.  everything is there.  everything is there.  all you have to do is pick what  you want from it and then you  can move ahead with making the  decision.  the biggest decision of course  is where is the money coming  from?  that'  s number one.  I think this will be another  item on the 26-27 budget.  take a look at it then.  but I want to thank you.  thank you.  thank you.  anybody else from the dais?  that was our only speaker,  correct?  I have a couple of thoughts.  I have a thought.  just a statement which is  obvious to anyone looking at  this $200,000 document in front  of us there'  s a lot of value in having  continuity throughout the county.  but I also the county just got a  bunch of money too and I wonder  if they'  re going to do this.  I feel like if we were to put  some money into it it would be  more beneficial if there are  some other locations in the  county that are putting these up  at the same time because it does  have that.  s people who come to visit  butte county in general that we  want to try to bring from  patrick ranch museum or bidwell  river or sacramento state park  into the city to certain  locations.  this was passed over to me  because council member van  overbeck had his plate full.  I do think that the city is !  I think we do see that there'  s probably a need for some  sort of ad hoc committee ish or  just a group of people to get  together and talk about it.  I think the biggest question is  where and how to roll out and  what so we can have a good idea  for when it comes time when  there'  s actually money available.  right now we don'  t have any money.  but I thought some of the  comments that were made two  weeks ago when we'  re here like just talking  about the hole inside of the  parking garage and kiosks and  some things that are existing  that we'  ve talked and talked and  talked and talked and talked  community members, chico state  and downtown and what not I  don'  t think we need to name  those right now but we can  figure out who that is.  And bring back some  recommendations to council on  maybe a plan of start downtown  or start at the park we have  this beautiful new area in the  park it would be great to have  the signage to go along with  it.  I think that'  s a good place to start  mayor and I'  ll second that motion  thank you.  I'  m sorry to make a  comment I do still feel that an  ad hoc committee isn'  t the best use of staff  time because we have so much  built out already for this.  But council member winslow'  s comment got me thinking we  could maybe purchase a  committee that would be  willing to consider going in  jointly just to start a  conversation maybe next budget  cycle is this something that the  county would be willing to  consider?  can I just have a quick  question on ad hoc because I'  m being very sensitive  of staff time but we'  re doing our homeless ad hoc  committee and the only thing  staff I think is doing is  turning on the lights to the  room and the building and  room for us.  room for us and handing me a  recorder because there'  s nobody in attendance at the  meetings.  Unless we ask somebody to come  give a presentation or do  something specific I think we'  re relatively almost zero  other than making a reservation  for a room.  that'  s correct.  Actually if you recall when it  was first brought up by  council member van overbeck he  wanted to have actually Eric  attend that.  I think that was the  So if you are looking to just  create the ad hoc and just have  a discussion with some ideas  based off the report that you  already have, brendan has  already indicated that they can  look at that and obviously it  would if anything was going to  happen it would be in the next  funding cycle anyway.  okay.  Does that ease your concern?  in that case I would consider  it.  I'  ll even turn the lights on if  that saves dina having to come  over.  do you want any air or heat?  air conditioning would be  good.  it'  s always hot in that room so  yes.  would you not to commit  director ottoboni to anything  else but would you want one  presentation from him in terms  of how it gets implemented and  how it gets implemented on our  side?  I do believe there would be a  small need for staff time at  least to guide the direction and  give us some direction on what  you need and then we can take  the work from there and then if  we have questions we can just  take care of that by email.  that'  s kind of what I was  envisioning anyway.  thank you.  so there'  s a motion and a second to  create a seven-member committee  ad hoc with the members to be  determined.  with limited staff support.  is that correct?  that would be my motion.  thank you madam clerk.  councilmember goldstein?  sounds good yes.  councilmember holly?  yes.  councilmember o'brien?  yes.  councilmember van overbeck has  recused himself.  councilmember winslow?  yes.  vice mayor bennett?  yes.  mayor reynolds?  aye.  carries 6-0 with one recusal.  all right.  who wants to grab mr. van  overbeck?  you got him?  okay.  thank you.  thank you.  thank you.  thank you.  thank you.  all right.  5.4.  the internal affairs committee  report approval and action.  i'  m going to turn this over to  the internal affairs chair.  councilmember o'brien?  thank you mayor.  this was a doozy.  poor director out of bone.  we about wore him ragged.  so we had four items we  actually i think it was four  items that we took some action  on.  and the first one was the  amendment to the federal  add a few comments to  titles 10, 14, 16, 16r and  1, excuse me, 18r, the chico  municipal code.  and i will just speak for  myself.  i really struggled with what  is happening to our building  community.  they are overburdened with red  tape, particularly from the  state.  i want to make sure we don't  add to that.  at the same time, staff brought  up some issues that for me also  relate to safety.  so i'  m trying to balance the two.  i want to make sure we'  re not penalizing our building  community that is already  penalized by the state.  but also making sure that we  ensure public safety with some  of these recommendations.  so the committee recommended 2  to 1.  with councilmember winslow  opposing.  that councilmember winslow is  behind and and and and of concern brought up by the Chico Builders Association regarding proposed amendments. The first one was rainfall intensity calculations. Number two was payment design standards. Three was street lighting and four, traffic analysis requirements. In addition, we directed staff to further review  and and and and and and and  and and and and and and and  to see if there could be any  additional flexibility to allow  for some building cost saving  without compromising public  safety or infrastructure  durability.  This was the document that I  think the majority of our  association wanted us to find  some cost savings for building  community.  So mayor I would ask if  director adeboni had anything to  add after that meeting and our  recommendations.  just that we'  re constantly evaluating  opportunities to improve  processes but the primary  function of our municipal code  focuses on those three primary  being stewards of taxpayer  dollars so when we have  requirements looking at the  life cycle costs and the life  cycle expectancy of the  infrastructure that'  s constructed so it lasts  as long as possible and does not  become a taxpayer burden prior  to the intended life of that  infrastructure.  And then the third is typically  there'  s state and federal  governments tell us what we need  to do or what we have to do and  so those are another typical  robust package because it'  s been decades since it'  s been done the rainfall  intensity curve I think is from  the 1970'  s so this has been a big  lift on staff to try to update  this and get it cleaned up.  One consideration is since  there'  s those several items  specifically that the cba has  brought up there are some  elements that would be helpful  if we could proceed with  adoption of the other components  and maybe further consider those  four remaining items that might  be helpful for us as staff.  thank you for your report it  was very comprehensive and very  helpful so thank you.  I know your task with keeping  our community safe  infrastructure wise and that'  s very important I take that  seriously so thank you.  So fellow committee members do  you have any comments?  council member winslow  is a committee member let me get  him first and then.  super brief we had a good  cordial discussion about all  this I agreed that we could  reassess the threshold for having  a traffic study required from  we'  re saying about 50 trips a day  assuming it'  s a 50 unit subdivision is  what would currently trigger  that or that'  s what was proposed  there.  But the other things around  like we'  re using the best models for  rainfall so why would we look  at reducing that somehow like  the  the  what is the best information we  have not only where our model is  not good in the 70'  s but things have  actually changed and I think we'  re putting the city at risk if  we'  re not actually planning  adequately for what kind of  flood risk actually exists in  the community.  The other had to do with us  changing the street light  standards and it'  s like you make higher street  lights like you need a larger  concrete base that'  s just kind of intuitive.  So I felt like there was not  really firm direction being given  to engineering as to what to do  to address these things just  like find ways to reduce costs  without really knowing what to  I think nothing what I saw in  them doing their job said that  they were in error about that I  didn'  t really see a lot of room for  wiggling around that.  The other one was pavement  durability and I think most  people in chico could agree that  we should have durable pavement  so that we keep smooth streets.  So that'  s why I dissented on that.  council member van  overick.  well so when we referred this  to internal affairs the concern  was these four items in  particular and the  s add $3,700 to the cost of developing a lot, which is not an insignificant number. The last housing report I saw from the Chico realtors, the median house price in Chico is now $600,000.  and and and and and and and  and and and and and and and  and and and and and and and  and and and and and and and  and and and and and and and  the cost of housing because  housing is getting more and more  out of reach to people and so if  we'  re going to do  anything that adds a dollar to  the cost I want to know why and  it needs to be justified. The  street lighting thing for  example I have never in my life  seen a street light fall down in  chico because the base wasn'  t heavy enough and why we need  to do traffic counts for below  100 trips a day I think those  are unnecessary. You'  re the pro on this and you may  disagree but I'  d like you to explain it to us  before we approve anything that  adds additional cost. We need to  understand it.  thank you.  let'  s take our speakers and then  continue or do you want to have  something now council member goldstein.  I have a clarifying question  that'  s probably a dumb question  but are we only looking at the  development and are we looking at  decreasing costs per the internal  affairs direction versus what we  were presented before? I'  m confused because it sounded  like council member van overbeck was  implying we'  re talking about increasing  our costs for development.  just these four changes  add $3,750 to the cost to develop  a lot.  then we brought it to internal  affairs to try to decrease what  was being increased.  ask you what  I'  ll bounce it back to council  member o'brien.  do you think internal affairs should spend more time with  this?  like I said these four things  for me there may be some adjustments we can make.  I don'  t want to compromise some element of public  safety to save $3,700.  is there not something in our codes or  somewhere that we can give a break to our building  folks that will save at least that amount of money?  I can'  t believe there'  s not something somewhere that we can do other than these  which really relate to safety.  the rainfall intensity calculation which has to do with flooding that'  s a concern for me.  maybe there'  s some tweaks we can make to this to lessen the impact.  but I can'  t believe there'  s not something we can do to bring something back to them without  compromising public safety.  that'  s my perspective.  those are  some of the things we can do to bring something back to them without  compromising public safety.  we have our speakers too before we get too far down in our rabbit hole here.  you'  re the mayor.  m just thinking it'  would be good to hear from our speakers and there may be other things brought to light we might want to discuss.  how many speakers do we have?  we have three.  three minutes each.  I'  m an  and by kirk kaufman and then bill webb and chris gmpowley.  I'  first have a question.  if we want to talk about this one can we also talk about other things that the internal affairs committee did?  did you not want to talk about this particular  I  want to talk about this one but there'  s an  other thing that hasn'  t even been brought up.  you can make your comments for all of the IAC items right now and be heard on all of them.  okay.  so we'  ll get more than this chance.  correct.  okay.  all right.  so I'  ve talked to this group a lot about the whole issue of maize gates and boulders so you know how the chico safe streets coalition feels about it.  I  just wanted to point out a few things that I think are important.  think there are a few things that are really important to us that in the standards for these various kinds of barriers that there be at least six foot of clearance between any barriers so bicyclists have room to get through.  and basically boulders I think are a really bad idea.  they'  re not easy to see and they can hurt if you hit them.  I  also wanted to talk about the  floral avenue thing which hasn'  t been brought up yet at all.  but I just wanted to say that the chico safe streets coalition really applauds the idea of adding bike lanes and taking away some of the parking to be able to do that.  safety should be a number one priority and this is a designated bike route so some kind of bicycle infrastructure is really important.  I  wanted to though add a little bit of a  and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and  sidewalks. And it was said that the city of Chico is not in the business of building sidewalks. That  was something that I heard at that meeting. And that makes absolutely no sense to me. The city  changed that street from being a quiet residential neighborhood to being a thoroughfare because of  the changes that were made in the surrounding areas. And so the city should be responsible for  making that be a safe place to walk. It was before when it was a nice quiet street, but now it's not.  So it's the city who changed that and the city should be responsible for putting in sidewalks  so people can leave their house without being in a car. And one thing I wanted to suggest,  we really were recommending that there be no parking at all so that we could have buffered  bike lanes on both sides.  Thank you.  If you decide to still have parking on one side, a recommendation is to alternate which side of the  street has the parking. That would make the street have some curves in it, which would serve to calm  traffic. And also make it so that people could park on the same side of the street as their  destination, not have to cross the street to get to their destination. So that's it. Thank you.  Bill Webb, followed by Christian Pauley.  good evening and and  Vice mayor Reynolds and fellow  council members. As we have seen  that document is pretty thick.  I think it was a year-long effort.  Several of those pages are signed  by e.c. Ross if you can remember  him back in the 80s and 90s.  We are always conscious of and  sensitive to increased costs in  housing. We took these four  proposed changes and applied them  to a current project that is  being developed in the city of  chico. It is a 7068 unit  subdivision and they would  increase the cost of that  development by over a quarter  million dollars. That is  significant in itself. I do  believe there is flexibility and  we don't compromise public  safety. I also think there is  misunderstanding in some of the  things that we are doing.  there is any concern that we  should be doing something like  I think the  proposed standard is the same.  The luminaries are the same.  The luminary height is the same.  There is some confusion in how  the standards are either  developed, designed, written.  I think we do need to go back to  the city of chico and see if we  can find room with these four  items to compromise.  Pavement design is another one.  We are not asking to build  substandard roads. We are just  asking for flexibility. When we  propose a project and submit  improvement plans, our engineer  uses a caltrans pavement design  manual or standard and submits  those. There is varying soil  types across the city of chico.  Every road is different.  Classification is different. Traffic counts are different.  To add context to this,  amber grove, everybody is familiar with  amber grove.  It is on the north side of town.  It was built between 1994 and 2004.  This last year, I don't know if  it was this summer or last summer,  the city used measure age funds  for a slurry seal.  Those roads are 20 to 30 years old.  They have held up pretty darn well.  We are not asking for the standard  to be less or more than three on eight.  We are asking for if we can prove  with the caltrans standard pavement  design standard that that soil type,  that traffic count, that traffic volume  warrants three on six, maybe two and  a half on eight, that we have the  ability to do that.  The last one, I will let chris talk  on the other two on the  rainfall.  He is in a project right now  where he worked through some of this stuff.  Again, we are sensitive to costs.  We appreciate the general affairs  letting us have this discussion.  Thank you.  Chris giampale.  Thank you, council.  Chris giampale, epic homes, local home builder.  Yeah.  I think what bill is implying  is that us local home builders,  every single cost  in this crazy state of ours  is constantly adding more costs  to the price of the house.  I was building a house 15 years ago  that was $205,000 and now it is  $435,000 in costs.  We are talking about 15 years.  Every time we turn around,  we keep getting bang, bang, bangs.  It cuts by a thousand ways.  We don't want to jeopardize  any sort of safety.  I think that is what Mike is saying.  We have 18-foot light poles.  The standard is changing.  It is still 18-foot light pole.  The cost that you see that we were talking about  is $2,700, $3,700  is based off a project that I just got done doing.  We paid today  and Mr. Ottoboni has implied  that he has never seen something on six inches of AB  but we did it today.  I paid the project today three on six.  It has been working for the years that we have had.  The traffic analysis study  is another one that we are using  for 100 peak trips.  It has been used over the years.  Why go down to 50 or something lower than that?  CBA has asked  basically to respectfully request  council recommend to council  keep costs of developing more attainable  by making the following changes  to the proposed title code.  Keep same methodology in calculating  storm drain pipes  and infiltration pond requirements.  That is the requirements of NOAA  versus our historical rainfall amounts.  We have historical rainfall counts  that we have been using for years.  Now we are going to use a NOAA one  that changes dramatically  the underground,  storm drain,  and the whole system that is there.  Is it going to imply  that it is going to be a safety concern?  I am not sure.  The historical rates that we have been using  have been working over the years.  Pavement design allows the minimum pavement standard  to be over 6 inches of AB  and accepted design supported by calculations  by professional engineers.  Street lighting keeps existing standards.  Tom,  the street lights haven't fallen over.  If the car hits the street light,  it breaks the top of the street light.  But they are 5 feet deep,  30 inches around,  and then they want to add rebar and some other stuff.  I get it. We have Cadillac.  We don't need a Porsche  on everything.  It has been working over the time.  The last thing we have mentioned  is a traffic analysis study.  It memorialized the current practice  of not requiring a traffic analysis study  for under 100 peak hour trips.  We have been using this same sort of analysis  for the last, well, forever  to be honest with you.  Thank you. Appreciate it.  All right.  Just a quick point of clarification,  Madam Clerk.  On my handy dandy little cheat sheet here,  I actually have speakers listed  under 1, 2, 3, and 4  for all of these.  I think we were taking speakers.  I put that in there in case that was  how you wanted to do it.  Typically, we take all the comments on consent  at the beginning.  Then that way you can go through your  on consent. We do that with IAC.  I did throw those in there  because I wasn't sure you wanted to also include  council discussion on each section.  I apologize.  I think we will take them individually  from here out.  Then they would need to put which item.  I think we will take them individually.  Bill and Chris did,  but Ann just said internal affairs.  They don't say what item.  I can't.  Got you.  We will get this one done and then we will get on to the next one.  We will figure it out.  Thank you.  Further discussion from council on what we would want to do  of item number one,  the amendments to the municipal code.  Then we will deal with 2, 3, and 4 separately  just to make this easy. We will do them one at a time.  information that we need to  take a look at.  That'  s what you were mentioning.  Council member van overbeck.  Again, I'  m sensitive to public safety.  I respect our staff.  They do a fantastic job.  I also understand the burden our  builders are under.  We need to find some ways, even if  they'  re little ways,  to alleviate what we can at least as a city some of those burdens.  I think.  I will get you, council member van overbeck.  Thank you.  Thank you, mayor Reynolds.  Real quick, it sounds like the best  route forward is to pass  some of the changes  that have to do with safety  specifically.  I don' t know about you guys, but the neighborhood I live in,  I' ve seen plenty of street lights on the ground.  It is  a problem that exists  just anecdotally.  Certainly, the storm drain  pipe issue,  is of special significance  because much of Chico does live  in a floodplain.  Naturally, that'  s going to be a huge safety risk  largely to the people who are living  in basements.  As well as  the street lighting issue,  I understand that we can have  some flexibility on items like  the traffic analysis study,  but I hope to hear more from staff  which items really are the most  pressing to get passed and everything else  I' m comfortable sending back to  internal affairs if that' s the council'  s wish.  I would like  this to go  back to internal affairs  and for you guys to do  some more work on it.  One comment I want to make is  safety is number one, but we' re always  striking a balance. If we  drove everywhere 10 miles an hour  and we never rode a bicycle, we' d  be really, really safe. But,  d be huge costs to that. It'  s always trying to find a balance  between cost, safety, convenience,  all those things.  These recommendations from staff  feel like overkill to me.  I think if we'  re going to add a dollar to cost  we need to be careful about and  understand what we'  re getting for those  extra dollars.  and that'  s the first part of my  statement was striking a balance  between affordable housing and  public safety and you mentioned  that $600,000 figure, that'  s shocking.  I heard that as well.  We talk about affordable housing  all the time.  councilmember goldstein had a  comment before we'  d.  I wanted to put in a plug for  the fact we need to look at more  holistically the costs we'  re putting on developers for  building housing and how that  intertwines with how new  developments use our  infrastructure. At some point  considering our fee structure to  make sure the developments,  perhaps more dense developments  that are using the  infrastructure in a more  efficient way maybe aren'  t paying quite as much. That'  s a future discussion I wanted  to put a plug for.  I think the second half of  councilmember holly'  s question was is there  Mr. Ottoboni, are there things  of urgency on there or can the  whole thing go back and we can  bring it back later?  it'  s a very robust package so  to kind of nitpick things out I  think would be challenging in  this format. So it would be  helpful to maybe receive clarity  on what the council is  specifically looking for. We'  ve been working on this for a  long time and we'  long time. We'  ve coordinated with a lot of  different stakeholders. If these  four items are of most concern  again that would be my request  is pass the package. I think  especially the moratorium for  road repairs is stuff that we'  re seeing on an everyday basis  and the reality is if it'  s not in our code we don'  t have an ability to require it.  Right now we have because we  have good relationships with a  lot of our stakeholders and  utility companies they abide by  those and we'  have those but if they really  push back we really don'  t have any  mechanism to require it. I  think that'  s important in  consideration of these municipal  code changes. These aren'  t meant to be applied every  single situation. I think as  staff we have a track record of  not requiring the most extreme  aspects of the code in every  single element. I know we'  ve done our best to mitigate  costs for developers. I know  specific examples where we'  ve saved hundreds of thousands  of dollars, millions of dollars  for cost to developers. I think  our track record speaks for  itself and our ability to assess  those situations practically,  reasonably and in a cost  effective way.  can I make a motion?  yes you may.  I would like to make a motion.  turn your mic on first.  turn your mic on first so  everybody can hear you.  thank you. I would like to make  a motion that internal affairs  consider these four items that  were brought forth by the  building community and come  back with specific  recommendations on what you  think we should do.  can we make a friendly  amendment to approve everything  else that needs to be approved  beyond those four items?  you mean on the other items  in the internal affairs?  yes. this document right  here.  so just so you know, we'  re going to have to  I think those require  legislative action because  those were ordinances and  resolutions and those would have  to come back and actually be on  the agenda.  with the four items removed out  of the packet.  if you were going to discuss  unless you hold off on all of  the amendments, I'  m just saying what you  have before you is the internal  affairs recommendation to refer  it back to ic to have staff  look in those four areas for  new solutions.  so you'  re saying we need to do  two separate?  you can'  t take action on the  ordinances that aren'  t before you tonight.  so we would bring those back  but they would need to be  amended to remove the four items  that are being reviewed.  does that make sense?  yes.  okay.  I'  m still a little baffled by  it.  we will have to do that.  council to move forward on  essentially we would bring  back two packages.  one package would be the  municipal code changes minus  those four items for future  council meeting for approval.  separately we would go back to  internal affairs with those four  items.  is that correct?  that is correct.  that makes sense.  I understand that.  thank you.  and it is and it is  and it is and it is and it is  and it is and it is and it is  and it is and it is and it is  and it is and it is and it is  and it is and it is and it is  and it is and it is and it is  and it is and it is and it is  the !  I don'  t see anything coming out of  this in particular I don'  t think there'  s a light  bulb that will go on that will  change anything from the work  that'  s already been done.  what do we hope will come out  differently from this?  ideally lower cost.  we will find a new way to do  lower cost.  so again can we pass the other  items?  we'  re not passing any of it  tonight we'  re giving direction to council.  we'  ll bring those back.  for brendan to bring those back.  is there an alternative that we  could pass all the items tonight  if that was the council will?  in order to do that it requires  an ordinance and it'  s a first and second reading  30 day implementation.  so that'  s why it'  s not on there listed it'  s just the internal affairs packet.  we didn'  t put on a list all the  resolutions and ordinances would have to be  amended to reflect what that action is.  so that'  s the only reason you can'  t act on it tonight.  we could adopt as staff  recommended and consider lowering them but instead what we'  re looking at as I understand is not increasing these four  things like not changing the flood maps we'  maybe we'  ll consider the  modern flood maps later.  that'  s where we'  re at.  it sounds like if I were to decide to I  could make a substitute motion that we instead pass this for the next meeting.  pass all of these.  I'  m sensing that that probably isn'  t something that'  s going to fly.  okay madam mayor.  get this horse under control.  we'  ve got a motion and a second.  I'  go with that.  the motion and the second is to accept internal affairs recommendation to reconsider the four items come back with specific recommendations on reducing cost and then bring the other items back separately so that they can be acted on and implemented. And then those four items will be implemented. And then the four items will be heard at the very next IAC in October, and then hopefully those will be back to you.  we can turn it around in two weeks.  I think.  okay.  I' m hopeful.  okay.  so council member goldstein.  no.  council member holly.  no.  council member o'brien.  yes.  council member van overbeck.  yes.  council member winslow.  no.  vice mayor bennett.  yes.  vice mayor bennett.  yes.  yes.  all right.  massage parlors.  massage ordinance waivers and report from council member o'brien.  so I mentioned this meeting was a doozy.  so bear with me.  the light stuff.  yes.  supervisor durkin did a fantastic job finding solutions to unintended consequences from the ordinance.  if you remember we heard from existing therapists that would have been essentially driven out of business because of the cost associated with some of the pieces of the ordinance.  that was not anyone's intent.  I can tell you at least not my intent.  certainly not the intent I think anyone on the IAC.  so she came up with some solutions to not penalize our existing legitimate businesses.  and I think those were well received.  and most of those are what we'  re going to bring back to council.  there was a little bit left I think we need to fine tune.  so we agreed to take information and charlene in particular supervisor durkin take in information from the industry to fine tune that a little bit and then bring that back to our IAC meeting one more time.  and then bring it back to full council a little better fine.  thank you.  and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it  Mayor Reynolds? Aye.  Carries 7-0.  And let the record reflect that they are massage professionals  and I apologize for using the wrong wording on that when I  brought it up.  Item number 3, road rehabilitation project on  floral avenue.  Again, we tasked director Ottoboni with presenting, did  a fantastic job.  I think we have a lot of work to do.  I'm just going to give you what action we took and I want him  to weigh in in a second.  But the internal affairs committee recommended 3-0 that  council direct staff to consider adding traffic calming  measures, crosswalks, curb and gutter and lowering the speed  limit as the budget allows when the 2027 road rehabilitation  project is constructed.  Director Ottoboni, can you fill in the gaps on that project,  please?  Yeah.  Thank you very much.  Well put.  This is part of our 2027 road rehab that includes several of  those north-south and north-south road rehabs.  We have a lot of road rehabs that are in the north-south  roadways between east avenue and manzanita.  Floral avenue is one of those and it's identified in our  active transportation plan as a biking corridor due to its  connectivity going across lindo channel turning into fifth  avenue on that west side of lindo channel.  And so in order to do so and accommodate that type of feature  we would need to remove parking from one side of the roadway  which would be the east side is what we proposed.  We proposed that we would have a roadway that would be on the  We took that information, sent it out to all the neighbors along  the corridor.  Shockingly, the majority of the residents along that corridor  were in favor of removing parking on the east side to accommodate  those bike lanes.  So we're in favor.  So they went with staff's recommendation to and follow the  active transportation plan.  So this would allow us to move forward with that in our design  for that project.  Questions from council?  I only have one question.  Are we approving a final design or are we approving you to move  forward with design that you're going to bring back closer to the  project?  This is just a simple action and I guess technically it's an  internal affairs authority to remove parking.  So that might be a question for the clerk or city attorney on the  action by the council.  and it is?  and it is?  and it is? All right. There was some direction. And we have no speakers on this one?  We heard from Biker-Kaufman on it a little bit.  and it is? We had some general feedback between the three of us, just like some direction for consideration of the design. But yeah, then that, I don't know that these need to be approved. Thank you, Mayor. Yeah, I was just curious about some of the ideas  I'  m curious about some of the  ideas that our speaker and  biker kaufman had brought up  regarding different design  potential. I was wondering how  far into the design process we  are and if any of those  alternate ideas could be  considered or if they'  re feasible or how much  cost they might add.  that'  s part of the design process  is looking at those so we can  certainly consider some of those  re looking at those in the  design. We'  re under way. It'  s not super far along but it'  s under way so we can consider  those as we go through that and  evaluate if those elements are  within the budget.  how much generally does it  cost to add sidewalks to a  street like that versus not  adding them?  it all depends.  it always depends. One of the  that is not a sidewalk. A lot  of the times in old county  annexed areas that property line  goes to the back of curb. If  there are areas that do not have  sidewalk we have to acquire that  right of way in order to  construct those improvements and  have it be public accessible.  Then the construction costs and  there'  e grading and aggregate base  and the concrete itself. It adds  up pretty quick. We try to focus Okay, thank you. I'm imagining we would have to acquire land on every single street because there's not enough width on that road to, yeah.  find and find and find and find and  find and find and find and  find and find and find and  find and find and find and  find and find and find and  find and find and find and  find and find and find and  find and find and find and  that down we don'  t have speakers on taking  away parking. For the first time  ever. Do we have a motion?  I don'  t know do we need a motion  since internal affairs have that authority to approve that?  You don'  t because the t.r.a.  authorizes them to move forward with this.  Thank you.  It'  s just a report to ask everybody.  Report received.  Number four.  I'  Councilmember Winslow asked to  look at a couple of corridors and  lowering the speeds.  Director ottoboni surprising had to take that task on again.  And reported there was no legal justification to lower the speed  limits in the identified quarters.  I think it was a valid question by my colleague.  I think those are important things to discuss.  But again our expert said there'  s no legal justification.  And we moved on.  I'  So just because it'  s legal doesn'  t mean it'  s right. Are there places where there may not be legal justification but it makes sense to lower the speed limits?  Are you saying lower the speed limit council member?  Or do you want to increase the speed limit?  No I'  m saying lowering the speed limit.  Just because I know all the traffic guys at chico pd doesn'  t mean I'  m not in favor of lowering the speed limit.  There must be some situations where there'  e heavy bike traffic.  You know when people are commuting to chico high or chico state.  I don'  t know.  Their conclusion was they had to count for all those.  You can get like a five mile per hour reduction because of this.  A five mile per hour reduction because of that.  But you can only have so many and they already did everything they can.  I think there'  e a formula involved if I'  m not mistaken.  And he looked into that and gave us his opinion.  I think that'  s a good point.  We went through this on  valenbrosia.  We have all these people going into our beautiful park and you'  e got to cross.  Really bad stuff.  Can you do a really quick.  Ultimately the california vehicle code outlines certain parameters.  If you try to lower it below that.  s seen legally as a speed trap.  There'  t know what the prevailing speeds are.  And based on certain conditions can be lowered to certain extents.  We'  ve lowered our speed limits to the maximum possible extent by law.  If you lowered it below that.  It would be unenforceable.  And be considered a speed trap.  All right.  Can I.  Received.  Can you give the rundown of which streets those were.  I didn'  t see it on the report.  Maybe I missed it.  Shoot.  Masset and Park Avenue and the  East Avenue, I think there is a spot of East Avenue or eatin Road one of those. Yeah, sorry  I don't recall can we can we somehow?  Keep it in mind for any future road projects on those that perhaps there needs to be  Considerations in the design to if that's even an option to make it so that the design of the road matches up with the speed  Yeah, we already have those criteria in our design in terms of horizontal vertical curve  And the prevailing speeds associated with those so that is absolutely part of our design criteria already. Okay. Thank you  All right, and I'm 5.5 alternate site councilmember O'Brien this is your request so I'm gonna pass it over to you. Yeah, Thank You mayor  So I asked for council discuss the alternate site in the Warren settlement  specifically as it relates to the  Warren  Parameters and then here are options from staff as it relates to location and composition of that particular site  So from my perspective the site has experienced gun battles and other violent crime  Which has significantly impacted neighbors as we heard at the last council meeting and the community at large  And being locked down twice for a neighborhood in a six-week period because of violent crime is  unacceptable in any of our neighborhoods  So I do want to say that  Staff has done a fantastic job of seeking solutions within their respective capacities  They have done their job  We need to do our job by pursuing policies and decisions that will assist them in mitigating these significant issues  So I believe this discussion is important for us to have as a council  But more important more important for us to hear from those who are impacted the most and then take action  All right  council member  council member  director  Gustafson take us away  Thank You my Reynolds vice mayor and council members appreciate the opportunity to speak to you again  And per council member O'Brien's initiative last meeting. We just wanted to kind of present to give you a kind of an update where we've been  some of the challenges we've had with the alternate site and some of the recent improvements and we'll give  our site operator at Genesis who were also now  contracting for some pretty aggressive case management and improvements at the all site  Amber Ebony bass a moment to speak to those as well. So quick overview again background  recent improvements and then our case management efforts  Background this is a summary of paragraph 10 M out of the settlement agreement  Which basically says if there's no appropriate shelter space is available. The city cannot enforce anti camping rules  Against a homeless person but may direct them to one of three designated public property sites where camping is temporarily  This was a surprise to staff  When the settlement agreement came out there was no mention of an alternate site during those long  negotiations that I was part of and maybe us were part of so this was between  previous city attorney and legal services that was put into the settlement agreement  When it came out so as a bit of a surprise and of course, we initiated some clarification immediately  And so part of that there was subsequent conversations with at the time  Judge Kendall Newman  to define what what the purpose was of the alternate site and so  We narrowed it down to  If somebody wasn't eligible for one of the shelter options  There had to be a place for them to go and what we mean by not eligible for any of the shelter options  That's of course Genesis and the Torres shelter the two sheltering options were able to utilize through our enforcement efforts  These folks were violent convicted felons sex offenders  Or folks that had more than two animals and in most cases those are our dogs  If you remember in 2021-2022  After lots of deliberation the location of Eaton and Cohasset was selected  Due to the requirements that were also talked about further with Judge Kendall Newman in the dispute resolution process  And then the lack of city controlled spaces that met those requirements. I don't know if remember is a pretty robust presentation that  community development directors folks put together on city-owned sites an acre or larger  Taking out parks improvements preserves  It didn't really leave us with much many options and that's how we landed on the existing Eaton and Cohasset site  As we moved along that's what the site looked like just before we open it up and this was taken  this is an aerial taken in June of 2022 and  Then this was taken a year later in June of 2023  and it was really hard and it really hurt and it really hurt and it really hurt and it really hurt and it really hurt and it really hurt and it really hurt and it really hurt and it really hurt and it really hurt and it really hurt and it really hurt and it really hurt and it really hurt and it really hurt and it really hurt and it really hurt and it really hurt and it really hurt and it really hurt and it really hurt and it really hurt and it really hurt and it really hurt and it really hurt and it really hurt and it really hurt and it really hurt and it really hurt and it really hurt and it really hurt and it really hurt and it really hurt and it really hurt and it really hurt and it really hurt and it really hurt and it really hurt and it really hurt and it really hurt and it really hurt and it really hurt and it really hurt and it really hurt and it really hurt and it really hurt and it really hurt and it really hurt and it really hurt and it really hurt and it really hurt and it really hurt and it really hurt and it really hurt  sanctioned campground no  enforcement and folks  immediately impacted it. We  cannot remove the unauthorized  folks from the site to try to  provide some order and rules in  the facility so we had to  identify again going through  the dispute resolution process  and multiple objections from  legal services in northern  california we had to identify  the alternate site as an  enforcement operation just to  remove those unauthorized  individuals. We went through  multiple enforcement operations  to remove them and again kind of  a rinse and repeat and they  would quickly come back and  that' s what the site ultimately  turned into. Here' s just a few  on the ground photos of the  conditions there the amount of  trash. Outside of the site  that' s in the sycamore  diversion channel we have a  number of unauthorized folks  a continued problem very  difficult to manage as you can  imagine with no rules or  enforcement availability or  capabilities. In 2023 we began  the dispute resolution process  again to attempt to layer in  rules and really to make it  better for those authorized to  be there. We received lots of  feedback from those authorized to  be there about the negative  impacts from those unauthorized  to be there were putting on  them. They felt unsafe they'  re being victimized  taken advantage of and that'  s where the problems really  arose from. Again after more and  more dispute resolution meetings  judge newman did allow us to  impose reasonable rules however  no enforcement mechanism was  established to allow the police  department to depart individuals  the police department enforces  penal code violations they don'  t enforce hoa rules that was  an issue that we had to address.  We had to address the  challenges that was left unsolved  by the court system at the time.  After continued rinse and repeats  the city was finally able to  manage the site after a code of  conduct and reasonable rules were  allowed and so that'  s fast forwarding  to this summer of 2025 where we  were finally able to do that and  we were able to do that by  layering the rules and the code  of conduct that currently exists  at genesis. If there'  s violations there'  s due process  several warnings several written  warnings and once you get through  that process you'  re departed  and we are now able to utilize  those rules in departure process  since it'  s consistent with genesis  and we worked through multiple  multiple multiple dispute resolution  meetings. Now the framework exists  to trespass someone off the site if  needed and it'  s been quite  effective since this summer. Again  we really want to make sure that  manage the site. We reset it  again reassign sites those are  kind of assignments with no names  of course but the site numbers.  Another clean up operation never  miss an opportunity to showcase  our staff and the good work they  do. That'  s what it looked like this  summer in July. Again still you  know still some issues. I think  we have a pointer here. You could  see some of the sites the 20 by  expanding and the weeds and grass  quickly grow but those are fenced  off to prevent folks from going in  there. Still some issues with  property material that'  s expanding  out of the 20 by 20 facility that  we continue to deal with.  This is probably the best thing  that we did was install a lock  and shut the gate. That really  prevents that'  s a hard closure  preventing those unauthorized  folks from entering. It has  presented some challenges for  other service providers. Of  course we really understand and  support the work that the north  state shelter team does. They  provide showers there on a weekly  basis however it was becoming  extremely problematic when those  shower services were advertised  for those experiencing  homelessness in all of chico and  they would converge on to the  alternate site. We have many  them to converge for a shower  and end up looking around and  thinking I like this place I'  going to stay here and end up  victimizing those that are  authorized to be there.  Unfortunately we had to lock the  gate. We still allow north state  shelter to provide those shower  services but it'  s timed it'  s on Fridays we open  the gate and shut the gate. I  know it'  s a little bit  cumbersome but it seems to be  working in keeping the  unauthorized folks out. In  addition to that we'  ll get out of that.  thank you.  in addition to what'  s required in  the settlement agreement and  post discussions through the  dispute resolution process these  are the other services the city  provides to folks staying at the  alternate site. We brought  cal water water utility into the  site, trash service multiple  times per week, restroom service  multiple times per week,  surveillance camera and lighting  fencing with a fabric barrier,  some barbecues were installed,  park style barbecues were  installed, security patrols on  site and the surrounding areas  to try to mitigate some of the  impacts to the commercial  businesses that are adjacent to  the site. Of course multiple  enforcement operations at the  site and resets that we did not  intend to do when this first  started. All of that work comes  with a cost. This is what we'  re spending on the alternate  site on an annual basis. 47,000  for security there was a big  portion of that about half of  that during some of the  intend to do. We had several  resets we moved people off site  they had their personal property  that was their own personal  property that we had to secure  we had no other way to secure it  than post a 24-7 security person  on site to manage their personal  property. That happened on  several occasions that'  s why the security  cost is so high it was about  half of that cost was for that  24-hour post on several  several different occasions.  Water, the toilet facilities the  service 36,000 fencing,  ecology, the security cameras  which has been a huge help and  a huge resource for us but  there'  s an annual cost for  those we don'  t own that it'  s a subscription based  system. Some miscellaneous  costs so that puts the total  just under $130,000 annually.  If you hear that the city is not  doing enough we'  re certainly sensitive  to our costs. Of course we have  streets and roads to fix and I'  m personally sensitive  to it so we are putting a lot of  dollars to that and I want you  to know exactly where those  costs are going and how much  they are.  The site has improved since the  code of conduct was implemented  and the rules are implemented  and miss abney bass'  aggressive case management this  picture was taken from our  surveillance cameras yesterday.  There'  s still some  problems with the  We have a lot of cleanup that  needs to take place at some of  these sites of course they'  re expanding out of  their 20 by 20 square but we'  re managing it  appropriately. We'  re down to 17 people from  approximately 40 before so there'  s 17 people that are  authorized to be there. We have  an in game we know the settlement  agreement terms in 16 months so  we'  re really depending on  amber'  s folks to assist us with the  aggressive case management to  find these folks that are there  that are authorized to be there  some transitional housing or  transitioning into more permanent  housing and it is working people  are transitioning out of here  because this is by no means a  permanent solution for anybody.  These photos were also taken  yesterday it'  s important for us to  keep the adjacent areas clean  and clear so those show just  outside of the alternate site and  across the street at the  ladulce piazza facility and  community that has received  quite a few impacts we had  rentals have you been involved  with multiple meetings with  those folks and so far since the  rules and code of conduct have  been implemented there are some  improvements.  This summarizes at least my  portion code of conduct was  implemented in june 2025 we now  have layered rules and a  departure process that helps  we'  ve contracted with the jesus  center to conduct case  management multiple times a week  and again try to transition the  folks that are authorized to be  there to a more permanent  housing solution and it is  working we have light at the  end of the tunnel 16 months left  of the settlement agreement and  recognize the intent to look at  some options but just wanted to  give a snapshot of the background  and where we'  re at now and some  improvements we'  ve made that will help.  At this point I would love to  introduce amber abney bass to  talk about that case management  implement in some of those efforts.  good evening mayor vice mayor  council. I think what I would like  to do and I think director  gustafson has talked a little bit  about case management but I think  there has been a little bit  broader of an approach and I want  to walk you through that. Our  priorities we started talking  about having a need to layer in  some operational oversight to  manage that code of conduct.  towards the end of 2023 and  again more robustly at the end  of 2024 we had a true desire to  do that. We thought it was  really important to try to create  a bridge so for folks that were  in that site that they would at  least have some comfort and just  sort of familiarity because our  hope was that they could move out  of that site and move over into  genesis. We really wanted to  establish the briefest amount of  rules but the right amount of rules and also ones that can be  managed given the type of style of  management that we were trying to  implement out there. One of the  delays this year has really honestly  been that we had to go through and  we had to get that site approved as  a work location for my staff. For  anybody else who has tried to pursue  getting something insured that is  not a quick process but we were  relieved when that was done. It  allowed for us to go in starting in  early June. When we did that we  sort of had a set of priorities.  That first one was we had to get  everybody in and sign that code of  We had to get everybody in and sign  that code of conduct because as  director gustafson mentioned was  getting that code of conduct out and  making sure everybody who was  authorized at the site signed that  code of conduct and understood it.  That took us about seven weeks to  get everybody at that site on board  and to sign and acknowledge one of  those code of conducts. We had one  gentleman who was not authorized to  be there who was adamantly opposed  to signing the code of conduct so  We had two folks that one particular  encampment had three different  individuals that was in it. We  worked on getting the code of conduct  signed removing unauthorized people but  we also really worked on trying to  identify people that were at the site  that had been there for some time that  perhaps had had a change in  circumstances that made them eligible  to go to a different shelter that they  had previously been denied to. From  there we had two of the folks first  and second year and second year and  third year and third year and  sixth year and the reason they had  initially been out at that site was  because they had exceeded that two  animal count. Because they had had a  change in circumstance we were able to  offer them shelter at genesis they  quickly took that up and they have  relocated to that site.  The other thing we worked on was the  cleanup. Director Gustafson showed  some of those images. We did a large  scale cleanup in coordination with the  department of the unauthorized  individuals. We had a visit by fire  marshal ricketts at the end of July to  go over the struggle and try to educate  folks out there why that 20 by 20  space was critical. We talked to them  about at that time I think it had been  just after there had been a couple of  emergencies out at the site. First  responders had reported that they had  struggled getting access, getting in,  feeling like there were clear pathways and  people who were trying to get in. I  thought it was important to be able to  bring in the fire marshal so he could  directly communicate and explain that to  folks why those things were important to  be managing.  Also moved into we have heard I have  been at many of these meetings over the  years and I have heard several times the  suggestion that the quality of the site,  the impact on the neighborhood was  primarily being driven by people who  were not authorized to be there. I felt  like it was a priority for us to figure  out how we could get the folks that  were not supposed to be there removed  and we could put in some mitigation  efforts to keep the people who were  not supposed to be there out. I will  share with you one of the things we did  hear is there were some folks that were  accessing the site with their vehicles  they were coming in occupants of the  site were reporting they were nodding  off they appeared to be under the  influence they had some safety concerns  perhaps they would do that and have a  foot on the brake and lose consciousness  and find it and find it and find it and just sort of plow through some of those encampments and tents. We took those kinds of things seriously and that was the reason, some of the big reason why we moved quickly and I asked that the fencing  find it and find it and find it and  find it and find it and find it and  find it and find it and find it and  find it and find it and find it and  find it and find it and find it and  find it and find it and find it and  and fridays and as needed they  do have access to some of the  surveillance images so they can  see if there is a site or an  immediate concern that they have  the ability to go out but right  now on their schedules on  Tuesdays and Fridays they are at  the site it'  s a two person team one of  those folks is walking around  addressing any code of conduct  violations getting any feedback  of the site and then also I have  a case management person that  goes out and we always do this  have this idea that we don'  t ask people who  are out to provide services to  also be policing people'  s conduct and  behavior we really want to keep  those two roles and  relationships very separate. So  my case manager goes out and she  meets with those folks again in  that same frame of time. I will  just share that the month of  June was one that not many  people spoke to us except to say  they don'  t need us and no thank you  for  I think that was a good day that  was some of the feedback that my  team received. Moving into July  we had three people at the site  who engaged in case management.  That was not a surprise to us we  recognize that we need to build  relationships and report we need  to understand people and learn a  little bit about them before they  feel comfortable coming over and  engaging. By the month of August  we had 10 of the folks on the  site who were engaging and I will  share that as we stand here  today that with the exception of  three occupants at the site that  I would describe as actively  resisting engaging with anybody  on my team. Everybody else out  there has taken up a relationship  has completed information we have  discussed housing many of them  out there are pursuing getting  ids social security cards they  have expressed interest in housing  opportunities and those sorts of  things. As eric mentioned one of  site. When we took over the site  it is a little bit of a fluctuating  number but according to our math  there were 24 people that were at  the site. 23 at that point that  were authorized. Some of the  movement just in the last 90 days  since we have been out there we  did have two of the folks that  moved into ever heart village we  had two folks that I mentioned that  involved in the shooting that  happened out there one person chose  to leave because the relationship  they were involved in out there was  terminated and so they left we did  have two deaths one as a result of  the shooting and another that was  related to an overdose. We have 18  people out there now nine of those  folks are currently cleared to return  to genesis. I would say that six of  them are in what I would consider a  decision phase. The city of chico  department of public works has been  very responsive we worked really hard  when those folks said yes and it turns  out that was maybe the beginning of a  conversation but they are still  imagining what that could look like for  them. We are trying to be creative  sensitive to the relocation of their  belongings and what that looks like  but I am encouraged by that. Three of  the folks out there have again been  given that opportunity but are actively  rejoicing in the community.  We are also working with the city of  able to relocate to genesis despite  those efforts. One other thing I want  to mention is the jesus center is  actually a host site for the healthy  rural California' s community  psychiatry residency program. We are  blessed with a wonderful doctor who  actually has some previous experience  visiting the alternate site through  their connection to behavioral health  and their first year of that residency  program. We are also working with the  wellness program. That doctor will also  be visiting the site. I just really  want everybody to hear all of the  efforts that are going on out there. We  have certainly experienced  frustration. One of the first things  that I was met with when I went out to  the site was we don' t have any place  to put our stuff the dumpster is too  small. I said thank you for asking and  24 hours director August of sin had two  large dumpsters out there and people  have been contributing and putting  stuff in. We have taken some feedback  on that for sure. There was a man gate  installed or pedestrian gate installed  out there. Also again just in the effort  to try to keep some safety and some  separation for folks that for the folks  that are supposed to be there and  minimizing the opportunity for folks  who are not authorized to be there. I  would also add that my team and I have  been meeting biweekly with the north  state shelter team to discuss some of  the work that they did at that site.  We have been working with the  done prior to us being involved. They  do have some long standing  relationships out there. I think we  have bridged a lot of gaps. I will  also stand up here and say they are  not pleased with us that we have put  the gate in. I think that I support  what we have done. I think that it has  worked. I think it has minimized the  people there but they do continue to  have concerns that folks that  previously relied on that site as an  has been removed. At our most recent  meeting last week I said at this point  within my purview of operations out  there I am not yet comfortable opening  up that up broader. Again just in full  transparency those are conversations  that are going on quite regularly. It  is my hope that you see the efforts  that we are putting in. It is far from  perfect. My staff has issued notices  again with the help of the Chico police  department. Oftentimes we have to  re-examine the situation and we have  to make sure that we are doing the  are there. We have to rely on them  to be able to enact or to enforce  602 procedures. It is a difficult  large task and we are doing the best  that we can to respond to both the  folks in the site and the  neighboring but we certainly do  have limitations. I am available for  any questions if council had any.  any questions for  council member holland and  council member bernard.  I will never forget the tour  I took with you at the genesis site  and how impressive it was to see  how your staff communicated with  the tenants there and keeping their  surrounding areas cleared and  really maintaining their spaces.  Which I know is a long belt  relationship that you guys have been  able to curate through months and  months and months which is just now  starting at the alternate site.  Looking at the overhead views and !  Mr. Gustafson was showing I am  curious if your team are partially  working with people residing at the  alternate site and trying to limit  that encroachment out of the 20 by 20  spaces kind of through your  communications work.  But if it is not in your purview.  It absolutely is.  I think that is one of the main  components of the code of conduct is  that they need to have their sites  and their personal belongings within  that 20 by 20 site.  I think there is some unique challenges  to some of the occupants out there  and as we have been introduced out there  I think we are trying to have a  strengths based approach where we are  recognizing effort.  I will say that some folks are doing  better than others.  We are trying to give them a longer  lead on that because they are quite  entrenched out there.  Our hope in bringing the fire marshal  in was to create again an opportunity  of more direct education so they  understand the why and the purpose  behind some of that.  We get very little compliance.  What that looks like is issuing  notices when we have sites where we  have not seen people there we leave a  notice and let them know that this  has begun their seven day countdown  that if they don' t return to the  site we will consider that site  unoccupied and that we will begin  that clean up effort.  I think that is a big part of the  work that we are doing.  We have some sites out there that  I think in our conversations we have  some real concerns about people.  One of those sites has an incredibly  large number of animals.  We absolutely take that head on  knowing that I think that it is a  marathon a little bit more than a  sprint on some of those folks.  It does not mean that we won' t  document that and go through that  process as director Gustafson  mentioned because that is a  process that is in place.  I think the question becomes in our  minds of how do these folks end up  presenting in another place in the  community.  We do want to make sure that we are  giving them adequate opportunity to  make adjustments.  This is not a quick conversation to  try to get people in compliance.  There is going to come a time where  and right now people are on their  third notices.  I would say that those departures  are imminent.  I think that is a really important  Thank you.  Thank you for everything you have  done out there and at the genesis  shelter.  It is very moving.  Also, director Gustafson for  everything you have done to improve  the site.  I think one of the things we have  learned is that these campsites when  they are in close proximity to  neighborhoods do not work.  That has been our  responsibility.  making it better.  We have to sunset this thing.  That is probably when the end of  the settlement agreement is to make  it go away.  You told me once that we should not  accept campgrounds.  That means we are giving up on  people.  Part of that is I think that in  other parts of the world and other  parts of the United States it is  not the choice of homeless people  to decide to live wherever they want  to live.  If there is a shelter space they  have to use it.  They have to go there.  Those people who you would accept  that is not their choice.  We have to be concerned about the  society and about the town.  What we know is when you have  people camped in our public spaces  they destroy it.  We need to shut this thing down  within 16 months.  thank you.  council member goldstein.  just a quick question.  What is the capacity of the site  and what is the usual number of  people there?  there is a capacity that is  greater than the number of people  that are there.  We did that in advance in the  event that through enforcement  efforts more people would need the  site.  there is 24 sites that are there.  that is how it is laid out.  there is 25.  the latest reset there is 25.  our capacity.  25 sites.  correct.  25 delineated sites.  this latest reset we did maneuver  the assigned camp spots if you will  to the eastern side.  there is a lot of capacity  and it is So 50 plus, 50 to 60, we could fit in there, I believe. And a good number of them are shared sites. And so when I say that there's 18 people there now that does not equate to 18 occupied sites, many of those have two sites. And then the ones that are there and set, but not utilized, those ones are the ones that, but not utilized, those ones are the ones that, sort of up on that top right, that we've fenced in,  and it is  and it is  because previously what happened is an available space becomes an occupied space.  Okay. That makes sense. Yeah. All right. How many speakers do we have?  Great. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Ms. Price. We have 11.  Okay. Three minutes each. Three minutes. Okay. I'll call the first two names, and if you could  go ahead and line up in the middle. It's Steve Lottie, followed by Brenda Sally.  Good evening. A couple things. I wrote a dissertation with 11 people. I'm going to be  short. I'd like to, in addition to the  presentation, I'd like to address a couple of questions. I think we can start with the  emotional health and physical safety of the nearby residences that are experiencing and  expressing here this evening, there are a few points that I'd like to offer for your  consideration.  I'd like to bring up the airport.  I know there's about $2 million gathered together to attract an airline here.  And the site is underneath the runway approach, and the FAA strictly prohibits housing underneath  the runway.  So I'm urging you to not consider this as a formal campground in the future, managed  campground.  I think that could affect future business coming to town.  I manage a property maybe 300 yards from this site, and all the properties west of the  site, their property lines go to the center of the creek on both sides of the creek.  And in the past, when I wasn't able to negotiate campers to move off the property, I would  call dispatch for assistance.  And the dispatcher says, due to the war on settlement, that they're welcome there.  But it's private property, and it falls outside the war on settlement.  So I'm hoping in the future, if we have campers that are outside of the encampment, that we  can get some help removing those people.  The other thing is, is that the site itself...  It attracts spillover.  If you were to drive out there today, there's several campers outside the fence.  So it's kind of an attractive nuisance.  And a lot of these campers camp below the high water mark.  And if their camps, when they're finally removed, aren't completely cleaned up, all that trash  goes downstream.  And I think that's a given Chico's Creek today.  It's a really big concern.  I think we should keep our waterways super clean.  So if you move the site someplace, I would urge you not to put it next to a waterway.  Sycamore Creek, depending on the season, does support spring-run salmon and steelhead and  the Sacramento suckerfish.  There's something else I want to say, but I think it's going to be covered later.  But I think there is enough time.  Thank you.  Okay.  Thank you.  Good evening.  So Brenda Sally, followed by Charles Withoon.  Go ahead and take that.  Hi, my name is Brenda Sally, and I live at Baltimore City, and I've been in the center since it opened.  There's a lot of things there that need to be really considered.  There's no place where anybody could, no place where a parent or a court could have a proper  shelter or nothing.  The water supply is the sanitary.  It's not safe anyway.  And I feel that those people deserve better.  You know, a lot of, everybody has a story out there.  Some is good, some is bad.  But there's a reason for that.  There's no reason for it and it's really good and it's really good and it's really  I know you're going to help me, but he does his best.  I've got a business son that we have to take care of also.  And people don't realize how close a home is to a gopher.  It's what you want.  And I never thought, and there's no one here that I ever knew once.  But I'm here, and I'm with people who treat me like a human and not like a piece of trash.  But alongside the rest, who does not?  And that's all I've got to say.  Thank you.  Charles Withoon, followed by Liz Brooke.  Good evening.  Thank you, Mayor, Vice Mayor, and Councilors.  I'm reminded of the statement by the recently retired director of the housing authority of the County of Butte.  Ed Mayer said famously, you know, really, Chico needs two or three campgrounds.  A campground would include a secure perimeter.  A campground would include a secure perimeter.  In fact it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and  And with a proper monitor system, you can keep out unauthorized visitors.  Successful programs are characterized by tent decks, micro shelters, tiny homes, a common building for food prep.  The current water delivery system at Incohasset is not sanitary.  Every other camp I've been to has a sanitary water delivery system.  Incohasset does not.  Other programs I've visited have co-management with a local nonprofit that works with the campers to help coordinate a team effort.  So you get peer group pressure.  A camp was something that people could live in.  Instead of just surviving in.  Then they have a sense of pride.  Then they take care of it.  Then they pick up the litter.  Then it's not a problem for the neighbors.  As a matter of fact, in Sonoma, the neighbors were dead set against that tent camp.  Didn't want to have it.  The city leaders put it in with proper management.  And now the neighbors like it.  The neighbors are fine with it.  There's a tent camp in Sonoma that has a good neighbor for the neighbors.  Imagine that.  With proper management.  I'm reminded that since we've declared the shelter crisis, we've had, we've recorded 80 deaths outside or of homeless people.  This is the most deadly disaster to hit the streets of Chico in our lifetime.  We will be remembered on how we responded to it.  The Butte County nationwide homeless continuum of care survey.  If you crunch the numbers, I came out with about 60 women over 45 years of age that are unsheltered in Chico now.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  So Liz Brooke followed by Lynn Overholzer.  Hello.  My name is Liz Brooke and I live in close proximity to the encampment at Eaton and Cohasset.  I've lived there for 30 years.  I've lived there for 30 years.  I've lived there for 31 years.  The encampment is now spilling over into the surrounding neighborhood.  I've seen more violence, drug use, drug deals, and extremely, extremely inappropriate behavior than ever before.  My family and neighbors have been ordered to shelter in place twice in the last couple of months.  The violence of that camp is real and not just hysteria.  There was a murder in July.  And the last dog for me.  It was October 17th, Sunday afternoon, when a naked man with a gunshot wound in his head was pounding on my door, wanting to get in.  At that moment, I realized this is out of control.  I feared for my family, my neighbors.  I could go on and on and cite for you specific incidences that we have incurred.  But it would take all night.  I realized that this.  What most.  Cares me.  Is the guns in that site.  And there are guns and there are drugs and there are emotionally disturbed people.  There's people on drugs.  It's real and it's not hysteria.  My heart breaks for the woman who spoke.  Absolutely.  The location of the current encampment only facilitate you guys violence and drug use.  Behind the camp is a levy and a wide open field to the airport.  I can tell you nothing good is happening in that levy.  I see it.  Every single day.  Drug use drug paraphernalia.  Individuals camp outside of the encampment.  Individual camps.  The levy is a thoroughfare for the residents.  And my street is a private street.  And so when they come, people park there for whatever reason.  They don't want to be seen at the camp.  And they had off their backpacks to the encampment.  We're absolutely rolling the dice when I ask them, please don't park here if you're not visiting someone.  Okay.  I'm rolling the dice on my own safety, my family's safety on that one.  And so the roads to the camp are located, very dim lighting at night, very wide street, gravel on both sides.  Easily, you can easily park.  There's drug deals going on.  People asleep at the wheel.  You know, everything.  And I'm running out of time.  But what I really wanted to say is this.  The camp.  It may start it out as a spot for people without homes.  But things have changed.  And now it's time to look for a better solution.  This is a request to move the encampment.  It's not about moving the encampment and making it someone else's problem.  I hope you guys don't think, you know, not in my backyard.  We've lived with it for three years.  It's escalated and it's no longer safe.  Time. Thank you.  Thank you.  So Lynn Overholzer followed by Robin McCollum.  Thank you.  She and Joseph  school, Oak Bridge Learning Academy, K-12.  There are students there every day. There is also now the Adult Transition Center  there. Adults age 18-22.  A variety of disabilities. They attend school there every day.  Some school staff is concerned about  them walking down Cohasset from their bus.  It's just, anyway, I just wanted to  make sure you knew there was a school there.  Right now there's 17 people that are supposed to live there.  I'd say over the last three and a half years, I believe there's been between 7 and  26 authorized people to be there. People who don't  qualify for their shelters. That's been well covered, who doesn't qualify.  Even after the Warren  agreement expires, the remaining people in these couple  categories that we don't have shelter for, they're still going to be there.  So we still need to come up with a solution.  It's not a lot of people. You know, 15-20 people on average.  And allowing a population of people that small  to have the northeast corner of Chico  escalate into something like it has is really kind of unbelievable.  We've come up with shelters for people with  serious mental health issues. We've got 20  people in the state. We've got 20 people in the state.  We've got 20 people in the state. We have two tiny homes now. They're filling them up. That's great.  We're probably going to need more. We have spaces at the  renewal center now. As of about two years ago, I think five people can be together  there. We've come up with that. We need to come up with something more  humane for the remaining categories. The criminal  records of criminal violence, registered sex offenders.  I don't have the information and the data  that you guys do.  But I'm optimistic that you can come up with a better solution to house that  small remaining population than what we're doing. I don't know.  Maybe completely fence off some of the pallet shelters.  How many do we need? How many people are we talking? Maybe 10 in those  two categories? I don't know. You probably have the data. I don't. Fence off some  pallet shelters. Make them completely separate. Put a few on a vacant lot  over by the existing shelters that we have. Build a couple of small  houses. I don't know. I'm just throwing things out.  Because I don't have the data. But I'm optimistic that you can come up with a better solution  to house these people and a more humane solution for them. Thank you.  So, Robin McCollum, followed by Nicole Nava.  Good evening,  counselors. After hearing the presentations  from Amber and Eric, I should make  some more comments.  It's an improvement with the management by Amber and her folks.  And it's not exactly the same as we might have imagined.  But we've always been advocating for managed campgrounds.  North State shelter team.  And what I'm hearing as well  is that the camp is overflowing. That it attracts people from outside.  And that's why the city should provide more small manageable camps.  Similar to Eaton and Cohasset. To reduce the number of ineffective sweeps to near zero.  Constantly moving people. These people from destabilizers.  And makes it harder for them to find supportive services.  That can help them transition to housing alternatives.  That are appropriate for their needs. Unlike large congregate shelters.  where many have been abused, these needs are various reasons beyond their reach.  Nearly all of them are unable to do better because they are disabled physically, mentally,  addicted, and or with little or no money.  The economic privation is a fundamental driver of these handicaps.  The systemic problem of perverted capitalism where wealth is concentrated at the very top  putting great strain on all classes in America except the ultra-wealthy.  As an example, we have hedge funds buying properties in Chico  and then keeping them off the market to jack the prices affecting all who rent in this community.  These campers have been spit out to the bottom of this economy  and are powerless to do anything.  More than just try to survive.  The camps need to be humane and supportive in order for the campers to get by  until they can be housed, treated as necessary, and their lives can improve.  Public bathrooms and showers should be kept open around the community where they exist,  cleaned regularly with janitorial services that are far less expensive than sweeps.  Camps should not be designed to punish.  If they are to be effective and meant to make the general public feel safe.  This is the problem that we're not addressing all those people with this one small camp.  You push them around and they're all outside there.  We haven't addressed the total number.  These are our own people.  They came from paradise.  The problem is in our town and it's time to stop blaming the victims.  If you get a chance, listen to the mayor's recording of Helen Hartman.  Please.  So Nicole Nava followed by Lori Monroe.  Good evening again.  So I'm not going to use euphemisms because it's ugly what's happening.  And I am some of those people who came up.  Their story is my story and it's the story of many neighbors from neighborhoods all over Chico.  And so here's the ugly truth.  It is people that are on drugs.  It is people who have committed rape.  It is people who have been pedophiles.  And recidivism is pretty much 100% for some of those things that were going on.  So what needs to happen is y'all need to figure out collaboration at certain levels.  And also respect when people are talking.  It's not fun to look at people pulling faces.  I've been in almost 30 years in the field.  So I think I know wherever I speak.  So if you would look at collaborating with state level.  People to try to talk about solutioning mental health help.  Drug rehabilitation.  This is long term facility stuff we're talking.  When you're talking the level of drugs that are out there.  It is not old time drugs.  It is the kind of drugs that takes almost a year to get someone to a state.  Where they can then begin even normal type therapy moving through things.  It's very serious.  It's very hard.  And you know.  You've got this will in California.  That apparently the will of some to flounder outside.  Is seen as compassion.  Because you're giving them the free will to be there.  Only it's not free.  You have those of us who have to live amongst very chaotic situations.  And our money is paying for situations that continue.  We don't want to live near a chaotic campground.  And I don't think realistically most people want to live amongst what is considered to be.  and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it is and it  judgment is by people who have agreed and are compelled to move through a program and  it works and they get connected to things.  At the Genesis, you have a bare bones rules-based system that they had to fight for even the  most basic rules.  And then we have the completely chaotic situation, but now some plugged in type of things, but  again, at the expense.  And I think you need to start collaborating again at a state and a federal level to get  a level of services where these people can plug in and are compelled to get the help  that they need because some of that's outside the purview of the city of Chico.  Start enforcing what you can.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Lori Monroe followed by Grace Marvin.  I have been a volunteer at the showers that Eaton and Cohasset offered on for the  past two years and things have gotten better this summer.  Uh-huh.  I think that even closing the gate has been an improvement simply because people, clearly  some of the things at the camp were not put there by the residents of the camp, but were  dumped by other citizens in this community.  There was a piano there for a while and I don't think any of the campers would have  moved in a piano, but somebody else thought that would be a nice place to leave it.  So sometimes.  Sometimes the neighbors, sometimes the other citizens of this community don't treat the  people at Eaton and Cohasset so well.  But things have gotten better and my question for you because you're interested in safety  and making sure that all people are safe, the residents and the neighbors, is what hap—when  you have a camp where there's 40 people who are residing in it and suddenly there's 17  people who are in the camp, the residents don't want to be in the camp because the unauthorized  people were asked to leave.  Those others are someplace and they're probably not too far away.  And so that's the problem.  The spillover is the problem.  So my question to the council is how are you going to make us all safe?  And that's it.  Thank you.  Grace Marvin, Baltimore.  by Ann Byker-Kaufman.  I've heard some wonderful  speakers and I really appreciate  what those two  three speakers have been saying  especially.  Most Chico citizens  would agree with members of the North State  Shelter Team, the ACLU  and Butte County Grand Jury.  Our lovely  Chico community must seriously  address the truly  inhumane conditions  for the unsheltered people  living in our city  and not dispose of them  just get rid of them.  We can't finance this or we're just going to  have even more homeless.  Many hours  have been spent by North State  volunteers in helping people  at the Eaton and Colasset site  and they also have been  trying to find sites for people  to live elsewhere more  humanely. But this volunteer  group and even with  Genesis Health do not have  the resources to complete  the tasks that  need to be addressed without  the city's  much greater  financial and moral  approval and support.  One thing that I  hadn't written down but I thought of this  later, when the city put  on some major fundraising  events, fundraising events  to help the homeless.  I think that would be just  fabulous and we could probably  raise a heck of a lot of money  that way. I certainly would contribute a lot.  Okay. No wonder there was a shooting  at the Eaton and Colasset site  earlier this summer. It would not be surprising  if a lawsuit isn't filed  regarding that site. The heat has  been horrendous for people who have to  live crowded together in unshaded  tents, unprotected from rain  and cold in fall  and winter and without basic  bathrooms, cooking facilities,  better trash services  and much more humane management  at the current site  that even Genesis  and NST cannot  provide alone. People  who cannot be housed at the two  major city subsidized  sites that were developed  after a very expensive lawsuit  should have alternatives.  We must have much  better managed campgrounds  as we see for example  in state or national  parks where people  enjoy living. If we go  to look at those sites  with the tents and the  living arrangements and so  forth that would be great.  We need to be able to place  tiny homes on the lots  as possible that the  NSST now wants to do  and we should also  get the city's approval and find  excellent managers and sufficient  financial resources  to provide much better managed  campgrounds for our truly  needy homeless. And again I  didn't really make it clear.  That's time. Thank you.  We need to  house the people in the trailers  that are at four different church  sites. Thank you.  And by Kurt Kaufman.  I think I saw her  go.  Okay. Adam Fideli.  Good evening.  Kudos to the city.  And kudos to my friend  Amber Abney.  She is a missus by the way.  Those who call her a missus.  Anyway. I would encourage  everybody to continue to be creative.  Be creative  with what you do.  Do what you can do out at that site.  Some more basics shouldn't be  very hard.  Water shouldn't be  very hard. But the bottom line  of all of this  is that people that have gone  so far after the reservation  for whatever reason  takes a long time to bring people back.  Sometimes you can't  bring them back at all.  But  they're all members of our community.  Nobody deserves to die under  a bush in the heat or the cold.  No matter what their circumstances.  So I would encourage us all to keep plugging away at this.  We're getting there.  You know, we've made a lot of progress in the last few years.  Too bad it had to take the lawsuit to be the impetus.  But there's a lot of progress being made.  And the state of California definitely needs to step up,  but they haven't yet.  They've kind of dumped this on counties and cities.  All across the state.  Doesn't matter where you go.  You know, this problem is everywhere.  But continue to be creative.  Have a good night.  He's our last speaker.  All right.  Questions or comments from council members?  Well, it seems how it's in my district,  and I've probably had to deal with this a little bit more than everybody.  I will take my stab at this.  I will take my stab at this.  A few comments.  District 2 has endured enough.  We have had this the whole entire time.  We are allowed to move this site up to two times a year, and I  think every 60 days if needed.  It needs to be moved now.  We are at the risk of a major !  I think if you don't want to have  Burger Hut there, if you don't want to go get your facial there,  let's see, I think Butte County Behavioral Health is moving out.  I think the facial place is going to likely be moving out if something doesn't change.  I mean, these are real impacts on people that have invested their lives in their businesses,  bought a piece of property to be a landlord, and they can't do their jobs.  So we need to follow by the agreement.  We need to have the alternate sites, but it needs to be moved somewhere other than the  one we're trying to attract business to fly in to Chico and build our airport, and we have all these wonderful amazing things in this new amazing road and all this stuff.  And it's just not safe out there.  Being on the corner of Eaton and Gohassett, a super busy area, it's just something needs to happen.  So I know that we have amazing staff, and I know that they've told me for three and a half years there's nowhere for it to go.  Maybe it's six people one place, maybe it's six people at another.  I know, Charles, we've heard your idea a bunch of times.  I know. We've talked about it.  We've talked about it in the report, too.  If we just give you a location and money, you can do it.  Amber, thank you so much for everything that you're doing.  I appreciate it.  It's a lot better.  I have heard from neighbors.  Somebody just told me today that came in and was talking to me today.  They're like, wow, that place is like half of what it used to be, but half is still too much.  Now, mind you, I just also want you to remember we have very strict guidance as to where this has to go.  And I think that's something that we need to be very careful about.  How it gets done and it needs to be done and it needs to be done and it needs to be done and it needs to be done and it needs to be done and it needs to be done and it needs to be done and it needs to be done and it needs to be done and it needs to be done and it needs to be done and it needs to be done and it needs to be done and it needs to be done and it needs to be done and it needs to be done and it needs to be done and it needs to be done and it needs to be done and it needs to be done and it needs to be done and it needs to be done and it needs to be done and it needs to be done and it needs to be done and it needs to be done and it needs to be done and it needs to be done and it needs to be done and it needs to be done and it needs to be done and it needs to be done and it needs to be done and it needs to be done and it needs to be done and it needs to be done and  know where we go but I would like for staff to give a shot at trying to find some sort of a  management and maybe talk to Ms. Bass she's super creative she's super outgoing she's solved some  stuff that I never thought anybody in their lifetime could solve and she's done it so I  don't know maybe she's got some good ideas for us but that's not what I have to say.  Council Member Goldstein go ahead. Yeah in general agree with you reflecting on a couple of comments  it seems like everybody is in agreement that there are issues at this site also that there's  good work being done to correct some of those issues one thing that I heard a lot was that  there were unauthorized people at this site causing issues but they haven't just disappeared  a lot of them are still around there are still drug deals happening behind the site  one thing that I've learned from experience volunteering in the past and listening to these  conversations before is  a  a  a  multitude of sites you don't have a lot of people together just keeping that in mind but that said  years ago I recall looking at what property the city owns and it was surprisingly limited I think  people have a vision that the city has control over so many things but a lot of the vacant  properties we see around are actually just owned by investors or have yet to be developed so I'm  and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and  their tents die of drug overdoses? Is it half or is it three quarters or a third?  Any sense of it? Anecdotally, I would say the majority. Right. So the reason those 80 people  have died in their tents isn't because we haven't provided free housing for everybody. It's because  they're drug addicts. So the reality of this situation is there's 17 people out there. I think  I heard Mrs. Bass say that there were six or seven people that would be accepted at the  Genesis shelter if they would go. Ten. Okay. So that leaves seven. So the reality is until,  I know you want to move it. We've been through this, I don't know how many times. There is no  other place really to put it as bad as this is. The reality is that there's a lot of people  that are going to be in the shelter. We have to move it. The reality is we'  re going to be stuck with this for another 16 months. At that point we need to shut it down.  If those ten people don' t want to go to the Genesis shelter then they should try their luck  in Redding or Biggs. I just also wanted to add one quick thing. I'm following my own rules. Go  ahead. You first. I already spoke. Council Member Winslow. I'  m just going to say the comment I was going to say before. I just heard that how we'  ve come a long way in these conversations. We'  ve had a lot of bouncing around. Most of this has happened in the back room. I think this is  a conversation that' s long overdue. I would just say thank you in general, neglecting the last  comment, for the way that the conversation has progressed. It doesn' t feel like we have the same  energy about it. There' s not the same amount of cynicism towards one another. We' re able to look  at this and see it for what it is. There' s a necessity here in that people need a place to go  and people don' t fit into the limited shelters that there are. We understand the impacts of  clearing out one place. I rode my bike down to the site on Friday and went and joined the  Jesus Center and North State Shelter Team. I saw all the people that were  there before. They' re all down the bike path. Some people are fine and some people are smoking  out of something. One thing that I observed in our prior conversations when it came to the forefront,  for example, the Grand Jury report that really forced us to have the discussion about this place  because they identified the problems that we' re seeing and said that the city needs to do  something about it. They need to improve sanitation and such. The response the city ended  up giving was, I would characterize it, it was sort of this fear of moral hazard. That' s beneath  it. We say inherently this is so bad we can' t do anything to improve it. We say health,  safety, sanitation, it' s all, it can' t be any better because people are in tents, not in houses.  There' s not a two by four construction. This concept that I think is a bit out of context,  a quote of Mrs. Bass that we can' t just leave people in the tents essentially. The idea that  if we do anything to try to improve it, we' re going to have to do it. We' re going to have to  make this better. We risk this becoming a permanent situation. I think that' s it. We don' t want to put  investment in, not just because it costs money, but we' re afraid that this works just well enough  that it will continue to happen. Nobody wants to see this be a permanent state.  I can agree with those sentiments in that we should always try to uphold some higher standards  for health and sanitation. I think we can pull that off, but I think at this point,  we can' t leave things the way that they are. If we can find another place, I' m all for  looking at starting a new site. I would say we started on a very different basis with a higher  standard.  I say that we engage partners like North State Shelter Team, but also the county behavioral  health and such in order to make sure that there' s serious case management and serious security,  that it' s a real managed campground, not like what we have here where we' ve had a water pipe  put out there eventually and then we get a fence up. There' s these incremental things that still  amount to what is not the standards for a managed campground that are upheld in other communities  not far from us. I think the move is that we need to do something. We need to understand that it  might cost some money, but look, we have 16 months for this.  We can really turn this around to some degree, but we can' t just have it be this lawlessness out  there. There' s been improvement, and I think if anything that states that we can do something to  make it better. I' ve seen the place, and I can identify some extreme safety hazards that I saw  out there just last Friday, and I can also say that some things were better than I' ve seen in  the past. I think if we acknowledge that this is our thing, even if you don' t like it, we need to  do what it takes in order to make this better, whether it' s here or somewhere else or something  in conjunction.  MR. Thank you.  MS. Thank you.  MS. Thank you.  Councilmember O'Brien.  MR. Yes. Thank you, Mayor.  First, I do want to acknowledge and acknowledge in my initial statement and my request to  agendize this. The staff has done a great job. Amber, Mrs. Bass, Eric, Director Gustafson,  you guys have done everything that you can do to make this work. The reality is it' s an  untenable situation. We' re giving you the impossible.  MR. Well and frankly and frankly and frankly and frankly and frankly and frankly and frankly So I do have a quick question on definition, maybe something that's been defined and clarified in some of the many discussions we've had with judges over the years.  and frankly and frankly and frankly and frankly and frankly and frankly and frankly and frankly and frankly  and frankly and frankly and frankly and frankly and frankly and frankly and frankly and frankly and frankly and frankly  and frankly and frankly and frankly and frankly and frankly and frankly and frankly and frankly and frankly and frankly and frankly  and frankly and frankly and frankly and frankly and frankly and frankly and frankly and frankly and frankly and frankly and frankly and frankly and  I appreciate that clarity.  So whatever we end up doing, I can tell you the current situation is unacceptable.  And it's unacceptable because what's happening to those neighbors, they're the ones that are impacted more than anyone.  Not me, not anyone on this council.  They are.  They are.  They live there.  They have lived this for too long.  And I agree with you, Mayor.  We have got to find something better.  And I don't know what exactly that looks like.  We're maybe down to 18, whatever that number, 17, 18.  I heard different things.  We can't come up with something different to house those 18 better than what we have right now.  I've got to believe with the brainpower in this room and in this community, we can do something better.  And that's going to be my request is that we find something better, not the status quo.  So is that a motion to send this to...  Or Gustafson and maybe have a report come back in two weeks with some ideas of a direction we might be able to go and chew on from there?  It is.  Because I don't think we're going to be able to...  No, we're not going to solve it tonight.  That's not a realistic expectation.  But we can certainly look at different options.  And that's what I want to hear.  There's got to be something we can do that's better than the status quo.  I know we can do better.  I think some coordination with Mrs. Bass.  No.  Now that we know that there's possibly...  We're at 17 and 9 can move.  And we're not dealing with the numbers that we were dealing with before.  And I think we can make much more educated decisions knowing what's happening there.  And know where we're going to go.  I did want to address a couple of things about the water.  We paid to have Cal water in there.  Don't most of us drink Cal water in our house?  Yeah, it is Cal water.  Yeah, they actually donated the connection and we pay the monthly rates.  Okay.  I make so much water.  I'm sure that they filled a swimming pool with it out there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  And so if I may clarify real quick, Mayor.  When I say we can do better, I'm not talking about staff.  Staff has done their job.  Like I said, we can do better.  Well, I think we need staff's expertise on this too.  But we all collectively, yeah.  Chief?  Don't look at you.  Yeah.  I mean, we're happy to...  We're happy to do better.  I think we need to come back with some options.  I don't think they will be materially different in terms of location, different than what was  presented in what was at June of 2022.  Because again, the facilities are very limited in terms of actual city-owned properties.  Might we divide it up into smaller pieces?  Might it be better structured?  Sure.  I'm going back to the history of the alt site.  It was a last-minute, poorly constructed, you know, that'  s why we have, what, four or five pages in the settlement agreement that outline the  attributes of the pallet shelter and we have one, I think, a single sentence, not more  than a paragraph, outlining what the alt site is.  And even that has been the subject of a lot of debates and dispute resolution processes.  And the reason we don't want to do more of the debate is because the !  The  the  the  institute reasonable rules but  he didn'  t identify what those  reasonable rules are nor what  the consequences are. That was  part of the purpose of the  implementation agreement that we  burned six months trying to get  agreement on. So we finally  instituted effectively some of  those attributes even though  legal services never agreed we  we'  ve just done it anyway.  all right.  that'  s all right. Just before we  move on because I know this is  going to be heard again and I'  ll get my chance to reiterate  it but I do proceed with caution  when it comes to these  discussions because historically  the lower income neighborhoods  have been the most vulnerable  to the ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !  Again people saying very  not kind things in very close proximity to where I'  am living so I'  am very open to having the conversation of splitting the  sites up but I really am proceeding with caution picking the alternate site up and placing it  somewhere else because that usually ends up being the neighborhoods of condensed poverty so I just  want everyone to keep that in mind moving forward when we have this discussion I assume in two weeks.  All right.  Council member  I just want to remind you that it'  s after 10 o'clock.  I know we can'  t take anything up new but we don'  t we have to finish the item when we'  re on so and that'  s our last luckily we'  re on our last item so I would make a motion that we direct staff to  I did make that motion already so I did so yes.  Do you need a second?  I do.  Second.  Second.  Can you read what your motion is?  Can we all second it?  Can you read I'  m sorry I didn'  t hear your motion I'  m about.  No you had mentioned exactly what and I confirm what you said as far as.  Okay so Ms.  Preston will you read the motion?  Okay so you read us back the motion and Council member Van Overbeck seconded so everybody  knows what they'  re voting on.  I' m going to condense it down because I did take a lot of notes but I think that you  directed staff to work bring back some ideas and see what that might look like whether  that'  s different locations or breaking up locations that kind of thing just whatever the options  are.  Perhaps partnerships.  And collaboration that was part of it.  It was collaboration.  Okay.  Collaboration.  And us doing our work as Mr.  And then did I hear someone say that it is to come back in two weeks?  I think a lot of the work'  s already done but if they need longer than two weeks you can but.  Just a reminder we have a sort of semi-related conversation happening in the next two weeks  right that was a request of yours?  Yes.  Is it a safe spot?  Out of the ad hoc committee?  Safe spot campground?  Oh safe spot campground.  Yes.  Yeah we can bring it back with that.  Awareness yeah.  In two weeks?  Sure.  Okay.  All right Council member Goldstein?  Yes.  Council member Hawley?  Yes.  Council member O'Brien?  Yes.  Council member Van Overbeck?  Yes.  Council member Winslow?  Yes.  Vice Mayor Bennett?  Yes.  Mayor Reynolds?  Absolutely.  Carries 7-0.  Okay reports and communications.  The following reports and communications are items are provided for Council's information.  No action can be taken on items under this section unless the Council agrees to include  it on a subsequent agenda.  City Manager report?  No report.  All right.  Final maps for the development director's approval as information only.  Council member requests Council members may verbally request an item to be agendized at a future  meeting after stating what the item would be.  Any questions?  No.  Council member Winslow?  A majority of vote of Council is needed in order for staff to agendize it.  Do we have any requests?  Yes.  Just one.  Council member Winslow?  Yes.  A gentleman.  If you guys can leave quietly please.  We're still doing our last item here.  One last little thing.  One last little vote.  Thank you.  A gentleman's approached me, maybe some of you guys too.  He has an interest in trying to set up like a scooter share in town.  Separately with that, like some people from the university told me that they were interested  in a sort of bike share thing.  My understanding is that there might be some policy limitations on that sort of thing.  And it'll probably be a long conversation, but I think it's worth getting it started.  So I just want to have a motion to discuss that bike scooter share.  Seconded.  Can you explain exactly what you're envisioning just so I understand please?  Well, this guy, I mean I don't want to take his thunder or whatever, but looking at like  franchising a company that provides like an app where you can like get a picture of the  city and you can rent a scooter in the public space.  And there's some similar bike things that are familiar in more larger cities or other  college towns.  We had a yellow bike program.  Do you remember that Mr. City Manager?  Technology has come a long way.  So I was just in Idaho Falls and they have a scooter, electric scooter thing and you  use, I forget how you authorize it, but they were just scattered everywhere and kind of  dumped in ravines.  So I was just wondering if you could talk about that.  I think it's a great question.  I think it's a great question.  Okay.  We're just, we're agendizing.  Yeah, okay.  It's just we can't discuss the merits.  It's what our policies are in regards to private parties applying to do this sort of thing.  So of course it's always conditioned, right?  We got a motion and a second.  Okay.  Council Member Goldstein?  Yes.  Council Member Hawley?  Sure.  Council Member O'Brien?  I'll have a discussion, yes.  Council Member Van Overbeck?  Yes.  Council Member Winslow?  Yes.  Vice Mayor Bennett?  Yes.  Mayor Reynolds?  Aye.  Carries 7-0.  Any other requests?  No.  All right.  We will adjourn to closed session on Tuesday, October 7th at 5 p.m. or 5.30, followed  by the regular City Council meeting at 6 p.m. right here in these chambers, 421 Main Street,  Chico.  Good night.
