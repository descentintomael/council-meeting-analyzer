 Thank you.  Mrs. Rogers, are we ready?  Yes.  Yes?  All right.  So we'll call to order the regular Chico City Council meeting on November 2nd here at the  Chico City Council meeting.  We'll start with an invitation by Reverend Dr. Richard Yale.  This way.  Grace and peace to you.  This week as we approach the third anniversary of the Camp Fire, which irrevocably changed our county, including our own city of Chico, and has engaged many of us in the work of recovery and resilience.  Commemorations and congratulations to all of you.  Commemorations this week will often look forward in hope.  We would be remiss at this point not to look back and remember our grief, our pain, remember our lament.  It's also for many traditions today here in our midst, Dia de los Muertos, the Day of the Dead, celebrated by our Mexican neighbors and in my tradition is known as All Souls Day.  In light of both of these commemorations, I invite you all today to name in your hearts and minds the day of the dead.  We went through so many of those stories of drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug  I invite you to remember those who have died unsheltered in our midst,  especially this year, Guy Stephen Van Zandt.  May we remember them with sorrow, grieving our loss of them.  May we remember them with gratitude,  overflowing gratitude for the gifts that they have shared with us.  And may we remember them with resolve,  that together we may bind up the wounded,  feed the hungry, care for the sick, shelter the weak,  that justice might roll down like waters,  and righteousness like an ever-flowing stream.  Amen.  Amen.  All right, thank you.  If you could please stand and join me in the Pledge of Allegiance.  Salute.  I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America,  and to the republic for which it stands,  one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.  All right, thank you everybody for being here tonight.  Madam Clerk, Assistant Clerk, I should say, I guess.  If you don't mind taking the role for us.  Oh, thank you.  We went through all of the !  We went through all of the  We went through all of the  We went through all of the  We went through all of the  We went through all of the  We went through all of the  We went through all of the  and we will move on there to the consent agenda,  and this is for matters of routine and nature  and can be enacted in one motion.  Are there any council member disqualifications or no votes?  I don't have a disqualification or no vote,  but just an edit on 2.1.  I believe there was a note that there could possibly be  a variation on the time on there.  I don't know if we need to note that or not,  but that the operation hours are from 11 a.m. to 12 a.m.,  so we can just note that for future.  Thank you, yes.  Duly noted.  Do we have any speakers on this item?  We do.  Okay.  Go ahead.  The first speaker, we have two.  Rob Brasner, followed by Julie Threat.  All right, and we would say that whenever you come up to speak,  make sure you file your card ahead of time prior to the item starting  and that you make sure to stop at three minutes.  We'd ask you that.  And then also that you keep your comments relative to the topic  that you're discussing.  All right.  So our first speaker then.  It's Rob Brasner.  He's the applicant for Winchester.  He was available to speak if anybody had any questions.  All right.  Any questions?  No.  Any questions?  No?  All right.  So.  If you want to waive your time, that's fine to do.  All right.  And who's our second speaker?  Julie Threat.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you, council.  I just, my only comment about the application, too,  was the note about the, I can't remember the name, the zone,  the census block where it said that we've got 81 liquor licenses  and census block 10.  And this is.  I don't know if it's the 7th.  So I was like, okay, is like the census block all of Chico?  Or is the 7 number like 20 years old and should be increased?  So that was kind of my only comment.  But I found it fascinating because, and I wish Mr. Brasner was here,  because the Winchester goose, and I didn't know anything about this  because I just looked, Winchester goose.  I normally wouldn't even, I'd skip past it.  I was like, what is a Winchester goose?  Let me go look.  So you know me, I look everywhere for this information.  So this Winchester goose, which seems to have a history,  but this Mr. Brasner gentleman.  So this is what it says when I pulled it up.  It's really interesting given what we're going through right now  with these crises.  The Winchester goose is a physical manifestation of the vision  of an idealized utopia as seen through the eyes of our leader,  Robert Lee Brasner II.  It is a lifestyle and cultural experience situated in the humble,  yet eccentric oasis known as Chico, California.  Our purpose is to create an environment conducive to social interaction  for all walks of life, ages 21 to infinity.  Our main conduit to such interactions is via a clear glass  filled with only the finest malts, hops, grains, and water  available on planet Earth.  These elements are combined to create a libation fit for the gods  by only the most revered and respected artisans of the choosing craft.  We passionately encourage our patrons to ingest this mystical elixir  in an effort to promote a proper state of mind  for which to fully experience a true connection with other human beings.  So I just thought, and it went on.  It's fascinating.  Go Google him.  Google this guy.  I'm really interested to meet him.  He's got a fascinating story.  So I approve.  I recommend going through this.  But yeah, if we could have some conversation about the census,  track, block, why there's 81 liquor licenses and one for seven.  Thank you.  All right.  Thank you.  So no counsel, no votes or disqualifications then.  Entertain a motion.  I'll second that.  We have a motion by Council Member Brown,  a second by Council Member O'Brien.  You can take the roll.  Council Member Bennett.  Yes.  Council Member Brown.  Aye.  Council Member O'Brien.  Yes.  Council Member Tandon.  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds.  No.  On all of consent.  On all of consent or just one night.  Okay.  Oh, yes.  No problem.  The vote is yes or yes.  Sorry.  And Mayor Coolidge.  Aye.  Carries 6-0 with one answer.  All right.  Thank you.  Okay.  Item three, business from the floor.  Members of the public may address the council at this time on any matter not already listed  on the agenda with comments being limited to three minutes or as determined based on  the number of speakers.  The council cannot take any action at this meeting on requests made under this section  of the agenda.  How many speakers do we have?  We have six.  All right.  Let's do that.  We have three minutes.  Okay.  And if you can line up behind, if you're called and she says who's next, if you could  line up behind the person speaking just to minimize our time in between, we'd appreciate  that.  Thank you.  Okay.  The first speaker is Ginger Thomas followed by Todd Farron.  Good evening, council.  I just wanted to say thank you for your hard work for the city and the citizens.  My name is Ginger Thomas.  I am CEO of BB&G Enterprises LLC, owner of Pop Radiance Beauty and Cosmetics Company and  Majestic Medicine Holistic Health and Wellness Company.  I'm here to ask you kindly and humbly to strongly consider opening the manufacturing application  process.  In regards to the dispensary businesses opening, they are going to need retail merchandise  and the three-part system is set up so that companies can be able to open the dispensary  and the three-part system is set up so that companies can produce products on a local  level, minimizing the transportation of cannabis products.  If we do not open up all the application processes at the same time, we are foregoing the setup  desired from California.  Not only will we keep revenue from these businesses in town, which would otherwise be leaving  town, we would be creating five to seven new businesses that would be producing tax revenue  for the city.  Thank you.  Thank you.  We really needed to make sure drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug our citizens feel better, be a better productive member of society. These are people that doctors and health professionals have given up on and every day there are  drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug  drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug  drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug  and I wish to make this medicine legally  for our town and our community.  I'm so nervous I can hardly barely talk.  Thank you for your time.  Mr. Coolidge, I've sent you an email.  I asked you to open up this process you have.  I do not wish to be a dispensary.  I do not want to manage a storefront.  I do wish to make products for these dispensaries.  I have made one file for you with all of my business stuff  just to show you that I have my ducks in order.  My lawyer is on board with helping me with my meetings  and making sure that everything is the way it should be.  So I have left some samples.  Unfortunately, I only made five packs  and there's seven seats,  but I would like to leave it with you to try,  to smell, to feel, give it to your family,  give it to your friends.  I only brought CBG and CBD.  If you're unfamiliar with CBG, it is a hemp product  and I have found that it is healing much better than CBD.  I've also included  some certificates that I've earned in holistic classes.  And I would really, really like to ask you,  please consider letting a few businesses come into town  that are honest, hardworking, and here for the people.  Thank you for your time.  All right, thank you.  And you can leave that with the clerk.  Okay, Todd Farren, followed by Robin Engel.  Hi there. My name is Todd Farren.  I'm just an ordinary Chico citizen.  I'm here to give some feedback on the homeless situation.  I've been coming to Chico since the early 90s,  recruiting project engineers out of the university.  Bought property here in 2007 and moved here permanently in 2017.  Loved the community, but, boys, it changed.  It's not for the better.  I do not understand how businesses are able to survive downtown.  We as citizens don't want to come downtown.  And we don't want to go to the parks.  I had a two-year-old grandson here this last week,  and we had to search to find a park that was appropriate to take him.  It's a problem.  I would like to thank you for your work towards the,  I saw a recent RFP and I think it's an MOU with the county.  And I would support that so that people have a place to live.  But even more importantly,  if they can get the help that they need so they can move away from homelessness.  So, appreciate your doing that and just wanted to reiterate how important that is  to most of us in the city.  Thank you.  Our next speaker is Robin Engle followed by Jessica Giannola.  We have a problem with homelessness.  We have a housing crisis,  which thankfully the city has finally acknowledged.  That is that we have a housing crisis.  We do not have a problem with any element of our community being less than any other element of our community.  And I wonder how it's possible that the city has not made a real impact in remedying our housing crisis,  when in fact,  our police department is,  at the highest percentage rate of pay,  percentage of the general budget of any of the other nearly 18,000 police agencies across the country.  Highest rate of pay.  When our city manager in fact takes in well more than the governor of California,  who takes in more than twice as much as most governors throughout the country.  And cash pay alone above and beyond very snazzy benefits,  including a maybe five to 600,000,  car allowance,  plus insurance,  plus,  plus,  plus when our city staff makes 230% more than the average city staff across the country.  When our police department has enough money to purchase drones and a military tank.  When you put thousands into an ice rink during a drought,  during a pandemic,  during this housing crisis,  and despite please from our neighbors,  our family in paradise.  Thank you.  I really appreciate, I want to say, the pastor's words or Reverend Yale's words earlier today in acknowledging the anniversary three years since the campfire.  Our children are murdering people because they are victims of the housing crisis.  You have taught them that by continuing the housing crisis, by ignoring federal judges' rulings and words.  You have taught them this.  Two or three of these children are roaming free.  Two or three of these children who were involved in the murder of Guy Stephen Van Zant are free, not being held culpable.  They knew they could get away with murder, literally.  Literally.  Literally.  Literally.  That's your fault.  That blood is on your hands.  All except for Alex Brown.  I appreciate your compassion, especially your compassion for the most vulnerable.  The rest of you need to own your accountability for the situation in this city with our housing crisis and what it has caused and what you have caused by condoning and supporting it and by not remedying it.  Thank you.  Jessica Giannola, followed by Julie Threat.  Counsel.  Oh, my gosh.  It's a real bummer.  I only have three minutes every other week to say something to you about the circumstances that our city is under.  But here we go.  In recent weather forecasts, we had a clear indication that we'd have flooding in our area.  Yet the city failed to act.  I'm confused as to how anyone running a city could be unaware of the danger that the unhoused folks that they were in, the people lining the creeks.  There was no preparation, no mitigation efforts, no moves to warn people, move people, or assist any of the displaced citizens from immediate danger.  There was nothing.  There's no offer for dry shelter, no offer to help with transportation.  Again, no offer, period, for people in danger in our city.  I reached out to council.  I reached out to city staff.  And I received just, well, two emails back in response.  One was just identified that we have some shelter beds available.  But it's already been established that the people who are out in Comanche Creek and other areas, they've already been excluded in some manner.  They're not accessible to them.  It's already been established.  So something besides that would probably be beneficial in people in an emergency being flooded down creeks.  Something.  Something.  Something.  Something.  Why the city didn't act was that litigation prevented you from doing so.  And that is absolutely not the case.  There is nothing preventing the city from acting in an emergency situation for people in the city that are, their life is in danger.  Nothing.  No, there is no litigation at all.  City, the city leadership should be acting in faith for all of our residents.  I usually say this every time at the podium because it's really important that we see it.  And I'm not seeing it.  That's why I keep saying it.  We need to see it.  The people of the city should be moved to ask why you're picking and choosing who is valued and who is offered aid during an emergency.  Who among us is left to fend for ourselves?  I ask that.  What happened during a recent storm is a complete failure in leadership, in my opinion.  One that I wish would not repeat itself, but one we continue to see time and time again.  If it's not flooding, it's freezing, it's heat, whatever it may be.  Our poorest citizens need help now.  They need shelter and housing now.  Not just shelter, but housing.  They need the BMX site up and running now before another storm, before they freeze and approaching freezing temperatures.  They'll need it six months from now when the city litigation is done and that timeframe, the committed timeframe is done.  They'll still be unhoused unless we're doing something about housing.  I felt such hope when we had the community input.  Nothing has happened since then.  Our voice has been ignored.  Our emails go unignored.  When I stand here at the podium and I make these statements pleading for your help and understanding.  Our true situation.  They go unignored.  The people in this city continue to suffer.  Our city suffers.  And I keep asking for what purpose?  Julie Threat, followed by our last speaker, Patrick Newman.  Hello again.  So on this item, it's kind of the same topic.  And I fully endorse the Pallet Project, whatever it's going to be called.  I assume it's palletshelter.com.  So I don't know if that's really the one.  But the word pallet is kind of getting thrown around.  I fully support the MOU that you're putting together.  I worry a little bit that the county is going to maybe come in and go, wow, this is kind of working great.  Let's just, you know, send people down our way.  But, yeah, I was really disappointed.  I was at that board of supervisor meeting when the budget item was on the agenda.  And the, not the chief, the head guy said no.  And then he went away.  And then he came back.  And so it seemed like there was something nefarious going on.  But pallethelter.com, if anybody goes to that website, they'll see a lot of stories.  They'll see a lot of information that I think will make you very proud of what this organization can do.  And if it's not this organization, maybe we'll get to know that soon.  But if it's this one, it's fairly new.  They've got a lot of great ideas and opportunities.  My one request would be to, there's so many lessons learned from what Modesto did as a city.  Two years they were running an emergency shelter.  Got people out of their park, put them in this emergency shelter under a highway.  And then now they're in a, they're moving into a formal Salvation Army shelter.  So that transitional housing process seems to be working there.  I think we could cover a lot of the issues we have.  Thank you.  Keep running into the safe space, where we put people in the winter.  The cooling things aren't working.  And I think that eventually we'll see that there are some advantages to this.  And again, the dignity and the healing and a lot of things that the folks keep bringing up all the time,  I think will be kind of covered.  The one thing, again, that I would ask for, I think we've got to prepare for this,  maybe the illegal population that might be coming into the city.  I've heard some rumblings about Redding.  And I want to make sure that the folks that are approved or get to use this facility are just our citizens,  the people that have been out there for a long time.  And then again, if there's a way, I wanted to start going and talking to Modesto  or calling this lady that started the palletshelter.com.  She sounds like a fabulous woman.  But if there's a way that's already being done and we can get more engaged as individual citizens,  that would be great.  I did see that there's a team, Chico, which is the group of the Chamber of Commerce,  the DCBA, 3Care, Alliance for Workforce Development, Chico State, and Butte College.  And one of their main objectives.  One of their main objectives is obviously focused on the homelessness,  reduce impacts of homelessness to the community by participation in our organizations.  I never see them here, so I'm always kind of wondering what are they doing to participate.  And so maybe they'll be more actively engaged in the community.  So that's their 2021 focus.  I'm assuming that they're doing that.  And then there is a YouTube video.  Some people have talked about this.  Respectful Revolution put nine residents on the video.  A lot of people say they were kind of focused on those nine.  It was fabulous.  You can see there's a need for this.  It's kind of an opportunity.  And then my last one is absolutely this thing is going to fail bad if there's not a zero tolerance.  When there's a date when this thing gets activated and people are moving, there's a hard line.  It's zero tolerance, no more illegal camping.  I expect as a citizen that next day I see all of Chico PD,  I see all the sheriffs from Butte County rolling through town,  and I want to know that they're going to be hard because otherwise we need to send a signal to the folks out there  that are committing the crime and coming in.  So thank you very much.  And our last speaker is Patrick Newman.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I wish people would stop using the term transitional housing and start to talk more about temporary housing.  Transition implies a transition to something.  We're missing 500,000 affordable housing units  in the United States and most of those on the West Coast where things get more expensive every day.  And we have never put a net under people  in our community that have needed a net for 40 years.  So they fall through onto the streets and that's where they are.  So we have people up here time after time talking about their personal experiences  with people on the streets and how much they wish Chico some other kind of place.  I've heard this hundreds of times.  What all those people have in common is that they don't really know this population.  And  one bad experience, one frightening spectacle,  that can all be turned around with direct contact,  with some generosity, with some willingness to establish some intimacy with people who are out there.  It's not that hard.  I wonder why it seems like it's so hard.  Having said that,  I came up here to talk about this fence over here.  A few hundred feet.  Third time in this year that we fenced that area off.  And because I know people on the streets and have spent more than five years,  six, seven years actually getting to know them, that's a very personal thing.  I don't know them through this lens of, oh, they're offensive, they're scary.  They interrupted me while I was eating my dinner downtown.  I know them differently.  This is a cultivated discipline.  You go out, you meet people, you stand with them, you talk to them,  you help them meet whatever needs they have, if you can do it.  That changes everything.  That changes the whole conversation.  So  when I see this fence go up again, and I see and I know who's being fenced out personally,  people with missing limbs, people with wheelchairs, people with long histories of mental illness,  who will not fit into any of the shelters that you claim they can fit into.  They're not going to be accepted there, just as Robin just said.  I know that those people are fenced off from restroom access.  I know that they're fenced off from a place that's a resource for them.  It's a resource in a lot of ways.  It's a social resource.  It becomes the only place where they can be members of the community in a way that's where they are accepted.  When you fence these people off, you fence them off from, really,  in a lot of ways, they're not going to be accepted.  In a lot of ways, they're living room, bedroom, kitchen and bathroom.  And you may not like that they use it for that.  But again, go back to 500,000 missing housing units.  Thank you.  All right. Last speaker, yes.  All right. Thank you, everybody.  OK, so we're going to move on to public hearings and there's five of them tonight,  which is going to be the brunt of our evening.  The public hearing guidelines for each  hearing are as follows. So an announcement of ex parte communications  by council members. So if you've talked to anyone with any of these various  organizations, the staff report up to 15 minutes, then council discussion or  questions or discussion, which is 10 minutes.  And then we'll open the hearing for public input.  No more than 50 minutes.  Applicant 15 minutes.  Additional speakers 30 minutes.  Appellant three minutes, if granted.  So as a rebuttal on the three minutes.  So and then we close the public hearing.  Council discusses we motion and then vote.  And that can take as much as 20 minutes.  So we'll see how quickly or slowly we get through the process here.  And we will start with four point one hearing regarding a proposed general plan  amendment and rezone to reconfigure primary open space zoning design,  review and associated site improvements, DCM and construction.  Marlene.  I'm not going to read the assessor parcels number.  So do we have any announcement of ex parte communications?  And no conversations.  All right. So with that staff report.  All right. Thank you, Mayor Coolidge.  And good evening, council members.  This project site is located at the southwest corner of Morro Lane at Comanche Court.  It's just east of Notre Dame Boulevard and Highway 99.  Southwest Southeast Chico.  The site zone.  It's owned ML Light Manufacturing with a ribbon of primary open space going  through the middle of it and surrounding land uses include materials,  supply stores and commercial services with some sparse residential to the east,  including directly across Comanche Court.  The aerial shows that we have a vegetated corridor going through the middle of it.  And within that vegetated corridor, there's a little stream channel  from a former stream that was a tributary to Comanche Creek.  There's a.  About two acres of grassland to the north side and a small contractor's yard,  largely unimproved to the south.  The former stream channel used to carry more flows out of the foothills and then  deliver those to Comanche Creek, however, with the construction of the Butte Creek  diversion channel, it intercepted those foothill runoffs.  And now it pretty much just collects localized stormwater.  And I have some slides at the end that I can go into if there's more questions about how  that got to be.  The site plan calls for two warehouse buildings, about 18000 square foot  warehouse up front near Morro Lane with a little bit of parking in front,  more parking in back and another warehouse in the back,  about 15000 square feet with parking all around.  The stream channel remains in the middle.  It would be largely undisturbed.  There would be one vehicle crossing proposed.  It would be a clear span crossing, so no fill within the channel  around the parking lot, as typical these days.  We have stormwater detention basins to catch the runoff from the immediate site  before that is allowed to enter the channel, which would be the way stormwater  would exit the site. The site plan shows all the trees on the site.  There's a lot of trees.  The bold ones were the ones that were found to be in best health.  And  then there's a lot of other trees that I'll show you a couple of pictures here.  There's some of them lean very heavily to one side,  which is their future viability, as well as there's some damaged trees  that make them susceptible to diseases.  Those types of trees would largely be removed.  And the project designed around the best trees that they wanted to keep.  The landscape plan shows how there would be some new trees planted around  the parking lot and perimeter of the site to fill out the canopy where the existing  trees would be retained.  They're shown here in the green, larger circles.  The buildings themselves would be very substantial, large buildings.  It's 35 feet tall, concrete construction, very permanent looking buildings.  Lots of glazing in front to give them a nice look.  Very utilitarian with burlap doors in the back.  The perspectives show how they're really  going to have good surface articulation, good entryways that people can find easily.  The part of the rezone involves changing the existing zoning,  which is shown here in black.  And when we were doing the zoning many years ago, I think we followed the riparian  corridor more, not knowing exactly where the channel was when we were doing this  at large scale. This project gave us the chance to really zoom in and take a closer look.  So shown in red is kind of where the channel goes.  The channel actually comes out of stormwater pipes onto the site and then it flows into the open space  next door or undeveloped property to the west.  And then it will go back into storm drains to get under the freeway.  The rezone would conform the open space zoning to the project site  and reconfigure that to capture the trees that would remain.  As part of the process, we do an environmental review document.  We identified several mitigation measures in that process.  One, to lower the lighting that's nearest that residence on Comanche Court.  Some air quality, typical BMP.  Pre-construction surveys for various trees and bats.  And then cultural resources in case something's found during construction.  Mike, just for the public BMP?  Best management practices, typical things that happen on construction projects to minimize air pollution.  Any time you see an acronym, I'm going to ask.  Sorry, I apologize for that.  A couple of those mitigations were added at the request of Department Fish and Game,  who took a look at the document and decided that we could use a couple of additional measures.  So in summary, staff thinks we have a good project here.  The Architecture Review and Historic Preservation Board reviewed it a couple of months ago.  They voted unanimously that it should be approved.  And the Planning Commission, also all members present, voted to recommend that the project be approved.  So tonight we have a rezone ordinance to introduce.  And we're recommending that you do that, as well as a resolution to adopt that would adopt the mitigated negative declaration,  as revised by the Fish and Game Commission.  So we're going to have a rezone ordinance to introduce.  approve the general plan amendment, and approve the design review of the two conditions.  So with that, I can answer questions if you have them.  All right. Questions for Mr. Sala?  Thank you very much.  And so  so we'll open the public hearing and the applicant can have 15 minutes.  We have no speaker cards.  Can I ask the applicant or no?  Or do they want to?  OK.  He did. He did.  All right.  So and then any speaker cards on this item?  No. All right.  So obviously no rebuttal to the speaker, so I would assume.  So close the public hearing and then council discussion.  Just a quick question for Mr. Sala.  Noted the votes coming from ARHB and Planning Commission.  Are there any concerns brought up during those conversations that might be helpful?  I'm just curious.  Mostly just clarifying that we're largely staying out of the channel.  Thank you.  So can we get that back up on screen?  I have a question, his presentation.  And then if you can just scroll back to the beginning, I think it was page two or  three where the true a little further, actually, probably.  No, no. I mean, a little like five or six.  Probably. Let's see. Five, six, seven.  Let's look at seven. Yeah.  So the site where we see some of these trees on here.  So are those being removed and replaced by the trees shown where you see the shadows  of the trees or those just the ones in the channel that aren't being touched?  The one in the channel, the green  halos throughout the channel are the canopy of the trees to remain.  OK. And then all the little new colorful ones  are the ones that they would plant as part of the project.  Gotcha.  And how many trees are being removed?  Twenty eight for sure.  There are some that are right on the borderline and they will be retained if  they can, but they might have to be removed because we're also dealing with  slopes on the edge of that channel, there is a condition that they have to pay  mitigation fees for every six inches of diameter that come out.  So there's a built in incentive for them  to try to save as many trees during the construction.  And then adding how many trees?  Because I don't want to count about about 30.  Trees. All right.  Thank you.  That was my only question.  Any other questions?  All right. Well, the council  had moved to approve  second of a motion from  Vice Mayor Reynolds, a second from Council Member Tandon.  Madam Clerk, take the role when you're ready.  Thank you, Mr.  and that is a motion for to introduce the ordinance of the city of  the City Council of the City of Chico amending the zoning property identified  as assessor's parcel number 040030046 to reconfigure the existing  light manufacturing and OS1 primary open space zoning rezone 19-02 BCM construction  on Morrow Lane.  Council Member Bennett. Yes.  Council Member Brown.  Aye.  Council Member O'Brien. Yes.  Council Member Tandon. Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds. Aye.  And Mayor Quillage. Aye.  Carries 6-0 with one absent.  All right.  Thank you very much.  Clock on that one.  All right. Item 4.2.  Appeal hearing regarding denial of commercial cannabis application.  Ash Chico LLC and Mr.  Ewing, I believe this one is yours.  Come on down.  And before we start, sorry, Mr.  Ewing, before we start, is there any ex parte communications on this item?  Anyone?  All right.  Go.  Thank you, Mayor Coolidge, Vice Mayor Reynolds, members of the council and to  all those assembled here this evening.  I am pleased to announce that the council has approved the approval of the  drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug  we'll go through the process that the city of Chico went through in considering the permit  for cannabis dispensaries in the city of Chico. So first slide, please.  So the first step in this process is a zoning verification process. And that process was  undertaken by my esteemed colleague, Mr. Brendan Veague, and his staff, Ms. Dilg, and some persons  from my office. And essentially what they're looking to do is to see whether the proposed  use is consistent with the zoning code in the city of Chico. Next slide, please.  So what you do when you determine whether that use is consistent with the use and the zoning  code in the city of Chico is you look for specific markers such as sensitive uses. And in this case,  in all of these appeals, we received applications for commercial cannabis dispensaries from June  2nd to the end of the year. And we received applications for commercial cannabis dispensaries  2021 through July 16, 2021.  Phase 1 of the application process, as defined in the Chico  Minicode 5R42030, consisted of the application review I just  described and also the zoning verification by city staff.  The zoning verification review process was conducted to ensure  the proposed retail dispensary location was zoned properly and  was not located near a sensitive use.  A sensitive use is defined by the Chico Municipal Code under  1975-120.  Any applicant who did not meet the zoning requirements was  denied the opportunity to proceed to Phase 2A of the  application process, which consists of application scoring.  The city allowed timely appeals, and for any applicant who was  denied zoning approval, Ask Chico, which is the first matter  that you have before you, requested an appeal and is  before you today.  Okay.  All three.  Any other appellants went through the same process as I just  described?  We received timely requests for appeals and they were agendized  for this hearing today.  There's one application or appellant, Grupo Flor, who  communicated with the city on Friday afternoon of their desire  to request of the city council another hearing date.  Our communication from me, city attorney, to Grupo Flor's attorney  was,  I will communicate that to my client, you all, and you all  ultimately will decide whether or not you're going to grant  Grupo Flor another hearing date or you're going to decide their  appeal today.  You have the option of denying the appeal process, meaning they  would waive their appeal rights by not showing up today, or if  they have shown up, I don't know.  I don't know one way or the other whether in the audience.  If they've shown up, okay.  And if they've shown up, they haven't waived their appellate  rights, they can have their hearing and we'll go forward.  Quick question about that.  Quick question.  Okay.  So, the only appeals that we'll be hearing with regards to zoning  verification on these applications?  Yes.  Thank you.  So, all four are essentially of a sensitive use.  Again, that's to determine whether the proposed use is consistent  with the zoning code.  I just recited for you the muni code sections that you have on the  slides before you.  Next slide, please.  And then you take a look at the map, which is of a community, all  of which, all of a community which all of you are familiar with.  You're familiar with Chico and the uses in Chico and the  businesses in Chico.  Next slide, please.  So, before you have a definition of a sensitive use.  And in essence, or generally speaking, at least all of the  appeals that you have before you today consist of essentially uses  that are determined to be youth centers or businesses that cater  to or attract young people.  And so, the Chico municipal code determines that to be a sensitive  use and the idea is that you don't want to locate a dispenser  industry next to a sensitive use or a place that attracts youth.  Next slide.  Yeah.  And there you have before you the definition of a youth center.  I'm not going to read these slides because you have the hard copies  before you and I'm not a big fan of reading what you have before you  and what you can see on the screen.  So, I've described for you generally the use that we're talking about.  It's a sensitive use.  It's businesses that cater to youth, children, ages,  specific ages to toddlers all the way to teens.  At Chico specifically, their appeal is close to a sensitive use.  It's Chico Creek Dance.  Please continue.  Thank you.  And Chico Creek Dance Studio caters to youth.  Again, these slides speak for themselves.  I'm not going to read them to you.  And you have the hard copies.  Next slide.  So, based on the assessment of city staff, the Ask Chico application failed  the cannabis zoning verification.  And that's why this matter is before you.  It's a recommendation to consider the city's position, the appellant's position,  and ultimately for you all to deliberate upon what's been presented to you today  and to make a decision.  That concludes my report.  I'm going to move to the next report on the Ask Chico appeal.  Do you have any questions?  Questions?  I do have a question.  So, Mr. Ewing, is it your analysis, your assessment that staff's identification of the Chico Creek Dance Center  is indeed a use center?  Do you agree with that assessment?  I do.  In fact, I'll just speak to this, but I'll give you a preview.  I agree with the staff's assessment on all four.  Thank you.  Good.  Thank you.  All right.  Anyone else?  Okay.  All right.  So, okay.  Thank you very much.  You're welcome.  So, any further council discussion?  No, we're going to, yeah, we just have to do it in order.  So, the next is called the appellant.  Yeah.  But if there's any discussion, we'll just go ahead and do it.  If there's further discussion, we can discuss amongst ourselves, too.  So, and then do we have the appellant or applicant?  Come on down.  And you have 15 minutes.  Thank you.  I will not take all 15 minutes, but thank you.  My name is Tin Weston.  I am the attorney on behalf of Ashe Chico LLC, and I am happy to be here today, all the way from Orange County.  So, it's good to see everyone.  And I wanted to reiterate, we did submit a written appeal for purposes of preserving the record today and for oral arguments to be preserved.  I wanted to outline the reasons why we submitted an appeal.  What I noticed that is different between Ashe and the other appeals is that we actually had a company called City Radius Maps,  who actually directed the appeal.  And the person who directed the appeal, during the due diligence, contacted the city and inquired about a dance center.  And that person was told that a dance center would not be a youth facility.  And subsequent to that, the person from City Radius Maps then submitted an affidavit to us, indicating that it is not a youth center.  And from then we proceeded with this location.  I don't have the details of who the person is.  within the city who indicated that.  Should this proceed to litigation, I am sure that through discovery  we can find out who within the city indicated that it's not a youth center.  But aside from that fact, I think by definition  the fact that this dance center also caters to adults  in and of itself is not a youth center.  And I noticed that the city did have slides  indicating that it's primary for children  or minors because most of the classes are for minors.  But I think the legislative intent  in deeming something a youth center is actually  that it's strictly what it is on its face for youths only.  Because if the city were to interpret it  in a way that it includes facilities where there are other  ages who are not minors,  that would actually make it very difficult to find a location  and would ultimately limit any possibility of finding a location  within the city because many things can be considered a youth center.  But the definition that is given by the city  or given as written is actually a really narrowly  tailored definition that's not meant to encompass facilities  that cater to individuals who are not minors.  And as such, that's why with the definition that is written,  this dance studio would not qualify,  as we believe would not qualify as a youth center  and be disqualified.  The other issue that I wanted to speak about today  is that in addition to the factual analysis  of the interpretation of youth center  with respect to the dance studio,  there is actually a procedural flaw,  which needed to be needed in order to ensure  that the dance studio needed to be needed  needed to be needed in order to ensure  that the dance studio needed to be needed in order to ensure  that the dance studio needed to be needed in order to ensure  that the dance studio needed to be needed in order to ensure  that the dance studio needed to be needed in order to ensure the applicant is not notified whether or not this location would actually be approved rezoning until after the application has been submitted, which consequently means that if this location  that if this location does not pass muster within the zoning the applicant cannot move forward um  to then the rest of the application they've submitted and this is a uh it's a procedural  flaw and that it justly limits the number of qualifying applicants in in in effect that it  does not allow the applicant an opportunity to resubmit an alternative location or as in most  cities how i've seen it's been done they actually get a zoning letter before the application  process closes that they know ahead of time that um whether or not their location  will actually be approved and in essence those are the reasons why we believe that  our appeals should be granted for today thank you all right my apologies for our clock there  as well it's not uh necessarily accurate so it's only five minute increments and we can  do that all right thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you  thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you  yeah so so we'd reset you if you want additional time here no i'm okay thank you okay all right  um okay so and then additional speakers any on this item i don't have any other speaker cards  and then obviously no rebuttal um we could certainly ask questions i think of the applicant  so if you have any  okay first half i do have a question  well yeah i do have one for staff too i would say that my daughter went to that dance studio and  there are literally hundreds of little kids there all day long especially on the weekends but  especially in the afternoons and they have teen classes and some adult classes but it's primarily  little kids and a lot of them bike and walk from the surrounding neighborhoods  so um i do that view that as an issue but um we can bring back up staff mr ewing and miss tiller  so if needed if needed so if needed so if needed so if needed so if needed so if needed so if needed  so if needed so if needed so if needed so if needed so if needed so if needed so if needed  so if needed so if needed so if needed so if needed so if needed so if needed so if needed  so if needed so if needed so if needed so if needed so if needed so if needed so if needed  so if needed so if needed so if needed so if needed so if needed so if needed so if needed  Yes. The short answer to that question is yes, but really what you're doing here is you're hearing both sides, right?  So the staff made a determination.  You have the applicants.  They tell you their side of the story, if you will, and then you all will, you can ask questions like you just asked now and make your decision.  The recommendation is to hear the appeals and for you all to decide.  Now, at the staff level, our determination, you know, we collaborated internally and we reached consensus on these determinations.  But the goal for you all today is to listen to the city staff side, the applicant side, and ultimately for you all to decide.  I think I'm just clarifying that the kind of quasi-judicial element of things we often do is not the same in this.  Do the same rules apply?  Are we reading?  Are we reading the policy and saying this aligns or doesn't align with the policy?  Does that make sense?  What you said does make sense.  And this is quasi-judicial.  It's an appeal here.  And so we're looking at the policy and we're saying, okay, yes or no, you know, the determination.  And this is, you know, specifically we're talking about sensitive uses for this applicant.  Their appeal is before you now.  So the staff determination was, yeah, it's a youth center.  You know, maybe staff didn't make it.  I hate that face.  But, yeah, it's a youth center.  They're kids.  And to echo Mayor Coolidge's comment, you know, we looked at the youth and how many young people were going to that location and so forth.  And it wasn't like a one-off.  There were many kids going there.  And that allowed us to make the determination that we did.  I appreciate that for all these things.  Thanks.  And then addressing the legal issues, we don't obviously have to do that.  But the  applicant had some issues in that regard.  Right.  So one of the advantages of having me here is I can talk about those things.  So certainly, you know, the applicant raised a procedural question.  That question really pertained to the process and what happens at the counter, if you will, in Brendan's shop.  So I would suggest that you can ask that question of Brendan.  Like, what happens?  What happens when someone comes and they have a proposed?  Use of land in the city?  What do people normally do?  You can ask those questions now or you cannot ask those questions.  But, you know, it's certainly, you know, counsel for the applicant raised the issue.  You have staff available to answer the question.  Yeah.  And I think it might be impossible for us to find out if someone called in and got that, you know.  Right.  And I was actually speaking to the question that, you know, sometimes applicants come to staff and say, hey, I'm going to do this.  What do you think?  Right?  Yeah.  That approach.  Yeah.  All right.  Further questions?  I have one question from staff.  City radius maps, is that something that we get calls from very often?  Is that used a lot in determining these things or is this a new type of service that's used?  Oh, that.  City radius maps.  The service they used.  I've not heard of that before.  It's not something that you're aware of?  Yeah.  And then you said something in your argument or in your discussion about the.  Sure.  Sure.  The legislative intent was to.  Can you repeat that part?  Because I watched it at legislative intent.  Sure.  Of course.  So with the legislative intent, obviously the legislature had the intention of preventing access of cannabis to minors in that the intention is to allow the zoning such that it's within a spatial proximity.  So it's not a  So when you have a hybrid, how do you then determine what is truly a youth and what is not truly a youth?  And I think that by definition, if it caters also to adults, it's not by definition a youth center.  Because when the code talks about primary, I think what they're talking about primary is that the facility is used primarily for youth activities.  And by definition, youth is strictly for minors.  And if I may add one thing to Mary, could you just comment about the dance studio?  I also have kids and my daughter does dancing and she now does springboard diving.  But, you know, I understand.  I totally understand what you are talking about.  And that's why in our appeal, we set forth an alternative to allow us to find an alternative location.  Given the fact that, you know, we went through this whole city radius map and we had an affidavit drawn up saying that this location is OK.  And so we do have an alternative location that we have an LOI for in the event that the city decides, OK, well, it is, you know, inequitable to deny there for moving forward.  We're not at this point.  We're just asking.  We're not asking for an opportunity to move forward in the application process.  That's really what we're asking for.  All right.  And Mr. Ewing, I'd assume that's opening up a can of worms if we allow denied appellants to move forward with a different location.  Or what's your thought on that?  So that's a, I mean, that happens at the beginning of the burning shop regarding whether or not, whether you can go to a different location.  In terms of that opening up a can of worms, I would expect to talk about.  Denying the staff recommendation, allowing the applicants to go forward with the process of what a different location that would be in changing the importance.  Right.  So what I was alluding to earlier, however, is if I'm coming into a community and I want to operate a certain business, I go to the building and planning department and I have a conversation about what that business is going to be.  I check the zoning and I confirm the city, not some third party that has no affiliation with the city doesn't know about it.  I confirm the city, whether my use is going to be allowed.  So that's fairly common.  Makes sense.  I have a quick question to that point, just to verify with your side of the shop.  If somebody were to come to the city and say, I want to talk about this location and whether they're a sensitive use.  Is are there staff available to consult on those locations and whether there are sensitive uses?  So this was unique in that we had these buffers associated with the sensitive uses, and that's not something we normally have associated with people coming in and asking a simple question.  Is this a use allowed in this zoning district?  So what we would say is, yes, at that location with that zoning, that use is allowed.  But you have to understand.  And that's where you've seen disclaimers in the PowerPoint presentation on the website and all of our frequently asked questions.  A determination will be made about this site and this location for this use based on your application, the time you make your application.  So it's fluid.  And that's why things were always draft up until the very last moment when they submitted.  And there's one in particular tonight where the timing is quite close on when use, we believe, was established.  So this wasn't your normal counter engagement.  And to speak to something that was said earlier, staff was coached very clearly.  Okay.  So we were very careful about this.  I coached like they needed coaching.  But we need to be careful because there was a lot of people coming in saying, hey, can I do this here?  Hey, I want to get a zoning verification.  Yeah.  And our response was, you don't want to get a zoning verification right now because it's only valid as of today.  It's not valid as the day that you submit your application.  So it really doesn't have the value that you think it does.  And we were careful to point out to folks they need to do their due diligence and be very careful.  And they have the same access to information that we did in our due diligence.  And Kelly Murphy's here who did a lot of the work on these and got in the weeds and contacted state agencies and looked at websites and did other searches.  And so it is work.  And so that's kind of the process we went through.  I have two more questions.  One, question one, is it in your research and analysis of other applications of this definition where dance centers included?  Say that one more time.  In your analysis of other applications in other communities.  In your analysis of other applications in other communities.  Were dance studios included?  So we had 25 applications.  So you're saying other jurisdictions I don't have.  I thought you said you did some research and dug into it with state agencies, et cetera.  Oh, of like searches of Google in our community.  Oh, got it.  Okay.  Use centers like looking at figures and looking at Google Maps and trying to figure things out.  So that's what I was referring to.  Thank you.  That's clear.  I appreciate it.  And I would share that there was a mention that.  It's difficult for applicants to get through.  But of the 25 applications, 21 did make it through our process.  Absolutely.  Or through the zoning verification.  And Mr. City Attorney, just a quick question for you.  Is it your opinion that the ordinance is written in a way that allows staff some flexibility and discretion in determining whether a use is a sensitive use?  I do read the ordinance that way.  And I also read the ordinance.  And I also read the ordinance the same way with respect to the policymaking body, which is the quasi-judiciary body today.  I believe you all have the discretion as well.  Thank you.  I appreciate it.  All right.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Okay.  So we will close the public hearing and then counsel discussion.  And I wouldn't mind starting just with saying, following up on my original thought is, I think I took my daughter.  I think I took my daughter there for three or four years.  And it's youth, without a doubt.  Every Saturday morning, every Sunday, every afternoon.  And while youth are there, you're out because the classes are an hour.  So you're basically out walking that immediate neighborhood with your other children, whether they're older or younger.  So I spent a lot of time at that dance center, way too much, and a lot of time around it.  So I understand the concern.  But that's my two cents.  So anyone else?  All right.  So with that, we entertain a motion.  And I would like to just clarify to the public, and Mr. Big did say this, but we had 25 applicants.  These four are appealing.  The other 21 are moving forward through the next process.  Some of these, if they meet the appeal, maybe not all 21.  19?  29.  29 total.  And so the other 25 are moving forward right now.  Oh, gotcha.  Okay.  So I'm missing.  Yeah.  So 29.  It's all right.  Okay.  So one dropped out.  Close enough.  My point is, is that there's others moving forward.  So, all right.  We have a motion.  I would make a motion to stick with staff's recommendation.  On this particular one.  And uphold staff's opinion.  I'll second that motion.  All right.  We have a motion and a second to deny the appeal.  Council Member Bennett?  Yes.  Council Member Brown?  Aye.  Council Member O'Brien?  Yes.  Council Member Tandon?  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds?  Aye.  Aye.  And Mayor Coolidge?  Aye.  Carries 6-0.  All right.  Thank you.  And with that, we'll move on to item 4.3,  appeal hearing regarding the denial of commercial cannabis application,  Authentic Chico LLC.  And before we start with our report, again, from Mr. Ewing and Ms. Dillig,  we will start with an announcement of ex parte communications.  Anyone?  All right.  So, away you go.  May I proceed?  Yes.  Thank you, Mayor Coolidge, members of the council, to all those assembled here today,  in person and virtually.  I'm Vincent Ewing, the city attorney, and I'm addressing the next appeal before you,  which is appeal hearing 4.3 regarding denial of commercial cannabis application, Authentic Chico. the proposed dispensary would be in an area that's proximate to the Apollo School of Music. Next slide, please. And this is determined by staff to be a sensitive use.  We'll begin in just a moment. And this is determined by staff to be a sensitive use. Next slide, please. And based on that determination, the zoning verification process for this particular applicant was determined to be such that they failed the verification process.  that they fail the verification process and the recommendation that you have before you is to  deny this application that staff staff's recommendation but also the um the staff  would ask that the city hear the appellant you've heard you heard staff you have the slides  before you in hard copy and on the screen and we're available for any questions  all right questions for staff i have a question go ahead um this one was a little bit more  difficult to suss through uh admittedly i went to the website of the uh the site that was determined  to be a youth um center and i'm given some of the discrepancies right one page says kids kids kids  one page says adults right um how did you finalize your interpretation for youth center here and this  may be a question for mr b but  um go ahead part of it was actually contacting the um the apollo school of music both um myself  and kelly talked to the school um ask questions who are you primarily primarily catering to are  you having adults come in is it mainly children um so it was a lot of that was the feedback from  um the sensitive use i hope that answered your question  okay  um !  mr city attorney just real quick um so defining youth is that minors meaning  a person under 21 or juveniles under the age of 18.  uh under the age of 18 so you have a on your slides you have a age range that we we looked at  uh anywhere from four to seven and all the way up to the age of 18 and that would that would be youth  thank you yeah  so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so  I've been a resident in Chico for about 40 years.  I'm also an honorably retired peace officer and an alumni of Chico State and  Butte College.  The property that we're working on, we're on page three, is 900 Mangrove.  Corner location, dedicated parking, access over 250 additional parking spaces,  well distanced from other businesses in the shopping center.  As significant to this location is it's a short walking and biking distance to a  large concentration of the city of Chico and adjacent to public transportation.  The next slide shows you where this location is on a map in reference to  location in the city as well as the transportation corners.  Currently, this business is vacant.  It was last used as Bravo Bank.  Hard to ask for a building that's more secure.  It has it's old bank vault.  Large building 550 square feet.  The plan is to provide a retail floor space of about 3 700 square feet.  The issue in question is the Apollo music school and  so we wanted to discuss those issues.  A Youth Center according to the city municipal code and  I'm a little concerned.  Right?  because we have two code sections, but the first one is 5.42.050.  It defines a youth center as any public or private facility  that is primarily used to host recreation or social activities for minors,  including but not limited to private youth membership organizations or clubs,  social service teenage facilities, video arcades,  or similar amusement park facilities.  The implication would be, I'm thinking, an amusement park facility,  I think would be pretty big, something like the fairgrounds,  as opposed to a school.  Apollo was originally started as a retail piano business  that rents and sells pianos.  In the website information that we have from Apollo,  it mentions adult life.  It mentions lessons, and then it also mentions that they provide lessons to children.  The school is not a place that hosts recreational or social activity.  It's a music school that hosts recreational activities,  including one-on-one teaching, as opposed to a large social gathering.  The definition proceeds to provide examples of such activities,  all of which imply a large gathering of youth,  such as an amusement park,  none of which relates to a music school.  The next page is the first page of the website from Apollo Music,  which talks about adult beginners,  is their first theme on their page.  The other concern is that we did go to the city  and get a copy of the business license for Apollo Music,  and it's actually not designated for youth.  Its classification is BU,  and it's actually not designated for youth.  The B is educational occupancies for students above the 12th grade,  and then we provided for you on the next page  a copy of the certificate of occupancy from the city of Chico.  So this is obviously showing that this is not the occupancy  that the city of Chico provided.  It's saying that it's not for...  It's specifically for people over the age of the 12th grade.  If Apollo was to be considered a site used primarily for minors,  it would have been designated into an E group,  meaning a different classification.  So in vetting for our location,  we did pull the permits and check the city licensing.  The other concern and a little bit of confusion I may have  is city code section.  It's 19.75.120,  and then the subsections get pretty fun.  Subsection B,  and then it says here specifically in this code,  the sensitive receptor, which would be a youth center,  must have a Chico City business tax certificate  for the specific location and sensitive use.  Whereas the gentleman here said it simply needs to have a business permit.  He's not mentioning the specific location and sensitive use  needs to be added to the city business certificate.  Based on that information,  it seems unreasonable to presume that Apollo is a youth center.  A youth center is supposed to be a large facility  for any number of children,  not like a ballet company,  which has hundreds and hundreds,  of children on a Saturday,  especially because of COVID.  When I've gone by Apollo there,  they're not open.  Their latest website show one-on-one teaching  that is not a large facility providing services to youth,  nor is it zoned or permitted by the city of Chico for that use.  Any more questions?  Any questions?  Any questions?  I do have a quick question.  Yes.  You mentioned that the building is currently vacant.  Do you as the applicant have a lease on the building?  Actually, we do.  And actually, they have donated to the use of our health community.  And so if any of you have received a COVID test recently,  you've probably gone there.  If you peek around where the nurses are,  that's where the vault is.  And so it is currently being used as a free COVID testing site.  And we do have a lease on that building.  Thank you for clarifying.  Thank you.  Questions for staff?  Yeah.  Good.  Oh, okay.  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right.  Do we have any speakers?  No speakers.  All right.  I'm just not used to that, so sorry.  Any further questions for staff?  I do.  Okay.  I do as well, and I think Alex does too.  So while the last one seemed a little bit more clear to me,  this one obviously is a little bit less clear.  And when I was doing my studying on it last night,  the particular thing that came up was the certificate of occupancy permit  from the city of Chico where it clearly does say BU,  but then there's in handwriting an E that says 12 and under,  and I just, the staff want to speak to,  I don't know who went out and did this, but, well, back in 17,  they may not even be here at this point.  But I just think that that's very unclear for an applicant if they pull  something.  Then it says that it's being used for over 12th grade.  And that was.  Is it possible for me to answer that question?  Because my contractor is the one who wrote that on the piece of paper.  Oh, okay.  Because we were trying to find the proper zoning.  And so I sent a contract to the city and he put in, oh, it's BU.  And what would his BU mean?  And then he put in, well, it would need to have been designated as E,  which would be for youth.  And so.  Okay.  Thank you.  I thought that was somebody from our inspections, you know,  notes on there.  So I appreciate that.  It's clearly licensed to BU.  So that to me throws a wrench in the works for our decision.  Clearly.  Let me just offer up.  The building department determines occupancy based on their codes and rules  and regulations, California green building code finance might have a list for a,  a,  a,  um,  a business permit planning.  We look at the use and try to define that.  And so that's kind of what we were focusing on is what we perceive the use to be at the location.  There may be some other underlying things where there hasn't been complete and utter perfect coordination between building for use that might have been established 20,  30 years ago,  um,  as a bank,  perhaps,  um,  with the finance department and determining its use on their codes for the business license.  But that doesn't mean when we get,  to what we're talking about tonight,  we're really focused on a zoning verification and then the use.  So I,  I just offered up that.  Um,  but there can be sometimes some minor mixed messages in some of those  and probably didn't really matter much.  And a lot of the other decisions that we've made and a lot of other things where it's kind of critical in this particular,  you know,  arena.  Yeah.  Um,  I just want to follow up Mr Vig on the question I asked previously,  um,  cause I'm realizing maybe it felt,  um,  maybe I didn't have a clear answer about,  um,  if somebody came in and asked,  Hey,  I want to open a business,  this particular type of business in this area.  Is this a sensitive use?  Are there staff available to consult and identify and work with those applicants to identify those uses?  As it relates to sensitive uses that would,  to my knowledge,  really only be focused on commercial Canada.  That's what I'm speaking to.  I don't mean to be vague.  Yeah.  Um,  well,  like we suggested,  we had these initial,  um,  figures that we shared with the,  um,  cannabis committee.  Sure.  Um,  and that was ultimately some figures that were developed based on just a first blush of our GIS.  And they were intended,  if you remember to share with the committee at that time where we might likely see these uses established,  they were never intended to say these are absolute finite and finish.  Um,  so those,  those tools were at least available though.  And some people called and asked,  you know,  Hey,  this is,  this is gospel.  The answer was no,  this is not gospel.  Sure.  This was the intended use of these figures.  This is what their purpose is.  Um,  we can share with you that per our zoning,  that commercial cannabis use is allowed there barring the establishment of a sensitive use.  Sure.  And that was kind of where we stopped.  So you couldn't go any further.  This,  if somebody said,  does this count as a sensitive use to confirm or deny that?  Cause all they would remember,  this happens all the time.  Yes.  Even when it's not cannabis,  all they remember is what they positively heard.  Yes.  And so they,  they would say,  I,  as we heard tonight already,  somebody told me that it was allowed.  I don't believe that to be accurate.  Totally.  But so we had to be very careful.  Um,  given the nature of this use and how it's going to be allowed,  how there's going to be three at the end.  Yeah.  It's different than how we,  um,  had to teach.  We may mostly would engage folks on other zoning questions in our community.  I do appreciate the answer.  I think I asked the question because the language can be vague,  right?  If this person were,  if this,  uh,  person were trying to explore,  whether this was a sensitive use on their own,  they would find this business license that says it's not in a website that says it caters somewhat to use,  but there's a lot of adult activity,  uh,  classes and,  and lessons available.  And so from like an equity standpoint and what it says in our,  in our code,  I'm just trying to assess through a little bit.  Thank you.  So any other questions?  I have a couple of questions.  So to what extent was round table pizza?  Consider it because it's got an arcade,  it hosts little league signups every year,  or at least it has,  it hosts little league parties.  I'm aware of soccer parties,  all private.  I would say we would find that those activities do take place,  but the primary use is a restaurant,  right?  Okay.  And other using an arcade in the,  and I would say that those arcades are,  you know,  they're,  it is not an arcade.  It is,  it's a restaurant with an arcade.  Gotcha.  That is where little league hosts are.  Well,  or in the past,  at least when I've spent many nights there,  maybe soccer.  I don't know something we registered a child for there multiple years in  a row.  Um,  all right.  Further questions.  No.  Well,  the council,  you have a question.  Council member 10,  you know,  what percentage of the students in the polo are minor and how many of the  business goes to the adult there?  You know,  you please repeat the question.  I'm sorry.  I'm curious to know if,  uh,  what percentage of the business that a polar does is with the minors and  what percentages with the adults.  So if we know by chance,  I'll let either Angie or Kelly respond because they in fact contacted Apollo  and kind of inquire.  They,  you know,  we really wanted to meet these things out and get to the bottom of,  you know,  is it predominantly minor?  Or not.  So  I can speak a little bit to that.  initially we did reach out just to,  uh,  members of the membership team,  ask some initial questions about their programs and if those programs were  age specific and then,  um,  a general question as to if they would consider themselves a youth oriented  facility or not.  Um,  and then all of our interpretations were forwarded to the city attorney's  office for,  um,  corroboration.  And we took it from there.  Um,  just out of curiosity about the process,  when you called the youth center,  did you say,  um,  we have an application for a cannabis retail dispensary and we're doing a zoning  verification related to that?  I did,  um,  share that we were doing a sensitive use analysis for a new use that required  a buffer of 600 feet from youth centers or a thousand feet from a school.  So we did provide that information without getting very specific.  Um,  so it went really well. with only retail, so in my conversations with them, which I haven't talked to the guy in at least two years,  We went really well with it.  We went really well with it.  We went really well with it.  We went really well with it.  We went really well with it.  We went really well with it.  just like the other music school does over by the sandwich shop.  It's one of those days.  But I know that was the specific reason for him moving from Highway 32 out to Mangrove  was specifically to have lessons and a facility for lessons.  Any other questions?  No, but I'll make a motion.  Go for it.  I think this one, unlike the other, is completely different.  And I see a whole lot of you, not a whole lot,  but there are various businesses with minor aspects of youth usage in that permit.  And in that aspect, I think that we should allow this, deny it,  and allow this one to move forward or overrule staff's recommendation and allow this.  Yeah, approve the appeal and allow this one to move forward.  I'll second that one.  All right.  We have a motion on second.  Madam Assistant Clerk.  Council Member Bennett.  No.  Council Member Brown.  Aye.  Council Member O'Brien.  No.  Council Member Tandon.  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds.  Aye.  Mayor Coolidge.  No.  It is a tie vote, so the motion fails.  All right.  So let me ask our city attorney real quick.  So if, in fact, we have no approval and no denial, what happens?  Okay.  Okay.  So a tie is a fail.  Yeah.  Gotcha.  All right.  Any further motions?  All right.  Seeing none, we will move on.  And let's do a short break, and then we'll return.  All right.  We'll reconvene on my agenda.  All right.  Item 4.3, appeal hearing regarding denial of commercial cannabis application.  Authentic.  Chico, LLC.  Sorry, we're on 4.  4.4.  Grupo, floor.  Carmichael Drive.  And so any ex parte communication on this one?  No?  All right.  Okay.  So with that, we will start once again with the staff report.  Thank you, Honorable Mayor, Council.  We went through all of the slides.  We went through all of the slides. of commercial cannabis application, Grupo Floor.  We went through all of the slides.  We went through all of the slides.  We went through all of the slides.  We went through all of the slides.  We went through all of the slides.  We went through all of the slides.  We went through all of the slides.  into slides that the city staff has prepared to give you an idea of how the city staff  reached the conclusion that this, in fact, is a sensitive use.  You all are familiar with the community.  You're familiar with the location.  And you're familiar with the type of people that go to that location.  So with that, I'll open the floor for any questions that you may have of city staff.  All right.  Any questions?  None?  All right.  Thank you.  We'll open the public hearing and invite up the applicant.  Welcome.  Good evening.  I'd like to thank the council, mayor, and staff for taking a few minutes and hearing what we have to say.  I'd like to take a little different tack than the other applicants  and just spend a couple minutes talking about who we are and what we've done in the industry so far.  We're the intent to show you that giving us the opportunity to move forward would be a good partnership with the city.  We would be a key strategic partner with them.  And I think the city would benefit in a lot of ways.  I'd like to do this in three ways and really just highlight our experience in the industry.  We currently operate five dispensaries.  I've been in the cannabis industry for 15 years.  I opened one of the first legalized dispensaries in the city of San Jose in 2015.  That dispensary has operated for the last six years successfully.  We have four other locations in diverse communities throughout the state of California.  And we spend a lot of time...  Excuse me, sir.  For the record, can you identify yourself?  Oh, I'm sorry.  It's all right.  My name is Darren Dykstra.  I am the COO of Group of Floor.  Thank you.  I'm here to present.  Apologize for that.  I was trying to be nice and polite to begin with.  So anyway, with our experience, we're very familiar with operating successful cannabis businesses.  The other point I'd like to highlight is that we're local.  We integrate ourselves in the community.  We spend a lot of time taking a look at the location that we're interested in obtaining,  understanding what the neighborhood is like, understanding our neighbors themselves.  And we spend a lot of effort in cultivating a relationship with those neighbors prior to even submitting our application.  Another thing I'd like to highlight is that we open every dispensary that we apply for in our granted application.  We have never aggregated our licenses.  We don't intend to.  We flip our licenses.  We're owners and we're operators.  The other thing is that we understand that cannabis is a very sensitive topic, not only to you trying to make determinations of good partners within your community, but just to the community themselves.  We understand safety and security are key issues that often come up in these discussions.  We've operated for five years.  We've served over two million customers without a single safety or security issue.  We have 24-hour security at all of our sites.  Our facility has more than adequate cameras and security measures.  We actively patrol our property.  Our locations themselves are situated in such a way that we ideally look for standalone locations without neighbors, without sensitive use, which is obviously why we're talking tonight because there seems to be an issue with that here.  But, again, there's something that we're very sensitive to and we take an active role in trying to mitigate those issues.  I don't know if you guys are following along.  I think we did.  I did have a PowerPoint presentation for you, but there's a few visual representations of current operations that we have throughout the state.  And if you notice, we, unlike some of our competitors, don't take a one-shoe-fits-all type approach to the community.  This is the second slide.  We have a location in the city of Salinas.  We have a location in Union City in a major regional shopping center.  We have a location in Moss Landing.  Each of those communities are very different.  City of San Jose as well.  And if you notice, each...  Each of the skins of our locations represent the community and the local surroundings that we're in.  Again, a sensitivity to our neighbors and the experience on how we present ourselves.  Obviously, the city of Chico has done a lot of deliberation as to why do you even allow cannabis in this community.  With COVID and tax deficiencies, that's become a motivator throughout the state and we understand that.  We operate very successful businesses.  Our locations typically generate five to eight times the tax revenue as our competitors.  Again, just highlighting that.  I think we would be an excellent partner for the city should we be granted the opportunity to move forward.  Something I'd like to highlight on the next slide is we just recently opened the first retail location for cannabis in a major regional shopping center.  This is over a million square feet located front and center in Union Landing in Union City, California.  We're right next to Krispy Kreme, In-N-Out, Century Theater, Texas Roadhouse, Lowe's.  There's an extremely diverse amount of people, including children,  that pay for cannabis.  We have around 100,000 customers that visit that neighborhood.  Yet we're front and center.  If you look at the pictures of our visual representations, there's nothing that would indicate that this is a cannabis dispensary.  There's nothing to indicate that this is cannabis retail.  There's no green crosses.  There's no cannabis leaves.  There's no consumption in the parking lot.  There's nothing that anyone driving by would conclude that this is a cannabis retail location.  In fact, over 60 percent of our customers are over the age of 30.  20 percent are over the age of 60.  We as a business cater to a more mature, sophisticated, and sustainable environment.  educated group of cannabis consumers within the state.  Cannabis youth consumption is not something that we support in any way, shape, or form.  We do this in several ways, but mainly through community education.  In the city of Union City, before we even opened and submitted our application,  we donated over $100,000 to community outreach.  $31,000 of that went specifically to youth cannabis use and prevention of that.  Every founder of Group O'Flor is a parent, myself included.  We all have young children.  We're all extremely sensitive to anyone that could even potentially have access that is youth,  and we actively promote the deterrent of that.  Something else with regard to being part of the community, we hire 100% locally.  In any community that we've ever gone in, 100% of our staff is hired from the local community.  This is something that we will obviously bring to the city of Chico as well.  We plan on bringing 25 new jobs the day we open.  We've created over 200.  We've created over 200 jobs within our organization.  We've paid over $20 million in wages since we started.  50% of our employees are minorities.  Of the 11 managers that we have, nine are women.  We are a very diverse company, and we plan on bringing that community engagement  and hiring from the community to the city of Chico as well.  This isn't really a pat ourselves on the back.  It's just really to emphasize that we take cannabis retail,  we take the cannabis industry,  very seriously.  We understand it's transitioning.  There's a lot of issues that revolve around that.  We are sensitive to those issues, and we work with the communities that we're in to help mitigate those issues.  It really brings us to this slide here of how did we get here.  As part of integrating ourselves in the community,  choosing locations that are strategic,  figuring out ways that we can become better contributors to the community,  we've spent over a year searching properties.  We've been doing that for a long time.  We've been looking at a lot of different ways.  In fact, we looked at 15 locations before we chose the location on Carmichael.  We chose that location because it is a standalone.  There's easy ingress and egress.  The highway is close by.  It is actually in the part of town that most of the applicants are not choosing,  and so we feel that we can cater to a part of Chico that is not being addressed by the other applicants.  So if you notice the timeline, I really think this is the meat and potatoes of the conversation.  In June 2020,  we started looking for property.  Funland was closed.  We visited the neighborhood.  We drove the neighborhood.  We went and talked to some of our neighbors,  and we looked at Funland, and it was closed.  We secured the property in September,  and in November we submitted a zoning verification letter to the city.  We understand that through your process you couldn't tell us that that location unequivocally was compliant,  but we reached out to the city to get some guidance,  and we noticed that we otherwise wouldn't be able to get it.  Obviously, we're within the appropriate zoning.  In December, and I think this is really where I want to emphasize this point,  our head of retail and one of the cofounders, Mike Tar,  physically went and visited over 30 of the neighbors, knocking door to door.  There's an example of the information that we handed out to them,  introducing ourselves to the neighborhood, explaining the type of business we are,  and just touching base with them to see if there's any issues, anyone had any sensitivity, any questions,  any concerns, so that we could address them one on one.  By the way, Funland was closed, and we physically verified that.  We reached out to them subsequently several times between December and February.  They continued to be closed.  We got no answer, no response.  And in February, we again actually went out, myself included,  knocking on all of those neighbors' doors and actually expanded our radius and talked to several more,  handed them similar information.  I will say that every single person we talked to, myself, Mike, Joanna,  were the three that went to the neighborhood.  Every single person we talked to was a neighbor.  Every single person we talked to gave us a positive.  There's a few people that were indifferent.  There was not a single negative response.  In fact, several were interested in cross collaboration and were excited for the business that we'd bring to the neighborhood.  Again, I want to emphasize Funland was closed.  So when we submitted our application, we were under the understanding that, like many businesses,  in fact, the building that we chose was actually collateral damage from COVID.  They closed their business due to the issues surrounding that.  Funland also was closed during that period of time.  It did not look like it ever intended to reopen, like many businesses in the state.  So we felt confident in submitting our application because of that.  On September 23, after we were declined to our ability to submit on that property,  we went ahead and submitted a detailed appeal to your legal counsel or from our legal counsel.  The appeal letter that we submitted set forth with precision why the city can properly conclude that our location complies.  Very similar arguments that were presented tonight.  But I think, again, the one thing that differentiates us from some of the other applicants is we reached out.  We physically visited the community.  We confirmed that Funland was closed.  And therefore, we had confidence that we could move forward given the fact that business was no longer operational.  So we really have three options before us.  I think our options are very similar to what the previous speakers had presented,  which is option number one, you grant our appeal, we move forward, and we can open in that location.  That's probably not likely to happen tonight, and we realize that.  What I would like to present is really the second option, which we feel is the best for the city.  And that is that if we are allowed to proceed forward in the process, we have no intention of holding up the process.  We have an alternative building that we could operate out of.  We would just like the ability to continue on the process.  As was mentioned by your counsel, you guys have an immense amount of discretion and the authority to make decisions  and take each situation on its value.  And that's what we're presenting before you.  This promotes a fair process.  It avoids potential disputes in the future.  And it allows a group of floor, which hopefully I've at least been able to briefly articulate, would be a good partner for the city.  It allows us to move forward.  And that's really all we're asking for is the ability to continue in the process.  And keep our application in queue and go ahead and go on to the next step.  So I appreciate your time and thank you for your consideration.  All right.  Thank you.  Questions?  So actually, we have a couple of questions for you, if you don't mind.  Sir, what was the date that you submitted your application?  I want to say it was September or July 14th.  Sorry.  I was going to flip through that, but I can't find it.  And then what was the date that you first noticed that Funland was open?  That was you.  I will say this.  It was close enough to the time where we really couldn't pivot and scramble and resubmit an application.  That's as close as I can give you at the moment.  Okay.  Thank you.  So along those lines, did you have any contact with the ownership of Funland?  We actually, after we were denied.  Prior to?  Prior to that, no.  We reached out by phone, by email.  We physically visited the site three different times.  It was crickets.  I personally visited the site.  It looked like a ghost town.  I mean, we attributed that to COVID, but the way that place looked optically, it seemed like there was no intent to reopen.  And I think actually you guys had discussed that early on, maybe in February, about if a business was closed during the process, that potentially that could not trigger the sensitive use.  I don't know that that ever, it wasn't really, I don't think, an official adoption or anything, but I do remember it coming up in some notes that we had reviewed.  So there was at least some thought to the aspect of a business.  But you didn't have contact with the business owner?  Prior to our denial of the appeal, no.  Once the appeal was denied, we obviously went, like our other applicants, into sort of crisis mode, figuring out was this even a youth center or what was the age groups that were there.  I think, again, I emphasize that most of our premise on this was based on the fact that that business was non-operational.  Okay.  But, I mean, they didn't have a for sale sign or a for lease sign?  No, but it was, there was like tumbleweeds in the parking lot.  There was nothing going on there.  They didn't even have limited duty.  Well, I mean, I think that's a good point.  Well, no, they were closed for COVID, obviously.  Yeah.  But, I mean, it was over the period of the year.  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah, my business is closed for a year and a half, so I can simplify this.  Yeah.  So, all right.  Any other questions?  All right.  Thank you.  Sure.  Thank you.  All right.  Any speakers?  We have three speakers.  Okay.  The first one is Mary Sakuma.  All right.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you. Good evening, Mayor Coolidge, members of the City Council and all of the city staff. Thank you for giving me a few minutes of your time this evening. For approximately 20 years,  We'll pass it over to Mary.  We'll pass it over to Mary.  We'll pass it over to Mary.  We'll pass it over to Mary.  We'll pass it over to Mary.  We'll pass it over to Mary.  160 feet of the proposed cannabis location.  So I think all of you probably received a copy of the letter that I sent to you.  I will acknowledge that we erroneously stated that you had previously ruled on this,  and now I understand that it was the city staff that makes the initial decision in regard to denying the permit.  I would like to just point out that about seven years ago or so,  we purchased the property at the adjacent site, which is 2491 Carmichael Drive,  and with the intent that over time we would have the flexibility of serving students of all ages in that facility.  And in fact, we are awaiting some of our tenants,  to leave that facility so that we can expand some of the services that we have available in Chico for students and youth.  So I would just respectfully request that you consider that situation.  We are an entity that operates on the regular in that area.  And while, yes, we were closed for many months due to COVID,  we have always had the intent to continue operating.  And so, again, I would just request that you uphold the decision of the city staff in your consideration.  At Butte County Office of Education, our motto is where students come first.  And so I respectfully request that you put students first in your decision this evening.  Thank you.  The next speaker is Ginger Thomas, followed by Jessica Giannola.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Again, my name is Ginger, and I just had a question.  And I wanted to present to the council after listening to all these appeals is, you know,  especially this last gentleman, people have spent so much time, so much money trying to figure out where should I be?  What are we going to do about this in the future to where there is one source of place of information where someone could find out  or do what they want to do?  We need a list of special use businesses.  How do we meet in the middle on this?  Because this is literally two sides not seeing eye to eye and people being penalized on a lot of expenditures based on things that they didn't have foresight on.  And I just don't think that that's fair.  So I just wanted to stand up here and present to you the idea that there needs to be some centralized information on zoning, on special use, on decisions.  Because if we're going to open the door to these businesses and we all seem like we want to do it the right way, how do we all stay on the same page?  So do we need a task force?  Do we need zoning to touch?  It just seems like there's a lot of this going on.  And it seems like these applications are just a toss of the bucket and whatever wants to make it in are the ones that get lucky enough.  So I know that if you open up the manufacturing process, I'm going to be the one to make it in.  I'm going to do due diligence and do my homework.  And I hope that if I do get an application in, it's in the right place.  But I just want to bring to the attention of all of you that there is no one place.  And I have made many attempts to figure out where do you start.  And, you know, I've emailed you.  I spoke to the city this morning.  And sensitive use has never come up once until I joined this meeting.  I have gone on the city website.  And I have looked at the zoning maps.  And I have zoned in.  And I have printed them in many different shapes to find out where would I look for a building if I were to have an application and I were to have a business.  I don't have a solution.  But I just wanted to leave that with you.  So thanks for letting me speak again.  And I look forward to helping this community feel at their best.  And Jessica Giannola is our last speaker.  Okay.  So I just watched all the applications.  And I'm pretty much begged for a second chance for a shot at their business here in Chico.  And it seemed from listening to them that every single one of them did their homework.  They spoke and engaged with the city.  They tried very, very hard to follow the letter of the boundaries we have for Chico and where they can put their business.  It's the application and it's denied for sensitive populations within an area.  That they were unaware of.  Because the definitions seem to keep changing depending on the personal feelings or political feelings on maybe it's just cannabis in general.  And that's not truly fair to the businesses, the people of the city who have done their homework.  This failure here seems to have fallen upon the city and the miscommunication on what is the definition and how are we going to follow it.  If you have a clear definition, then it's easy to follow.  It's too muddled right now.  So I think the right thing to do at this point is to allow the applicants to resubmit their application with an address that you have approved.  Instead of shutting them out and saying, nope, sorry, you got it wrong.  Too bad, so sad.  Because that's what I'm hearing from the city right now.  There's no allowance for them.  And I agreed with Casey on that.  The one with the zoning.  Your zoning doesn't even call this site for children.  And really, children are everywhere.  So it kind of reminds me of other topics that we've had in the city.  Nope, not there, not there, not there.  Because people exist everywhere.  The arcade at Roundtable, well, there are a lot of kids there.  So yeah, are we considering that a youth center?  What about the grocery store?  Kids are always in there.  They're with their parents.  Is that going to be off limits?  So we have to use these clear boundaries.  We have to use these clear boundaries for people who are applying for a business.  They can run their business.  And it's not up for I don't know, sorry.  So I think it's fair to the people of your city to do that.  And if we've identified now there's a mistake in how we're defining it, give them another chance.  Let them get the right address so they can move to the next level.  This is their business.  This is their livelihood.  We should be doing that for our people.  These are our people.  Thank you.  All right.  Okay.  And then rebuttal by the applicant.  Three minutes.  If you so choose to respond to anything that was mentioned.  No rebuttal.  I appreciate the community reaching out as well.  I think, again, I just would like to reiterate, not only for myself but the other applicants, this is not something that is unique to Chico.  There's been plenty of other municipalities.  We've been in this business for 15 years.  We've seen it.  We've done it.  There's plenty of municipalities with the discretion and authority that the city council has to midstream in the process when there are hiccups, when there are identified issues that are not perfect and we're all trying to figure this out together.  We work together, figure out a solution.  There's only four of us that have been denied.  It's not a big lift for the city to allow for to find another piece of property in a short period of time.  I think everyone probably has the ability.  We have the ability to do that.  In fact, several, ourselves included, have already put forth that effort to accomplish it.  I don't think it's going to be an impediment to your process.  So, again, respectfully just ask that maybe you could consider allowing the four of us to resubmit, stay in step with the rest of the process, not delay it, and have the opportunity to just go to the next level.  Thank you.  All right.  Thank you very much.  And then close the public hearing.  Council discussion.  There's no discussion.  I'll make a motion to deny the appeal.  I'll second it, but I'll follow it with a little bit of discussion.  While we had one that was a little vague and one that was pretty clear, this one to me, I'm born and raised in Chico.  I've been here my whole life.  I've been going to Cal Skate since I was six years old.  Like, I know what happens at Cal Skate and how many students are there.  The fact that the Board of Education is literally the only one that's going to be able to do that.  I mean, your building is here.  The L that is behind it is the Board of Education.  So it's been on the door.  It's advertised there.  I just think, I don't know if that was overlooked or what.  And then to follow that up, Cal Skate during summer times, even if you say, well, there's adult skating there, too, and everything else, and I'm not sure if everybody here is aware, but during summer time, they actually hold daycare slash school there all day long.  So people drop off their kids at 8 o'clock in the morning, and they're there until.  You know, 5 o'clock at night.  So this isn't, to me, when you talk about the legislative intent or what's behind children and primarily children use, like, literally, Cal Skate is the one youth, primarily youth area that we have in our community.  And I just have a huge place in my heart to really protect our kids.  And not that your places look amazing.  You do beautiful things.  I'm not saying that you would be pandering to kids or anything like that.  But I just think we need to follow the intent of the law in this one, in my opinion.  All right.  Further comment?  Motion and second?  Take the roll.  Council Member Bennett?  No.  Excuse me.  .  .  Yes.  .  .  Yes.  Council Member Brown?  Aye.  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Right.  Right.  Right.  Right.  Right. Velvet Chico, LLC. And ex parte communications. I do have one on this one. The applicant did contact me and shared their frustration The applicant did contact me and shared their frustration and I said, I'm the wrong person to talk to, you need to talk to Angie. And I believe Angie and Vince took it over there  I met with the property owner and also at some point a representative from the business,  but I believe it was back in December, so that could be noted.  All right, staff report.  Time's four.  Okay.  Thank you, Honorable Mayor, members of the council, to the city staff assembled here,  and members of the public assembled here today, and those watching this meeting virtually.  I'm Vincent Ewing, the city attorney, and I'm here to present to you agenda item 4.5,  appeal hearing regarding denial of commercial cannabis application Velvet Chico.  I will not recite the process that the city staff went through,  as it is the same for all four of the appeals that you have heard today.  This is the last.  The city staff ultimately decided to deny Velvet Chico the zoning approval,  and phase two of this process.  There is one slide, however, that I want to bring to your attention.  I will go through the chronology of that slide.  It is before you on the screen.  On June 17th, 2021, step-by-step childcare of Chico Daycare submits a Department of Social Services  family daycare home license application.  On July 13th, 2021, daycare received positive report after unannounced inspection by DSM.  On July 16th, 2021, Velvet Chico submitted retail cannabis application.  On July 19th, the daycare was issued a provisional daycare license by DSS.  In September 2021, the daycare was issued a permanent license by DSS for up to eight children,  as well as a business license from the city of Chico for A, childcare, B, tutoring,  C, care, and D, education.  We went through drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug  to sensitive views.  And then you have photographs  on these slides of the location  that I just described to you as the  child care center, or child  care location.  Questions?  Well,  I'll wait until after the  Any other questions?  So just for clarification,  if  they submitted an application,  they're not actually  a daycare yet, correct?  They've submitted  so I'm going on the  timeline. So on June  17th they've submitted, on 13th  they got a positive report  by DSS, but they actually weren't  issued a license until July  19th.  Right.  So the DSS  determination, that's a separate  determination by DSS.  DSS, the  discretion that the  city staff exercised in reviewing  this application was  done so. So you have the  planning staff, you have the city attorney  staff who took a look at this and we  determined that this was a sensitive  use. And we ultimately don't make  the call as a city. DSS makes  the call on when it is a child care.  Gotcha. Thank you.  All right.  Okay. Any further  questions? Thank you.  All right. So we'll  move on and  open the public  hearing and  the applicant has 15 minutes.  And please  state your name for us as you come up.  Mr. Mayor,  council members, first of all  thank you for taking the time to speak to us.  We're very excited to hear our appeal.  My name is Matt Moore. I'm one of the co-founders  of Velvet Cannabis. With me  tonight is our general counsel, Jason  Molinelli, co-founder Vince Blatney  and our local community development  partner, Alex Kriz.  I wanted to just share  I'll be brief. I know it's been a long  night, but I just wanted to share a little bit about who we  are and what we represent and can  potentially bring to the community up here.  I had the privilege of  spending four years up here going to college.  It's great to be back up here and  we're really excited about that.  We're really excited about the opportunity to bring  Vet the Velvet brand up to the community.  I think there's three major things I want to highlight  with why we believe we'll be a good partner.  Today we operate a dispensary in Martinez, California.  We have the opportunity to partner with  the planning department and the council of Martinez  as they were going through this exact process.  And this is a tough process and we certainly don't  envy the position any of you are in.  We also recognize the direct benefits that the  bringing cannabis to communities like Chico represents.  And I'll highlight it in really three ways.  Number one, it's through job growth.  We've currently got 74 employees.  We pay 25.6% higher than the average in the industry.  It leads to tremendous retention, employee engagement,  and ultimately a much better customer experience,  which allows businesses like ours to thrive.  We provide benefits to all of our full-time employees.  There's profit sharing.  We won last year second place nationally for best companies  to work for for cannabis retailers.  We take a lot of pride in the people that we employ.  We also hire 100% locally.  And that really brings a sense of pride and ownership  to what we do.  I think the second aspect that I want to highlight  for all of you is the direct community involvement.  And the first piece of that, in addition to job growth,  would be revenue generation.  Martinez location will do well in excess of $26 million this year.  We are currently on track to pay over $1.6 million  directly into the general fund through a development agreement  that we worked together to draft with the city of Martinez.  It allows the city to conquer some of the challenges  that are no different than some of what we saw coming in here tonight.  And in a time when so many small businesses and tax revenues  have been impacted by COVID,  we think this is a really significant step  and a really important thing for you to consider  with whoever you move forward.  I think the third piece that I would point out  about our unique organization is our commitment to the community.  So we have the Velvet Foundation.  It's a 501 foundation.  And we've got full-time staff whose primary responsibility  is to get engaged, outreach with the cities and the communities  that we serve, and identify real local problems  that are top of mind for not only the councils and the city staff,  but also the communities in which we operate in.  We would love to have the opportunity  to continue through the process.  I'm going to allow Jason to highlight the merits of our appeal  and why we believe we should stay in the hunt.  And I just want to say that we're encouraged by the opportunity,  and we really look forward to being able to bring  not only the Velvet brand, but the contribution that we make  to the community here to the folks of Chico.  Mr. Mayor, council members,  staff, thank you for this opportunity to hear us out.  We submitted a brief.  As you're well aware, it's in front of you there.  It was 12 pages plus 20-plus pages in exhibits.  It's a lot to digest.  In light of that, we have brought today with us,  which is now in front of you, a PowerPoint presentation  in paper form, which is comprised of six slides.  And they're all in the form of a PowerPoint presentation.  And those six slides, I think, really sum up what our position is  and why we're here asking you to reconsider the denial  of our application.  Page two is just a slide, very short,  talking a little bit about what you just heard from Mr. Moray.  Page three, a little bit more of the same with some pictures  of the folks here and some of the other driving forces  behind Velvet, Chico, LLC.  One thing I'd like to note, like you heard from the prior appellant,  Group O'Flor, every person on that page is a parent,  myself included.  And so, obviously, we take very seriously the intent of this community,  every community in the state and the state itself of protecting our minors  and youth from overexposure to cannabis, to alcohol, to all substances.  Moving on to page four.  This is getting more into the substance.  What it says, Velvet, we submitted an application for a dispensary permit  with the proposed premises location at 1914 Oleander here in town.  There's a picture there of what the building looks in its present form.  Following review of our application, as you know, staff determined the location  to be inconsistent with the minimum safety buffer requirements of Chico  and of the state.  They mirror one another because it's located 528 feet from step-by-step childcare,  a daycare.  And on that basis, it denied our application.  And so, this is a little different than the other applications.  This is a little different than the three prior issues that were before this  dais.  In fact, this is been categorized as a daycare center, not a youth center,  not a school providing education to K through 12.  Turning to page five, we contend that step-by-step childcare is not a daycare  center within the meaning of the Chico Municipal Code or the state's  health and safety code.  On page five, the definition out of the Muni Code here at 1975-120 B1EA2  describes that a retailer storefront must be at least 600 feet from a daycare center  or a youth center or a school.  And that at B2C,  I'm sorry,  and those are sensitive receptors, sensitive uses at state law.  The Muni Code here refers to them as sensitive receptors.  And moving on down to 2C in the same section,  that only sensitive receptors in existence at the time the city receives the cannabis permit  should be considered prohibitive.  And so, our argument is two points.  First and foremost, that,  step-by-step childcare is not a daycare center,  again, within the meaning of the code,  state or municipal.  Step-by-step childcare has a family daycare home permit issued by the state of California.  And now, based on staff's presentation by the city of Chico,  the municipal code at 1975-020 subsection V,  defines daycare center as the same meaning as you would find in the Health and Safety Code,  and includes any childcare, child daycare facility other than a family daycare home.  So the municipal code,  and by the way, the Health and Safety Code has mirror language.  So both the municipal code and the Health and Safety Code exclude a family daycare home,  from the meaning of daycare.  And it's on that basis that we would say,  and ask that this council find that,  step-by-step childcare is not a daycare,  within the meaning of the municipal code,  thus not a sensitive receptor.  And for that reason, our application should be returned to consideration.  I did a lot of research,  and I found that there was a lot of confusion  to the legislative history behind this section at the state level,  because again, the language is the same.  Trying to drill down on why this section excludes a family daycare home  from the definition of daycare center.  I couldn't find any.  Well, there's plenty, but nothing to really give an answer to that.  Seems reasonable that  all the other daycare center, youth center, school, K through 12,  there are many, many children there.  And that would create a greater potential exposure,  a larger amount of kids.  And by the way, similar to Mr. Dykstra,  whether you view the outside of a velvet store from one foot 600 feet,  or from the other side of,  the world on Google Earth,  there's no indication of cannabis.  You would never know there's cannabis inside.  In any event, the intent would seem to be that  because a family daycare home is eight kids,  in this instance, a small family daycare home would be four children,  that to find those also as daycare would create a slippery slope  where there would be no suitable,  suitable locations for cannabis uses,  because there would be no safety buffer.  Like the other applicants,  we did a lot of research to identify any potential sensitive uses,  sensitive receptors in 600 feet within that area.  Then we found none,  but there are many other businesses,  a Starbucks, Big Al's Drive-In,  the Matador Motel.  And at any given time,  those may likely have four to eight children there too.  And so in that respect,  then the exclusion of a family daycare home from the definition of a daycare center seems reasonable.  If in the event that the council determines that it is a daycare,  within the meaning of the municipal code and the health and safety code,  we contend that if we,  if we have a family daycare home permit,  it was not in existence at the time that we submitted our application.  As staff's PowerPoint showed,  we submitted our application on July 16th, 2021.  Step by step,  we received its family daycare home permit from California on July 19th,  three days after it received its family daycare home permit from the city of Chico in September,  a month or so after.  And for that reason,  we would say that even if it were a daycare care center,  and it clearly is excluded from the definition of one that even if it were,  if it was not in existence at the time that we submitted our application,  that should not be considered prohibitive and ask that you consider returning us to the application process.  Thank you very much.  We'll reserve the last three minutes for rebuttal.  All right.  Well,  you'll get an extra three minutes if you want to use the rest of that.  So,  all right.  Okay.  Any speakers on this?  We have one,  Ginger Thomas.  All right.  This is the last time I'll pass to you this evening.  I just wanted to say this.  I graduated high school in 1997.  I registered to vote.  I was a student at the University of California,  so that I could sign the proposition for 215.  I've been fighting for cannabis rights for our patients since I was eligible to vote.  I am a single mom.  My daughter goes to Buick College,  and my son just graduated from PV.  I moved here when my children were in kindergarten and second grade because I wanted to take them to a city where I could raise them in a well family environment.  That being said,  I also took my children to the courthouse to protest for patients.  And I would roll up with poster boards and write signs.  And I have let my children understand the need for medicine for the community since they were knee-high to a grasshopper.  Neither one of my children started smoking weed during high school at all.  And I'm very proud to say that to you.  And I say that to you because I want you to know that education and knowledge is power.  If we teach our children that it is okay to use cannabis as medicine,  which it is for people who need it in situations that it is needed,  they will do the right thing.  Now,  we have an epidemic going with the vape pots.  They're being sold everywhere.  There's pictures of them all over 7-Eleven windows.  And that's okay.  We've denied a permit near the round table,  but the Unwind bar is right next door.  And it's okay to sell alcohol and have titles about alcohol right next to the same establishment.  On top of that,  we discussed round table and having pizza parties for children,  which my dad was president of Pop Warner, by the way.  I spent a lot of board meetings at round tables in Sonoma County.  But that being said,  you can still go get a pitcher of beer at the soccer party.  So what are we really teaching our children?  If we keep making this about cannabis,  then it's just going to be about this.  But the whole issue is cannabis is so much more than this.  So why are we lumping it up with that?  And I just want to say this.  I'm sorry,  y'all aren't going to like this.  But part of the cannabis industry is we have big bank accounts.  And we don't have people with big hearts.  We waited this long in Chico to open the door to cannabis.  Let's keep local business owners.  If you let business industries like this come in,  you're going to have the problems that you didn't want.  Thank you.  That's it?  Yes.  Yes.  Yeah.  Thank you.  All right.  Appellant gets three minute rebuttal if they so choose.  No.  All right.  Questions?  Sure.  So we'll close the public hearing,  move on to further questions.  Thank you.  Council Member Brown?  Yeah.  I was hoping that staff could speak to what I would say is a pretty compelling argument  about the health and safety code and its exclusion of family daycare homes  from the definition of daycare center.  I'll just first share that we coordinated really closely with the staff  and the city attorney's office.  And one of the PowerPoint slides I think tries to speak to that issue.  It's the one about proximity to sensitive use.  And while it does highlight the nuance that they shared about the terminology,  the final two bullet points highlight that under the same chapter,  a child daycare facility is defined by law as a, quote,  a facility that provides non-medical care to children under 18 years of age that, quote,  again, includes daycare centers, employer-sponsored child care centers,  and a family daycare home and family daycare homes.  And then the nuance is highlighted that by holding a DSS license,  the daycare in question falls within the category of a daycare center.  So that was the conclusion that was reached.  There apparently are some little nuances in there.  But looked at in its totality, the conclusion was that it does meet that sensitivity use determination.  Again, the city's goal in adopting its ordinance and its codes was to mirror state law.  And so that's what we feel is happening here.  Again, that was, you know, I do see the nuances.  And there's the timing of some of these applications to DSS.  This is not something, you know, we tried to be as clinical as we could in this process and coordinate.  So that's just where we landed.  Thank you.  All right.  Further questions from staff or discussion?  Motion?  I would just say this one, I'm inclined to support the appeal.  Given the timeline issues, given the language nuances,  given that four to eight minors would be present at this particular business type  and the conversation around where four to eight minors may have the opportunity,  where four to eight minors would otherwise be,  and given that it's nearly 600 feet from the use in questions, 500, what, 80 something,  for me, I think this is one that I would approve.  So I'll agree with that in a second, though.  So further discussion?  Take the roll.  That's a motion by Councilmember Brown and a second by me.  Yep.  Councilmember Bennett?  Rather than yes or no, which has not been working all that well sometimes,  I do support the appeal.  Clear.  Councilmember Brown?  Aye.  Councilmember O'Brien?  No.  Councilmember Tandon?  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds?  Aye.  And Mayor Coolidge?  Aye.  Carries 5-1.  All right.  All right, with that, we're going to move on to our regular agenda,  which we have nothing posted after the agenda,  so we're going to move to reports and communications,  city manager reports.  Yes, honorable mayor, members of the council, thank you very much.  I think this is on.  Just a quick one.  I just want to acknowledge that there's been a tremendous effort underway  way out at our airport for quite some time.  The fire season was dramatic, and has been year after year,  and I just want to commend one of our vendors up there,  Northgate Aviation, supplied the fuel necessary for all of those tankers  coming in and out.  I think it goes without saying that we don't acknowledge some of the vendors  that we rely upon at our facilities as often as we probably should,  so I just wanted to publicly state that I really appreciate the support,  the effort,  the consistent  professionalism that they show to ensure  that those folks who are coming into our airport  are fueled adequately and have the  supply ready for these times of need.  So with that, that's all I've got tonight. Thank you very much.  I love that, but I have a quick question for you,  Mr. Orme.  I'm getting asked  a lot of questions about the redistricting process  by the public, and I was just curious  if there was any brief update  about that process, the timeline associated  with it that could be provided?  Yeah, good question.  I think it's all on all of our minds right now.  So I'm going to pass that over to City Attorney Ewing  for the latest update on that.  Thank you.  Thank you, City Manager  Orme and  Council Member Brown.  A solicitation has been  issued for the redistricting  process.  I wasn't prepared for this, so I don't have it in front of me,  but the RFP is online.  It has the dates that  it opened and it closed,  and we have received  it is closed, I know that much  because I happened to talk about it today,  and we received one proposal.  The next step will be the scoring  process. There's a scoring team  that's assembled. It consists  of myself, Mr. Orme, and Ms. Presson,  and then once that is scored, a recommendation  will be made to the council to  move forward either with  the proposer or some other  process. You're welcome.  All right. So we'll move  on to council member requests for  AP and P1010. Council members  may verbally request an item  to be agendized at a future meeting after stating  what the item would be. A majority vote of the council  is needed in order to staff to agendize. Council members  may also submit requests in writing.  Council member  Morgan made a request,  but he's not here, so I'd be happy  this one and another, but I'd be happy  to  push his request forward because I did have  back and forth kind of with Scott.  Kennelly from the director of Butte County  Behavioral Health, so  I think Sean and I  both agree on this, that  we'd like to have a presentation by  him here, and then  possibly, you know, instead of doing our  original letter, look at doing something  you know, in  combination with the county and maybe some of our  current legislators to push forward an effort  perhaps for  you know, something more  related to getting people to  direct care through  the process of  you know, conservancy or something along  those lines.  So that would be the first request.  So I concur with that. I think  the more information we have on these  issues, the better. I completely concur.  Yep.  I genuinely appreciate the effort  to make sure we're doing our due diligence  and get some clarity and  especially to see a letter that captures  both the nature of the issue and our  community context, so  I'll support it.  I just think my draft may not have been the  best draft, so.  So, all right.  So is that a motion and a second?  That's a yes.  All right. And second? All right.  So we have a motion and a second.  Take the roll. Council Member Bennett. This is an easy one, yes. Council Member Brown. Council Member O'Brien. Yes. Council Member Tandon. Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds.  Vice Mayor Reynolds. Aye.  Vice Mayor Reynolds. Aye.  Mayor Coolidge. Aye.  Carries 6-0. All right. My second is  probably just as easy, but we'll see where it goes.  So, you know, I'm glad to see us moving forward with the  Spenceries, which I supported,  but I think it is time. We did mention that  we left out an element and that  at some point we would need to reconsider that,  which is the manufacturer protection side.  So I would like to see us bring  that back forward to council to see if we can get that back.  So I would like to see us bring that back forward to council to see if we can get that back.  Point of clarification.  I'm so sorry.  Was that a second?  I'll let that happen.  It's not the only element that we left out,  so I just wanted to double check.  Is revisiting deliveries, testing,  manufacturing, and distribution all in here?  Yeah, I think we can approach all of those,  at least in terms of a discussion.  Okay. I'll support it.  All right.  I'll second with that whole thing.  Oh, I didn't make the motion, so you can make the motion  if you so choose.  I'll second.  All right. So we have a motion by Councilmember Tandon  and a second by Councilmember Brown.  And take the roll.  Councilmember Tandon.  Yes.  Councilmember Brown.  Aye.  Councilmember O'Brien.  I'm willing to discuss, so yes.  Councilmember Tandon. Yes.  All right.  .  .  .  .  All right.  Okay.  So from there, we have the sunshine  negotiation proposals.  It's information only.  We will receive and file, and then we'll move into closed session.  Do we have any public comments or council?  Well, public comments on closed session?  Oh, wow.  I'm in an empty room.  So probably not.  And then any council disqualifications?  All right.  Thank you very much.  We're adjourned.  .  .  .  .  .  .  .
