 Chair Wall. Clear. Thank you. Okay, speaker card announcement. Anyone wishing to address the planning commission on any item listed on the agenda must first complete a speaker card, which can be found in the back of the chamber. Once completed, please turn the cards into Nicole. Speakers are taken in the order. The cards are received, and once the first speaker begins their comments, no additional cards will be accepted on that item. Move on to the consent agenda. Do I hear any comments or a motion? I'll motion to approve. Hear a second somewhere? Second. We have a motion and a second. Clerk, would you call the roll? Commissioner Wolfe. I'll abstain. I wasn't present. Commissioner Poulin. I'll sustain as well. Since I was. Senator. Commissioner Laffins. Yes. Commissioner Cooper. I have a question. You're approving the minutes. Yes. Chair Wall. Clear. Yes. Yes. I'm a little confused. Okay. The approval of the minutes of the last meeting we just finished. So, on a public comment side, members of the public may address the Commission at this time on any matter not already listed on the agenda. With comments being limited to three minutes, the Commission cannot take any action at this meeting on requests made under this section of the agenda. That was for information only. Now we're going to public hearings. Do we have any expertate communications to report? Okay. We have a staff presentation. We have a staff presentation. On the development agreement 2301, Casino Chico, 325 Broadway, APM 004151010000. A condition of approval for use permitted in 22-09. Good evening, everyone. I'm Kelly Murphy, senior planner. I'll be providing just a brief verbal report tonight on the first agenda item. As you may recall, earlier this year, the Commission considered and approved a use permit request to establish a seven-table card room in the downtown North Zoning District at 325 Broadway. As part of the project, the applicant proposed a voluntary annual contribution to the City of Chico equivalent to 5% of gross receipts generated from card game participation fees for the benefit of the downtown area. The City Attorney's Office determined that the application was not a voluntary contribution.

The DA requires approval by the City Council so staff is seeking the Planning Commission's recommendation to the Council on the proposed DA. Staff recommends approving the development agreement as it would facilitate an approved project that has previously been determined to meet all required findings of approval including consistency with the general plan and municipal code. So that will conclude my presentation. Is there any questions? I believe we have the City Attorney's office, Marina, on the line if there's any questions specifically relating to the development agreement language itself. Otherwise I can try to answer anything you might have on your mind. I got a quick question. Is the five percent just for the downtown area or is it just going to the General Fund? It would go just to the General Fund. Kelly, I've got a question. Sure. Just in general on the agreement. The agreement, well development agreements are usually a quid pro quo. You know, so here we've got an offer of possibly a lot of money to the City. What is the developer's benefit of this agreement? It is true that we are not giving anything in exchange for this contribution. This was John Scott's voluntary idea as a long-term community member and business owner to help the downtown as part of his business proposal. It was not a requirement of the use permit until we made it a condition of approval. Okay. I have a couple more questions actually. Maybe there, I don't know if there are more for you or for the City Attorney. I just had some questions about about about! some of the verbiage in the agreement. Wanting to make sure that we understand what it contains or what I'm wondering if I can make sure. Sure. I would probably refer that to Marina. So, if she's on the line. What can I just go ahead and pose the question and then we'll see. On the page nine, section 2.3, it states that the agreement applies not only to the approved project but to sort in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in that she's able to speak. One of my colleagues who has assisted in drafting this particular agreement. I'm not sure specifically as to whether or not those intentions were for something specific. So I can certainly ask another colleague of mine who has assisted in that drafting on what the intentions were for the subsequent approvals that you have asked about. I've got another question on page 10, section 2.8. It states that the agreement would be that in the event that any future unforeseen public health or safety emergencies occur arises, city agrees that it shall attempt to address such emergency in such a way as to not impact the development in accordance with the development approvals. And if that is not possible to select the option for addressing the emergency, which has the least adverse impact on the development in accordance with the development approvals. And I'm wondering if that would, that language would necessarily limit the city's ability to respond appropriately. To some future public health or safety emergency. I don't know that necessarily applies to this project, but it's in the agreement. So I'm just wondering what that tie the city's hands if something serious happened, would we be limited in terms of what the city could do? I will again, probably have Marina chime in here, but to my knowledge, a lot of this is standard language that we use in our development agreements. And we work with Scott Nichols directly on the development of the development agreements. And he's been working with us on the development agreement on several iterations, honestly, paring it down as this development agreement really is about just the one thing and that's the annual contribution. So I might agree with you that some of the language doesn't apply to this project. All right. Yeah, I was just, as I said, just concerned that we're kind of prejudging what the response would be from the city's perspective on a public health emergency. Did Marina want to comment at all? Yeah, so I will also follow up on with my colleague on that particular question to confirm what that language is intended to mean. Just things I think to think about before we get to the council and stamp the final stamp on this. Let's see, something else here. Page 13, section 3.5. It starts off with the parties acknowledge that although development will likely require subsequent development approvals and then goes on. And I'm wondering if that's just left over for some other agreement or if there is something pending out there with this project that needs to be a subject of this agreement. The card room is the only known development proposal. Okay, so there aren't any subsequent development approvals that we're anticipating? No. Okay. All right. And I have one more question. It's on page 16. Starting with the second line. This is kind of catching it mid-paragraph, so my apologies. But it in effect says, should this agreement terminate for any reason, then such termination, and there's some dot, dot, dots in there. There's some verbage I'm not getting to. But if this agreement terminates for any reason, this agreement or any part hereof shall not affect the validity or effectiveness of any such project approvals or other land use approvals and entitlements. And I'm wondering if that means, in effect, if the development agreement is terminated. And I guess the only subject here is really the land use. And I think, you know, Mr. Scott contributing money to the city, if that agreement is, this development agreement is terminated, does the use permit persist? Or is this directly tied to the use permit in that respect? Does it mean the use permit automatically is rescinded or it can just go on? This seems to suggest that they're two completely separate things and that termination wouldn't affect the use permit. Is that right? Yeah. Mr. Chair, from the planning staff's perspective, that would be correct. The use permit runs with the land. So that would be our standpoint. The city attorney may have more to add. But from a planning standpoint, the use permit would run with the land and they would be separate. And I'm touching on some pretty esoteric stuff here, so I apologize for that. But I'm just looking out in the future in the, and I can't imagine the scenario, but in a scenario where, for whatever reason, the development agreement is terminated, and the use permit was approved based upon the presumption that the city was going to get a certain something out of the project, this would seem to be an issue. That was, and maybe the city attorney has any comment on that as well? Like to hear? Yeah. So again, I'm, I am listing down all of these questions because they are very specific. I'm just trying to make sure that I'm not missing anything. I am basing in on basing in on basing in on basing in on bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas bas could see it being reasonable the use permit would have to be revisited for a reconsideration of conditions of approval as that was a component of the project presented to you. If for whatever reason the DA ceased to exist, I think the use permit would have to come back for reconsideration without that component. I see. Okay. Great. That was it for my questions, and thank you for your patience. Thank you, Mark. If you wanted to tell me those sections, I got most of them, but I might have missed the first one. Thank you. Appreciate it. Those are a bunch of good questions, but we don't have answers for it. Is it reasonable to postpone or to table this to another time? Is that your desire? No, it's not necessarily my desire, Mr. Chair. I think that the questions are going to be addressed by the city attorney and staff before it gets to the council, and that's fine. I just wanted to kind of, I was reading through it, and I was like, huh, what does this mean? And thank you. I was thinking about scenarios in the future and wanted to get some clarity, and maybe by the time it gets to the council, some of this stuff is addressed. I just didn't want it to get lost in the shuffle at all. Okay. Good. Anybody else have comments or questions? I do have a couple. One, there are no other use permits similar to this downtown at all, are there? There's a couple in the outlying areas that require a contribution, but none of them are used for the purpose of the city. Is there a contribution to the city that is not used for the purpose of the city? Yeah, the only other land use I am thinking of is our cannabis storefront retailers. Okay. As part of their city permit that they got through the city manager's office, they had to provide the community benefits package, and that included annual contributions of gross receipts. Now, if he's being required to make a contribution and the money's going into the general fund, that doesn't quite square with the fact that the city has a lot of money. That is supposed to be used for downtown general improvement and upkeep. Yeah, and I think you could look at it a couple different ways. The general fund, I believe, you know, pays a lot of the salaries. We could, you know, pay for increased police officers or some contribution that may indirectly benefit the downtown, but I don't think that there's a specific way to funnel that money into the downtown. Okay. If this is considered, a contribution, then could Mr. Scott work his way out of contributing that money at some point in the future? No. It is a condition of his use permit, and so therefore, not meeting all his conditions of approval, he would not be able to continue with his business, the card room. It would require an amendment to the use permit. It would require an amendment to the use permit. It would be a process after that. Or it would be noncompliant. But does it require a DA agreement? We did condition the project, and it wasn't a requirement of the use permit, but once it was proposed, the DA was the only mechanism we had to make sure that that actually happened. And that's why it's coming to you subsequently. Okay. And the cannabis community contributions, those go to the general fund as well? Yes. And they have a similar development agreement? I would say more robust, certainly, but yes. Okay. And that was a requirement. That was a requirement of their multiple licensing through the city, whereas this was a voluntary proposal. Why is this considered a contribution as opposed to an assessment or a tax? I wouldn't say that's my realm of expertise, if you wanted to ask the city attorney. Are you able to answer that? Sure. Marina, chair. I just observed that this was something that was proposed. It was proposed by the applicant, so it's not something that's... I understand that, but it's a contribution, but yet it's more than a contribution. It's an assessment in reality or a tax in reality. I find that unusual, and I'm sure Mr. Scott will explain his thoughts on that in a little bit. Just kind of thinking as I'm talking here. Are there other avenues to where this could go, like into a CMD instead of the general fund, so it could stay with the downtown area? I'm not sure. I could follow up for you, though, for sure. Okay. If there's nothing else, then we'll move on to opening the public hearing. Do we have any speakers signed up? We do not. Wait, what? We do not have any speakers for this project. Okay. Well, I will ask Mr. Scott if he'd like to come up and say a word or two. Sure. Good evening. Appreciate your time. I know this has been a lot of repeated visits, and I'm in a great appreciation. And I'd like to give special thanks to Kelly, who has worked her butt off on this for a long time. And I've really come to... respect her skills, and I'd like to feel we've kind of developed a friendship as we've gotten to know each other. The question that I heard you pose was, why wasn't this just a tax? And the answer to that is that taxes, you know, Californians get kind of worked up about that, and it requires a vote. And an election to put a tax on one business is expensive to the city, and it's not needed, because I'm not fighting that. I've lived here since May 15, 1978. Had a whole lot more hair back then. I've raised my family here. I've got grandchildren now. In short, this is my community. I've been here since I was 19, and this will be where I die. So anything that I can do that helps my city, where my kids are, where I live, and at the same time allows me to grow a business that employs a lot of people with really good jobs, that's a win-win. So it's not like there needs to be a vote, because I'm not going to be out there saying, oh, no, no, no taxes. I'm way good with taxes when they do good things for the community. That's a big if, but taxes are okay when they're used to benefit everybody. And that's... what I had in mind here when I offered the voluntary contribution, and that avoids the election and, you know, being called tax mongers. You know, you guys don't need that. You already have enough problems. So I'll leave it at that. I think Kelly has done awesome stuff, and I've read that report as best I can. It's lengthy. It's very legalese, so it's not exactly fun reading, but I totally support the work that she's done, and I'm way good with it. Okay. Thank you, John. Mr. Scott, are you comfortable with the funds going to the general fund, or would you like it to... I am way comfortable with the funds going to the general fund, because you and the City Council, the city, you guys make the best decisions as to how to spend that money, you know. I mean, not every decision is a great decision. I mean, I'm not the only one who's made the best decisions. I'm the only one who's made the best decisions. I'm the only one who's made the best decisions. Not all of my decisions are great decisions, but I ultimately have quite a bit of faith in our elected bodies here in Chicum. Thank you. Anything else? If I could just get back to my nitpicky kind of questions I had on things, I want to see what your thoughts were on them, if I can get on the right page here. It was page nine, which is eluding me now, but page nine, section three, that says that the agreement would apply not only to this project, but to subsequent development approvals. Was that something that you specifically needed in this agreement, or would you be okay with saying it applies only to this project? This is for this project. Okay. Right. It's, you know, beyond other projects, I have no idea. This is... I'm bringing a card room, an existing business that is right now at 968 East Avenue, to downtown. And I would estimate, you know, after a ramp-up period, we'll probably end up with about 40 jobs. They all pay real well, and that's where I stop. I'm 65 years old, and I have promised my wife this is my last big project, and I hope I can keep my word. And just to... just one more question that... that one section on page 10, section two, point seven, that talks about the city agreeing to attempt to address public emergencies, but only in a way that... not to impact the development, or that it has to be the least impact on the development. Is that something that you needed in this agreement, or... I'm confused as to what the question is. It might be my hearing. Well, that's fine. There's a... there's a section, there's a clause in the agreement that says, it's a public emergency, and that if in the event any future unforeseen public health or safety emergency arises, the city agrees that it shall attempt to address such emergency in a way as to not impact the development, and that if it is not possible to do so, to select that option for addressing the emergency which has the least adverse impact on the development. And I... I just... My answer, if there's a... if there's a public emergency or safety or something like that, that's what I... that's what I... okay, thank you. Anything else? Okay, we'll close the public hearing. Thank you very much, John. Thank you, appreciate it. Clerk, will you do a roll call vote for us? Well, we need a... We don't... I don't think we have a motion yet. We don't have a motion yet. I... to... to Mr. Wolf, I do think that some of that language is carry over from other development agreements, and it does seem... basurr to be putting in a development agreement with this use. I don't know if the development agreement is is the right term to be using for this agreement, but I am not the expert in that. I but I in other development agreements that are developments that language would make perfect sense so I do kind of agree with you that maybe we I guess I'll make a motion that we approve this under the conditions that we expressed here tonight that the city attorney go back and look and see if some of the language that you've discussed is appropriate for this use second yes Commissioner wolf all right Commissioner Poulin I questioner laughing Commissioner Cooper I chair wall thank you Kelly thank you guys for all your really good feedback I appreciate it next item 4.2 code amendment 2301 to title 19 land use and development regulations allow a new alcoholic beverage is that establishments in the downtown north zoning district Molly good evening commissioners my name is Molly Marcus and I'll be presenting this item to the board of trustees and I'm going to be presenting this item to the board of directors in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in to remove the restriction that was placed on new alcoholic beverage establishments or bars in the Downtown North Zoning District. CMC section 1944-040 limits the establishment of new bars in the Downtown North Zoning District. This language was incorporated into the Missile Code in the mid 1990s in response to concerns related to negative impacts associated with a high volume of Type 48 liquor license in the downtown area at the time. Following Council's direction, planning staff coordinated closely with Chico PD to ensure that Council's request was met while still being able to regulate and condition any proposed bars, ensuring that the new business will operate in a manner that upholds community safety. From these discussions, we found that while deleting 1944-040 would remove that restriction, it would still allow the city to rely on existing regulatory mechanisms to approve and condition new bars on a case by case basis. These existing mechanisms are the alcohol beverage establishment zoning verification process, public convenience and necessity, PCN, and permitting requirements based on operational details and proximity to residential districts. So in 2015, we were able to remove the restriction on bars, and we are now able to remove the restriction In 2016, City Council adopted an ordinance establishing operational standards for businesses which sell alcohol as a significant component of use. All new land uses which sell alcohol are required to contain an alcohol beverage establishment zoning verification from the city, verifying that the proposed land use activity is allowed in the underlying zoning district. This process also allows the city and Chico PD, I work closely with PD on this, to provide a recommended recommended recommended recommended recommended recommended recommended recommended recommended recommended recommended recommended recommended recommended recommended recommended recommended recommended recommended recommended recommended recommended recommended recommended recommended recommended recommended recommended recommended recommended recommended recommended recommended recommended recommended recommended recommended recommended recommended recommended recommended recommended recommended recommended recommended recommended recommended recommended recommended recommended recommended recommended recommended recommended recommended recommended recommended recommended recommended recommended recommended recommended recommended high number of businesses with alcohol license and the low number of residents living in this census tract. So any new request for a Type 48 license for a bar, which is a bar, in downtown will have to go through the PCN process and receive council approval. This provides another mechanism for Chico PD planning and city council to condition a license. Let's see. Additionally, as it currently stands, CMC section 1944-020 requires that any business or alcohol beverage establishment in the downtown zone that is within 300 feet of a residential district and operates between the hours of 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. or allows amplified music needs reuse permit approval. And lastly, planning staff consulted with ABC regarding council direction, specifically Type 48 licenses. Currently, per ABC, there are currently no Type 48 licenses available for sale. While there is a potential for a new Type 48 license to become available via the ABC lottery system, this would only happen after a sufficient increase in population or change in ABC regulations. The only other avenue for obtaining a Type 48 in Butte County is if another business license holder were to shut down and put it up for sale in auction, which in the past has typically occurred at a very premium cost given in this context, staff believes in removing the restrictions on new bas in downtown will not in bas in downtown in bas in bas bas in bas in bas in bas in bas in bas in bas in bas in bas in bas in bas in bas in bas in bas in bas in found in the land use downtown and economic development general plan sections. In accordance with CEQA guidelines section 15162, the proposed amendments are within the scope of the EIR that was certified for the general plan. So with that being said, we believe that the city's existing ABE zoning verification and PCN process combined will allow for conditions to be placed on a new bar in downtown similar to the use permit approval process and require that a new license come before council for approval or denial. Staff believes that this is the appropriate and intended level of review that council is seeking. So planning staff recommends that the planning commission hold a public hearing regarding the proposed amendments to Title 19 of the Chico Municipal Code and adopt Resolution 2310. With that, I'm happy to answer any questions. Thank you. Any other questions? I'm just trying to understand. I get that city council instructed staff to look into this and remove this restriction. But by removing this restriction, if nothing changes, I don't really understand what we're being asked to do. Yeah. That's an excellent question. I believe that it basically is just kind of reducing bureaucracy and redundancy and cost. So it's not going to change much. But should down the road a license become available and someone purchases that, it will be a lot cheaper to put in a new bar downtown, to be completely honest. Right now, one, it's really not available. And if they should meet the requirements of that section, they have to get a use permit. And it just gets really costly. Sure. So this is kind of removing that barrier and just reducing bureaucracy. Thank you. And if I may just add, I think, from my perspective, it's part of an overall effort to reinvigorate downtown and get more activity or kind of make it that entertainment center. And as a matter of policy and practice. And right now, this is something that kind of stands in the way of that. Yeah. So it's even if nothing happens, right now, it's just a matter of policy and practice. Right away, it would open the door for the future for something to come in. So it's just a matter of council expressing policy in a way that would require some code changes. I've got a question. Liquor stores. We've been talking bars, but there were some in here. I think about a liquor store could be. So those are type 20, I believe. So there's difference. It's 20 or 21. That is not a type 48. So it's still alcohol beverage establishment. And as it stands, those aren't allowed downtown for that prohibition. But really, I think the main concern or like what they see happening or what we're getting questions on is bars, not liquor stores. This applies to not only type 48, but also to 41. Is that correct? Correct. Yep. Thank you. Anybody else? Okay. Thank you very much, Molly. I'll open the public hearing. Nicole, do we have any speaker cards? We have three, and I will start out with calling up Sebastian Tamarello. And after Sebastian, then we'll be Adam Samorano. Sorry. Good evening, City of Chico Planning. My name is Sebastian Tamarello. I own one of the owners at the Banshee, B Street Public House, and the Argus. I'm going to start with a letter that Scott from the Argus penned because he couldn't be here tonight. My name is Scott Baldwin. I'm the majority owner and hands-on operator of Argus Bar and Patio. With regards to the proposed amendment to delete section 1944.040, I'd like to give my input as a lifelong Chico citizen and longtime downtown business owner. To be clear and succinct, I don't think it will serve downtown's interests. I think it will be a good idea to have a meeting with the City of Chico. I think it will serve to alleviate the problems we face as downtown business owners. I am pro-business. I would love for more good investment in downtown Chico, either residential or commercial. However, opening up more type 47s or 48s that we learned tonight in an already overly concentrated area isn't going to help our current transient issues, parking issues, or empty building issues. It's going to make them worse. Many businesses are in the brink of failure in downtown with or without a liquor license. There just isn't enough foot traffic. When friends ask me how my business is doing that has been voted Chico's best bar for the last seven years, they usually have a look like someone would if they were checking in on someone with a sick family member. For many folks, the trash, the mental ill, the parking, etc. are enough for them to not come downtown anymore. There are other options these days that aren't in much better shape than our quaint downtown. My suggestion would be for the first to fix the health of downtown. I'm a big fan of downtown. I've never heard anyone complain about the lack of variety or quality of bars and restaurants in downtown Chico. I constantly hear the complaints about our known issues. Please address the vacant buildings that landlords do not rent, renovate, or maintain. Keep the mentally ill away from our businesses that scare families, litter our streets, and blurt obscenities, discouraging normal people from wanting to shop here. Recognize that Merion Park has a great addition to Chico. It has advantages. It has advantages that businesses do not in downtown Chico, such as free parking. Many downtowns across America are making a comeback. I hope we can find our way there, but I do not think the path is through opening up more liquor licenses for downtown. The way to make our downtown a jewel again is to fix our known problems. Please address the homeless and mentally ill that panhandle and litter. Get landlords to take care of their buildings that are in eternal distress. Help create parking solutions. Invite people, not outside vendors, to create events hosted in downtown. When the existing businesses thrive once again, that would seem like a more reasonable time to consider adding more liquor licenses to downtown Chico. Thank you, Scott. I have just a few things to add to that. I'm not opposed to people that have earned licenses getting licenses, places that have been good standing in the community, such as Momona or Woodstocks. They put in their time. They do great work. We appreciate them as downtown co-business owners and whatnot. My concern is that what the vetting process is, and what the barrier to entry will be. In the past, the barrier was, as we kind of just discussed, that the licenses had to come from within downtown. You had to buy a license within downtown, put it at a storefront, and then open your business from there. Put your best foot forward in the community and have a solid plan to survive. Currently, we have many empty storefronts downtown, with few set up as viable restaurants or bars, I guess. What will be out in downtown in a rush to get a license, and will it be for the rest of the year? I think the best is a concern. I think we need to address some of the reasons people now avoid downtown first before opening up the ability to get one. So let's have reasonable regulation, which we did discuss a little bit, of whom can get one, and enforce the licenses appropriately. Enforcement is always an issue. I don't know, is ABC going to do it, or the city? Sorry, I think we need to slow down in making this decision and be certain we're doing what's best for downtown. Thank you. Sebastian, thank you very much. Who is the next one? Adam. It's a lot. It's a lot. And then after Adam will be Josh Marks. Hello. My name's Adam. I own a beachy public house and part of the Banshee. I'm just going to piggyback on a lot of what he said. We are concerned about there's parking, there's homeless, there's lighting, there's just an overall feel of being safe downtown, especially when it's darker. But we're concerned about the city. We're concerned about the city as well as diluting the businesses that are here that have worked hard. We have a lot of, when we first got our liquor license, we had a lot of hoops and simulations put on our license that we worked through. And we still have some of those on our license. And so that was part of the last part of what he was talking about, is if theoretically, if this does go through and people do, are able to get licenses downtown, what kind of parameters or what kind of regulations are we going to have to get to downtown? Or will they have to have, there was a few on our B Street liquor license that we'd like to get rid of. Maybe that could be part of the conversation in terms of people that have had these liquor licenses for X amount of years. Or Adam can maybe take some of those restrictions off or lighten them up a little bit. That's it. Thank you, Adam. Josh. I'm going to go ahead and get my mic. Okay. Good evening. My name is Josh Marks. I own Parkside Taphouse, co-owned Parkside Taphouse and Bella's Sports Pub. I don't think this is going to be a solution to fix downtown. We're all fighting to survive as it is. I mean, it's not busy. There's not anybody out and about. And by putting more bars down here, you're not going to create more foot traffic. You're going to have to get more bars down here. You're going to create more problems. Everybody's going to be fighting for the lowest-priced drinks and just to survive to get people in the door. And you're going to end up with a mess on your hands. I don't think it's a good solution. Like they said, the health and safety, that's the biggest issue with downtown. If we can get that more vibrant and get people downtown as it is, to piggyback on what Sebastian said with Scott, I mean, there's plenty of variety downtown. There's plenty of places to go. There's a lot to do. If it's a new and unique concept, it's a new concept. Welcome it. But if it's something that's already here, you're just going to put us out of business. I mean, nobody will have enough people to survive. And as far as the restrictions go, I mean, it's 2015, Labor Day. Labor Day is a dead weekend. Nothing even going on. But we have to close early. It's ridiculous. And then not to mention we have grad weekend. We should be celebrating that. We should be welcoming businesses being open past midnight. Showing off what we have as a city and our night life and all that. But you shut us down at 12 and everyone's got to leave. Graduation doesn't get out until 930 or 10 as it is. So parents and their kids get to celebrate for an hour and then they got to leave. It sucks. So that's my two cents or more than that. But any questions? Thank you very much, Josh. Okay. We'll close the public hearing. Thank you. Do I have a motion? I have a question. Why did this amendment, why was this proposed in the first place? Was there an issue? I didn't catch that maybe. I was not at the city council meeting where this was initially brought up. But it was brought up by a council member for discussion. And they asked staff to look into, you know, what this would do. If we were to remove it. So that's what we did. And we received direction to move forward with removing that. I believe it, I mean, like I said, it was to incentivize and, you know, fix this problem downtown. But I'm not sure why that was originally brought up at a council meeting. Yes, sir. I had a similar question, perhaps. And that was if the council had the benefit of the testimony that we just heard. Was it, was this the first time this has been? Yeah. So it went to council. We had to obviously get council direction. So we're coming to you guys for a recommendation or denial or recommendation of approval or denial that we will then take to council. So there will be another opportunity to provide all this public comment to your council members as well. Anybody want to make a motion? I think I just have some comments. I just want to make sure I understand this right. Because even if we do recommend this for approval, even though council directed staff to look into it, council can still then deny it based on the findings, even if we approve it. Correct. Also, if we approve it, it's not adding additional licenses to the pool. So really the only. Difference is it's just taking a restriction off. Correct. Do the existing liquor licenses, the ones that do have conditions of conditions on them, is that a thing that was done for all of the licenses downtown? So it was from 2015 on. So if someone had a license prior to 2015, they would not have a license. They would not have those standard operating conditions. In that code section I referenced. However, ABC has been and Chico have been conditioning licenses. Forever. Especially through the PCN process. But no, not every single business or bar downtown has those same standard operation conditions. Is there an avenue for those conditions to be reviewed currently? So. So like amending code section, whatever that is. Yeah. I mean, we would have to get obviously direction. Well, I'm just thinking to our speaker's point. If we're talking about bringing more vitality to downtown, then I think we need to be looking at it holistically for the current downtown businesses. Mm-hmm. To make it. A fair playing field. Maybe there's some things that, you know what I mean, that's going back, you know, almost ten years. Nine years, eight years. And so a lot can change in eight or nine years. But I'm not an expert in this. So I'm just speaking aloud. No, no, that's. I think maybe. At least I'm not. I'm struggling. Maybe the rest of you are too a little bit here because it almost felt like a like a fait accompli, you know, that we were just going to move this on to the city council. And and I certainly support, you know, invigorating downtown and making all that happen. But it seems that maybe the the council would benefit from hearing from some of the the operators and get a better sense of what kinds of changes would really be the best. And then and then we can talk about a little bit more. And so the process just kind of got a little jumbled up here. I think what it sounds like to me. And I see the the issues that have been raised. I see a lot of the, you know, the issues with the homeless and those kinds of things. Maybe it's being a little separate from this whole discussion. They're certainly very real. But I think that the other comments about, you know, the timing of this, if the business is down, down or, you know, the bars are struggling right now. And. In the effects of this kind of change, should somebody come in or more than one person who knows really what the effects going to be. Is that is this the right time to make this kind of change? And I think there would be some benefit from hearing more about kind of the realities of the marketplace. I do know that council's been talking about some of the abandoned buildings and trying to address those issues. And I think they recently passed some code or discuss some code amendments. As far as. You can't, you know, just put plywood up over a window and more code enforcement type things that really should should be addressed. But, yeah, I agree. It's kind of the cart before the horse in this scenario. So I'm sorry, Mr. Chair. I was going to say, so the question for us was what staff has recommended that we recommended the council. Approve this. And my thinking is there needs to be. And I hate to sound like a wonky process guy, but that's kind of what this comes down to is maybe there needs to be some more discussion before the council with some of this input. And then we can come back and talk about more of the details on it. That's kind of where I am. I'm not sure how to do that at this point in the process. But that's where my thinking is right now. Well, I believe. I mean, so from my understanding that whether you recommend. So are you suggesting to not make a recommendation at all and to come back to the planning commission or recommend denial in hopes that council will do. Reach out to these to the downtown businesses or I'm confused a little bit. Okay. Okay. So we're on the same page at least. Right. So I'm going to go to the council. The council, of course, being the decision makers, all of these folks here, plus a lot of others will have the opportunity to weigh in and express their opinions or concern. One of the things I think that the council is looking at is open marketplace for different things. I mean, there's no restriction on just about any other business downtown. The question, I think, comes down to why this one. This is a college town. This is what college kids do on the road. This is what they do on the weekend. And it provides a fair amount of revenue for both the proprietors of those businesses as well as the city. So I think whatever we do tonight, the council will make up its collective mind in a few weeks and move forward. Yeah. Yeah. If we denied it, would it still move forward to council? Yeah. Yeah. I think we would have to do this with our, with, yeah. That consideration. And this would obviously, it would capture all this in staff report and your reasons for denial as well as the public comment. And all of these people would have an opportunity to, even after this meeting, start messaging their council members and letting them know where they stand. But it would, it's slated to go to council in a few weeks with denial or approval. Thanks. Anybody else? I mean, I agree. It's scary downtown. I try to support downtown all the time. I was down at one of these establishments the other day and, yeah, there's people right outside. It's all of a sudden scary and there's other things to be addressed and the bars aren't going to solve, new bars aren't going to solve that. So, and then retail is dead, right? I mean, everybody goes on Amazon. So, we're not going to get those little shops pop up. But what do you do? I mean, so how do you put something in there to challenge this instead of just a bar or something like coin op or, right? It's video games and you're changing it up some. But I don't know. But I think I agree there needs to be a little bit more or we just leave it on the council. Yeah. That's, I'm wondering if we could, I hate to even think about doing this, but is it possible just to punt to the council? You know, the council. Yeah. Had this idea and I think it's got some merit to it. But this is just kind of the beginning of that discussion with the people who are principally affected by downtown. Yeah. If you send it off without a recommendation, send it off to council without a recommendation, that's simply saying that we don't want it to happen. And I don't know that that's something that really makes a lot of sense. Because the council wants our recommendation. They don't want us to say, well, we can't decide, council, it's in your lap. I don't think that's the right way to go. And as far as being quiet downtown, yes, it is and it has been for a couple of years. And remember the attendance over at Chico State is down several thousand from four years, three, four years ago. And it too will come back. And when it comes back, you know, not only bars but other places will come in downtown and there will be a vibrant, more vibrant downtown than there has been in a long time. So I think this is just preparing for what is inevitably going to happen. Mr. Chair, I think it's entirely appropriate to give the council your, these same comments to include the feedback of some of the stakeholders. And that you have some reservations. But I also think it's good to provide a recommendation one way or the other. And the process, as Miley indicated, will continue. And you can highlight this. You can say we don't think this has been vetted enough and you've taken into consideration the stakeholders here. And then you can highlight that as part of your action on whatever recommendation you choose. Right. And that's what we're going to do forward. Or that could just be a part of the minutes as well. Sure. It is part of the minutes. It is part of the record now. I'm just thinking of the, you know, we're just doing action minutes now. So I'm not sure how we could get that in there. But anyway, Larry, I think I tend to agree with you on your points. And making it, you know, getting it up to the council, letting the council hear from people. Does this move it along? Sure. So with that, I'll move adoption of resolution recommending approval of the code changes to the city council as recommended by staff. Do we have a second? That will include, do we need to put conditions on that? Or are they going to read the minutes and take the condition into consideration? I would likely just include that in my staff report. But I guess I might need that as a part of, like, the motion. I'd be open to an amendment. I'll make a friendly amendment to approve based on staff's recommendation. But then also to request that the city council look into some other areas of concern raised by the council. And then I'll make a motion to approve that the city council look into some other areas of concern raised by the downtown stakeholders. I accept that. Okay. We've got a motion and a second with an amendment. Roll call vote. Yes. Commissioner Wolf? Aye. Commissioner Poulin? Aye. Commissioner Laffins? Aye. Commissioner Cooper? No. Chair Wall? Thank you. So the motion passes four to one. Correct. Okay. Regular agenda, we have none. Reports and communications. Bruce? Mr. Chair, I don't have anything direct, no reports. And we will need to recommend canceling our next meeting, too. Okay. Well, everybody have a happy Thanksgiving. And we're adjourned to the regular meeting of Thursday, December 7, 2023. Thank you. Thank you.
