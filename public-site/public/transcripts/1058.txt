 Everybody's here. Are we good? We are ready now. Okay. All right. We'd like to welcome everybody to the regular city council meeting. February 15th. A note that this meeting, of course, is being held via Zoom. But the next meeting we are looking at being returned to in person at the council meeting at the council chambers. So, with the governor lifting the mask mandate, as of today, all future meetings will be held in person at the council chambers. Hopefully that will not return to online. And please note that the public is invited to participate in the council meeting using the information found on the agenda on the city's website. The public was also able to submit comments via City of Chico Engage Chico platform, also found on the city's website. So, we will start with calling the meeting to order. Madam Clerk. Okay. Council Member Bennett. Here. Council Member Brown. Here. Council Member Morgan. Here. Council Member O'Brien. Here. Council Member Tandon. Here. Vice Mayor Reynolds. Here. And Mayor Coolidge. Virtually present. All right. And I believe we have a closed session announcement from the last meeting. Madam Clerk, if you could do the honors. Okay. So, on February 1st, the council met with staff in closed session regarding three items. Item 7.2 was Warren versus the City of Chico. No action was taken. No direction was provided. Item 7.3 was the estate of Tyler S. Rushing versus, or at all, an AG private protection. No action was taken. Direction was provided. On the last item, 7.3. 7.4, labor negotiations. No action was taken. Direction was provided. And that's the end of the report. All right. And then on the consent agenda, did we have, Mr. Orr, maybe you know this, I believe we had an item that was going to be pulled. Is that correct? We've got nothing on the consent that staff is desiring to pull. Okay. I had an email about something. So, I do have public comment. Okay. So, let's start with public comment and then we'll go from there. Okay. And so, anyone who's listening and participating remotely through Zoom, if you could raise your hand to speak on this item. But we did receive an email from Chris Nelson asking for the council to please pull and not act on item 2.4, which was a supplemental appropriation regarding the funds for Hagen Lane. Okay. And so, that was the comment that was received on that. It would be up to the council whether or not you pulled that item. And then we also have three speakers now. And this is on the consent agenda, which consists of four items. So, Jessica Giannola, go ahead and unmute yourself. Thank you. Hi, council. I was looking at item 2.3. I believe that we can comment on that now. Okay. So, I think that the police department is seeking approval to move funds from looks like staff funding to some non-recurring operational accounts. What I would like to add my input in on is possibly having some sort of grant or other funding source to satisfy whatever need that is and using those funds that have not been used to fund four positions. Up to four, that would be awesome of having like a social service type partner funded through the police department. That way there's always someone available to go with them out on needed calls. 341,000 is a lot of money and that would more than pay for those positions. So, that's what I wanted to comment on those. Thank you. Thank you, Jessica. Ruth Sarnoff is our next speaker. So, go ahead, Ruth, and unmute yourself. And this is on the consent agenda. Ruth, are you there? Yes, I'm here. Go ahead. A question. There are reports on these 24, 23, 22. Might the public speak to those individually? If they have something to... Because there's a staff report here, so something's going to happen. It's two-one staff report. So, where's the staff report? So the staff report are all included with the agenda, Ruth, and those were found on the website. And the consent agenda... You mean yesterday or last meeting or what? They were... It was posted on Thursday of last week and were made available. And... And, Stine, if you could reset her time, please. At least give her a little bit more time and pause it when I'm speaking. Thank you. So, the items, Ruth, can be addressed and you can address all four of the items or just one singular one. That is how the closed session works. Okay. Well, let's start with the first one here. I... It appears to me that that is one... Okay. The first one is a question that is setting up a business to be owned by the city. And the fiber utility, I think, was referring to manufacturing of... Of something that could be then used for other purposes for providing energy. If I'm wrong, so be it. Okay. The... The next one is on health and sanitation of the Chico Municipal Code relating to mandatory solid waste recycling and organic waste disposal reduction. And I don't remember that ever being shared on... At any of the stuff that I was watching. And I've been checking it also through the ads in the paper. And I just... I did not catch that. Probably others didn't too. On two, three, consideration of approval of a supplemental appropriate budget modification. And that's on the police department. And I very much would hope that people would review the work of the ad hoc committee. It was very... To me, I watched it on flash drive. I tried to... I tried to work out something to get some more. I loaned my flash drive to somebody else. So I could not watch it recently. But it's very revealing of both the... The intention of using all the modifications to... To jail or arrest more people. And it does not show to me any intention of improving the amount of shootings and arrests. And I think that's... Maybe I should be full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full work and even informally and be given some more of the flash drives would be very, very helpful. And I would urge that to happen. I want to express again that there's no water available for anything here. Our reservoirs and everything are dry and there's no water. Thank you. Thank you, Ruth. Let's see. We did have one additional speaker and they have lowered their hand. So that is all that we have in terms of consent. All right. Thank you. Okay. So do we have any council requests to pull any items or any no votes? Yeah, this is Alex. I'd like to pull. Item 2.3 and item 2.4 for further discussion, please. Okay. Anyone else? All right. So we'll go ahead and take the entertaining motion on item 2.1 and 2.2, the rest of the consent agenda. Second. Motion and a second. Madam Clerk, if you can take the roll. Okay. So it was a motion by. Council Member O'Brien, seconded by Vice Mayor Reynolds to approve the consent agenda, which contains item 2.1 and 2.2 only, which include an ordinance of the City Council of the City of Chico amending Title 15, creating Chapter 15.70, Fiber Utility of the Chico Municipal Code to establish a city-owned fiber utility. Item 2.2 is an ordinance of the City Council of the City of Chico amending Title 8, Health and Sanitation of the Chico Municipal Code related to mandatory solid waste recycling. And organic waste disposal reduction. Council Member Bennett. Yes. Council Member Brown. Aye. Council Member Morgan. Yes. Council Member O'Brien. Yes. Council Member Tandon. Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds. Yes. Mayor Coolidge. Aye. That carries 7-0 for the consent agenda. Except for items 2.3 and 2.4. All right. Item 2.3. Council Member Brown, did you want to take that? Yeah. I just wanted to make a little bit of a comment. I am going to vote no on this item and wanted to provide a little context for it. I actually think it might be doing a disservice to the public and Chico PD to approve this reallocation now without it being scheduled in a budget presentation. We're so close to budget discussions that I don't think I can justify saying yes in one fell swoop. I think we should have the opportunity to get 10,000 before we approve. I think we should have the opportunity to get 10,000 before we approve this major reallocation. So I prefer to weave this discussion into budget season. And I'd be especially interested, as I know the public would, in learning about the importance of these items, the impact they'd have on policing in Chico, particularly those meant for de-escalation training. So I'm going to vote no on this item at this time and encourage more education. Thanks. All right. Do we have any further comment on item 2.3? All right. Entertain a motion. Move to approve. All right. I'll give that to Councilmember Morgan. Do we have a second? I second that. All right. Do we have a motion and a second? Madam Clerk? Councilmember Bennett? Yes. Councilmember Brown? No. Councilmember Morgan? Yes. Councilmember O'Brien? Yes. Councilmember Tandon? Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds? Aye. Councilmember Brown? Aye. Mayor Coolidge? Aye. Carries 6-1. All right. Moving on to item 2.4. Councilmember Brown? Thank you. I'm going to start with a question that I believe Mr. Gustafson. This is based on an email that we received, so I just wanted to get it into the public view. Has a traffic study been done related to Hagen Lane congestion? I'll hand that off to Director of Engineering Leigh Ann Sutton to take that. It's in her wheelhouse. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Good evening, Mayor, Vice Mayor, and Councilmembers. This item tonight is to move funding around, to consolidate funding, and it's basically a cleanup funding item. And I can explain more details about the different items, but to answer your question, Councilmember Brown, we are working on the traffic study for Hagen Lane right now. We're looking at six intersections in the Myers area. We received a grant for, or a couple grants, that we're going to be doing in the next couple months, totaling $2.4 million for this project. One was a CMAT grant related to traffic congestion, and another one was a highway improvement program grant, HIP grant. So we've been, work has been going on in engineering on this. We haven't put it out for public comment yet because it's not finalized, but it will be in March. And at that time, when it's ready, we'll be setting up a public website for this project. Including an email and a phone number that people can call, and they can also include their comments on the website if they would like. And then we're planning on also having an in-person or video meeting to go over the details of the traffic study and our proposed design solution moving forward for the five or six intersections that, where we'll need to either install intersection improvements or roundabouts. Thank you. That was a very thorough overview and I appreciate it. Thank you so much. Thank you so much, and I'll be happy to serve with questions and questions and questions and questions and questions and questions and questions and questions and questions and questions and questions and questions and questions and questions and questions and questions and questions and questions and questions and questions and questions and questions and questions questions and questions and questions and questions and questions and questions and questions and questions and questions and questions and questions and questions and questions and questions and questions and questions and questions and questions and questions and questions and questions and yes all right thank you anyone else questions i just want to thanks leanne on that too and you will be probably will be discussing this today so thank you for that clarification yes thank you all right um entertain a motion all right we'll give okay so we'll take that from council member morgan and a second from vice mayor reynolds madam clerk can take the role council member bennett yes council member brown thanks thanks for the clarity yes council member morgan yeah council member o'brien yes council member tandem yes vice mayor reynolds yes mayor coolidge hi perry seven zero all right at this time if anyone wants to speak on business from the floor please raise your hand um and members of the public may address the council at this time on any issue not listed on the agenda and um council cannot take any action at this meeting on a request made under this section of the agenda once you know how many speakers we have let me know uh well the hands are starting to be raised right now we have three but i'd like to pursue it to the government's uh the changes in the brown act related to zoom meetings i want to thank all of our I wanted to just summarize the Engage Chico comments. We received one under business from the floor, one email through Engage Chico from Daniel Govan. He expressed concern and councils received copies of all of these comments over the rent prices in the city of Chico. Nancy Park, Mary Kay Benson, and Ann Seymour, all three spoke under business from the floor in Engage Chico regarding the Hope Street Coalition plan and wondering what the status of the plan was in light of the fact that the agreement, the settlement agreement has already been reached. So those are the individuals that spoke through the Engage Chico platform. We have our next speaker is Julie Butler. And let me just get back to my participants. And go ahead. Julie and speak and unmute yourself. Julie, are you there? Yeah, I'm here. Okay, go ahead. And this is business from the floor. Can you hear me now? Yes. Okay, the city council erroneously assumes that the pallet shelter site is a temporary facility. But it will be here indefinitely. We are already 10,000 houses short in Butte County due to wildfires burning people's homes. And this site serves and will continue to serve climate refugees until the housing shortage abates. So the pallet shelter site is a permanent transitional shelter site. And as such, it needs built-in showers, built-in bathrooms and laundry facilities, trees, shade and landscaping. As a permanent fixture in our community, it must be run professionally by teams using evidence-based social service practices so that people may truly be helped to transition to permanent housing rather than to jail or our parks. In terms of safety and organization, it needs to be a safe, organized space known as SOS spaces communities where a working relationship is needed. The building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building constitutional human rights violations and cost the taxpayers two million dollars but still hasn't changed this basic philosophy of not wanting to make the homeless too comfortable where um we all know that the police department and justice system is massively more expensive than social services and health health-based systems and that punitive and punishment methods only lead to recidivism and do not solve the problems whereas it has been found that 80 percent of previously unhoused people that were housed were getting back into the workforce after a year so it took them a year just to get um mentally capable uh to to to get to together but then they do move on so that's a great rate of success and um people chico may be interested to know that uh besides the jesus center there were two other professional agencies in town that made bids to lead the pallet shelter site to north and the united way these agencies were rejected in favor of the jesus center which is faith-based and um it's actually not acceptable to hundreds of our unhoused because we can tell that because they're currently not living under their system so i fear that this is going to fail our community unless you change and go to evidence based humane practices thank you thank you nicole nada go ahead and unmute yourself i can hear me yes okay thank you so first off i want to start by thanking uh the city clerk staff um and whoever else had a hand in um getting the redistricting topic added to engage chico so i want to encourage chico citizens to look there and discuss and let's um work as a community together to look at maps and land on something that we believe we can all live with um so thank you to the staffers who uh put forth that effort maybe a little idea is um to have the city create a mini video about how to use engage chico starting from how to sign up i just know that some people are a little bit tech challenged and that might be a fun little project for folks who like doing things like that um switching gears um i'm wondering when the public can expect to hear the plan on dealing with um entry to the city of chico and how it's going to affect the city of chico and how it's going to impact the city of chico and how it's going to affect the city of chico and how it's going to and other things for the homeless community i realize that they're working with the selected provider the jesus center um but i think some of us have a desire to learn about what is going to happen in our neighborhoods for the cleanup effort that needs to take place uh when the encampments are moved there's a lot of trash a lot of trash and a lot of damage that needs to get repaired so that's something that i would be interested in um also switching gears um i'm wondering if you have any thoughts on how to deal with the community and how to deal with the community and how to deal with the community and how to deal with the community again i'd like to find out if there is some type of roadmap timeline etc that the public can look at in regards to roadway improvement um to get a like a bird's eye view of how you would be moving through the community to do some of the repair work that's been long needed and what is our plan for getting there um i do not know where that exists or if it even does if it does not i would like to request that we get something that's transparent and that's something that we can that would be useful to all of us um and then i would just like to say about this map experience because i know it'll be on the next uh meeting is that it is a challenge for people to get in we had two weeks to dive in learn watch the tutorials outside of our normal jobs and normal lives and try to draw maps be helpful try to see if they're level which is close to impossible um there are some i think uh demographers cartographers whatever they're doing to whatever you want to call it working on that um that i know have a vested interest in it maybe going one way hopefully it wasn't like that i'll take a look but i want to let the community know like you have to dive in early on these things and educate yourself on the tools and put out what you'd like to see happen um and you know just kind of put yourself out there a little bit or at least look at what other people are putting out and weigh in one way or another um i look forward to that effort but i'd like to see us tighten up and get better at some of these things to give more runway for this community thank you for your time thank you nicole so ruth sarnoff go ahead this is business from the floor go ahead and unmute yourself okay i wanted to um bring your attention to uh these are are both articles from the uh enterprise record that are within the last uh three days the first one is an article that's at 2 12 22. canadian judge orders an end to blockade at border bridge it's a very important article it's followed up by another article that's in today's paper canada's trudeau invokes emergency powers to the full force and full force and full force and full force and full force and full force and full force and full force and full force and full force and full force and full force and full force and full force and full force and full force and full force and full force and full force and full force and full force and full force It was going through, but now it isn't on one of the ports, which is the middle one, portals. These are international ways of shipping, and these are large diesel trucks and all kinds of other things. I want to bring your attention to the weather charts that are in our paper every day. And it's very important because you can know a lot. I'm very homebound, and I do most of my research from papers. I have a pretty clear record of the fact that we have an iced-in country that mostly has been below freezing for some time. Now, if you will look at both the national... The national forecast part of the weather forecast, as well as the local one, and you will find it lists a whole lot of cities that are below freezing. You get a picture of everything that's going on. And if you track it every day, or at best every other day, because they'll tell you what it was the day before, too. And this is a form of everybody doing research. I just want to say climate change is here. We're already well into it. The situation on the East Coast with all of the freezing of all the pipes and all of the pipes that were frozen going through the South and a number of big storms that you might have at least heard about those has pretty much destroyed the infrastructure in our major cities. And areas. Thank you. Thank you, Ruth. Our last speaker is Jessica Giannola. Go ahead. Hi, Council. I wanted to comment on the the pallet shelter development and some comments that I've seen since it's been announced that the lawsuit has finally closed up and we're moving forward this pallet shelter. And the comments that I've been seeing. I think it's really important. The comments that I've been seeing are that now and now suddenly there's, there's parts of the Council that are proclaiming that this is what they've wanted all along and that they've wanted these services that are similar to what's coming and and I find that really frustrating, I myself have spent over three years of, I think I've only missed two Council meetings, where I've personally begged begged I've written letters, I've asked for help for our housing refugees in our city. and I have so many peers that have done the same. And not only do we talk to you and ask you for help, which we've gotten a no from, there'd be no answer or pushback or even efforts at stopping services like the Orange Street Shelter and the Simplicity Village. Those didn't happen because people didn't want it to happen. Our life would be so different right now if they had. And we go out, we go out all the time. We spend our waking hours helping people who have nothing. We've carried the city here. We have put our own health at risk numerous times trying to help people because our city hasn't. And now we have this shelter developing and we want to see it succeed. We desperately want to. What's being offered sounds amazing. And it's successful really depend on who's running it and how they're running it. People that are familiar, familiar with a low barrier population, they really, really need to understand what that means. And right now we have one that's chosen that hasn't been operating with that population for quite some time. And I fear that people out in the community that would benefit from this site, they're going to hear that Jesus Center is running it and they may go, okay, they've already told me no a hundred times. Then they may already are feeling hesitant. So I hope it doesn't happen. And then we have other partners involved. That really do connect with this population to give them the services they need. And I really feel like their suffering has been used to the benefit of so many of our politicians who are sitting on the council now, or who will be running in the future, who've done it in the past and, and they're suffering. It's that's not right to use their addictions or they're having to live in our, in our parks as a basis to get voted in. The city has to be able to do that. And I feel like we're going to have to do that. The city has had a duty to help them and they haven't for so long. And really, I think that advocates like myself that are out there doing the hard work day after day, week after week, I think that maybe a thank you is an order from the city to all of us for picking up that slack. Anyway, that's all I have for now. Thank you, Jessica. We do have one other hand that was raised, Alan or Lori Harris. I'm not sure which one is on, go ahead and speak speak or unmute yourself. Hi, this is Lori Harris and I have a comment and a question. Far too long we have been silenced by not being in the council chambers. When do we get back in since gruesome new scum has lifted his mandate? My question is when do we get back in the chambers? You want them to put that on? We'd like that on the agenda. Thank you and just as a side note this our next meeting March 1st will be in the council chambers and that's when we're getting back to you. Thank you, Debbie. You're welcome. That is all that we have in terms of stickers under business from the floor. That chick is some kind of high maintenance man. Did you guys? All right. Okay. And we did make that announcement at the beginning of the meeting too that we'd be returning in person at the next council meeting. So all right. Moving on to public hearings which we have none. So item five is the regular agenda. Item 5.1 consideration of an ordinance adding chapter 7.24 to the Chico Municipal Code pet shop and kennel regulations. And I believe Chief Madden you have a report on this. Yeah. Good evening. Good evening Mayor, Council, colleagues. I'm actually going to turn this over to both Captain Billy Aldridge and our Animal Services Manager Tracy Moore that can speak more intelligently to this ordinance and the need for it. All right. Thanks, Chief. So thanks Mayor for letting me speak on this and Council. We have an ordinance in front of you that the city attorney's worked on for us. I'd like to thank Animal Services Manager Tracy Moore who should also be on this line also. She's put a lot of work into this and so she's the master of this and not necessarily myself. So if I can't answer anything she'll definitely jump on and help us. So the reason we have this ordinance in place right now to be approved is because we don't have one that defines any kind of processes or permitting processes for having a kennel or pet shop. So we're going to have to make sure that we're getting full approval and full approval and full approval and full approval and full approval and full approval and full approval and full approval and full approval and full approval and full approval and full approval and full approval and full approval and full approval and full approval and full approval and full approval and full approval and full approval and full approval and full approval and full approval and full approval and full approval and full approval and full approval and full approval and full approval and full approval and full approval and full approval and full approval and full approval and full approval and full approval and full approval and full approval and full approval and full approval and full approval and full approval and full approval and full approval and full approval and full approval and full approval and full approval and full approval and full approval and full approval and full approval and full approval and full approval and full approval and full approval and full approval and full approval and full approval and full approval and full approval and full approval and full approval and full approval and full approval and full approval and full approval and full approval and full approval and full approval and full approval and full approval and full approval and full an extremely important thing to our community and our animal services division has done an amazing job at providing that service to our community to make sure our animals are taken care of. So our ordinance in front of you is simple in terms of what we're looking for and how to police those pet shops and kennels within the city of Chico. So we just want to have a permitting in place. Okay, any questions? I did have a couple of questions. I had a couple of questions, but I'm not seeing Ms. Moore on here. Is she on? I'm here. Yep, I'm here. Oh, okay. Hi, this is Vice Mayor Reynolds. Quick question. It says, so once this is passed, there will be a permit required. What's the approximate time frame that will allow for somebody to comply and get in compliance with that? I didn't see. It says they have to be paid by January 1st of every year, but since that's obviously passed, will they have two, three, four months, five months? Yeah, I don't know that we've determined that, but I would think that we would notify any existing pet stores and give them a reasonable amount of time to come into compliance. Okay, and then the other question was, it said any fees, permit fees and anything like that, penalty relating to animal service shall be set. Set by the city council by resolution. So is that something that we should be expecting back soon? Or I didn't see it attached. I don't know if it's included in this or not. We have not set any fees yet, and that would just be something that we would request if this ordinance got passed to, you know, to set up a fee schedule. Okay, and I also did not see anything that, are we precluding people from being able to bring animals in from out of the area by this? We are not. That was not written into the, into the ordinance. Are we able to write that into an ordinance? We could. Okay. Okay, that was, that's all I have for now. All right. Do we have any other questions from council? All right. Seeing none. How many speakers do we have on this item? I see one hand raised, but I did get, we did receive two emails in the Engage Chico platform, and one was from Taylor Wynn, concerns over care provided by Wags and Whiskers, as well as Nicholas Stamper, who also said the same thing. And then Jessica Giannola has her hand up. So let me unmute her. Go ahead, Jessica. Thank you. This item, I just have some questions I don't see that are answered, either through discussion or the description. And I'm just wondering, are we, is the city requiring a license for the pet shops and the kennel? And really what is being determined that defines each of them? Is it the number of pets they, they service or however many pets they, how many litters that adopt? Is it the number of pets that they service? Is it the number of pets that they, how many dogs has? I mean, at what point are we consider them to be a pet shop and a kennel? And then how is it going to be regulated? Are they going to be regulated or are you just simply having them pay a fee once a year and that's it? There's no checking in or following up or pop-in visits. And, and can somebody be denied to have a permit and, and what would be the basis for that? So those, those are really some questions I'd like to see before this is something that's voted on. What this means for the community and the people who may use their services or be a part of that, that population there that has a pet store or pet shop or a kennel. I know I, we've used a kennel ourselves for our dog, like on vacation. And so, you know, what does that mean for, for, for customers or for whoever wants to run the one? So just some more information. That would be great. Thank you. Thank you, Jessica. This is our next speaker is Ruth Sarnoff. And this is Ruth. This is on pet shop and kennel regulations. Go ahead and unmute. I got it now. Okay. Okay, perfect. It appears that the, the need for something that's truly public and paid for as, as a paid for to some, some specific body of, I mean, you have, you have stray animals, you have injured animals, you have, you have, you have, you have, you have lots of things that depend on a response system. And we also, you also have a whole lot of people who try to take care of a lot of animals and they hate to see an animal put to sleep. And that's often what happens to animals. And so, and people are poor and sometimes they don't have their animals spayed. And so, you know, animals are very important to a lot of groups of people here that live here. And a lot of people are still living out of their cars are living in campus are, are suffering from cold and heat and all kinds of things. And the animals, they're all suffering too. They need water. They need to be not where it's so cold that they freeze. There's a lot of things. So we need a public, public sheltering here. And I will say once again that I think we are deeply in to climate change already. Because all of our major cities are frozen in the country and have been for a while and I've been tracing it. And so I think some way of just providing a large area that's, that's, that people in that live in that community can figure it out because that's what we've always had to do here because FEMA and Red Cross and all these nonprofits basically have paid staff, and then they count on volunteers to come in and they don't come in till very long and then they're kind of like, they're like traffic directors for humans go this way and that way. But there's nothing at the end. end of the line. And so at some point, if we're going to save the planet, and if we're going to save the ocean, we need to not be dumping in it. We need to not be figuring out what we can manage to manufacture or to produce or mine, mill, log, or whatever. That's not the road. Thank you. Thank you, Ruth. And that is, Ruth is our last speaker. Great. Any comment from council? This is Alex. I just have a quick question. You know, generally supportive of cleaning up language around this. I'm just curious. I've read, of course, the two sad stories in Engage Chico, but can somebody share a little bit about what led to, like, what sort of reports were coming in that led to this? This result of wanting to clean up the language and specify? I can do that for you, Council Member Brown. Go ahead. So, like I said, in 2015, we started really getting a lot of complaints about a local business that was importing a lot of animals from out of state and actually from out of country. This provider had a facility in Chico that was not necessarily kept up to par in terms of cleanliness, animal care, in terms of housing them in a very fair manner. We had things such as, you know, urine and feces that were seen everywhere. We had cramped cages. We had animals that were being adopted out that had parvo and distemper. And the people who were adopting these animals were spending thousands of dollars trying to bring these animals back to health because they loved them. They cared enough to go and adopt them. And so, you know, I think that's a really good example of what we're seeing. And so, as these repeated complaints came in, we worked with code enforcement, planning. We even reached out to PETA and some of the other state run programs for animal rights. And what we kept running into was that, hey, we don't have an ordinance that defines what a pet shop or a kennel is. And so, this particular business kept having a lot of complaints about the animals that were importing them. And so, we had a lot of complaints about the animals that were importing them. And so, we had a lot of complaints about the play on semantics with us. And so, in order to combat that, we started working with the city attorney and some zoning issues, planning issues, and just trying to drill down to what is it that we need to do to solve this problem so that we can make sure that these animals' welfare were, you know, of utmost importance and just take care of the animals. And that led us to, we need to have an ordinance. So, the result is these types of businesses will then pull permits that that gives us some authority to do that. And so, we're going to have to do that. And so, we're going to have to do that. And so, we're going to have to do that. And so, we're going to engage with those businesses, making sure that they're operating appropriately and some enforcement room should we find that they're not operating to the best well-being of the animals that they're sheltering. Exactly. And it'll allow our animal services division, particularly the animal control officers, to be able to go out and do site inspections whenever we get these complaints. And then, likewise, code enforcement could also go out and do these inspections. Okay. Thank you. Can I add just a little little bit to that? Yeah. I mean, I think it's a great question. I think it's a great question. Little bit to that. Part of the issue that we've had over the last few years, several years, as we've been trying to grapple with this situation is that the state codes are somewhat vague when it comes to housing and pet shops. And because the pet shop laws have been modified over the last several years, pet shops no longer can sell dogs, cats, or rabbits, but they can give space to nonprofits, to humane societies, to animal shelters, to showcase animals for adoption. So there's a lot of gray area, a lot of wiggle room. And we have had some difficulty in enforcing housing requirements because the state laws are very vague. So we wanted to really tighten up the language and really specify what is acceptable housing, what is not acceptable housing, so that we could start enforcing some of the things that we thought were really the major problems. Thanks again for the clarity. All right. Any other questions? I do have one. All right. Council Member Tamman. So just a clarification. So when the state laws are being implemented, what are the things that are being done to make sure that the existing businesses will apply for the permit? Will there be an inspection of the facility before that? So I think that would be a question for planning. Okay. We would certainly be involved in the process because planning wouldn't know the regulations behind the pet shop and kennels and what to look for. But we would partner with planning before they issued a permit. And I would probably send that over to the state. Okay. Thank you, Council Member Tamman and Council Member McG信 . Thank you, Council Member McG信 . Thank you, Council Member McG信 . Thank you, Council Member McG信 . Thank you, Council Member McG信 . Thank you, Council Member McG信 . Thank you, Council Member McG信 . Thank you, Council Member McG信 . Thank you, Council Member McG信 . Thank you, Council Member McG信 . Thank you, Council Member McG信 . Thank you, Council Member McG信 . Thank you, Council Member McG信 . Thank you, Council Member McG信 . inspection to make sure that they comply. So I think all of that's going to be done through the ordinance that's related to the function of the PD and animal control. I think we would probably be coordinating with them to make sure that there's nothing in their ordinance that's incompatible or inconsistent with our land use regulations, the zoning, and the kind of the similar definitions found in Title 19, which are more specific to the land use. As Billy shared previously, there were some nuances about some of the activities taking place, whether they were accessory to a primary use, and that's where there was some grayness. And we worked closely with PD, code enforcement, and sought compliance. And I think what this ordinance is seeking to do is to ensure something that kind of is slightly outside of land use and zoning. It's more about the operations. And the specifics and being consistent with state law and, you know, humaneness and things along those lines. So I'm guessing there will be inspections, but the animal patrol services will be doing that then. Is that correct? That's my understanding, but I'll push it back over to Billy. Yeah, we would work with planning once the permit was requested. I would have Tracy on board. I've worked with building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and because some of the things shared in Engage Chico, and you're recognizing that this may exist around one particular business, maybe more. I'm assuming that once this moves through, there will be some sort of good faith effort to engage these service providers and make sure to get them into compliance rather than kind of bring down the hammer. Can you reassure me on that point? Absolutely, we've been working with this one particular business for several years to bring them into compliance. We have provided them with all kinds of information in terms of the types of complaints we're getting about them. We've worked with them to go and show how they should be housing these animals, how to care for them. We've done multiple meet and greets with these folks to try to keep that partnership going because I honestly do feel like they are trying to do the right thing. They're just missing the mark a little bit when it comes to making sure that the animals are cared for in a humane way. And then the issues of charging the adoption fees that are pretty exorbitant, the medical issues that are stemming from these poor health animals that they're adopting and such. So certainly we'll work with all the people who wanna apply for this permit. And with this one particular business, we're definitely not gonna bring the hammer down without having worked with them continually to educate them on the ordinance. And how to properly run that facility. Thank you so much. Yep. All right. And Mayor, just one quick question by Mayor. Yeah, go ahead Mr. Ruse. Just to confirm, some of these diseases we're talking about are not just dangerous to other animals, but they're also dangerous to humans, to people as well, right? I'm gonna defer that one to Tracy cause I don't know a lot about that stuff. So the main diseases we're seeing, distemper and parvo, specifically just affects dogs, but there are other potential diseases, including rabies that we are concerned about, especially animals that are being brought in from out of country, from other states that have high incidence of rabies in dogs. So there is a potential for zoonotic diseases to be introduced into the community. Thank you. All right. Any other questions? All right. Seeing none, entertain a motion. I'll make a motion to approve. Second. A second. All right, we have a second from Council Member Tannen and a motion from Council Member O'Brien. Madam Clerk, you can take the roll. Okay. I'll give you a second. I apologize, I'm looking for my notes . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Brian, seconded by Councilmember Tandon, to introduce an ordinance of the City Council of the City of Chico, California, amending Title VII, Animals of the Chico Municipal Code, adding Chapter 7.24, Pet Shop and Kennel Regulations, including definitions of pet shop and kennel, and establishing standards of care and permit requirements. Councilmember Bennett. Thank you, Officer Aldrich and Officer Moore. I believe you're an officer, and I'm definitely going to vote yes. Okay. Councilmember Brown. Aye. Councilmember Morgan. Yes. Councilmember O'Brien. Yes. Councilmember Tandon. Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds. Aye. Mayor Coolidge. Aye. Harry 7-0. Right. Thank you, everybody. I appreciate it. And moving on to Item 5.2, Ratification of Mimile of Understanding Service. Employees International Union, SEIU Local 1021. And I believe Director Cannon has the floor. I'm sorry, Mayor Coolidge. I will need to recuse myself because I have a family member who works for SEIU. So I'm going to not participate. Okay. City Clerk, perhaps you can text her when it's time to come back on, or she can listen, of course. Yeah. All right. Go ahead. Good evening, Mayor, Vice Mayor, Councilmembers. The item in front of you is the final action required for the SEIU successor MOU. This MOU in the report as indicated has a cost of approximately $967,000 over the term of the agreement. This is a long-term contract at three years. There are a total salary adjustment number of nine percent that goes between now through January 2023, as well as a one-time non-pensionable incentive payment in recognition of their arduous and hazardous work during the period of COVID and in our population as we currently live. I'm happy to answer any questions, wherever this was a hard-fought MOU, and we are happy to have it at resolution. All right. Do we have any speakers on this item? If you're interested in speaking, please raise your hand. We have one. That is Rob. We actually have two. Rob Berry, let me just unmute. Go ahead, Rob. Hi. I normally wouldn't talk on a subject like this, but in reading through the agreement, I was struck by the $5,000 bonus. And the thing about that is that it it's a $5,000 bonus. And I think it's a good thing that we're able to do that. And it is being issued without regard to either job description or seniority or any other consideration. It's just a blanket $5,000 bonus. The thing that sort of sticks in my craw here, besides the fact that we're talking about a total million-dollar increase to the budget as a result of this, is that the justification for this bonus is in recognition of arduous and hazardous work. And my question is, number one, is there a way to make sure that we're able to do that? And number two, and this seems to be a real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real employee, no matter how long they've worked for the city, are subject to this sort of, you know, hazard. I mean, even being an ambassador downtown has proven to be hazardous. So I'm very concerned about, you know, the level of sophistication or attention that was paid to the details of a negotiation like this, where handing out five grand just because you are part of this union, regardless of what your job description is, it's unfair to those employees who are actually are subjecting themselves to hazards. For example, the people that are cleaning up campgrounds, there's no doubt that they are exposing themselves to hazards doing that. But we also have a lot of other city employees that regularly expose themselves to hazards, including, you know, dog bites and all kinds of things. And so I'm very concerned about that. There's a lot of other things that have been part of this that does not apply universally to every single service employee. So I would just make that observation for your consideration. I don't suspect you're going to change the contract at this point. But I want you to know that that it's noticeable and that I would hope that we would apply a little bit more discipline to our negotiations. Thank you very much. Thank you, Rob. Um, so So, Ruth Sarnoff, this is on the SEIU MOU. Go ahead. Okay. First of all, everybody who lives in this area in Northern California breathes the same air, drinks the same water, and inhales the same smoke. And frankly, smoke is very damaging. And no matter where you are, it's compensated. It's something that everybody's doing. I remember right after the fire when we actually, my daughter and I picketed, well, it wasn't picketed, it was out there with signs out in front of us. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . great. If you have not really good health care, it's cancer producing. I have a list of all of the chemicals that are cancer producing, and I'll put them in the file because I'm going to make a report on this because I have a lot of documentation on hazardous waste and on the history of paving over a lot of hazardous material. We're kind of living on, the best way I can describe it is we're living on Swiss cheese, you know, the kind with the big holes and the little holes. And, you know, a good example of that is Oklahoma, where they get a little shake about every, I don't know what it is, about every 20 minutes or something like that. And that, is because they took so much out of the ground. And now, you know, they had storms and stuff that drove them out of Oklahoma. And then a little bit later, it was Arkansas. And it was other places. Everything has a history, and we have a history of a lot of volcanic action that's going on right now in the Antwerp. I was in the Arctic and around an island called Tonga. And I spoke to it at the very end of one of the, my presentations at the last meeting. And I would suggest you check it out. Right near it is, is the whole islands, the Spanish island there. And there's other ones, but it's a kind of a remote part of the Pacific. But there's a lot of stuff going on in Antarctica. You should know about it, you should learn about it. Thank you. Thank you, Ruth. Our last speaker is Julie Three. Go ahead, Julie. Julie, can you unmute yourself? Give her just a second. Oh, go ahead, Julie. Okay, she, hold on one second. Let me try this one more time. Julie, are you there? So, Julie, if you want to email me your comments, I'll make sure the council gets that. Okay. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . all right okay so um any comments from council all right i'd just like to say i'm glad we got this done i think it it's important that uh you know we honor our groups and the especially the hard working folks of seiu so glad to see this moving forward um do we have a motion with that i'll move approval i'll second i have a second from council member morgan uh madam clark did you take the role council member bennett yes council member brown well deserved and long overdue yes council member morgan yes council member o'brien yes council member tandon excuse me she's disqualified on this one vice mayor reynolds hi mayor coolidge hi carry six zero with one disqualification all right we'll move on to let's see our time here okay we'll go ahead and move on to item uh 5.3 vice mayor reynolds request letter in support of ab1599 uh vice mayor reynolds all right i just want to thank the council for considering um a support letter of support for ab1599 um i don't think chico is much different than the rest of the state and seeing an uptick in crime um despite some other information that's been brought forward i was happy to see that the board of supervisors recently also supported this bill with only one member abstaining with the staff and our sheriff and d.a both spoke in favor of this with that i would like to ask our police chief to come forward i know there's some recent information that we're seeing that's been brought forward and we're seeing some of the information that he's got from our local um statistics and i ask that he maybe share some of those with us before we move forward in our carbon's conversation yeah thank you uh council there's uh been no question over the last couple years uh for me in the years that i've been doing this job uh really the negative impacts of prop 47 uh you know i i totally understand uh the dynamics regarding uh you know criminal justice reform and looking at different ways to do things but but one of the problems that i've always had with this bill it addresses certain crimes that are actually relatable so uh what prop 47 did was it reduced penalties and crimes as it's related to controlled substances and possession of those it also highly impacted uh lowering standards penalties and crimes as it pertained to larceny which is theft my experience in 30 years is is drug addiction and drug abuse goes hand in hand with that and so we really saw the impacts over the years with prop 47 and now you know we're living in a different time since 2014 when this bill was enacted if you remember and take council back a few years we had a dr andy miller come to town as our public health doctor and identified that uh not only across the nation but here in butte county we were in a major opiate crisis these were drugs that were being uh these were pharmaceuticals uh highly addictive drugs um being prescribed at an alarming rate and so uh your your medical uh profession your medical community really took heed to that and what we saw in the last couple years is a reduction in those types of uh uh pharmaceuticals out um in our community but anytime you restrict you know uh drugs or or illicit uh chemicals to you know make these type of drugs you're gonna see illicit drugs rise up and that's what we're seeing right now what we're seeing is um incredibly strong illicit drugs out on our street uh when they reduced the opiate crisis by pharmaceuticals we saw an intense rise of black and white drugs and we saw an intense rise of black and white drugs out in our community so we're seeing a lot of drug use in our community and we're seeing a lot of drug use in our community um that i haven't seen in 30 years uh methamphetamine's always been a major problem in this community and in this region and now we're seeing black market we're seeing counterfeit opiate pills coming into our community alarming rate and what's most concerning now is the most powerful drug i've ever seen on the street is fentanyl and so with prop 47 it's not allowing law enforcement it's not allowing the judicial process to hold any accountability for individuals and individuals and individuals and individuals and individuals and individuals and individuals and individuals and individuals and individuals and individuals and individuals and individuals and individuals and individuals and individuals and individuals and individuals and individuals and individuals and individuals and individuals and individuals and individuals and individuals and individuals and individuals and individuals and individuals and individuals and individuals and individuals and individuals and individuals and individuals and individuals and individuals and individuals and individuals and individuals and individuals and individuals and individuals and individuals and individuals and individuals and individuals and individuals and individuals and individuals and individuals and individuals and individuals and individuals and individuals and of dealing with several people on the street back in the day who attended drug court, collaborative court system, where it was a diversion program for possession of drugs. And we were seeing incredible successes right here in Butte County. When they reduced these crimes, drug court essentially went away. We have not seen the participation. We have not seen the successes. And I don't have to tell anybody on the Zoom of what we're seeing out on the streets as far as drug addiction and these really scary, high-profile illicit drugs that are taking control of our community. So with that and lowering larceny charges, lowering the threshold of property-type crimes that were occurring, those two go hand in hand. And to me, Prop 47 put us on a collision course of where we're at today. All right. Any questions for Vice Mayor Reynolds or Chief Matt? I just have a follow-up question for Chief Madden. Just to clarify, Chief, the laws for selling distribution of those substances did not change with the passage of Prop 47 by the voters, right? What did change is possession. And so, you know, we go out and we make arrests all the time for possession of controlled substances. But what it does is it's reduced those crimes down. And so, you know, we're not able to see the fruits of our efforts to try to reduce these drugs on our streets. Right. But for dealing those drugs, the law didn't change. Is that correct? You might be distributing them on the streets. Prop 47, no. But I'm sure there's other reform bills that did because I'm not seeing the sentences and things like that. I'm not seeing a reduction. The full removal of full removal and removal and removal and removal and removal and removal and removal and removal and removal and removal and removal and removal and removal and removal and removal and removal and removal and removal and removal and removal and removal and removal and removal and removal and removal and removal and removal and removal and removal and removal and removal and removal and removal and removal and removal and removal and removal and removal and removal and removal and removal and removal and removal and removal and removal and removal and removal and removal and removal and removal and removal and removal and removal and removal and removal and removal and removal and removal and removal and removal and removal and removal and removal and removal and removal and removal and removal and removal and removal and removal and removal and removal and removal and removal and removal and removal and removal and removal and removal and removal and removal and removal and removal and removal and removal and removal and removal and removal and removal and removal and removal and removal and removal and removal and removal and removal and removal and removal and removal and removal and removal and removal and removal and removal and removal and removal and removal and removal and and basically made an infraction. And it also required the judicial system to have multiple violations before penalties can occur. So that's another problem that we see with Prop 47. Thank you. And I so appreciate that. So sorry, I'm sorry to press here. I think what I'm asking primarily is about dealing drugs. And if there's an amount, like a threshold amount for enforcing higher penalties, if somebody is in possession of a certain amount or above a certain amount, are additional laws enforceable? I believe those come in jury instructions and through the district attorney, through the judicial process, similar to a DUI when you talked about like blood alcohol levels. Thank you, Chief. All right, further questions from council? All right, do we have any public comment on this item? Yes, people are starting to raise their hands. We'll start with Nicole Navas. Go ahead, Nicole. Okay, can you hear me? Yes. All right, so I come out in big support of you all getting this letter over in support of AB 1599. I don't think it goes nearly far enough per se. I'd like to see some of the other props looked at too, but this is a good start. We have to begin somewhere. And one thing I want to comment that I think what I like to see, this shift with our council, is that there is some mindfulness going on here. Because if you take this piece, you're doing what you can to at least say, we as a municipality see this issue. We need you as the state to take control, get this back before the voters so that we can all speak again and hopefully land in a safer community and a safer state. Taken with the fact that you guys are also have authorized and sent the letter to the state, about getting some help about amending some pieces of mental health bills and to hopefully get some funding pulled down and appropriate programs. These are two very good things. My hope is that we stay in this vein of going, okay, we're not helpless as a community. You guys are a governmental body that can ask for what you need and you can collaborate with the Butte County Board of Supervisors to push that will and to the other surrounding communities. Okay. And then you're mighty, right? And we can actually start getting some stuff done. So kudos on things like this. Keep looking for these type of opportunities. And as to the chiefs part of the presentation, I truly do appreciate that perspective. And I know these because I've dug into this. I'd like to also say, I really do. We keep saying like, get back, look at that place where we were doing that community court, the individual assessment kind of a thing where we can try to innovate and pivot here in our community to help people with upfront early assessment and intervention opportunities to hopefully avoid jail. But there are certainly cases where sometimes that diversion isn't possible. And the problematic thing is people are taking advantage, right? They've landed in that space. They totally get how much it is with the 950 threshold, some of those wobbler situations. So they're taking their chances and going, okay, if I do any time, it's going to be a little bit of time. That doesn't protect these communities. So I appreciate the chief vocalizing that they need this. I would like to also ask that you guys really lean on the DA to get these things on the docket and to be willing to follow through when you guys are doing arrest, because I know you really need that support too. I know it's hard to be in the field right now. And I just want to encourage you to do things like this, collaborate. And let's start working on a top 20 program too, or top 10, if you got to start somewhere. Let's get those that are causing the most chaos in the community, the proper kind of attention to mitigate the impacts. Thank you so much for your time. Thank you, Nicole. Our next speaker is Jessica Giannola. And go ahead, Jessica. Madam Clerk, how many speakers do we have? I can't see. There's like two more after this. Oh, okay. All right. Perfect. Thank you. Thank you. Um, I, I, well, right off the bat, I would say that I, I do not give my full support in this letter of, um, support for Prop 47. That's in relation to Bill 1599. And, and because, um, there are some aspects that I think are needing to be reassessed. I think when people voted for this item, it wasn't properly, uh, researched. And there are some, like, there's some sex offender areas that, that maybe didn't belong in having, um, a reduction in, in, how. how people were, you know, the things that they did wrong. The things that I don't agree with, and I do not want to see us going backwards, would be the drug possession. Selling is one thing. Selling your dealer. You're giving that drug out there to the community. Possession, possession, and even theft. These two, they are closely related because they're signifying there's a deficit going on. There's a lack of access to a resource. And that's why people are generally, they're stealing. They're stealing to survive. And they're doing, they have developed an addiction, like from the opioids, when the doctors stop prescribing that medication, heroin is the next closest thing that the brain can latch onto and try and sustain itself. That we can see that people aren't able to really survive on it. Eventually they're spiraling completely. Their life is lost. But they're in that. They're in that situation. And we're seeing an increase because our collective situations are getting worse across the country. Everything is getting worse right now. We have inflation. We're heading towards a recession. I mean, everything's bad. So we would see also people's desperation getting higher. We would see more addiction happening because we don't have the health system in place to treat people. We do not have equal access to regular basic healthcare. We have no less having addiction services. So I would like to see support. We can individually support a comeback of the drug court. If that was successful, why aren't we doing that now? Why are we having to wait till we change these ordinances and these codes and having people spend more time in prison because they had possession of something or they're trying to survive? That's not helping them. More services towards prevention base. How do we intervene before that takes place? Do we have youth-based services out there enough that people can access and mental health services available in the community so that they're not leaning into an addiction that then spirals out of control? So I would support an amendment. But as the bill's written now, I would not support it. And thank you. Thank you, Jessica. So Ruth Sarnoff is our next speaker. And Ruth, this is on the letter of support for our assembly bill. Fifteen ninety nine. Go ahead, Ruth. First, I would like to to speak to the the whole issue of. Of the history of legislation, the the full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full and full for a piece of, he had a environmental report and it was like, see, I'm an environmentalist, I blah, blah, blah. In the course of it, in about page four or five, there was a list of all the chemicals that were destroying and cancer producing. There were pages and pages. And when they were put on this list and all this stuff, I have a lot of documentation and I'm going to make that available to also. And if somebody is listening, I don't know exactly the best route to file a Brown Act, freedom of information, whatever, but I have lots of documents. And I can tell you that the, the, the list of their, on their prescription drugs, because the prescription drugs are a big part of the drug problem. So if you have, you know, why people still trust JJ, that's Johnson and Johnson who gave us taupe powder, which is very bad for babies. And, and, and also put the, the fire prevention stuff in the pajamas. And when we, they were called out on that, then they shipped them to Europe and to other parts of the world. So we stopped their use here, but then it went somewhere else. And I think some look at, you know, we're talking about toxic substances and are extremely important. And I think leaving it to a legislature that's so heavily supported by pharma, big pharma is a mistake. Thank you, Ruth. Your time is up. Our last speaker is Katie Posey. Go ahead and unmute yourself. Hi everybody. Good evening. I just wanted to add that I am glad that you have this letter to send. And I also just want to add my support to Nicole's comment earlier just about how I think it's great that the city is kind of working and doing some of the same things and sending letters as the county. And I also wanted to mention, I wanted to say thanks to Chief Madden for sharing. I listened to the Board of Supervisors presentation about this letter, and it was really helpful to hear the DA talk more in depth about what this bill, what Proposition 47 has actually done and what Assembly Bill 1599 is trying to accomplish. And so I think that's great. And as you know, the Board of Supervisors voted to support this. So I think that it's a positive move, and thanks for considering it. Thank you. And she was our last speaker, Mayor. All right. Thank you. All right. Further discussion from Council or entertain a motion? I'll move to approve. I'll second that. All right. We have a motion and a second. Madam Clerk, can you take the roll? I have some comments I'd like to make before we take the roll. Go ahead, Council Member Brown. Thanks. I was, of course, willing to hear this item and read the letter that Vice Mayor ran. It's attached for consideration. Obviously, I appreciate our ability to advocate for higher level policy change. I think it's important. I wasn't sure I would support this. I needed to do some additional research. And Vice Mayor Reynolds, as the letter mentions that you shared, what this policy does is revert us back to where we were before Prop 47 was passed by the voters. And it does make that argument with one primary point that crime has increased due to Prop 47. I appreciate that you shared the bill language with Council. And that you cited a report by the Public Policy Institute of California in your letter. I actually had the chance to read that report thanks to you citing it, which researched the effects of Prop 47 on crime and recidivism. Because the letter you're requesting to send in says a 2018 report by Public Policy Institute of California found that the passage of Prop 47 directly correlated to 9% uptick in larceny thefts throughout the state. I just want to read it a little bit more context for the good of the public from that report. So it says, despite fluctuations since 2013, the monthly rate of larceny thefts has been steadily drifting down to lows of about 125 per 100,000 residents. This number then increases about 10% in late 2014 and 2015 before returning to roughly pre-reform levels in 2016. The report goes on to say, despite recent upticks, California's crime rates remain comparable to the low rates observed in the 1960s, even with dramatic reductions and increases. The report goes on to say, despite recent upticks, California's crime rates remain comparable to the low rates observed in theал passing of Prop 47. The one thing I want to note that it also mentions is that the funds saved in incarcerating people are meant to build treatment programs to reduce and to reduce recidivism. And certainly, I'd like to know more about those programs and their efficacy before throwing out that funding stream too. So that report certainly doesn't tell the entire story. Obviously, there's anecdotal, there's local experience to be shared. But it does inform my belief that asking the voters to bring us back to square one based on arguments about crime isn't the best choice here. Obviously, we do need strategies and policies for addressing the gaps in this proposition and the increases in crime that have occurred, particularly with vehicle thefts. But other than that data point, I think undoing the entire reform doesn't appear to be the answer and doesn't appear to be data-driven. That doesn't mean that Prop 47 was the very best option. As it could have been for the criminal justice system, propositions often contain flaring issues. But passing the proposition was the will of California voters. And so for that reason and the reasons I just listed, I'm going to be voting no on sending this letter of support to put it back in front of the voters. Thank you. All right. Further comment? I just have one quick comment. Some of the data that's not addressed in that study, and I appreciate Council Member Brown bringing this to our attention, is the fact that overdose deaths, not only in this county, in the state, but across the country are going up substantially. And it is a true, true concern, it should be for all of us, that we're doing something that is missing the mark. And that missing the mark is drug court. And as Chief Madden so eloquently stated, Prop 47 has decimated our drug courts. And this, in essence, has decimated rehabilitation. That means people are not getting the help they need. And that is one of the data points that is not being discussed. And we need to be aware of that. All right. Thank you. Council Member O'Brien. Any further comment from Council? All right. Madam Clerk, can you take the roll? Council Member Bennett. Thank you, Vice Mayor Reynolds, for bringing this to our attention. I vote yes. Mayor, did we have a motion? Yes. Yeah, we did. Thank you. It was a motion by Council Member Morgan, seconded by you. Oh, thank you. Yes. That's how quickly we forget, right? Good job, Mike. Yeah. Thank you. So, Council Member Brown. Very respectfully, no. Okay. Council Member Morgan. Very respectfully, yes. Council Member O'Brien. Just a plain yes. Council Member Tandon. Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds. Aye. And Mayor Coolidge. Aye. Carries 6-1. All right. We're going to take a short break. We'll come back in, let's say, 12 minutes. All right. I was going to remind you of that. I guess I don't have to. All right. Let's make sure everybody's back, and then we'll get restarted. All right. Mike Dale and there's Sean. I'm here. All right. Dale, how about you? I do not see him on. I do not see Councilmember Bennett either. All right. All right. I will reach out to him and see what happens. Yeah, if you could. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Still not seeing him on. All right. Why don't we go ahead and proceed and hopefully he can join us as we move forward here. All right. So coming back after our break, item 5.4 is actually my request for a review of the Bidwell Park and Playground. Commission, well, a review by the Bidwell Park and Playground Commission of Park Rules. In talking with several of our commission members, as well as lots of folks, you know, just as we move forward with some of the cleanup of various areas, I believe it's timely to look at, you know, things like park closing times, drug-free zones, enhanced signage in the park. I know we've had some issues with weapons, such as long knives and machetes. I know we've had some issues with weapons, such as long knives and machetes. And axes being carried in the park. I'd like them to review that. Of course, always of paramount importance is bicycle and road safety throughout the park. You know, I'd love to have them look at perhaps closing the park road or closing the park road more often than vehicles, if necessary. Maybe we could even include some of the barbecue locations that, you know, have been an issue in terms of potential fire risk. And depending on where they're located. I don't know where they are, but noise ordinances, code of conduct, things like that. And I, you know, this is really why we have our commission. I believe we have some good capable folks there. So I'd like to just see them kind of hash this out and bring it to us. And nothing more really beyond that. So, you know, I trust them to do the job they're put in place to do. So, is there any questions? I have a couple questions for you, Mayor Coolidge, but I also have one for, I believe, Chief Madden. Maybe someone else. If you wouldn't mind. Go ahead. I just, I don't know if Chief Madden is available. Yeah. Thank you. Just checking. Are there not already laws related to carrying long knives, weapons, axes, and machetes in public spaces? There is. But, you know, at the will of council, if you wanted to get more, you know, stringent on those types of rules, there's a lot of rules. When it comes to weapons, whether they're concealed, you know, just the mere possession of them, those types of things. So I'm not sure exactly what Mayor Coolidge is, was wanting to discuss there. But there are obviously rules when it comes to dangerous weapons. But, but again, you know, the nice thing about ordinances is, you know, council's directive is to maybe make those more stringent, depending on our situation in our parks and waterways. Okay. Thank you. And one follow up. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. There are also already laws related to drug use in public spaces. Is that correct? That's correct. And this, this may be for you, maybe for someone else. Noise ordinances. We also have those in place for public spaces. We do. But generally our noise ordinances have to do with geographical locations, such as downtown and, you know, south campus area, those types of things. Okay. Thank you. I know that we have park closure times listed. And our ordinances are the web ordinances that we have. Can somebody just let me know what our current park closure times are and our, and the hours that folks are allowed based on the laws that happen on quality path. Mr. Goss. Yeah. I could add that it will park commission heard that I believe at their July meeting of 2021. Originally park closure times were standardized to 11 PM to kind of. of parallel with Chico Area Recreation District card park closing times. The commission moved that up an hour to 10 p.m. So if there's, you know, we maybe want some direction from council on when exactly, you know, what, unless we're just wanting the park commission to kind of discuss maybe some earlier closing times in particular park areas. But if there's anything, you know, beyond 10 p.m. that we'd kind of want some clear direction on and to kind of guide the commission on those discussions. Okay, that makes sense. There's also like closure hours for waterways that are specific to, right, sunrise to sunset or something like that written in our ordinances. Is that right? It used to be that way. It was, I believe it was a half hour after dusk, which led to, you know, a lot of, there's a lot of variables there and, you know, one could, you know, interpret that many different ways, which led, you know, it was kind of problematic. But I think most park goers had the general idea. There's some that tried to push the envelope. So that's when we went to the time. I think that's what kind of lent. To the discussion last July, I was kind of getting away from the ambiguity of, you know, a half hour after dusk to an actual time closure. Great. And sorry, just to repeat, we have that on the books currently as 10 p.m.? Correct. Okay, thank you. Very cool. A couple, or one question specifically for you, or two, what kinds of signage updates are you looking for? That was intriguing to me. So I just wanted to hear a little bit more about it. Well, I mean, particularly in regards to, you know, obviously if we need something in regards to, let's say, if there's a lot of threats in the park, if those signs need to be reviewed and changed, fire, you know, wildfire warnings, things along those lines, anything that may need to be updated. But I think that the, obviously, council level isn't really where that discussion needs to take place in that review. But I think the park commission would be a really good place to kind of hash that out and look at the specific signs, see what could be updated. Just provide maybe, you know, further park rule signs, maybe change those signs relative to whatever. You know, aspect that they think needs to be appropriate. But yeah. Great. Yeah. I would be interested in exploring that. And this may come with a similar answer, but code of conduct issues. Is that kind of related to the signage, wanting to make sure that there's particular... It is. I mean, obviously we have in place some code of conduct when you come into the park. You know, there's obviously things that are listed on that signage. You know, I think a review of any and all of that is, you know, something that needs to be done. Yeah. And, you know, particularly as we're updating signs and updating drug-free zones or things along those lines. So, and to answer your question too, I mean, obviously I know we have noise ordinances on the book for the city as, you know, in particular areas, I know we have, you know, laws that say weapons can't be carried, but, you know, we, you know, and that drugs can't be used. But, you know, I do believe that the drug-free zones in the park can be beneficial. And, you know, we have other areas that could be covered by that particularly. You know, we could look at, depending on what the park commission wants, whether or not, you know, we have more stringent guidelines or less stringent guidelines, you know, just kind of let them hash out those specifics. But I think it's important kind of as we move forward here, because we haven't really had a council review of that sent out from the park commission in a while. I think those need to be looked at, particularly in terms of bike and road safety. You know, the road through lower park is, you know, I get that complaint very often from a lot of my constituents that, you know, the vehicle traffic mixed with the pedestrian traffic, particularly on weekends, can be very dangerous sometimes. You know, we've had some incidents over the years that have occurred there. You know, obviously we have damage to the road because of the vehicles and it's mainly a pedestrian road. Anyone who's gone through lower park on that road knows those issues. So, you know, I think it's just a good time, especially as our city grows, to look at that particularly and just kind of, you know, move forward and see what the park commission wants. And I think that's a good time to look at that and see what the park commission thinks and hash it out there where people can comment on it directly. Thank you. Yeah. Any other questions? Mayor, I have a question. When was the last time this was done? That might be a question for Eric. That's probably best asked to Mr. Gustafson. On some of these items, I mean, there's, I know the park closing times was updated this last summer. There's been various comments. There's been conversations at the park commission level on a handful of these items, but I don't think a whole lot of clear direction on making changes. So maybe I think now that this is council driven, it will really, you know, cause the park commission to take a hard look at this. And we have a new park commission, a lot of new commissioners. So it's probably good. And I can, I appreciate the comment by Mayor Coolidge on, you know, looking at these items through the lens of the population has increased, dramatically increased over the last few years. And so I think it's a good opportunity to kind of renew some of these and make sure we're in line. And with current standards and, and doing the right thing. Any further questions? All right. Madam Clerk, do we have any public comment? We do, we have a couple. Nicole Nava, go ahead. Thank you. Can you hear me? Yes. Okay. All right. Well, so I read through this item and I think it's going to be a little bit more complicated than I thought it would be. I think it's good that we do a rehash of things and make sure everything's appropriate. But I'd like to preface this by saying this is only so good as the willingness to embrace what the rules are and to enforce the rules accordingly. And we've all been put on pause mode. And I believe that depending upon status, certain people have been getting a free pass. And that is not acceptable. And so I look forward to this city re-embracing what civility means and what a social contract means as part of a community, which means enforcement of our laws. And so all these things listed like the park closing time, drug-free zone, et cetera, enhanced signage, all of that is important and needs to be looked at and the bicycle and road safety. So I appreciate a visit of this, but again, I would love to see actual traction to things happening. In regards to like the fire risk item, that is a big deal. And so even lately there's been confusion about what can and can't be enforced as it relates to fires in our public spaces. And it's been said, you can't have fire in there unless it's in the proper barbecue receptacle and not at high red fire risk times. And so as we're aware, there's been issues with a lot of transient fires that go unchecked and that have caused a lot of fire. We have just a drain on our city resources. One just happened the other day along railroad tracks. And there's family in the area there. And I was concerned, and this is not okay. And so it'd be good to have some clarity from both chiefs to land on who is responsible because I've heard it's from it's CPD who has to take responsibility for siting. But then we also hear, well, if it's a warming fire, people just get counseled and that CFD just warns them. and tells them to put it out. I don't think we're experiencing a level of comfort with that as a solution and mitigation. We need prevention and we need citations and we need adherence to our rules of law. And so if those rules are in question, such as some of these park ones, then good. We need to review them and make sure that they're aligned and they meet the expectations of this community and that they get addressed. And I would ask that the same happen in that regard to making it clear to this community, maybe via press release about, is it against the law to have a warming fire? Yes or no. And if it's yes, who is the enforcing entity and what is your ability to do that? So those are my comments tonight. Thank you. Thank you, Nicole. Our next speaker is Jessica Giannola. Go ahead and unmute yourself. Thank you, counsel. Listening to the proposed change, different topics in areas like weaponry or animals or fires, I just really can't help but think that this is really, I mean, what's behind it. And it feels like maybe we're, the city's just trying to get creative in how can we make sure that we do not have unhoused folks in our parks after certain times or living there or whatever it might be. It seems like we should be able to enforce our reasonable existing rules of law. I think that's a really good point. I think that's a really good point and I've experienced real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real rather than trying to change up verbiage for some pretty common sense regulations that we already have down in the books. And we should be able to address those as is without changing the signage and staff time, etc. So I just would encourage the city to kind of just work with what you have right now without having to add costs onto us. Unless those costs get pushed down the line and eventually we'll see another proposal for another tax increase because we still haven't fixed the things that haven't been fixed yet. So hopefully you'll make a sound decision tonight that it's cost conservative there. All right. Thank you. Good night. Thank you, Jessica. Katie Posey, go ahead and unmute yourself. Good evening, everyone. Again, I just wanted to thank you. I want to thank Mayor Coolidge for bringing this on the agenda. I think this is a good idea. Even if you look at the mission of the commission, it's to ensure that the city's parks and greenways are preserved and enhanced for this in future generations. And so obviously that's there in the letter, the email from Andrew Coolidge. The goal is to bring back the original Bidwell Park experience and family feel. So I think anything. That contributes to that is good. I do agree with what Nicole mentioned about this idea that there are rules, but if they're not enforced, you know what, what good is that? So I think that definitely needs to be considered and thought about as you go forward with this. But I think it's great. I also noticed that the next meeting for the commission is the 17th at 6 p.m. If anybody in the public wants to get on and comment. I mean, I know that this probably won't be on their agenda yet. I'm not sure. But. Just to kind of encourage other members of the public that want to talk to them about some of these issues. I think that's a great idea to remember that they meet on Zoom. Thanks, everybody. Okay. And then our next speaker is Ruth Sarnoff. And Ruth, this is on park rules being reviewed by the Park Commission. Got it? Yes. Go ahead. Well, this is really a very important thing, this whole thing with the parks. Now, we have lower Bidwell Park and then we have upper Bidwell Park. And they kind of seem to be on two different systems here. When we have needed to, we bring the goats. We have brought the goats up to upper Bidwell. Okay. They serve as a full building and serve as a full building and serve as full building and serve as full building and serve as full building and serve as full building and serve as full building and serve as full building and serve as full building and serve as full building and serve as full building and serve as full building and serve as full building and serve as full building and serve as full building and serve as full building and serve as full building and serve as full building and serve as full building and serve as full building and serve as full building and serve as full building and serve as full building and serve as full building and serve as full building and serve as full building and serve as full building and serve as full building and serve as full building and serve as full building and serve as full building and serve as full building and serve as full building and serve as full building and serve as full building and serve as full building and serve as full building and serve as full building and serve as full building and serve as full building and serve as full building and serve as full building and serve as full building and serve as full It was raised once, and I remember the city manager, Mark Orm, said, well, maybe we could do it down, put goats down there if we had enough money or we could do it or something, something like that. And I'm just thinking, you know, come on, that's an infinitesimal difference in the amount of money being spent, considering that a lot of money is spent with absolutely no good return. And the other thing is, I think that a lot of things need to be looked at, not based on seasons anymore, because I'm checking out the rain perspective for the whole coming period. It's nothing. It's nothing on the horizon for about two weeks at least, which we get the forecast and there's nothing coming down. So, you know, we have very low water in reservoirs in Lake Mead and all these reservoirs. The Colorado River is compromised, the Mississippi River, all our rivers in America are compromised. And so if we don't use the weather maps and start looking at things based on what the actual weather is, then we're not going to be able to do anything. But we have to look at the weather, the weather is now because we're kind of we're kind of off of season. Seasons are not very dependable, which is why agriculture is having a really hard time. So and so, you know, looking at it a little bit differently, I think is really important. And I see no reason why people should not be able to come to that morning meeting on the I believe it's the 25th here. It's the the council. It's the commission meeting. And and it's nine o'clock in the morning. I think it's on the 25th. And I don't see why somebody can't come to a commission meeting because I went to one with Molly McKusen years ago. So I can do it. Thank you, Ruth. Your time is up. Thank you. She was our last speaker, Mayor Coolidge. Okay. So further counsel. And I'll go first. I think I've been through not certainly the park. When we updated the AP and P's, we had a committee that did it and we brought back the things we thought would like to change. I think what I'm hearing a little bit, maybe it's time to look at this. If the park commission wants to do that and go over everything, it's just a lot of work. But if they want to do it, they can do it and then comes back to council. But it needs to almost be bullet points as to things that we're willing to change and not change. But I would not want to see a complete revamping of things. I don't think that they have the time or necessarily the qualifications to do it. I don't want to see Eric and his staff and other staff pulled into that for some of the obvious reasons. They've got plenty of other things going on. But if the park commission wants to get into where they think they can get the biggest bang for the buck, if there are changes, it can be very, very important. Maybe make and then send them back to us, I'm fine with that, I just don't want to open a gigantic can of worms . I think that sounds like a good motion, if you want to make it . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . make the motion that this gets sent to the park commission with the understanding that they're not rewriting all of the rules uh to fit whatever their motivation may be and we're looking for broad strokes that the council can either um approve or disapprove i'll make that motion if it fits for your that makes sense to me yeah okay all right do we have a second i'll second that all right uh madam clerk take the role please member bennett i'm not sure are you on yeah were we able to get him back or no i'll vote for dale i don't think so uh council member brown dale are you there i'm here okay what am i voting on the park rules being some of the park rules being reviewed by the park commission and the council of the park commission and the council of park commission yeah and if you didn't hear the discussion you could certainly upset yeah go yes that's it i can hang this one up okay council member brown i appreciate the clarity and motion and the motion yes i think i can hang this one up council member morgan yes council member o'brien yes council member tandon yes vice mayor wong yes council member reynolds aye mayor coolidge aye carry seven zero all right moving on to item 5.5 a review uh well informational update on the 150th year celebration and i believe we have uh miss mccarthy on this one yes is she there right there she is right yes good evening mayor poolidge vice mayor reynolds members of the council i'm jennifer mccarthy deputy city manager and january 4th the council requested that staff work with the community to create an opportunity for the community to celebrate chico's 150-year birthday this would be an opportunity to honor our heritage as well as celebrate our city the direction from the council included that the celebration be cost neutral and involve limited staff time tonight my role is just to provide you an update on the planning process to date since the original direction was provided the city manager pulled together a great group of community members to really gain their input into how best involve the community into Chico's 150-year celebration. And really not surprisingly, this group came up with some pretty amazing ideas. The concept that was born out of these discussions was 150 days of celebration. And I stress the word concept because things are very much in the planning stages at this point. During the 150 days of celebration, the community will be provided opportunities to learn, to experience, and to explore our community. The 150 days will be bookend by two major events. We hope the first one will be aligned with the celebration of People Parade planned for the first weekend in May. And the second will be another large community celebration that will be held in September on the other side of town. During the 150 days between the two large events, other events, activities, and educational opportunities will be incorporated into the 150-day celebration. And we hope that the 150-day celebration will be highlighted for individuals to participate in. Now, these will be existing events that would be held regardless of the 150-year anniversary. So examples would include such items as exhibits at the Discovery Science Museum, nature walks in Bidwell Park, Armour's Markets, historical tours, including Bidwell Mansion and others, entertainment events, art exhibits, and community lectures, and obviously other events as well. All of the highlighted events during the 150 days could be branded with the banner that you can now see on many of the electronic signatures from city employees. It's a green banner that states the City of Chico's 150-year celebration with a wonderful tagline that says, Rooted in Community, which is really the tagline for this 150 days of celebration. We are rooted in community, looking at our past, looking at our present, and then looking at our future. In addition, we're contemplating utilizing a passbook and an online calendar that will highlight the events and provide information on when and where residents and visitors can learn, experience, and explore a community during the 150 days of celebration. And to reiterate, all of this is still in the planning phases. The City of Chico has not been asked to fund any of the projects or programs being considered. Instead, this would be done through community partnerships and private sponsorships. Also, we are looking at the planning process. So, in terms of staff time, while I am participating in the planning meetings, the concept is the City is not leading the implementation of this plan, but rather being a partner in the planning process. Another, on a side note, another interesting fact is that our Clerk's Office has been doing some historical research related to city government, and we look forward to sharing with the public some of these historical tidbits through the City's social media pages. In fact, you might want to check out today's social media posts, because there's an interesting one that was just posted today . So, at this point, I'm happy to answer any questions that you might have, as well as accept any feedback . Thank you . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . to speakers from the public then uh we have a show of hands on how many um so we have two right now nicole nava go ahead just a second make sure go ahead nicole thank you so on this one i just i was curious if the by community members involvement if there was like a survey for people interested in who were kind of coming up with those ideas so i don't remember seeing that if i did i blurred it out sorry um but i think it's an important that if we are going to recognize things like this that it definitely has different voices throughout the community who have a stamp on it um i think that's great that there's going to be those events that you spoke of and i think it is important to highlight that what i've heard community members say before is that it's important to get it out via different mediums because not everybody's techie um that maybe embrace the community calendars that are part of our local news media that would be print and tv and maybe if there's some kind of email sign up if people are more old-fashioned and prefer it that way um and things like that so that you can get um a diverse uh population also attending these events um i i'm glad to hear about the parade and something else because i was gonna like submit an idea that it would be fun to like do something that is kind of community-minded as far as social breaking bread together that's a good way of healing and unifying a community right is having something so maybe it could be a cool multicultural food event and have people bring things that are region specific to them and where how they were raised and like booths and clothing and whatever people want to do that if others are willing to do it i get the city uh needs to be mindful not to have a cost footprint necessarily in the picture but i just think those would be kind of some fun things to consider and maybe even a way to kind of kind of group with some places in the community that you might not think about that would be good, like Dorothy Johnson Center puts on things, maybe they have some ideas that would be relative to that, maybe Area Agency on Aging and things like that, so that we ensure that our elderly are also considered. Thanks. Thank you, Nicole. Jessica Giannola. Thank you, Council. I just first want to just appreciate some things that Nicole had mentioned about having some, you know, potential cultural sensitivity and cost-inclusive aspects involved with any sort of celebration for the city. I also just wanted to touch back on the last time that this subject was brought up, and I commented, I wasn't hearing that this part is being proposed, but I think it's important to note that this is a part of the city's just yet when it comes to celebration, and that's going to be when it comes to considering how Chico was formed 150 years ago, what was life like then, who were the people of the lands, and how did Chico develop into the community and city that it is today, and a part of every celebration and positive in life, there's going to be a dark side too, and I think it's important for the people who live here that we do know our full history, and acknowledge, acknowledge the people, the lands that were moved, some, many, many were killed, and that's just part of our history, and when we're celebrating something like, okay, we have this city, it was birthed, but at the cost of some lives, how are we acknowledging that when we're celebrating where we are today? Are we being sensitive to the culture and the people who lived here hundreds of years? I think it's important to acknowledge that we're celebrating longer, you know, it's just, I just, I'm not seeing that in our proposal yet, considering that we have a very involved, amazing people, amazing people who are out there, and trying to rehabilitate our fields and lands and nature, and there are friends in the area, and it just seems like we should acknowledge them, and people who, they're descendants of people who have lived here for a long time, and I think it's important to acknowledge that we're living here for a long time, and I think it's important to acknowledge that we're living here for a long time, sacrificed, and, and we, we own that privilege today, living here in Chico, and the life that we have today, so I just wish that we would hopefully incorporate that as we celebrate our city, and our growth, and, and the vision that we have for the future, for all of us together, right? That's all, thank you. Thank you, Jessica. So, Ruth Sarnoff, and then I have another one as well. Ruth, this is the 150th year celebration for the city of Chico. Go ahead. Okay. Oh, yeah, I am. Okay. Well, first of all, I don't want to be picky, but the incorporation of Chico was in 62, not 72, but who wants to, to say you've changed so many things, and, and layered things on top of things, and created to it new agencies, but I think it's true that having a tree be the symbol, and it's on all the documents I have, I have it at 62, but we'll handle 72, and that makes it 150 years, so okay, you have a round number to work with. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . something around that. Earth Day comes in at that time. Also, there's a whole number of other activities, like growing food. By that time, maybe the community will be more aware of the rate at which we are moving to a warmer climate, known as global warming, and we'll want to plant food. That could be a marvelous thing. It could be done in little pods of people and with a different idea and a different framework. Seasons as we know them are, as I said before, they're over. We're locked in. We're locked in with frozen ground in all the big cities of America. When they transition into the summer, you will see where the hot weather comes in, and then you will see it replicated all over the country in here. It's just a matter of looking at all the things that are going on, including the supply chain that's broken. In terms of continuing manufacturing and logging and cruising and flying and underwater boats and having wars and all that stuff, there's no way to have that and survive as a people. I think you want your kids to survive. Thank you. Thank you, Ruth. Our additional speaker is Julie Threatt. Go ahead. Can you hear me, Debbie? I can hear you. I've got laryngitis. I was talking about earlier. That's okay. I've got laryngitis, but I wanted to chime in really quick. I did send an email on the Rob Berry question. Okay. Really quick on the context. Usually, that's a tradeoff for a benefit that's lost that's an equal cost by headcount. There's always another side to the coin, but really quick before I lose my voice completely. I think it might be great to think about something that we can include that represents this current time. Obviously, we're in a time of crisis. Maybe something pretty meaningful that we're going through and what we want to maybe share 150 years from now and I know full time capsule thing gets to be kind of crazy, but . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . wherever you are, you know, in the plaza or around town and, you know, post what we're looking like and what we're doing and wearing crazy masks or we drop off the masks we hate or whatever we do. You know, kids can draw pictures of things that have been driving them crazy about COVID, but I just think it's such a meaningful time. And I know my grandkids are going to look back and go, did you really go through that? Yes, I really did. So whatever we can do to maybe include that and as a way to bring the community together around it and then look forward in 150 years. Thank you guys. Thank you, Julie. And so the only, we don't have any other hands up, but I did want to mention that we did receive a message in Chico from Mary Kay Benson, which was, she mentioned definitely including outreach to the Machu Picchu tribe. So that is all that I have, Mayor Coolidge. All right. Thank you very much. All right. So just really quickly to provide just a little bit of a question for Ms. McCartney, has there been consideration given to consult to tribal relations, consulting with the tribe and bringing them, giving them a seat at the table of planning this? Absolutely. At this point, we are really just in the very early stages is when ideas were kind of floating around of what could this look like, right? The tribe definitely came up in conversation, whether it be, is there a lecture series that people could participate in? Is it a, is it some type of a community celebration? What makes the most sense? Maybe even a full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full Brown in the very early stages of this. So we take all of these comments into consideration. And the ones that we heard from the public today are completely in alignment with where we've been headed in terms of, we want to make sure it's something that is affordable. We want to make sure, and by affordable, I mean, lots of free stuff, right? We don't want people to have to pay to celebrate 150 years of our community. There may be some that require some admittance, but for the most part, we want people to be able to afford and experience free of charge some of these awesome events. We want to make sure that it is something that is for all ages. So I appreciate the comment about their area on aging. I mean, we talked to the people putting on the parade and they said, well, their key constituents are eight years old, right? So we want to be able to bookend the eight-year-olds to the senior citizens in our community as well. So we're thinking about all of those things, making sure that it is not a one-size-fits-all celebration. Great. Thank you for your consideration. And I do hope that the tribal members will join the conversation. Thank you. Like that. Thank you. All right. Do we have any other comments before we move on? All right. Seeing none, we will, that was informational only. So we'll move on to item 5.6, advanced life support ALS service area resolutions. Chief Sandridge. Go ahead, Chief. Good evening. Just one second. I'm going to share my screen. And hopefully you can see it. Yes. Okay, great. Mayor, Vice Mayor, and council members, thank you for this opportunity to talk about and present on the subject of Chico Fire and a possible path for providing advanced life support, otherwise known as ALS, as a core capability. And throughout the day, I've been acutely aware that many, if not all of you, have been inundated with emails and phone calls expressing concerns about this particular proposal. And I've read many of those emails as well. And I hope to dispel some of the misnomers or misunderstandings that are inherent in some of the proposals. So thank you for that. And I hope to dispel some of the characterizations of this particular program initiative. My motivation is actually straightforward. Create a mechanism that gives the city more direct local control over a system that can have such a profound impact on our citizens. And as the city's fire chief, I am obligated and dedicated to evaluating and proposing initiatives that help attempt to address deficiencies, inefficiencies, allowances, and other issues that may be relevant to the city. And I hope to dispel some of the misnomers or misunderstandings that have been made here. And I hope to better coordination and collaboration and permits direct and ongoing input to adapt and change to an ever-evolving environment. But in this case, it also does it in a way that respects the private sector's statutory rights to provide this service in our city. And I'll explain that in a moment. Thank you. Pardon me. If you'll recall last, I skipped one there, I apologize. If you'll recall last spring in May was the first substantial opportunity I had to talk about the potential to add ALS as a core service. When I presented at the council meeting of last year, the findings and recommendations from the feasibility study, our consultant that we engaged, AP Triton, who has significant background and experience creating, evaluating these systems, conducted this feasibility study on behalf of the city. In the scope of work, the consultant was focused on three. Determining the economic value of the system within the 911 emergency ambulance transport. Determining the feasibility and cost of providing fire-based ALS service to supplement our current transport provider service level. Determining cost recovery options that were feasible and acceptable to the city to supplement and sustain the addition of this capability. The consultant and consultant and consultant and consultant and consultant and consultant and consultant and consultant and consultant and consultant and consultant and consultant and consultant and consultant and consultant and consultant and consultant and consultant and consultant and consultant and consultant and consultant and consultant and consultant and consultant and consultant and consultant and consultant and consultant and consultant and consultant and consultant and consultant and consultant and consultant and consultant and consultant and consultant and consultant and consultant and consultant and consultant and consultant and consultant and consultant and consultant and consultant and consultant and consultant and consultant and consultant and consultant and consultant and consultant and consultant and consultant and consultant and consultant and consultant and consultant and consultant and consultant and consultant and consultant and consultant and consultant and consultant and consultant and consultant and consultant and consultant and consultant and consultant and consultant and consultant and consultant and consultant and consultant and consultant and consultant and consultant and consultant and consultant and consultant and consultant and consultant and consultant and consultant and consultant and consultant and consultant and consultant and consultant and consultant and consultant and consultant and consultant and consultant and consultant and consultant and consultant and consultant and consultant and consultant and consultant and consultant and consultant and consultant and consultant and consultant and consultant and The second rationale for adding ALS is it would greatly help augment the current system by adding additional paramedics to an incident, thus providing a higher level of service from the fire department and provide the additional capacity in the paramedicine realm into the system as a whole. But if you'll recall, I did not make a specific recommendation in May because at that time, it would have necessitated diverting or obligating general dollars for this additional capability, which would have potentially compromised our ability to regain staffing we lost after 2008 or adequately sustaining our current core capabilities. I did, however, indicate that if the city's fiscal circumstances significantly changed, for the better, and that has not necessarily happened to the extent that it would allow us to add this, or that there was a regulatory or a potential legal path to sustain this level of service without compromising our core services, I would bring back a specific proposal. Since then, not only have there been some noteworthy changes in the state's regulatory environment and recent legislation that opens new avenues for providing ALS as a service level, we also realized there were other major issues that have had a detrimental impact on the city's ability to better understand, manage, and better integrate this key emergency service for our community. So the other issues that we started to realize were as important, if not more so, than the ones we initially identified, was a lack of local control for the city itself, and these issues were increasingly more problematic as time went on. Increased operational efficiencies and integration with our private partner, and then finding a sustainable funding to enhance the system as a whole within the city. And this is why I'm here tonight. Our regulatory and legal landscape has changed, and more precisely, I'm proposing to use this constitutional authority, granted California Charter Cities, to provide ambulance transport service through a subcontract with a private provider, exclusively within the city's boundaries. Pardon me, my light went off. And given case law, the city's attorney office reviewed, which although it does not specifically address this type of service provision, does support the principle, that the city can manage services, which state statute explicitly defines ambulance service as a municipal function. And we would do so by entering into that contract with a private ambulance company, such as BeautyMS, First Responder, Enloe, or any other authorized ambulance company to provide pre-hospital ambulance service. Before I get into the details and nuances of this proposed solution, which are specifically, supported by the two resolutions before you, I want to give some context and background to our community members, who may be watching tonight or will watch the proceedings later, but whom may not have the same level of understanding of our pre-hospital emergency medical system, as you as our council members have had the privilege of understanding, more so in the last several months. So the way California operates, is that it's a state-owned company, it is dictated at the level, at the state level, and that the Emergency Medical Service Authority is granted the authority to oversee the entire California emergency medical system. In turn, the EMSA for short, also designates local emergency medical service authorities, also known as LEMSAs. The LEMSAs are, are responsible for ensuring the rules and regulations are being adhered to, state and federal mandates are also adhered to, and compliance of all regulatory reporting and other types of compliance, such as training, are also adhered to. But in the end, the county is really responsible, is responsible for actually managing and coordinating the system. But the LEMSAs can serve a secondary role. They can also be responsible for the, for the system itself, can be responsible for the safety of the system, the system itself, by overseeing the RFPs, the provider contract and the compliance for ensuring that they're maintaining the obligations outlined in the, in the contract itself. And in turn, we, the county will work through the LEMSA then to provide the RFP and then the contract. And in this case, Butte EMS has that contract up until the end of June 30th, 2020. And then the contract, the LEMSA will be up until June 23, at which time a new contract will be in place and potentially a new service provider as well. So understanding how this all works in reality is that we get a call for service from an injured party. The fire department and Butte EMS are dispatched for most incidents. We respond to those. And then with the help of the fire department, we generally give them assistance with patient care, and then they will transport the patient to the hospital itself. As for billing, the billing, the contract itself is a performance based contract, meaning that whatever the private provider bills for and receives is the revenue that they enjoy when they get the revenues back. So in the case of private insurance, they, they receive a bill, their insurance company, pays that bill in a much larger percentage than that of a Medicare, Medi-Cal patient. And that patient gets their bill paid for through the Department of Health Care Services. And you'll notice that the cost that's recovered by the private is significantly less than that of the private insurance. So what we will be proposing is to alter this system in the way, in such a way that gives us the control over our system in our city. And by doing that, we still are basically offering the same type of service, but we'll be managing it on behalf of our city versus the county using LEMSA to do that. And the current model gives us very little local control. There is limited transparency. In the system, limited operational integration. We're experiencing response times by our private provider. It is not as efficient a system as it can be. And for the fire department, we are still obligated to provide a basic level of service, but there is no funding but for general funding to actually increase fire staffing to add paramedics or to actually offer ALS as a core service with the current, um, staffing levels. Under the proposed model, we will gain more local control, greater transparency because we will have access to data. We do not have access now. We can determine our response times. And this is an interesting dichotomy here because under in 2010, Beauty MS got approval from SSV to reduce their response times for the city of Chico and Oroville to eight minutes. When the RFP was completed and the contract was developed, those standards moved up to 10 minutes for urban areas, which would include Chico. So the standard for response actually increased in terms of the time that they had to get on scene. It will also create greater operational integration, and we have several models to draw off of, namely Contra Costa County, where they have a very similar model. And they have great luck and good relationship with their private provider, AMR, and they can integrate their operations more seamlessly. We can also look for increased efficiencies. Right now, we're in the process of finishing a computer-aided digital. The full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full can take advantage of priority dispatching, which is CAD2CAD is intended to do. And we can look for ways to integrate our dispatch center so we're not duplicating the dispatch processes, but instead we are doing it out of one dispatch center rather than two, creating cost efficiencies for both agencies. We can also then rely upon closest unit to send the resources in a manner that reduces the number of code three or emergent responses to the closest unit, allowing the further unit to come in code two predicated on the nature of the incident. Obviously, we are looking at adding additional service level by way of paramedics, and then looking at this as a potential revenue source for that increased level of staffing by way of paramedics and creating a mechanism to help pay for additional paramedics. And we can look at those services as a way to train our staff to be trained that are already firefighters here at Chico. So one of the key aspects of actually looking at a system is evaluating its value by which we then determine what kind of revenue would be potentially realized in the system. And we have one advantage. If we take advantage of the fact that we are the the purveyors or the providers of the system in Chico as the city, then we are entitled to receive additional revenue enhancements for Medi-Cal Medicare payments. And those can be a significant augmentation to the system. And that is why I say that with this particular model, we can actually enhance our services to our community. I think it's also important to understand there is an inherent or built-in cost that exists right now with providing BLS service. And this is a sunk cost that we already pay for having a 24-7 on-call and on-demand resource. But everything can be broken down into an actual cost. And these are based on 2018-2019 numbers. And as you can see, broken into 30-minute increments, pardon me, 30-minute increments, we are looking at a costing of about $1.3 million in 2018, and then a cost of about $834,000 in 2019. And that is largely the drop in that cost was due to a change that we made in conjunction with our partners at BeautyMS to reduce the impact of low-acuity medical incidents that reduced the cost of the service. And that is why we are looking at a drop in that cost. We also want to emphasize that we have been able to reduce our responses to those calls dramatically, and it gave us an opportunity to take on other responsibilities and had more time for things like pre-planning, training, public education, and so forth. So, coming from having our consultant look at the various scenarios, and we're going to go through some of the things that we're going to be discussing today, and then providing an estimated costing and budget for, or how much we would look to recover, we're looking at approximately $5.7 million of expected revenue if we do non-balance billing. And non-balance billing refers to the fact that when a patient is treated and taken to the hospital, if their insurance does not consider, that an in-network entity, then agencies are permitted to go after balance billing. It's a controversial subject, and it would be one we would want to evaluate because, obviously, it would increase the amount of revenue that we could collect. But as I suggested, it does come with some major downsides with public relations. So, with respect to our budget, then, we would be looking at roughly $5.7 million, and $6.6 million in full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full the engine. And then when we look at year three, we would be unable to add any additional resources, but then we could start to augment our three-person engines with additional firefighters willing to go back to paramedic school. And then we would slowly build out our system to augment the private provider. So the question now is why now? And unfortunately, there is a very small window. And this window is that Beauty MS's contract expires June 30th, 2023. That means that a new contract will be in place July 1st of 2023. It may be the current provider, it may be a new provider. Irrespective of that, once that process begins and the RFP is put out there, we would be hard-pressed to undermine that process. So we have an opportunity right now to do that. And we would be able to do that. And we would be able to do that. And we would at least get this on the table. At the very least, it opens up discussions that are needed to happen. And we've had these discussions in the past to no avail. And part of that is because we don't have any opportunity to really substantively affect the system at the local level because it is managed at the county level and through SSV. And so it relies heavily upon the fire departments to augment the business model of our private provider to assist with initial patient care, patient packaging, and patient transport when needed for a critical patient. And so this is important because while it impacts the city of Chico, it can have a substantial impact also on our other fire entities, such as Cal Fire and Orville Fire, and especially Cal Fire, where they have more remote stations where they have to downstate the fire. And so we're going to have to staff that engine while a patient is being transported and a firefighter is assisting with that. So it does have significant influence. So this will be an opportunity for us to sit down and discuss the merits of our program. They are not without potential risk, and I don't want to sound Pollyannish. The pathway we are taking does open up certain risk. One are legal challenges. Certainly the EMSA and the LEMSA, could put forward a legal case, and you've already heard from Director Panette from SSV indicating that there's case law that would suggest we cannot do this. However, in the analysis that our city attorney conducted on our behalf, there is substantial case law to help support the charter city approach, and that the fact that municipal services also is a part of the process, and that the fact that municipal services also is a part of the process, and that the fact that municipal services and local authorities serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve relationships, in particular with the county, and the county is rightfully concerned about how this would affect the county. And when we met with the CAO at the county, we expressed to them that very similar to how they made the business decision in the best interest of the county to close Station 42, despite the city asking to keep it open to provide that additional resource and capability, the county shuttered the station in 2017 in order to save money, understanding it was not their obligation to support the city. And whether we agree or disagree, it was a decision that they made similar to the one we would be making with the charter city and providing the ambulance service to our citizens versus having the county do so. I will also note that I would anticipate the county's decision to close the station in 2017 in order to save money, understanding it was not . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . the county had made when they closed Station 42. Then finally, financial. Depending on the two models that we have available to us to subcontract out, one would be a performance-based contract, much in the way the system is set up now. But what that doesn't do, it doesn't allow us to access the additional revenues that come through the federal government to augment Medicare and Medicaid payments. And that's substantial in the end. And in order to receive that, there are several ministerial effort or things that need to be in place, but two substantive ones. One is that we have to subcontract out to the private provider as a fixed-cost contract. So if we do a poor job of evaluating our system or evaluating the cost, then the city would be obligated to pay. And that's a big part of the cost. If our revenues didn't come in as projected. We could also see that the bids come in higher than anticipated, which would necessitate us to either cut into what we would be using for augmenting our system on the Chico Fire side. And that, as I said, expenditures surpass revenues. If we made this, if we were concerned about this, we could still have local control and turn it into a performance-based contract. So we could just go through the system and then obligate the private provider like they do now to provide for their own financial welfare versus the city doing so. So it is an option, but I would suggest that it may not be the optimal. So the recommendation I have put forward is to approve a resolution to utilize the city's charter authority. To establish advanced life support service effective July 1st, 2023. The second resolution is a complementary piece that meets the intent of AB 39, which is now codified in health and safety code 1797.201, which has specific language that we need to adopt for our RFP, a request for proposal, or RFQ, request for qualifications process, as well as the contract itself. And then finally, direct the city manager provide notice to all pertinent parties of the city's intention to establish its own service area. And with that, I will answer any questions and try to do my best to alleviate some of the concerns that have been brought forward. All right, questions for the Chief? I'm interested to hear from the public. And then have our discussion . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . to breach, what outreach did we do in the community on this particular issue to, you know, to anyone? Did we have conversations with Enloe? Did we do any of that? We did. We had, we've had several, since my tenure here, I've had several conversations with Enloe in particular. I've met with BeautyMS not on this particular topic, but with Enloe, I did share this information. And then we met with the CAO and the Deputy CAO and CAL FIRE Chief Butte Unit Chief about this issue as well. And prior to that, we've had multiple conversations with SSV, even predating my arrival here as well. So this has been a longstanding issue that the fire department has had, not just us, but CAL FIRE Butte, Oroville Fire have had with this particular issue. And we've had a lot of conversations with them. And we've had a lot of conversations with them. And we've had a lot of conversations with them. And we've had a lot of conversation with their EMS director about a month ago. Okay. All right. Okay. Does anyone have any other questions at this point or move to public comment if everybody's good with that? Go ahead, Claire. Okay. So first of all, we did receive the three letters that the chief mentioned, and those were emails from Vicki Panette, Mark Chisman, and Byron Parsons. And those were all expressing concerns about this proposal and asking for more time to review it. That's just a quick summary of those. In terms of people who would like to participate and speak now, I have two. Jessica Giannola, go ahead. Thank you, counsel. With this, I appreciate some of the things that were answered while I was writing down questions, like that there would be a use of the, like a dual use dispatch, which I think helps with probably time efficiency costs as well. I would hope that also that anyone using any insurance plan that's using it would be considered in-network and not a balanced billing scenario. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . scenes and situations. We could have fires in our area, but there's also injuries. There's hiking, we have rattlesnakes, water, you know, bear hole. There's always something that they're going to be able to respond to, and having the best equipped emergency responder is really important as our city continues to grow, and we have inlets at the center of the city, and for example, if you say you have somebody who has cardiac arrest, you could be someone who has sudden, you're, you know, typical age male that has this heart attack, or someone has a heart attack from injury, you basically have 10 minutes to get an AED to them to help save their life, because every minute that goes by, the probability of recovery goes down by 10 percent, so 10 percent down, unless you get that emergency system to you that's equipped with these advanced life-saving systems on board, your loved one, you're not going to be able to save your loved one, even if you're doing CPR. They need to have these advanced systems involved, and I would like to see us not lose any providers. I'd like to see an addition of providers so that they're better equipped around town to reach somebody the quickest, whoever is closest to reach that emergency situation fastest, not who's contracted for a zone, or, you know, some sort of financial reason why people are getting which provider to their door. It'd be nice if we could have the fastest one, and wherever they're located, and that they won't be balanced build, and that everyone can use them, those I would support. I don't know if I have anything else to add on that one, but yeah, I think empowering our fire department to do as much as they can is really a smart thing to do for our city and for the people that live here. I guess that's it. Thank you. Thank you, Jessica. So Ruth Sarnoff is our next speaker, and I'll unmute you. This is regarding the advanced life support service area. So go ahead. Ruth? Oh, okay. Well, I think we're on two kind of different trends going on here, but I'm still looking at what it means when the grid goes down. Now we've had some ice storms that went through the south, and all the way up the coast, and all the way into New England. We've had someיאיאיאיאיאיאיאיאיאיאיאיאיאיאיאיאיא had the ACDC grid shut consciously to save the big grid that sends the power back and forth and sells electricity back and forth. So we have something that's already there to show what what happens. They had to close a nuclear plant in order to keep the grid from going down, the big grid. Now, we are in climate change, for better or for worse, and we need to pay attention. The whole thing with transportation, we don't have to use the knowledge of indigenous people and people who have lived in the Caribbean and have come from Africa and have lived in South America. You've got lots of cultures that have all mingled, and they all have wonderful amounts of knowledge that they've acquired by the sharing over many generations. And a lot of it is edible food. The supply chain is broken because the places where it's been frozen for over a year now in many areas, those are broken systems underneath people's homes. And they're not going to be able to keep up with the current system. So we're not going to get repaired. We need to think of goats and horses. We have Mustangs, they're out shooting them in the snow because it's winter right now and they got a good beat on them. So you've got people out there shooting them, many articles on them, and you got to start watching it. We can't kill all of our wildlife. We can't kill every bug and every bat and every mosquito and everything that we see because they have natural predators. So we're not going to get repaired. We're going to have to do a lot of things that take care of it in nature. Small bats eat mosquitoes. We need to think of a lot of things in a totally different way, and we need to open it up to a broad discussion. And everybody ought to watch. Thank you, Ruth. And that was the last speaker for the advanced life support service area resolutions. All right, council discussion. I'll go if nobody else wants to start. So I met with Chief Standridge, I actually don't remember how long ago it was, and he gave me a brief overview of everything. Well, not everything, but the things you just went through. And I am supportive of any of the staff, any of the department heads coming forward with ideas that make for better services, create revenue, all those things for the city. So I applaud all of that. In the chief's own presentation, he brought up some questions, things that we there were potential for, but we didn't know. I did not list all of them. One of them was current CFD people becoming paramedics. What was going to be happening with dispatch, which what happens between police and fire dispatch has been a hot button and a point of consternation for both those departments, since I've been on council. So I don't know how that's going to go. Some legal challenges. I obviously a supporter of the city attorney's office. We're in a lot of other legal problems right now. Some of the comments about this is not how he said it, but this is how I heard it. We're basically going to go to war with the county. I appreciate wasn't happy when the county shut down the fire station if they shut down another fire station. They are they are rendering us some great help in other places. And I would hope that it didn't. You know, become quid pro quo on you do this and we'll do that. But it did sound that way a little bit. I have some questions on the subcontracting. Will that work out as well as we hope it will? Maybe, maybe not. In the end, here's what I think happened. I think some people were surprised to see this has an action item. I don't think there's anybody in the community. I'd be surprised if there were anybody on the council, but you guys surprised me all the time. That wouldn't support looking into these things. If we could get some concrete evidence. Some better idea how this would look. But as we heard from the community today, some of the conversations that Chief standards had and he had one with me and I know he's had the conversations. But having a dialogue about something that will happen versus promoting it and really given operational details are two different things and I think the community was caught off guard. Seeing this come up as an action item. And while we should be able to trust the chief or any other department heads to say, hey, I think. This is right. Has we are all very aware Chico is a very, very, very, very engaged community. So, and so sitting down with somebody and saying, hey, here's what's going on. Here's some information and then I'm not hearing from anybody for a while. And then bam, it comes up as an action item causes a lot of consternation and gnashing of teeth within the community, which brings it all the way up to the council. And we certainly don't like that. On top of that. There's a few. Other rather big things going on in the city right now. We're having this all day strategy meeting next Friday. I'll be able to see how that comes out. But for the most part, we're being governed by our budget and the enforcement of our laws and ordinances by a federal judge. There's a lot of things we don't have control over right now. I am concerned that I know this is a timely request. And if we don't do something soon, it might go away. But I am also aware that. Council and quite frankly, the staff can only handle so much change and so many unknowns. And in my time on the council, which is longer than everybody else's, I've never seen dynamics like this. Adding this to the mix without having a lot of these questions answered. I'm not ready to move on. That doesn't mean I'm not excited to support Chief Standridge in the conversations he needs to continue to have with Enloe and the county and everyone else. I'd like to see that happen. I don't know what the absolute deadline for it is. But as far as taking action on anything right now, I think that would be premature. Wow, that was a long monologue. It happens. Vice Mayor Reynolds. Yeah, I would say dittos and echo to that. I actually called and had a conversation with the chief earlier today. And while there's a lot of this that I absolutely love. I love the thought. I love the thought of local control. I like the thought of saving money. I think we've all learned a lot to find out that we're spending somewhere between $900,000 a year and $1.2 million a year to provide services that may or may not be our purview. So while I would really, really like to continue to drill down and dig down and get more information on this, as far as this me being willing to take an action on this tonight, I was actually going to ask that if we could push this to bring the citizens along. I think we need to have a lot. A lot more engagement, a lot more conversations. And so, yeah, I can't add much more than that. But that's my feedback right now. Right. Anyone else? Yeah, I have just a quick comment. Really, everything has been said that I need to say. But I would just echo that I do applaud Chief Stadridge for being creative, looking at different. Staffing models, different delivery models that will benefit this community, benefit the Chico Fire Department. So I applaud him for that. I applaud him for the detailed presentation and proposal. But I'm not quite ready to vote on this and support it. Not that I don't, but I'm not quite ready to do that until we have more public discussion, more discussion on the council level. And I think once we do that, I think things will become a little clearer. I think it'll be more appropriate. First for us to take that action. But right now, I'm just not ready to make that step. Right. A question for the clerk. Madam Clerk, to bring this item back in the future, do you need us to make a motion at some point here? Do we just need to give direction that maybe we'd like to see it again? Maybe the chief can coordinate with the city manager and we can determine how best to re-approach this issue. You can. You. You. You. You. The Council can just provide direction to staff to bring it back and for further public input and we'll just work with the City Manager's Office to get that scheduled and to allow other stakeholders to be involved. It's all up to the Council, but you don't need a formal motion . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Yeah. So not a heads. Yeah. So we'll bring back, get some additional information. I think maybe too, in terms of how it's organized, there's a lot of information in there. There's a lot of details in there. I think we maybe need to work on the organizational side of this so people can understand exactly what we're going through and talking about, you know, some of the cost figures hashed out, some of the things like that, maybe presented in a way that are a little more understandable, I think would be great. Sure. All right. I just want to make a quick, quick comment. Please. Chief, I think this is the direction that we're going, but I just want to very specifically kind of call you out in a good way for how much initiative I can see that you have taken. You know, I personally met with you and had a lot of questions, a lot of concerns, some of which were expressed today. And you took a lot of care not to expect, not to expect deference from us, but to really explain it step by step. This is a huge, huge undertaking and a huge shift for our community. So I can understand some of the hesitation. But I don't want that to cloud the reality that you have taken immense initiative, not just to tell us what would be best for TICO, but to show us with data and to really, to really help me personally understand this process. I think there is more understanding that's needed based on what we're hearing today. But I want to appreciate you for how much effort you have put into this up until this point. So thank you. I would like to echo Councillor Brown, as well as the additional councillors that have spoken. Thank you very much, Chief Standridge, for your work and your dedication to the community and to the safety of the citizens of TICO. It's a great presentation. And I'm going to support going forward with a delay. I'm going to support going forward with a delay. And take a look at this a little bit later. But I do want to say thank you very much. Okay. Any further comment? All right. So we'll move on. Thank you, Chief. We appreciate it. We'll move on to item 5.7, which is no items added after the posting of the agenda. Six reports and communications. The following reports and communication items are provided for the council's information. No action. No comment. No comment. No comment. No comment. No comment. No comment . . . level of engagement that's taken place has been amazing. And I want to commend Assemblyman James Gallagher for already introducing a bill to help try to find some solutions as it relates to some of the mental health crises being experienced within cities and municipalities, counties throughout the state. And so I just want to let everybody know that that information that was already pressed forward from this council has met the ear and the eyes and the pen of our local Assemblyman. And he's already introduced a bill, Assembly Bill 2020, which he will be working with to modify moving forward to make sure that it accommodates a vast number of needs for his communities that he represents. I also just want to give a quick update on all of the homelessness initiatives we have. I know there's been some comment asking about Hope Street Coalition and their plan coming back. Once the settlement agreement came into place, Hope Street was continuing to work on that. They were bringing a plan forward, but then obviously the land scale was not going to be the same. So I just want to let everybody know that that's going to be a long-term issue. And I know that the landscape of our homelessness situation and response changed. And so I know that they were going back through making modifications. So I anticipate that they will still come back with recommendations on that to fulfill their obligation. And that'll be on a future council meeting, probably maybe even on either the March 1st agenda for receive and file so that everybody can take a look at that final document and recommendations from Hope Street Coalition. And then finally, with regard to homelessness, we are still continuing to . . . Thank them for their willingness to be a part of this process. The city, unfortunately, did not have the contractor available that we were anticipating with regard to outreach and engagement. So we're in the process of going through interviews for those positions that will engage on the O&E process. The contracts for food services, laundry services, shower services, they're all moving forward. And so those are locked in as well. A lot of moving parts. We will keep you updated on the city's website under sheltering at the bottom of the front page. You can always find updates of what's going on there. With that, that's all I have right now. And thank you very much. All right. Thank you, Mr. Orme. Item 6.2, Council Member request pursuant to AP and P1010. Council members may verbally request an item to be agendized at a future meeting. After stating what the item would be, a majority of the council is needed in order for staff to agendize. Council members may submit. Council members may submit requests in writing. Do we have any? And yes, I have one. Sorry. I get a lot of inquiries about roads, particularly because I represent District 5, which has some of the worst roads. No offense to District 7, but I know they do too. But unfortunately, it's not a competition for the good. But. But, you know, I think it's important at this point to maybe bring back a presentation. I think our citizenry is hungry for a presentation on where we have been on our status of our local roads and, you know, where we're heading and some of the funding that we're looking at. And, you know, obviously, I know we're very behind and we have been very behind on updating our roads. But I think it would be important just to get some information out there for the community. So I'd like to just agendize a quick 10 minute presentation. I'm sure Mr. Gustin can whip through it and give our community some really good information on the status of our roads. There is no good information on the status of our roads. You're correct. But I know Mr. Gustin can put together the presentation quickly because I've seen it about 10 times. Yeah. And I know that's a fact, but I think it's important it comes back. I'll support that if you'd like to see it. All right. You make that a motion, Sean? Could I make an amendment to that? Sure. I mean, besides the condition of the roads, could we bring back a plan on how to make them better? Is that what exactly you're asking? Yeah. Well, I mean, I know there's a there's a plan in place already. But I think maybe just some information out there to the community for that. So they know exactly what that plan is and get some details. Right. The details of the plan on how to deal. But the roads. Situation. Yeah. Mr. Gustin. I'm pulling my motion because what turned into a 10 minute presentation is now going to turn into a. I've just seen it too many times. Well, I'd still go with the 10 minutes if you're comfortable with that. Mr. Martin. You can't give a presentation on the condition of the roads and all the degrading and the alligator, the gathering and where the money is and where the money can come from. I'm just saying that this is a long, long, long discussion. You guys want to put that together, make the request, but it's a big deal and it's been done a lot. It has. But I also know Eric could I mean, Eric could bring it forward at the next council meeting. He's got it all in his head. All right. So. So I'll just make a motion to have a, let's say, 15 minute presentation at a future council meeting. Where we look at Mr. Gustin go through the roads, give us a background, talk about the future a little bit where we are and, you know, some basic information. Would you expect action to be taken on that item? No. Or is this in preparation for action to be taken? No. No. No. Just a comment. Yeah. It's going to come up during capital projects. Under the budgeting, which is a couple months away from anyway. So I'm going to make this, I'm going to make this request too. If we're going to do this prior to capital projects. In the budgeting session. Can we not do it again? Three months from now? I mean, let's pick one. Yeah, no, I'm good with that. But I do think that we, you know, I certainly have enough constituents. I mean, I'm getting five to six emails a day on the condition of roads. So, yeah, I think it's enough to just. I'm not going to be able to specify us getting this report out there. So I can point citizens in that direction rather than having, you know, 30 minute lengthy conversations, because I'm not as eloquent about the roads as Mr. Kufz. So no. Yeah. All right. So Sean, does your motion stand for the 15 minute presentation with no action? Yeah. All right. So I'll second. Madam clerk. Council member Bennett. Yes. Yes. Council member Brown. Hi. Council member Morgan. Yes. Council member O'Brien. Yes. Council member Tandon. Yes. Vice mayor Reynolds. Sure. Mayor Coolidge. Hi. Carry seven zero. All right. Any further requests from council? I would request that we receive a brief, very, very brief report. On the ice rink economics. Just curious. I think the citizen three is very curious about what's going on. So. Yep. Mr. Orm. Do you want to. I know you had some information coming forward. Oh, it's already good. Yeah. No, I'm, I'm, I'm happy. I mean, I can even throw it in under a city manager update at the next meeting. Okay. That works. Okay. Works. Works. Thank you. All right. Anything further? All right. Item 6.3. Comparative analysis of regional housing production, production of housing cycle completion is informational only. So at this point we'll move into closed session with public comments or council disqualifications. Do we have any? Um, yes, we have two citizens. Um, just a moment. Uh, no. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .! . . . . . . . saying there is a plan, here is the momentum behind that. So people who have been living with promises are still kind of left floundering. So I have an issue with the fact that we landed with the Jesus Center without seeing like what was their proposal that elevated them above two others that we had to hear about from another citizen. I kind of had heard about one offline, but to have two there and wonder, okay, well, stacking up against all of that, why did you land the way you did? Is there a concern that they are perceived to be a religious entity or are they breaking rank from that in this ops as they kind of were diversing themselves of or divesting themselves of that name for the Renewal Center as well? Just there are problems like that. Another situation, so I did a PRA. And none of that, there was not literature available for me to look at to see kind of what happened and what has been agreed to or even discussed. And as public that our funds are being used to pay whoever is placed, it's problematic. Another concern when I was looking through the contract statements that were made about who's handling certain things under services for laundry, I wondered why we're shipping that to the Renewal Center. And I think that's a good question. Maybe it's just because of how full and of nomadic population to ensure we're kind of meeting people where they are as likes to be stated constantly. And so doing that doesn't necessarily lend itself to nine to five hours and definitely not fly by check-in visits. So it would be important to have like a physical footprint as I've stated before, but more so also that these maybe evening, weekend, whatever hours. So I would hope you guys go back and just make sure there's a solid plan since we don't get to hear what that is. Thank you. Rob Berry. Hold on one second. Go ahead, Rob. I'm going to be a little bit more blunt. I think that you guys are abusing your privilege in closed session. The exception that you quote, as I said last time I talked to you about this, is a very narrow exception that only covers matters that would prejudice the position of the local agency in litigation. There is no litigation. There is no privilege to take anything related to this lawsuit and move the city business into closed session. I listened to you talk in other items here, Sandwich's item and so forth, about the citizen's right to know, and that the citizens want to know, and I'm getting five emails a day. There are thousands of people that are asking questions about this settlement agreement and how it's going to work. By the way, not one word has been said about the enforcement part, the big payoff for this settlement. No one has even addressed the point about enforcement. The only time that I've ever heard a commitment to give information to the public was Mayor Coolidge had the Mayor Coolidge had the courtesy to answer questions from a few public members. And in that session, he promised to bring a motion back to the city council to ask the city attorney to respond in writing to two of the questions. One of the questions was, how's enforcement going to work in light of the two moves for 12 months issue in the settlement. The second one had to do with what mechanism actually exists for the city to petition the court to change the law. change any of the language of the settlement agreement. Neither of those promises have been acted on. And as a result, the city, the population, the taxpayers, and the voters of this city remain completely in the dark as to what business you are conducting behind closed doors. It is time for you to come out of the closet and face your constituents and face your voters with your plans, defend your positions, educate the public as to how this is going to work. You know, you don't get to sit in closed session and sort of pontificate about it with each other and leave the public in the dark. That is wrong. I believe it's illegal, but it certainly violates the spirit of the law, which is to encourage open and transparent government. Anything that can be done to protect the public from the public is illegal. And so I think it's time for you to be discussed in public, should be discussed in public. It's not a privilege to just move the business of the city into closed session. So I'm not going to be talking about this every week. I've talked it to death. You know what the score is. It's an abuse of your privilege, and you need to stop it and come out of the secret closet. Thank you. Rob was our last speaker. Thank you, Rob. All right. Do we have any council disqualifications on any items? All right. Seeing none, council recess to closed session, which is closed Zoom meeting. And council members, you'll have to log on to the closed Zoom meeting. And then we will adjourn. So everybody knows we'll have a council strategic planning session on February 28, 2022. Okay. Okay. Is this the 25th? Is it the 25th? It is. I see. All right. So yes, on the 25th, my apologies. We will have that, and there's details on the website about it. So all right. With that, we'll adjourn the closed session. Council will take a five-minute recess before we get there.
