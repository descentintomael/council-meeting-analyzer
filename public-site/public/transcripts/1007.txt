 Okay. Okay, so do you want me to? Yes. I don't know if this is true, but on my side, it just said it just started recording, which means it missed the beginning of the meeting. Yeah, should we restart? I'm fine with that. Okay. That's probably the best idea. Yeah, probably. So we'll go ahead and restart, and we're here for a special meeting of the city council on September 24th, 2021 at 4 o'clock, doing this via Zoom. And Madam Clerk, can we have you take the roll, please? Council Member Bennett? Here. Council Member Brown is absent. Council Member Morgan? Here. Council Member O'Brien? Here. Council Member Tandon? Vice Mayor? Mayor Reynolds? Here. Mayor Coolidge? Here. Present. All right. And then we'll move on to the consent agenda. Do we have any speakers or raised hands on the consent agenda? There are no raised hands. All right. Any disqualifications or no votes? All right. Seeing none, then we'll move on. I entertain a motion. Move to approve. I have a motion from Council Member Morgan and a second from Council Member Bennett. Madam Clerk, can you take the roll, please? Okay. Council Member Bennett? Yes. Council Member Morgan? Yes. Council Member O'Brien? Yes. Council Member Tandon? Vice Mayor Reynolds? Here. Yes. Council Member Tandon? Yes. Mayor Coolidge? Aye. It carries 5-0 with two absences. All right. And then we'll move on to the regular agenda. If you don't mind reading that for me, Debbie, I'd appreciate it. Okay. So on regular, it's a consideration of the Motorola radio lease, and I believe that that will be Administrative Services Director Scott Dow. All right. Mr. Dow, are you here? I am here. Thanks for your attention. All right. Just want to let you know, as you can see in the report, we have an opportunity to update our radio system that affects police, fire, and public works. The system has really reached past its useful life. We did have this in the budget, which you approved earlier, the first year payment of 475. We have actually been able to finalize the lease. It was noted in the last meeting that we were in negotiations. The negotiations were able to be completed, and we were able to reach an agreement with Motorola that if we were able to conclude and sign this lease by September 30th, we would save a million dollars. So we thought it would be apropos to bring that back at this emergency meeting. So we're asking for approval to enter into a lease with Motorola solution for total $475.00. We have a $4.4 million, 460,970 to be repaid over 10 years at an interest rate of 2.19% with the annual payments to just under $500,000. With that, I'm welcome to answer any questions or provide any more feedback. All right. Any council member question? I just want to thank Director Dow and his team and all those that have been working on this project. This is critically important for our public safety. I appreciate it. I know that firsthand, and I just want to commend everyone that's been involved in this to include the city manager for supporting it. Critically important for our first responders. So thank you. Yeah, I definitely second that. That's, you know, the cost savings is pretty substantial here as well. I'm sure all of us are seeing that. So does anyone else have any comments? I just had one quick comment. I'm sorry. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'll make a motion to approve. Second. All right we have a motion from Councilmember O'Brien, a second from Councilmember Morgan. Madam Clerk can you take the roll? Councilmember Bennett? Yes. Councilmember Morgan? Yes. Councilmember O'Brien? Yes. Councilmember Tandon? Tandon? Vice Mayor Reynolds? Aye. Mayor Coolidge? Aye. Carries 5-0-2 and because this is a special meeting the public can only address the items that are on listed on the agenda so there is no business from the floor. Correct. All right and we don't have any further agenda items or anything that's been added correct? That is correct. All right. So we will adjourn the meeting at this time. Thank everybody for being here and shortens money on top of it. All right. All right. Thank you. Thank you.
