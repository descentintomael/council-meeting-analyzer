I will second.  is there any opposition?  do we need a roll call if there'  s no opposition?  I spoke with the city clerk  about the roll call vote.  she says that following council  we do do a roll call vote on  this consent agenda for  everybody'  s in agreement so we won'  t do a  roll call this time but we will  effectively effectively s fine. That will be deemed passed. I will second.  effectively  effectively  effectively Kathleen how many speaker cards for the public comments do we  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  the public comments we have?  we do have one speaker card from  david simmon.  david you have the floor.  my name is david simmon I live  at 280 east first avenue here in  chico I want to thank you for  allowing me to speak tonight I'  m the one responsible for the  paperwork you have in front of  you there.  I walk the bike and ride the  bike.  I am a bike lover.  I ride the bike the lower bidwell  probably every day.  I know I love the park a lot and  I know you guys all do too.  one concern I had was when  pedestrians are walking when  bikes are approaching from the  rear it seems like we should have  some kind of a flow pattern where  we know and we kind of take the  risk out of it so we know which  direction the bikes are going because a lot of people have kids a lot of people  have dogs on leash and it's it's there's a little antagonism there because I walk  and ride my bike both so I kind of really get a good feeling for for both  both positions and I was hoping maybe we could maybe investigate maybe having the  bike stay on one side when pedestrians are present and otherwise there's no big  deal and I know you guys have been dealing with this with the cars and  everything else so it's it's not an easy challenge but I thought maybe you  guys might be able to put your heads together and maybe come up with  something that might really make it a little more user-friendly for both the  pedestrians and the bikes so I appreciate whatever effort you can do so  thank you very much thank you David and I just wanted to let you know that your  concerns are on the radar of the Commission and city staff  you  know we have a lot of work to do and I think if you'  ve been following the  city council and some of our activities here we had a transportation company come  and do a study and present it to us and in the works are repaving the entire  lower park roads and at that time getting some delineated one option is to  delineate some lanes one being one option being pedestrians on the road and then  effectively effectively effectively  effectively effectively effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively know inevitably the pedestrian know inevitably the pedestrian  pedestrian swerves to the left before they go to the right i don't know squirrely kind of stuff  right but uh i think that you'll be happy um when the road is paved and some of these uh yeah i'm  glad you're looking into it and i actually had the bikes on the on the non-creek side so that  you know the picnic tables and everything i don't know if that's a concern but the dogs you know  the pedestrians usually want to gravitate toward the water a little more and the bikers you know  they can you know they can get around and they can go back and do their thing so well anyway i  appreciate you for talking to us and it just reiterates the fact that we need to address it  yeah there is some scare factors there i mean people are a little they get a little upset and  there's a little antagonism there so yeah so we could kind of reduce that it'd be great okay so  all right thank you i appreciate it thank you very much sorry hi david i just want to say thank you  for the effort of the packet for each one of us too i always appreciate when  we're  talking about the  thank you very much i appreciate that any more questions or comments thank you for coming i can  assure you that at least in the last couple of weeks we'll be able to get to the point where we  can effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  we have no public  we do not have any other  speaker cards.  then we will move on we have  no public hearings. We will  have the regular agenda item 5.1  consideration of an application  from chico state cycling to hold  mountain bike races in upper  bidwell park on may 3.  thank you Mr. Chair.  mcmair from chico state cycling  club would like a permit to hold  a mountain bike race in upper  bidwell park and it'  s coming to the commission  because this is typically a  non-reservable area and it'  s considered in sense of use. I  believe members from chico state  cycling club are here to answer  any questions you may have.  hello how are you guys doing  tonight?  is this mic on?  hello?  is the weather nice tonight?  I'll just speak up.  how are you guys doing tonight?  I'm mcmair with the chico state  cycling team like he said and  yeah these are a couple of  trails we're looking at doing.  we try to host one race a year  for a fundraiser. we're going to  host a race called the  cross country race.  cross country race which would  be the pink map displayed on  your screens. that would be two  laps of that. we would also have  a super d course which would  start we call this winston. we  notice that we can'  t find an official name but  it'  s been used throughout years  for the park. it could be called  trail connector I think it was  a 32. but we call it winston  which we've heard around the  world. we would also have a  we would connect to guardians  and then we would take guardians  to south rim and then we would  end right there kind of where it  all flattens out before you get  to the creek.  yeah we'll be using a live  timing event so we'll have live  timing that we're getting from a  company. we'll make sure that  pedestrians know that there is a  mountain bike race going on.  we'll have volunteers there to  if they want to like call out  there'  s a race we'll make sure  they know and everyone is safe.  if you have any questions please  let me know.  is there any input from staff?  in the past we'  ve had chico state cycling has  done events like this before.  this is a new titled event but  this is nothing unusual. we also  there'  s the bidwell bump that happens  have been to the event and with  these mountain bike races there  has not been any issues.  staff doesn'  t have any concerns with  this event.  that was my thought even though  this event they say it'  s new your club has done  numerous other successful events.  indeed.  any commissioners have questions?  i have a number two.  go ahead.  do you have I can'  t remember if we  required them to have medical  personnel?  it'  s not a requirement.  it'  s not okay I thought I  would remember in the past they  had had chico state had had  medical personnel kind of on  standby but I didn'  t see anything about that  here. if it'  s not a requirement then  we'  d need to worry about it.  it'  s a good practice  especially in this area of the park  for a mountain bike race but it'  s not a requirement on our end.  okay.  with apologies to my fellow  commissioner I have a bunch of  newbie questions. what technically  are we being asked to do here?  are we approving a contract are  we approving a permit are we  recommending approval of a permit  what technically are you asking us to do?  I am asking you to do a  commission on the permit.  re asking for the commission  of the approval to approve the  permit.  when permits come to us that are  unusual like in a non  reservable area they'  re required to come to the  commission so you hear about the  event to either approve or not  approve the event or make  additional recommendations or  conditions to move the permit  forward or not.  I'  if this passes tonight we'  re authorizing you to sign a  permit?  city manager to sign a permit?  on the permit there is an  area that says approved by the  park and playground commission  and I will check that box.  there'  s no other approval right we'  re the final approval. it doesn'  does the permit have a contract  attached to it that requires them  to provide insurance and indemnify  the city and do all the legal  things?  yes within your packet if you  want to look at that section 5  is insurance.  it doesn'  t say too much there.  the insurance is required in  the requirements for the insurance  requires insurance and  indemnify the city to provide  insurance if they fail to do that  the permit is revoked.  the city has a risk manager  that reviews the contract and  receives the insurance permit and  in effect assures you they have  the insurance they say they have?  they will provide the proof of  insurance either there'  s insurance the city has that  they could go through or they  could provide their own insurance  and then they have to provide that  proof.  you will receive proof of  insurance?  yes.  it says in your staff report  that insurance covers commissioners  does it also indemnify us?  that'  s getting to a realm of risk  management that I would have to  investigate.  basically that means if somebody  gets hurt there everybody will get  sued and any good lawyer will name  everybody possible including probably  all of us up here.  my question which is a personal one  I understand we'  re insured but are we indemnified  in other words the city and their  insurance company can provide the  attorney that'  s going to defend us?  that would be a question that would  be better asked to our risk management  department and addressed on that level.  s an important consideration for all  of us because this is not just a  normal event there is a chance of  injury or maybe more above something  else.  commissioner nickels I could answer  too.  the insurance requirements do include  a full identification of city and all  its acting agents.  I'  m confident we can provide the  specific language to you and shoot it  all in an email but I'  addition to the participants?  we don'  t have many if anything it  would be the people that are helping  out worn hikers.  we might have one or two occasional  people that are rooting it would be  at the start or at the finish but we  don'  t have grandstands or a spectator  audience to any of our events.  being not completely  familiar with the territory are racers on  the trails or pedestrians?  are you separate from pedestrians  hiking in the upper park?  through upper park they are all  open to pedestrians but we did choose  trails that are not commonly used by  pedestrians.  we have ridden these trails for years  and maybe it'  s a pedestrian on occasion  mainly trail runners will be using  these but if that.  there could be other trail  riders and there could be people walking  on the trails while the race is going on?  not while the race is going on because  we will have it marked off.  you will have marshals along the course?  yes sir.  you guys also have signs up down  parking lot  don' t you?  race today that' s been standard  practice?  yes.  people will know before they probably  probably at the main parking lot  the main parking lots you will have  signage up so people will know.  we will probably have something  around five mile because that will be  towards the end of our race for the  super downhill and then we will have  something just right at the start of  north rim because that will be the  start of our cross country race.  sorry to interrupt you guys this  will be in the paper and stuff too I  assume or hopefully so just to get the  information about that and we will  have a lot of information about  frequent users of bidwell park too  that might be an idea for you guys to  notify the press. It' s always a good  way to get the word out.  awesome.  thank you.  when you'  re going to be doing this  event are you going to notify the fire  we will notify the police department  and the police department and  search and rescue because if there is  an accident I have hiked this area it  will be a technical rescue and I think  that they need to know that this race  is occurring just to give them the  information.  we can do that.  how many participants?  70.  I believe we put under 100 in our  packet or application.  and these are all chico state  students or can the general public  also come into this?  it will be general public we don'  t have anyone that was a minor that  will be racing we will have a women'  s and a men'  s open category so anyone 18 and up  can race and we'  re trying to direct it towards  riders of chico.  and you will have a !  a  a !  effectively effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively t always work in  They know there is an accident that they can summon help right away. Can I answer that I live with a mountain biker these guys are up there all the time they know where their cell phones work and they do they work all and they'  out on the trails when the trails are open and they' re dry. I have a question do you have  effectively effectively  effectively effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively effectively  effectively effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  schools but usually the emts we  try to get from the mountain  biking community because they  know the trails so last year we  had an alumni came and knew the  trails and then the school also  requires liability waiver and  that'  s why we can'  t have  minors because the school  doesn'  t have the paperwork to do  with the minors in the race.  I had a couple of things thank  thank you for being here and  thank you for carrying  yourselves very well and  appreciate your participation  this evening. I had a couple of  questions it says they will be  asked to submit an alternative  route for wet weather is that  something that'  s done in advance and  agreed upon in advance and  triggered by wet weather and we  all know we'  re switching to this  one?  exactly yes.  perfect and then just to  clarify this is a non-  reservable area and to me that  sort of meant they will be using  the area but it will be  because it can'  t be reserved but it will be  exclusive use. Hikers people  with dogs will be told to not be  on the trails during this  certain time?  no. it will still be open to  the public so it will not be.  the public is warned you  probably don'  t want to be out there  because there'  s a mountain bike race going  on but it'  s not exclusive per se?  that'  s why on one of the  conditions that they'  re supposed to put out signage  and course monitors so when they do encounter pedestrians or  other people that are on the  I think the other question is  that they can let them know this  race is happening and be aware  or maybe take an alternate route  or something like this.  thanks for clarifying.  just so everybody knows this  is my fifth year on the  commission these races happen  every year this is not a new  thing this is not we'  re not this is  not new more than one mountain  bike race happens every year and  it'  s always flawless and fun and  we have a really great area for  mountain bikers they come from all  over to mountain bike here.  again just a basic newbie  question why is this a good idea  why does the city want to accept  the risk of this race?  recreation is encouraged in the  park and this is a recreational  event it also potentially can  bring tourism to the area and  s several reasons.  I don'  t know how much further  you.  I would say riding your mountain  bike in upper park is less  dangerous than riding a horse in  upper park and we don'  t discourage that we  actively encourage that too.  upper park is mountain biking  heaven I don'  t understand there'  s no risk to us the  only risk is to the cyclists up  there and they'  re assuming the risk I'  m a lawyer I understand  this.  if they get hurt they'  re going to sue the city.  no they don'  t people get hurt up there all  the time.  they can sue the city.  that'  s why they require.  I haven'  t seen it in 26 years that I'  ve lived here.  the university has a really good  liability waiver.  this is perhaps a silly question  but why didn'  t you change the name of the  we changed the name of the  we changed the name so it had  to be a first time event.  honestly we didn'  t know that was a thing we  just changed the name because  it'  s the second one and the name  is a funny naming convention  with popular what'  s going on in pop  culture.  it rhymes with things around  pop culture we didn'  t know that if we  changed the name.  it would be considered a  first time event?  we didn'  t know that.  fortunately the institutional  memory up here realizes you'  ve done well in the past.  any other input, comments,  questions?  okay.  then we will declare.  eric?  I can add for everybody'  s ease.  looking at the permit and  insurance requirements here.  two weeks at least two weeks in  advance the applicant has to  provide proof to our risk  department of the state of  one is the  comprehensive and general  liability coverage in the  amount of one million combined  single limit and two million  aggregate with a bunch of  policy endorsements.  and that is if you buy an  insurance company license to  do business in the state of  california with the best  insurance guide rating of b or  better.  a is typically preferred.  and then in section six one of  the acceptance of conditions is  in signing this permit agree to  identify and hold the city of  chico and or the biddable park  and playground commission free  and clear of all claims of  damage from the property.  insurance for injury persons or  property and upon or about city  parks and playgrounds and it  goes on to further identify.  there is language and that'  s part of the  permit application and the proof  of insurance that is required to  provide.  this is standard city  requirements for similar type of  contracts?  correct.  one more question.  it says in the permit  application that they have to  repair any damage.  is there a deposit required?  it doesn'  t look like they had put down  anything.  maybe it was $150.  I'  I feel the city is protected if  they damage the cranial you have  to do some repairs?  I'  m sorry I didn'  t hear the last part of  your comment.  you feel the city is protected  against them not repairing damage  they done?  I do.  can I respond to that?  mainly in upper park it'  s going to be damaged to one of  the trails.  the trails are dirt and lava  rock.  so I'  m sorry.  I'  m sorry.  if we'  re ready I'  d make a motion to approve  the permit.  I second it.  to answer commissioner  nickel'  s question there is a as part  of the fees for it there is a  refundable damage deposit.  right.  he pointed that out.  okay.  so it'  s been moved to the  first of all as we were taught  at training I'  m declaring the hearing  closed.  and okay.  who moved?  I did.  jay.  and who seconded?  I did.  okay.  it'  s been moved and seconded  that the conditional use permit  be approved.  jay.  commissioner nava?  yes.  commissioner nickels?  aye.  commissioner shen?  yes.  vice chair blashly?  yes.  and chair willis?  yes.  you forget ms.  you forgot ms.  brown-peddy.  he skipped me.  I'  m sorry.  I say yes too.  and have a great time guys.  he seconded it.  so.  okay.  passed.  moving right along to item  number 5.2.  consideration of an application  from nolan levine.  levine or levine?  levine.  levine.  levine.  to hold a music festival in the  area of sycamore pool in south  one mile recreation area on may  24th 2025.  thank you mr.  chair.  just a brief report.  this is not typically this again  not a typically reservable area  and there is there may be  unreasonable interference with  other park users in an intensive  use area.  application and the reason why  this permit is coming to the  commission for review.  the applicant is here if you do  have questions.  I actually don'  t have a question.  I was hoping the young men knew  if they want to stay great but  after you'  re done with your  item if you want to skate out  you get to skate out.  you'  re quite welcome. This is a public meeting.  re free to stay or go if you choose. Thank you. Mr. Levin.  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively Does anybody have any questions or concerns about the event?  effectively !  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  the  I didn'  t see a map  attached but I saw in your  handwriting I think I read it  correctly right near the swimming  pool near the lifeguard station  but on the grass area or where?  probably right behind the  lifeguard stations there in the  grass.  I'  m trying to get an idea  for it thank you.  Mr. Chair are you ready for  questions?  if you could give us an overview  of your motivation and what you'  re hoping from the event I think  that would be helpful and if you  could in particular touch on the  fact it will be Saturday of  memorial day which is part of  your motivation for holding it then  but also a time when a lot of  folks might be using that area.  I didn'  t realize that but that'  s cool.  The intention is to just have a day  of music in the park and make it  more of an enjoyable place.  There'  e not really too much more  behind it than that.  I think for the first year I  would like to keep it really  simple just a few acts and then  eventually it could I mean it'  s a lot of fun.  s limitless how it could grow it  could be the whole city partaking  in spring a few years down the line  but I just want to start with some  people singing to the birds and  other people enjoying and swimming.  So you'  re not going to set up a stage  or anything they'  ll just.  We will probably set up a little  riser with a banner or something  behind it.  Mr. Chairman are you going to charge  people to attend or are you going to  charge the bands to participate?  No.  So essentially free for anybody  who wants to walk in is free?  Yes.  Okay.  Is this going to be amplified or  is it?  Yes.  re going to have generators there?  I plan on having a small generator  and it'  s a pretty small PA and a long  extension cord so you can'  t hear it.  And how many in the bands how  many members will be in the band  what kind of amplification because  we have some neighbors nearby so  I'  m a little concerned about that  but how big are these bands and  how many bands are you going to have and from what time to what time?  Well I was hoping to have music  from like 12 to 8 and then  hopefully be done with the music before  people are trying to go to sleep and  it becomes an issue.  So maybe  six or seven acts and  I want to keep it to folk and  bluegrass kind of things  and so it'  ll be little  amplification  if any mostly amplified  vocals.  But yeah just keep it to  things that sound good in that  sort of setting around the water  by the creek.  So no heavy metal or death metal  or any speed metal nothing like that?  Nothing like that no.  But I mean eventually  we can also  rent out the town  square and do something a little bit more  urban there and then people can ride from  town square to the stage in the park  and then from Sycamore  pool they can ride to Cypress  what is it called?  Cypress Grove.  And yeah it could eventually be  something like that.  Different kinds of music at different parts of the city.  So given the  probable demographics of the  people there it'  s going to be what you might call  G rated music?  Yes family friendly for sure.  Anyone else?  I had a couple of other questions.  So I'  ll just say I'  m a bit concerned about the use of the space because there are so many other people that are  in the world that like to use that especially on Memorial Day.  So there'  s kind of two impacts that I see.  One is physically being in a space where somebody might also want to be with their blanket.  But then there'  s also the sound impacts where people might  want to be hearing their own music that they'  ve brought or talking with people.  So those are the two things that I'  m thinking about and just conflicts there with other users.  I appreciate the beauty that I think you'  re trying to bring to it and sharing art in that way.  I just wonder if there'  e another location that'  s nearby that would be  or even back a little further from the lifeguard stand and closer to the path if you don'  t envision people kind of congregating but just like more passively enjoying it.  I think we just want to protect what people would expect they can find on Memorial Day weekend at  Sycamore Pool.  I see.  Yeah. I think they might enjoy something  I think.  I think.  I think.  I think.  I think.  podem I think we can get that any other day as well. You'  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  I can check the limits.  there are some pretty stringent  limits as I recall for decibel  levels of music in the park.  the 12 r codes within 50 feet  is to have unusual noises whether  it'  s bands or someone screaming or  something like this it'  s within 50 feet of audible.  As far as stringent that'  s pretty stringent.  will your program be able to  conform to those guidelines or  rules?  absolutely.  commissioner nickels get a word  in.  are we waiving a rule creating a  rule?  if we authorize this and we  created a precedent we would have  to follow sometime in the future  for people to use areas that  aren'  t necessarily permitted for  this type of use?  I don'  before you to take into  consideration the different  nuances like commissioner thomas  said this is going to be a metal  event or folk and bluegrass.  those types of things.  each event is unique.  I'  m hearing moving forward there'  s more and more interest to  bring different types of programming into the lower park  and one mile area so we may be seeing more permits like this  come before you.  you will be monitoring to see if there'  re any complaints from  neighbors and crowds so we have some feedback on how acceptable  this was to the normal users of the park?  we do have rangers park rangers  scheduled to be on that day and they would monitor the events.  the permit seems to say if one  person complains you have to shut them down is that reasonable?  I'  d not see where it says if one person.  it said something about  anybody complains.  saw that in here somewhere.  in the conditions?  the second to last bullet says  the sound volume will be at a reasonable level noise complaints will  terminate the event.  i think the complaints is  being made  s the key there.  it would be if you get one complaint, two complaints, three complaints, what'  s reasonable and what'  s not.  if it' s obviously disturbing people you get multiple complaints and that would terminate the event.  will you be advertising in any way for this event?  yes.  online.  i'  ll probably try to get into  kzfr and talk about it there.  a lot of word of mouth.  i'  ll make a poster as well and  hang that up around.  there will be more people than  normally would be in this general area on memorial day because of the advertising?  it' s possible, yes.  are the lifeguards on?  do we have lifeguards until 8 o'clock?  i'  typically the last few years lifeguards have been starting later in the season.  we don'  t have confirmation of a start date for lifeguards this year at this point.  way back that would be the beginning of the swim year.  but it'  s pushed out into mid-june typically now.  so there'  s a good chance that we would not have lifeguards on that weekend.  so concerning the  if we'  re drawing a lot of people there and the dam will be in place by then.  is that correct?  so the water will be up?  yes.  thank you.  i think that would be good for all parties if we got maybe some lifeguards there that weekend.  if it is typically busy as well it might be good for everything.  thank you.  thank you.  it'  s not working tonight.  i appreciate music and i will say i do live along side the park.  i'  m a little further down granted than a past commissioner was.  i will say the races tend to actually be noisier than the music.  we'  re all used to it.  the vast majority of us on the streets on both sides.  I know a lot of folks really enjoy that everyone is recreating and having fun and we're used to the certain hours as long as  It's not going into the wee hours  You know what? I mean, we all we all are pretty  Happy to have you be happy  And I like that it's gonna be folks and bluegrass that that sounds family-friendly  That was I was glad that someone raised that like what type because there is some that might not be conducive to children about  Just for future years too. And as you think about growing things  I don't know if you're aware there is a raised area in the grassy area  Behind the restrooms that do I have a natural like it's a concrete state, but it's the slope goes up quite high  So it's nice for people that are viewing because everyone could see just as a consideration point. It's near the  Softball field so that kind of brings things in right near parking as well  So that if someone was disabled they can get along there closer just just an FYI  But I think that that effectively effectively  What you're proposing said and up closer to the pool, correct  As long as it's in that in that general area to where people can  Swim and listen to the music right then then I'll be I'll be happy  Okay, and I've heard music quite a few times down in one mile. So this is not anything new and it sounds like maybe closer to the pool podem it is maybe a little different  podem  podem  podem  this is nothing new  Also, I I wouldn't be concerned about it disturbing people trying to listen to their own music  Everybody listens to those freaking earbuds now anyway, I mean, I don't ever hear anybody with a speaker  They've all they're all plugged in and you know, at least my children are and if there aren't any lifeguards  They have signs up to say no lifeguards on duty. So everybody is completely aware  And that's cards issue not ours. So you may want to  They're staffing the lifeguards, right? So  Yeah, so I don't know if that's something he can do to  Talk to card he could reach out to card  And see if they could work something out to bring lifeguards on that day  But I wouldn't imagine there would be a cost to that, right? Yeah, it might be cost prohibitive  But again, they'll have signs up no lifeguard on duty. And I think we a couple summers ago  We went  All summer without lifeguards, so I would not be concerned about that either  Cool, and I guess those are all the comments I had and I think it sounds great anytime  maybe somebody will be introduced to some new music or  You know, that's a good thing. So thank you for your proposal. Absolutely. Thanks for hearing  I think  No !  I  I'll make a motion that we approve the application from Nolan Levine  To hold a music festival in the area of Sycamore pool and South one mile recreation area on 5 24 2025 a second  Okay  Perfect so Commissioner Inaba  Yes  I'm sorry, Thomas Petty. Did you make the second?  Okay  Commissioner Nichols aye  Commissioner Scheer yes  Vice chair Blashley no based on the fact that it's on Memorial Day weekend and we don't have a specific  site  for for the event if we could have it at a different date and we could go out and see the  Specific site I would vote yes, but no right now  and chair willis  So motion passes motion passes  If you want it if you're looking for the future make this one more wonderful, thank you so much. Thank you for coming  Okay  So  That moves on to item six reports and communications  Parks division report  verbal report from Shane remain  Thank You mr. Chair, so this a division report for the month  No action can be taken on this report is for information only. I would like to  inform you that we were  very  lucky with the assistant park manager applications that came in we had a total of 98 applicants  It was the response was incredible  Of those applicants. I reviewed 50 of those applications  From the 50 12 were selected for interviews. We completed those interviews  last week  Last Friday to be exact and we're planning on inviting three back for second interviews next week  so very strong  Candidates that were excited about re excited about. Happening in bid well park if  E  E  E  E  E  E  E  E  E  E  E  E  E  E  E  E  E  not sure if you can  remember I think I mentioned  last month in between meetings  that lion'  s head that was  originally there was early 90'  s it'  s been there so it'  s quite faded  and has been functional for  quite some time. There'  s one person in the united  states that I found that  actually manufactures these  lions fountains so it took  about a year to get it. We  center of the city and we also  moved it from its previous  spot that was near the  Humpty Dumpty sand pit area  and children would like to go  over there and pour a bunch of  sand in the lion'  s mouth and so it'  s kind of a little bit  of a maintenance nightmare. So  we moved it to where it'  s more front and center  as you walk into cape rakers  where the personalized brick  circle is it'  s right there so we'  in the middle park area we'  ve been working with  lions for workforce  development on storm damage  clean up grant so they come to  us at no cost it'  s a crew of six  members who are working there  40 hours per week and they'  re focusing on  downed and dead tree material  that has built up a substantial  amount of fire fuels there. We  California conservation corps so  the lions don'  t use power  equipment they'  ve been pulling the  material out and piling it up  the California conservation corps  is also there on a different  grant and they'  re chipping up that  material. It'  s the pace of which these  guys have been working has been  incredible and the impact is  it'  s blown me away. I'  ve walked around there with  several different people and  been overwhelmed by the amount  of downed and dead there but now  it'  s looking really great  and moving forward it will be put  on a calendar a maintenance  calendar so each year our own  staff can go into that area and  spend a few days and pick up  anything that'  s new so we'  ll have this build  up of fuels in the middle park  area. In upper park we'  ve been working on  grading the parking lots the  weather has been favorable to do  some grading in parking lot e or  the horseshoe lake area and  parking lot and at the observatory  parking lot both those parking  lots get an immense amount of  use and the potholes build up  very quickly even when we have  these big rain events people  drive through and tear up those  lots and annually we go through  and grade them and get them  patched up. Next on deck for that  is the easter cross parking area  that'  s in really bad shape right  now. Ultimately or finally the  run gun club and that grading is  going to be due in preparation for  the upcoming paving that will be  taking place in late spring early  summer as weather conditions  allow. In our green ways we have  goats we'  re going to be returning to  lindow channel soon right now  they'  re scheduled to return the  week of April 7 and that'  s part of the fema  defensible space that we have !  podem  podem grazings one in the spring and then the last one will be in the fall so that grazing will happen  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  park and they contributed their  time weeding around the exterior  of caper acres and sprucing up  the inside of caper acres in  preparation for the spring  jamboree that will be happening  in a couple of weeks.  Lastly in segueing into richie'  s report we received a  very generous donation of $15,000  from the friends of bidwell park  to go towards the eucalyptus  removal project there at east  eighth avenue and the forest  avenue entrance of the park.  This project goes along with our  vegetation fuels management plan  and reducing fuels and also  removing invasive non native  species from the park so it'  s twofold. If you recall there  is a private donor that  contributed $20,000 towards this  project now with the $15,000  from bidwell park and the  friends of bidwell park that'  s a pretty sizeable chunk in  the city of chico will put in  the difference to get that  project done.  With that I will hand it over  to richie'  Bamblett urban forest manager.  Thank you shane and chair  willis and commissioners.  Again I have a verbal update.  March is typically the busiest  month in the tree division  because all aspects of tree  work are in the tree department  and the trees are in the tree  So it's a busy month and  we're just wrapping up the  cal fire seed to shade urban  and community forestry grant  that has been running for the  last three years.  That grant funded city's  operations to plant a thousand  trees around the city in front  of people's homes to provide  shade.  Also included providing  backyard fruit trees so people  can plant them.  So we just about concluded it.  We haven't fully counted up the  number of trees that we have to  report to cal fire but we're  comfortably over a thousand.  Just this weekend we had a great  community event in partnership  with butte environmental council.  They hosted a free tree giveaway  a fruit tree giveaway at their  community gardens up at oak park  oak way park and they hosted a  just off north avenue and that  went very well.  So currently there's a wait list  of about 100 people that missed  out and didn't respond in time  to grab a free tree but we'll  certainly hope in the future to  work through that wait list and  get them a tree as well.  So that was really great and  we're also wrapping up this  season with our partnership  with medical foundation this  year or this spring.  We've just finished delivering  trees to all the new parents that  have gone through the maternity  ward.  This season we've delivered 25  trees to the new moms and parents  so that's a lot of fun.  I know the staff love delivering  those trees because the kid or  if the kid is old enough they're  usually out there waiting and  then we start getting photographs  of the parents with the new baby  and the tree and we forward that  to Enloe and it's a great  experience.  It's really nice.  It's our favourite definitely.  Moving on to removals.  This month we also concluded the  Park Avenue removals.  That work was done early in  March and that is ahead of an  engineering project.  The Department of Division of  Engineering did get an ATP  grant, alternative transportation  grant and that's to upgrade the  back of the park.  We've also got a bike path that  runs along Park Avenue.  So part of that is to upgrade the  landscaping.  So we're excited that we started  the first phase of that.  We removed 87 trees which were  really dead, dying, just not good  specimens.  So we decided to remove those  and later in the year we will  plant new trees.  And as Shane mentioned there is  tree work that we're doing  We have some tree work scheduled  in Bidwell Park next month.  Well in fact tomorrow we start  work on Peterson Drive.  And hopefully commissioners got  forwarded a copy of the press  release on the road closure.  So they are starting tomorrow.  There's five, over 500 trees that  will be pruned.  21 trees will be removed.  And they're mainly dead walnut  trees with black walnut roots  which kind of shouldn't be there  anyway.  So we'll use that opportunity to  plant new native trees when the  time is right later in the year.  We anticipate that work will take  about a month.  So we'll see how it goes with the  road closure.  It does mean that Peterson Drive  will effectively be closed seven  days a week for the next month.  We will look to see if we can  open it in the evening during  Monday to Friday.  But the contractor will be working  seven days a week.  So certainly they will make the  most of the fact that the  Peterson Drive is closed anyway  at the weekend.  So they're a really hardworking  bunch of guys and they're ready  to work seven days a week until  the job's done.  So that's exciting.  Upcoming activities, we are planning  the Arbor Day event with Parkview  Elementary School.  Arbor Day Elementary School again.  So commissioners are welcome and  we will send you our invites to  that.  I know Commissioner Narver very  graciously helped out with that  event last year and had a really  good time, I think.  And not to be happy with just one  event, so we also have another  event on the same day.  So there are 50 international Red  Cross students in conjunction with  Chico State, I believe.  So I'm in talks with CARD to put on  an Arbor Day event for those students  at Degamo Park.  So they're looking to plant a dozen  or so trees in strategic places  where CARD staff really would like  to see more shade in the park.  So that should be another fun  event and you can go there and  you might find you get an invite to  come to that as well.  So that's all I have for the month of  March and I'll be happy to answer any  questions.  Commissioner  Collins-Betty?  Did I understand you to say you were  wrapping up your partnership with  FL?  Sorry, no, I misspoke.  No, just wrapping up for this season,  the deliveries.  I'm hoping that's a forever project  that we do it every year. Yeah. Great. Yeah, it's a great one.  Right. Thanks for the opportunity to  clarify.  Commissioner Nava?  Yes. I was seeing a little  bit of back and forth online  and so I'd like to get some clarification  on how many  more trees along the  Esplanade, along the new bike  path will be removed?  At this stage,  I'm not aware  of any more that will be removed.  Engineering and the  contractors have been good to  give me enough heads up  and come and look at each tree that  may present a problem with  constructability of the  new bike path. But I don't  believe any more. In fact,  I think today they  started planting another hundred  Ginkgo trees.  So they're going in right now.  Lovely. I think, you know, just if  people could consider  public transparency in  doing this, it helps people  to kind of keep the temperature down because, I mean,  the path will be a lovely thing that  there'  s a safer  spot for people and I just think it  would be good to keep the rumors to a  minimum.  For sure.  Thank you.  Commissioner Nick?  Shane, the position you were recruiting  for, I didn'  t get the title and  what the person does?  So it'  s the system park manager.  And that person.  That was your position then? Yes, sir.  Would you like more?  No, I understand.  I got it.  Question. Is that something  that we'  re going to have any  input to or does it go directly from the  staff interviews to the council?  Probably  It won'  t go to the commission or the council.  Okay.  It' s administrative hire?  Okay. Yes, staff level approval.  Mr. Chairman, I  got more questions.  Shane or Eric, are we at risk for losing any federal funding from the federal  retrenchment?  Have you heard that there'  e anything at risk that we should be aware of?  If there is, we can have a conversation with our congressman?  Yes, we definitely will.  We'  re keeping a close eye on things.  Nothing has reached our desk yet that'  s in danger of federal funding.  Our engineering side of public works manages a lot of grants and  funding from the federal level, federal and state government.  In fact, just to back up a little further, too, to make sure we report the correct granting agency, the grant for the Park Avenue improvements is Clean California, not ATP active transportation.  But we do have many ATP active transportation grants out there.  But that particular one was Clean California.  So, no, nothing major that'  s reached me at our level at this point.  But we'  re actively keeping an eye on things for sure.  One more question.  I'  m going to ask you about the  last council meeting.  At the request of council member O'  brian, there was an issue of transferring consideration of operations and maintenance of parks to card.  There was a conversation about that coming to commission.  Reading the minutes for tomorrow night'  s meeting and the actual minutes, it doesn'  t say anything.  It says it goes to the finance committee.  One, I think that would be a subject that this commission ought to be pretty interested in.  If that starts reaching some point of  concern, I'  s a question of fruition.  But more importantly, do you understand what the objective here is?  yeah.  I think there is intent to have maybe some more recreation programming, get a little bit more of an intensive use in some of our parks.  The first two that were mentioned were city plaza and maybe depot park.  We'  ve effectively  effectively  effectively ! hear kind of where we're at on that particular lists and what those costs  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  I think the item at the  meeting last week and last  Thursday and the paper reported  on it that it sounded like  there'  s a large list of parks  that were presented to their  board we'  re looking at what would that  look like if say card either  leased or took over the plaza  to for example to really  program a lot more functions  and activities in those  particular areas just to get a  more intensive use of some of  those areas.  at this point you think the  objective is recreational  programming not saving money  somehow it'  s going to be cheaper to  have the parks managed by  card?  yeah I think it'  s more recreational  programming.  I attended the meeting of the  card board and it wasn'  t a long  conversation but commissioner  lando thinks you'  re trying to transfer the  homeless problem to him.  I'  m not sure.  I'  m not sure.  good to hear.  I was going to raise that  same issue.  So you named two specifically  and there were a dozen named  including greenways, comanche  creek and others I didn'  t envision exactly what  the more intensive recreational  uses would be.  I do think there'  s an interest  from the commission with our  limited authority to hear more  about that.  I'  m glad to hear it will be on  the next month.  there'  s a long list thrown out.  I'  this discussion is way beyond  the agenda and the reports we'  ve  been giving.  it'  s going to come before us at  some point.  why don'  t we save our comments  until then?  may I continue to my next  one?  another item that came up  today that we'  ve heard  before and I don'  t know exactly where this is  but the city is circulation and  longer term planning for  circulation is there any update  on that?  I believe that'  s next meeting as well.  engineering is finalizing their  design options and that'  s for south park drive.  I believe that will be brought  back at next month'  s meeting as well.  we'  ve a shorter meeting  and shorter agenda tonight but  it'  ll be a hefty agenda and a  longer meeting next month.  I don'  t know if you want me to go  talk to eric after.  one is about.  one item was Mr.  Vanover-Becker's  request.  I think he was here before and  floating some things and then I  saw on the city council agenda  about the 20-year plan that he  would like the commission to  come up with.  I get that.  that'  s going to be coming  before us too as we found out  today.  I have a request in advance  since you'  re going to be at that  meeting.  I think it would be prudent to  ensure that there are some  salient details included with  that expectation because it'  s going to land with us and it  stays with us.  effectively effectively effectively  effectively effectively effectively  effectively effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  is looking to have met that to  me would be good and then a  question I would have is when  they say commission do they mean  the staff would produce said  report with inputs or is that  literally something we would be  that is a work in progress there  have been discussions with the  council so we will again wait  and see what comes before us.  can I interject?  commissioner navi you'  re welcome to  contact councilmember van overbeck and talk to him about it I would say.  anything else?  anybody have anything pertinent to what we'  re doing here  tonight?  if not I'  m going to  declare the meeting adjourned.  we will be back at 6 o'clock right here.  thank you.  thank you.
