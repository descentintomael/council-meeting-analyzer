and 42140 174. a proposal for construction of a two-story 208 unit apartment complex on a 11.77 acre site at the northeastern corner of west lindo avenue and north avenue slash highway 32. okay. madison? all right. good evening commissioners. i will be presenting the staff report on the site of this is a request for a planned development permit for 208 unit apartment complex. the 11.7 acre site is located on the northeastern corner of west lindo avenue and north avenue highway 32. the site is split zoned and is designated medium density residential and neighborhood commercial on the general plan land use diagram and is owned to medium density residential and neighborhood commercial with an airport overflight zone c corridor opportunity site and special design district west side place burismo overlays northern section of the site paralleling the pacific union rail railway is zoned cn while the remaining majority of the site is zoned r2 the resulting density of the project would be gross density of 17.8 dwelling units per acre which is above the allowable range of the original r2 zoning district but with the allowable density range for the cos density range 1570 units per acre site would feature 21 apartment buildings arranged around the perimeter as well as within the central area parking and vehicular access are organized in a circular fashion around the site primary access will be taken off of west lindo avenue an additional emergency vehicle access point is provided to the southeast and it's accessible to the west side of the site there will be a west side place on ruskin street but it is restricted from public use that it will be allowed for pedestrian and bicycle use though just not public vehicle use pedestrian access is also facilitated through the gate onto north avenue to the south and is conveniently addressed into the bus stop a total of 367 vehicle parking spots are provided the corridor opportunity site co2 overlay permits reduced parking ratio with one space allocated for each one bedroom unit and one and a half spaces for each two bedroom or larger unit furthermore 51 bike racks will be provided throughout the site each capable of accommodating four bikes the overall architectural style of the apartment is derived from the contemporary farmhouse and modern palettes of contrasting neutral colors the applicant has provided two separate um color palettes i did not include them on the presentation but if you look through the pallets through the packets you'll be able to see both a more white and gray palette versus a beige and tan color palette that is really up to the board to decide or speaks the applicant on what you feel will be a better coloring the apartment buildings would be capped at a maximum of two stories in height with about a maximum of 30 feet each they would include a range of building types including 12 units eight unit and four unit structures all while sharing a similar style and facade these they would vary in size though furthermore the site it would feature a one-story clubhouse designated to complement the neighboring neighboring apartment buildings amenities would also include a barbecue area multi-use lawn dog park and pool a variety of trees will be provided throughout the site including crepe myrtle canary island pine cedar chinese backstage elm and interior live oak proposed trees would help meet the minimum shade requirements and providing 50.1 shade coverage all exterior lighting would be low in intensity and energy efficient a six foot high tubular black fence would encircle the south and east perimeters of the project site along the north side a 10 foot cmu sound wall would serve as a barrier from sound from the railroad that is proposed mitigation from the resultant negative declaration the applicant has proposed to also reduce the height along the eastern boundary currently on the site plan it labels as a 10 foot sound wall the applicant has requested to reduce that size down to six feet itself so i'll be a little shorter staff does support this change and recommends planning commission also support a traffic study was conducted as part of the initial study process the traffic study based on vehicles miles traveled for vmt concluded that traffic would not have a significant impact overall on the site the project is proposed uh to general generate 11.4 vehicle miles per travel per day which is about 23 less than the county average caltrans has confirmed with staff that traffic signal will be installed at the intersection of west linda avenue and north avenue with construction anticipated in 2020 to start in 2026. based on the results of the initial study and made the game negative declaration was prepared for the project and circulated for a 30-day comment period commencing on april 2nd 2024 and ending on may 1st 2024. due to the length the initial study is incorporated into the report as a reference the link there was able to be clicked and you were able to view the initial study if you chose to the mitigation measures are included in the mitigation monitoring program and recommended conditions of approval mitigation measures directly address potential impacts such as noise nesting birds cultural resources hazardous materials and tribal cultural resources city staff did not receive a staff recommends recommendation to the board that they consider the project staff report and the project staff report will be considered as part of the project report. direct any questions to staff and provide comments to hold a public hearing regarding the proposed project and adopt resolution 24-08 adopt mitigation mitigated declaration and approve plan development permit 2301 subject to the attached conditions staff did not receive public comments until today so you'll see on your desk there is a memo attached due to the length of it of the comment itself staff was not able to respond right away we did receive this in the afternoon we'll say that the beginning portion of it we are going to direct the person who had questions about it that it is a public records act request so we will send them the link and that will be handled to Kirk's office regarding specific projects the questions regarding specific projects i've answered below here question number one it looks like the traffic study was single day tuesday october 24th 2023 is accurate yes consistent with traffic and engineering standards and techniques the data collection occurred typical midweek tuesday wednesday or thursday to reflect the typical traffic conditions the data was for the traffic study was collected on tuesday october 24th 2023 number two the study did not include pinch points to exist in chico example west sacramento nord intersections the bridge over big chico creek or east and esplanade is this accurate did the city consider these problems um the study is not accurate the city is not the study intersections used for those intersections were intersections were used for the traffic study our precedent approved by city staff it should be noted that the operational analysis was provided to demonstrate compliance with the city policy but is no longer a part of the sequel process itself number three the city requiring post traffic light at west lindo glenwood nor would be installed prior to project permit being issued the intersection is planned to be signalized by caltrans as part of the highway 32 improvement plan we do not require installation prior to permit approval though number four the access to the project will be from west lindo was an impact study conducted uh considered or required before west lindo this is known to be a local shortcut to esplanade cusick and east albany to avoid traffic on west east avenue west lindo does not have center line it's very narrow and it's curvy road knowing this will likely become a major thrill affair for new residents in the apartments who travel to and from the apartments was proposed risk road the proposed access point on west lindo avenue was analyzed in the traffic study for needed for potential improvements and access proposed on the site plan was determined to be adequate the project would require the construction of frontage improvements on west lindo avenue to bring the street up to city standards as well more residents of west lindo avenue included on the west on the pre-application neighborhood meeting and comment discussion then a pre-application meeting included a 500 foot radius which notified everyone within 500 feet of the project site number six did city require environmental studies or transportation studies to be included in the calculations for 616 west east avenue apartments or orchard creek the traffic study did include future conditions which would evaluate the traffic conditions associated with the build out of the city general plan and number seven has a song has the city's project been approved by the architectural review board does the board no longer exist any longer yes the arb as you all are aware um is part of the planning commission as a subcommittee and um they're concurrently reviewed as we are doing today this meeting that concludes staff support i am here to answer any questions thank you very much madison good report um can i ask a quick question so this will not go in front of the architectural view no this will be uh joint today together today so traditionally plan development partners have gone before the architecture review and then the planning commission as our efforts to streamline the process more we have combined it all in one so you're able to speak on both the architectural design and the planning commission portion of the project okay any other comments or questions for madison i have a question about the sound ball you mentioned that it went from eight to six feet um so just on the eastern portion itself so the side that is not along the railroad so if you see here so the eastern portion um that's not along the railroad there is an air on the site plan where it says 10 feet sound wall they are lowering that down six feet the sound wall directly across towards the railroad will still remain 10 feet thank you okay anybody else yeah i have a question about the traffic impacts from this project and i know the developer of the city is going to be responsible for putting in all the street improvements around their project but they're also responsible for paying some pretty significant traffic impact fees and they'll pay for other improvements around the city and take care of traffic problems i can't remember what that that fee is for an apartment but uh matt uh would be able to speak to that but the fees are based off bedroom or unit so based off how many one bedroom one baths two bedroom two baths that sort of um basis i i don't know the exact fee that it's based off of but it is a substantial amount for how many units yeah it would be part of this complex um i wish i could remember the the the fee per unit but i was thinking this is going to be you know million dollars or so in in traffic impact fees for 200 units again i don't know the exact dollar amount but it will be a substantial amount all right thanks anybody else okay we'll open the public hearing nicole we have both the applicant here so first speaker is matt galloway and then christian polly sorry i apologize for my colleague obnoxious cell phone matt delaway architect for the project thanks uh this evening for having me speak to you madison's report was great we really covered all the topics and we're going to talk about the topics uh i elaborated on a little bit of the process that we went through just to make sure everybody's aware in march 23 we presented to the neighborhood three separate options for this location one was the bare minimum intensity that we could have it was a drawing very similar to this with much less density we also went to the extreme of showing what the property would look like with 70 units per per acre and obviously the neighborhood did not react very well and have a very warm welcome to that extreme density that was in there so although the corridor overlay is in place in this location as well as the other overlay we opted to kind of hit the middle section in terms of density it seemed to work pretty well it's right in the marketplace right now in terms of what the what the market is absorbing for units so we opted to go with that in conjunction with you know at no small part because of what the neighbors requested obviously traffic associated with all those units is a big concern another concern with it and the number of units was the connectivity that was originally drawn that was going through ruskin street in the back portion so we verified with the fire department that they were okay with us removing that leaving it as a fire department access but removing it for connectivity for uh for regular vehicles and you're maintaining it for bicycles and pedestrians and emergency vehicle access and transportation okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay side of that property. Well, the sound report came back and suggested a 10-foot sound wall across the back side, but did not recommend having any sound wall between the two. And so it seemed a little bit obtrusive to have this large 10-foot wall, almost prison-like, between the two properties. That's why earlier in the week we reached out to Madison and said, hey, the sound report doesn't require this. We don't have to mitigate any sound allocation. How about bringing this down? He's having a little less obtrusive barrier between the two, and so that's what we're here. That's the one change that we're requesting at this time. From a design standpoint, we did kind of go with a more trendy ranch-style, bar-style palette and materials on the exterior. At one point, staff said, hey, maybe we want to enrich that up a little bit, so we did offer an alternative color palette, but did note that Westside Place along the side, along the North Avenue, has the same color and houses for the first six houses on there, so it didn't seem like necessarily we needed to go that way. I think the farm-style palette is very neutral, has some accent colors in the middle, but it's very neutral and very popular right now, so that's the direction we're going with that. I'd be happy to answer any other questions about architectural style to developers here as well. We're just so honed to talk about some of the traffic concerns if we need to go there. Anybody? Anybody? Thank you, Mr. Galloway. Thank you. Christian Pulley. So, Chris, Chip Alley. I don't have a lot to say after what Matt kind of took a lot of the thunder, but I will say that we did reach out to Caltrans at the beginning. I was talking to Matt about it, and Matt's alluded to it. And we have, since the last year, to find out what their process is. They have a big project that's going to be in the highway 32. And I don't know if it was all I did. I'm in Hamilton City, but that is the project that they went out to bid this March, last March of 2024. We had an email from Caltrans alluding to that they hope to have a contract by June, and then the construction will start at the end of June, July, and August. And it's a big project, but it will take through 2025. And then their goal is, in the email that I have, is that they would be able to do a lot of things. They're going to be installing the light. You install your underground and get all your big street improvements done, and then the last thing that goes up is the lights, right? And then that's slated for the end of 2025, beginning of 2026. This project would be big enough that I don't see us starting it this year. It would be a 2025 project and more of a 2026, and maybe a 2027. So, anyhow, I don't have a whole lot to say that we did have the public meeting with the folks. I really, I do think we took to heart what they said. They didn't want three, four-story buildings in their backyard. We even brought some other buildings that were more family-oriented. That was the four-plexes, or the stack in the center, and the three- or four-bedroom, to try to show that. Like Matt was alluding to, not having the pass-through to go through the neighborhood. We put a block wall along the side instead of having a wood fence or an iron fence to separate that. There's no way that we want a 10-foot wall. Something six-foot is more what we'd like to see. But I think we listened to the public at the time, and we understood what their concerns were. And I think it's going to be a good project. Any questions you guys have, we have to take them. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Gavali. Okay, we'll close the public hearing. Chair Wall, excuse me. We have one more speaker. Pardon? We have one more speaker. Oh, I thought you said two. We'll reopen it, and then we'll close it. Who is that speaker? Trent Nahas. Hello, thank you. I haven't done anything like this before. Okay, then I needed you to fill this. I live on the corner of West Lindo and the railroad tracks, so right across from the development. And I did some desk readings with a couple different apps on my phone, so I don't know if these are accurate. But the readings are already above the acceptable level, I think, for the public. I think it's 60 outside is the acceptable level, and 45 inside. So both are already above that. Now that there's going to be a 10-foot wall on the other side of the tracks, we now have that sound reflected back towards us. So I was just curious that we're already above the acceptable level. I know that this only applies to new developments, but this is still a new development issue, because even though it's causing, maybe causing a problem to us, it's still something that I think needs to be addressed. For the new development. So that was basically that. So I, when the experts came around, they're doing desk readings. We actually allowed them to put it in the backyard, our backyard. And I'm assuming those readings brought them to the conclusion that you need a 10-foot wall to make it acceptable for the new development. The problem is, we don't have the luxury of a wall to then bounce, to then catch that sound that's now bouncing, not only off the wall, but off of the new two-foot buildings, two-story buildings behind that wall. So I just was putting it out there. I don't know if it's too late to mention this, but I wanted it to be heard. And I'll be trying to figure out what the next step is that I can take. Thank you. Thank you, Trent. Can I ask for any comments or clarification? No. I don't know how this works exactly. Unfortunately. I'm not the sound consultant. I have some specific design in terms of absorption and reflection. I would have to refer that question to him. I would think that it would be something the developer would want to consider. But if it is approved by the city, I think that it is now the city's responsibility to mitigate that possible increased noise pollution for the residents along Trent Drive. Thank you. Thank you, sir. Excuse me, Chair. Well, we had one last speaker. Yes. Maya Jal. Thank you, Chair. I just wanted to say thank you to all of you for coming today. Good evening. Good evening. My name is Leah Jule. The questions that Madison, or Ms. Griswold posed, were my questions that I sent her this afternoon. I emailed, I believe, the day before yesterday asking for some documents, which she was nice enough to provide, and I did have a list of more documents today to be able to put together my full comment. I have lived in this area since I was born. I live on West Sacramento Avenue except for the period of time that I went away to college. I have lived in the West Sacramento Glenwood area and still live there today. This area, I'm not sure how many people here are familiar or travel this area often. North Avenue cannot be widened any more than it already is. It has a for the most part a center lane that allows turning in the center. It cannot get any wider due to the restrictions on private land. And they've actually widened it. I don't know. I don't know how many people were around, but in the late 80s, early 90s, they widened North Avenue to about as far as it can go. So we're stuck with our one lane going in each direction with the center lane. During the periods of traffic, which are in the mornings as everyone may guess, but more so in the afternoon. So starting about 3.30 until about 6.30 at night. North Avenue starting. We're going at second, especially when you go over the bridge where everybody from here for a while knows where Paisan's Pizza used to be. It is a place that backs up all the way down to the signal to allow the signal on the first West Sacramento Avenue to go through. Caltrans has improved that section. It does move a little bit better. You are stuck again at the second signal. And things do thin out a little bit. Until you get near East Avenue. The projection on traffic that I read in the documents that I was provided. This traffic study was done in February, finalized in February of 2024. In the study, it states that the signal that is proposed by Caltrans to be put in at the Glenwood West Lindo. Avenue is scheduled to be commenced this summer. In Ms. Driscoll's report, it says that it's set to commence in 2026. That intersection is extremely dangerous. The city is aware of that. Caltrans is aware of that. If this building goes forward before that is secured, that is a knowing liability that the city is taking on for any accident that happens there. And I can't imagine that they want to do so. I have other comments, but I see that I'm out of time. And quite honestly, until I get the documents that I requested, I can't finish my comment. But at this time, I do appreciate your time. Thank you. Okay. Thank you, Leah. Any other comments or questions? Okay. We'll close the public hearing. Anybody want to make a motion or ask your own question? I just didn't see a couple. I mean, what are your opinions on the support of the architecture? I didn't see those and some of the things that are familiar with projects that they both done. I know they do great work and stuff, but just a couple things I missed. Code already requires the screening. Yes, they require everything. I just didn't see them on the plan. I'm sure they're beautiful. I like them. Great. I don't know if there's anything else. We haven't really mixed something together with both of these. So I don't know if we had to go through that. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. the city of california and some of the existing concerns that we' re hearing about out there and developing the capacity for future development in this part of town as well especially in conjunction with payment of the traffic impact fees and such. The timing may not be perfect but seems like it' s going to sink it up out here so I' m not too concerned that we' re going to get ahead of ourselves on that out here. you ready to make a motion? I' ll make a motion. I recommend planning commission adopt resolution number 24-08 attachment a adopt the mitigated declaration and approve plan development permit 23-01 2240 north avenue apartments subject to the recommended conditions. Exhibit 2. second. I' ll second that. motion and a second. Nicole would you give us a roll call vote please. commissioner cooper. yes. commissioner laffens. yes. commissioner pulin. yes. commissioner wolf. yes. thank you. we will move on to the regular agenda. reports and communications. Bruce. Mr. Chair. my microphone is out. here it is. I don' t have any reports to recommend. we don' t have any items for your next meeting so that will be a little bit of a! meeting now. . . . . . .
