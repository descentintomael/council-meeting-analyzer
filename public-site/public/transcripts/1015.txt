Now, therefore, be it resolved that I, Andrew Coolidge, Mayor of the City of Chico, on behalf of City Council, join advocates and communities across the country in taking action to prevent youth homelessness and runaway, and do hereby proclaim November 2021 as Homelessness for Homeless and Runaway Youth Awareness Month, and do commend this observance to all our citizens. Thank you so much for being here. Thank you. If you'd like to speak. I was just saying thank you. Appreciate it. Thank you so much. We encourage you to follow us on social media and check out our events. We'll be having a candlelight vigil tomorrow night at 5 and a Writing for Donuts book release at MUNCA on Friday from 6 to 9 p.m. featuring our youth and young adult authors. Thank you so much. Fantastic. Thank you. Thank you, sir. All right. Thank you so much for that. And now we'll start with a presentation from Scott Kenley. Welcome. Director of Butte County Behavioral Health. Take it away. Do I need a mic or is this on? Or is this loud enough? Actually, the mic is built into the podium. Perfect. Okay. All right. Good evening, Mayor Coolidge, city council members. Thank you for having me. Scott Kenley. I'm the director for behavioral health. I was asked to come here after the city council was considering a letter that perhaps was going to go to the legislative bodies advocating for some resources for the county. And I wanted to have an opportunity to talk a little bit about the homeless population, particularly a specific subset of the homeless population that I think is important to the And I think there's some opportunities to make some progress where we've spent many, many years stuck. And so I just want to put a couple points of clarification out up front because some people have already said, oh, this is a presentation to cure homelessness and resolve the whole issues for Butte County. It is not. I assure you that. And I want to acknowledge that homelessness and the lack of affordable housing in Butte County is a huge issue and throughout California. And that is the number one problem we have. And we've all talked about it at nauseam. While I fully support building more low income housing projects, this alone will not help the population that I'm going to talk to you about tonight. We all know that those experiencing homelessness come from a wide range of circumstances, crisis events, evictions, loss of income, foster youth we just heard about, runaways, domestic violence, traumatic brain injury, developmental disabilities, and people who are involved in the criminal justice system. The focus on tonight's presentation is on a very specific subset of this population and not necessarily on that general homeless population. So I'm going to talk about that. This subset is severely mentally ill and has failed to accept any and all services offered from the mental health support teams that we have, our drug and alcohol services, as well as the housing resources that we have available for our clientele. There is a group of people on the streets that are deteriorating and dying in front of us. They're dying by inches, day by day. And this is growing every single day with more potent drugs and alcohol coming on, or more potent drugs coming onto the streets. More and more people are becoming neurologically damaged and falling into this category, whether they had a predisposition for it. They're dying from mental illness or not. The group of people is well known to law enforcement, local emergency rooms, crisis workers, emergency medical technicians. They are a source of significant debate and disagreement among citizens, the city council, county staff, and they are also the highest cost population in the county and utilize the most staff resources throughout the county. For years, this population has been offered multiple resources and forms of support. It continues to choose to remain untreated and ultimately dies due to neglect, suicide, overdoses, and mental illness. This has brought posts of posts of posts of posts of posts of posts of posts of posts of posts of posts of posts of posts of posts of posts of posts of posts of posts of posts posts of posts of posts of posts of posts of posts of posts of posts of posts of posts posts of posts of posts of posts of posts of posts of posts of posts of posts of posts posts of posts posts posts posts posts posts posts posts posts posts posts posts posts posts posts posts posts posts posts posts posts posts posts posts posts posts posts posts posts posts posts posts posts posts posts posts posts posts posts posts posts posts posts posts posts posts posts posts posts posts posts posts posts posts posts posts posts posts posts posts posts posts posts posts posts posts posts posts posts posts posts posts posts posts posts posts posts posts posts posts posts and I appreciate your time to hear what I have to say. So a little history to start. I came from California. In the 1960s, many people with serious mental illness were frequently placed in state-run psychiatric hospitals. These were large facilities run by the state. They were warehousing many clients, and there were not a lot of patients' rights for those people. There was a lot of overcrowding. There was a lot of incidents of client abuse. There was neglect, and mistreatment was rather common. There was quite an outcry from the community who learned about this, and there was pressure put on the state to reform this. So as a result, in 1967, Governor Reagan signed the Lanterman-Petra Short Act, also known as LPS, which basically restricted the ability for anyone to get put into compulsory treatment. So prior to this, you didn't like your grandma, she was a little odd, you could potentially send her to state hospital, and off she went for years. There were mistaken identity cases where someone was thought to be mentally ill, but wasn't really mentally ill, and they were hospitalized for many, many years. One egregious example is there was a street vendor who was selling fruit, decided to paint his donkey zebra stripes. Someone believed that was a sign of mental illness, and he was shipped off to a state hospital. So as you can see, there was no real rhyme or reason or method to how people got in, and once they got in, it was hard for them to get out. So this LPS reform started a deinstitutionalization movement where the state said, we're going to close down these facilities, and we're going to realign the funding that covers these facilities, and send them to a state hospital. We're going to send these people back locally. There were a couple things that were behind that. There was recent antipsychotic medication that had come and passed and was put on the street, like Prolixin and Haldol, and some of the medications were actually very effective for some of these people who had previously been just psychotic. And the thought was, well, with these medications and with the resources going to the county, counties can take these people, they can be back to their community, and they should do better than these horrible state-run institutions. That sounded good, but the reality, the reality was the state never followed through their promises on funding this, and the counties weren't ready for a massive number of clients coming back with no infrastructure in place. So board and care, sober living environments, crisis residential facilities, places for these people to go to were not available, and housing was imminently short everywhere you went, as well as you didn't have the funding to build the teams to serve some of the most severely mentally ill people that were coming out of state hospitals. So the LPS Act also made it virtually impossible to compel anyone who was in the state hospital to come back. We needed treatment to get into treatment. It's broken down into three things. The LPS Act says you can only go into a psychiatric hospital if you're a danger to yourself, to your mental illness, meaning you're going to commit suicide, you have a plan, you have an intent and means, you're a danger to others, your mental health results in you wanting to hurt someone seriously and you have a plan, or gravely disabled, the most controversial one, which says due to your mental illness, you have the inability to find food, find shelter, or obtain clothing for yourself. And so you're not able to care for yourself. When this act passed, they had no idea that there would be a homeless population with mental health issues. So they didn't think that through. So many clients returning to the counties almost immediately became homeless. There weren't resources for them, they had no places to go, and they went to the streets. The state also passed something called the IMD exclusion, which said, we know what you counties are gonna do. You're gonna rebuild these psychiatric hospitals, but at a local level, put these people all back in. You're gonna take their rights away. What are you gonna do? We're not gonna let you do that. So if you build a psychiatric hospital that is over 16 beds, you cannot get reimbursement from Medi-Cal, and you cannot get reimbursement from the federal government. So they call that the IMD exclusion, which means that any hospital that's above 16 beds, with the exception of some acute care hospitals, couldn't get reimbursement. And so counties who had limited funds, if they were gonna hospitalize someone, would be spending sometimes $1,000 a day to put someone in on their own dime without any reimbursement. So if you look around at counties, and what they call psychiatric health facilities, or PUFFs, PHF, there's 16 beds for a reason, because of that IMD exclusion. So one year after the LPS Act, the number of mentally ill people entering the criminal justice system doubled. A lot of people on the street, homeless and mentally ill, uncared for, not getting into stable housing, started having issues with the criminal justice system. They shifted from state hospital to the streets, to the jails, and the jails became the de facto treatment centers. So in 2004, with the jails ballooning up, Governor Brown passed Prop 47. Did a couple things. He helped try and get the criminal justice population out into the streets sooner than before. He eased restrictions on property crimes, so up to $950 was no longer considered felony material, and people would now be charged with misdemeanors. And people who were previously arrested for drug-related charges, in the past, had to go through drug treatment as a condition of their parole to get out early, no longer had that as a mandate. He was now voluntary. So you had a lot of people with addiction issues getting out of jail, who said, I'm not going to treatment, bye-bye. Off to the streets they went, addiction continued, drug use continued, and things went worse. So, a couple facts about the homelessness. Homeless and mentally ill. The longer someone remains homeless, the greater the chance they'll develop a mental health issue or substance addiction. Why is that? The streets are tough, there's victimization, there's assaults, there's crimes, they're uncomfortable. You know, all the things that we've heard about homelessness that makes it very traumatic for people. And people who have mild to moderate mental health issues who are living on the streets often get worse over time. So, the streets are tough, your addiction or your mental health issue can get compounded and get worse. So, we want to get people off the streets as soon as possible, but unfortunately, we've not had that ability in many cases. And the third piece is, many of the severely mentally ill homeless population have a compounding third issue that is often not talked about. They have untreated medical issues. They have open wounds from assaults or attacks or stabbings or just generally not taking care of themselves. They have diabetes, high blood pressure, seizure disorders, the list goes on and on. And many of them do not get that care. Usually the only time that care happens is if they get cycled through an emergency room for some kind of crisis. And I know that there's data that's very inconsistent depending on who you talk to about how many of the homeless are mentally ill and how many are addicted. It's all over the board depending on who you talk to. What I want to say is I think the data is significantly underreported because you typically have a stranger going out in the community asking someone, are you mentally ill or do you use drugs? And they don't trust them. It's usually once they get into treatment with us, they go, oh yeah, I use drugs and I did this and you have to develop that trust. So data's all over the place and I'm not gonna get into the argument about how many people are mentally ill and how many people aren't. So we're gonna talk about the specific subset of people that I was talking about today, the severely mentally ill with addiction issues. We're gonna have a case study. We're gonna meet John. John's a 56-year-old homeless man with schizophrenia and addiction issues. Now by schizophrenia, just a little background. If you have schizophrenia, you typically have psychotic symptoms. You're hearing voices that are not there. You're seeing things or visions of people or images that aren't there. You also have sometimes delusions where you believe something that is, you really truly believe is true but isn't actually accurate. Some common delusions are you being tracked by the FBI. There's microchips embedded in your body. You're the second coming of Jesus Christ. The president's evil and you must kill them. There's some, that's not a common one, but that one has been. That has been something that we've had clients with. And the addiction issues. A lot of people like John have significant addiction issues. John's homeless, he's on the streets, he's untreated, and he's gonna use whatever comes across his way because it makes him feel good. And his life in reality is not so good without drugs. So John was born in Chico. He was a former high school football star. Had a relatively normal childhood. And then his late teens, early 20s hit. And that's when typically the first signs of mental illness kick in, particularly schizophrenia. So John deteriorated. His strong relationships with his family became, there was friction and ultimately John got kicked out of the house because he wouldn't go into treatment. Didn't believe he had a mental illness and got into several fights with his father. And on the streets John went. So John currently presents disheveled. He's got torn clothes. He digs through trash cans, bums cigarettes off others. He panhandles. He's malodorous. And he has a shopping cart overflowing with random items. Now that might actually show you just a typical homeless person. But John also has the mental health and addiction issues on top of that. He's been known to use alcohol, smoke pot, and other substances openly in public areas, including shooting up with heroin. John has a history of shoplifting, vandalism, intermittent violence, and has been arrested multiple times and placed in what they call 5150s, or involuntary holds. That's the mechanism by which you get someone into a hospital through the LPS Act. Grave disability, danger to self, danger to others. Only three ways in. And so he's been on those holds many times. That hold will allow you to get into a psychiatric hospital and be detained for up to 72 hours for assessment and treatment. If certain factors are met, you can be kept in that hospital a little bit longer and we'll get into that in a little bit. The thing about John is he refused to get help. We've had multiple outreach efforts with John. He has what they call anosognosia. He doesn't believe he's mentally ill. He thinks we're all crazy. And everything he believes is absolutely appropriate. So John isn't receptive to our outreach efforts, doesn't want treatment, certainly doesn't want medication. So what are the options to help John? There's a variety of resources for behavioral health throughout the county. We have outpatient treatment centers. We have outreach teams. We have mobile crisis teams partnered with law enforcement. We have homeless outreach teams that go under the bridges and encampments. We try to build relationships and get people into care. If someone does consent to treatment or care with us, that opens up some doors for housing resources where we have board and care operators. There's board and carers, unlicensed boarding homes, sober living environments, residential treatment centers, crisis residential programs for people with mental health or drug and alcohol issues. But they have to be willing to get the help. Without that willingness and not being open, the state says we can't do anything with them. So we do a lot of, as much as we can, on a voluntary basis for people like John. But people like John don't necessarily come forth and engage. So when those interventions fail, unfortunately, the two more restrictive options are, one, the hospitalization we talked about through the LPS Act, if he meets criteria, and two, incarceration. Sometimes people like John get arrested because they do things due to their mental illness that causes trouble. So people say, why can't we get John into treatment? Most treatment in California is voluntary. It's very hard to compel someone who does not want the treatment to get into services. And the LPS Act is a very hard one. The LPS law is 50 plus years old and outdated. Never, as I mentioned, did they consider homelessness and a great disability in that capacity. Someone who's slowly dying because they're not getting treated for their seizure disorder or their open wounds, someone who's got a life expectancy, if they're severely mentally ill, of 25 or more years less than the typical person in the general population. And if addiction issues are on top of that, keep dropping that life expectancy up to 30, 40 years, lower than what the typical general population would. So people say, well, grave disability sounds like John. He's homeless, lives on the street, lives in a tent. That's not okay. It's cold outside. He gets food from trash cans. That can't be healthy. Sometimes he goes to the shelter. He begs for money. That's no real stable way for someone to live. John also has the untreated mental illness. He's got diabetes. He's definitely got liver damage because he drinks a lot. And he also has an untreated seizure disorder. Sometimes John is seen on the side of the street seizing, and people are panicked and a little bit worried. John also has no filter. He yells at people. He scares people in the public. People are afraid to be around him. He's threatened members of the community. John hasn't necessarily followed through on that or had specific threats. He's just very big and scary to people. That won't get him into a hospital because he's a danger to others unless he's got a specific plan. But if John is so mentally ill, he's so psychotic, he's not really sure when his last meal was, he doesn't know where to sleep tonight, he's lost his sleeping bag, he's not going to be able to sleep tonight, he doesn't have a plan to go to the shelter, we can qualify him under grave disability. But it's usually he's so sick at that point that that isn't required to get him on a 5150. So people are going, okay, great, he's on a 5150. You're getting him into the hospital. He's going to get treated. Problem solved. Not necessarily. Now we start what we call the 5150 maze. Clients who are placed on 5150s have to be medically cleared in order to be placed in a psychiatric hospital. By that, they have to go to the emergency room and get medically cleared. And in some cases, like John, submit to blood tests to confirm how he's doing medically and also wait for a psychiatric hospital to accept him. In California, there's 60% fewer psychiatric hospitals at any given time than someone waiting in a 5150. So counties are competing with other counties to try and get clients into precious beds. And we're actually competing with each other trying to say this person's a more appropriate referral. Could you please take him? The psychiatric hospitals also can pick and choose who they want. They're supposed to take everyone. They're supposed to not say no, but they do it frequently. We get excuses, oh, John's too acute. He's too much work. He's got a history of assaulting behaviors. He's not welcome in our facility. Or, oh, John might have had some sexualized behaviors. He's not allowed in. So there's clients that are blackballed from psychiatric hospitals, yet they're sitting in an emergency room waiting to get into a hospital and can't get there. If John refused that blood work, that makes it all the more difficult because he's not medically cleared. No one's going to consider his case. So, yeah. So the longer John waits in an emergency room, the more frustrating things get for John. It's inhumane for John. Typically, he's strapped into a gurney, sometimes parked in a hallway of an emergency room. And if he's disruptive and he's off medication, he's scary. He's screaming. He's yelling. That creates a situation with the emergency room staff where you have doctors say, behavioral health, get your client out of our ER. He doesn't belong here. Get him out now. And we're saying, well, we don't have any ability to do that. We're going to have to change to the next level of care. We're doing our best to try and find a placement for him. There is a shortage statewide of inpatient hospitals, as I mentioned, for people like John or for anyone else. And if he's got the comorbid medical issue, it's compounded substantially more than just a garden variety person who's depressed or homicidal or suicidal. So if we can get John's packet accepted by a psychiatric hospital, which sometimes can be as short as six hours, but usually it's a couple days. Sometimes it's actually a couple weeks where they are waiting to get hospitalized. The LPS facility that they go to, the hospital, has very specific criteria around how long they can treat John. John has to continue to meet the criteria for what got him into the hospital. So if he's gravely disabled and he's really confused and he doesn't know where he's at, he has to maintain that and continue not having a plan. If John gets into a hospital, typically John goes, where am I? I want out of this place. Get me out. I don't know what I need to say. And John can get in front of a psychiatrist and go, I'm okay. I'll go to behavioral health. Just let me out. I'll take my medication, and I'll go stay at the Torrey Shelter. He's got a plan. He's got something that makes sense. They can't hold him. So people like John sometimes can be out of a psychiatric hospital within a couple hours. And what that sets up is 5150 fatigue for law enforcement officers, for our mental health staff, for EMTs, where if they say, I just put the guy on hold a day ago and he's already out on the street and he's doing the same thing. That didn't do anything. The hospital's worthless. What's behavioral health doing? John has rights. And the rights that he has in the inpatient hospital come out of the 60s where the rights weren't there. So there's patient rights advocates. There's judges. There's a lot of things, checks and balances to make sure that we can't hold someone unless they really, really need it. If John gets to a place where he is not able to compensate enough to argue his way out, or to have a legitimate discussion with the psychiatrist, something called a RESE or a capacity hearing, which means we can actually, in some cases, forcibly medicate John to treat the untreated mental illness or depression or whatever it is he gets put in for. Capacity hearings sound great because people are like, OK, good, he's going to get on meds, he's going to get stable. But the issue with capacity hearings is you can only give short-term medication. It's a daily medication that you give to that patient. And if they're down here and they're really confused, as you start medicating them, they come to their senses and they start realizing, I'm in a hospital, get me out of here. And many clients can compensate enough to win their hearing, to get out of the hospital, but not be stable enough to function out in the community. So many times they get discharged out in the community, still psychotic, but not as psychotic as they were, confused as they were. RESE hearings will not allow us to do any kind of long-acting medication which could have benefits for him once he gets out of the hospital. In addition to that, if John happens to be living with a family member or someone who's curing for him and doing all this work to try and keep him together and is really involved in his care, and John goes down to the skating rink tomorrow, gets arrested, gets put on a 5150 and gets hospitalized, no one without John's permission gets to know about that, including the caretaker, the family member, the person who has all that history on John that might be able to share with the treatment team in the hospital to help strengthen the ability to keep him longer, to stabilize him. Unless John says, I need your permission to talk to my mom or to my brother or to my family member, it's a lockdown. And that's called HIPAA, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. It allows treatment providers to talk, but it doesn't allow family members or people who sometimes really need to be in the know to be part of the treatment team and discharge planning. So John, who might have been able to be discharged to his family and to a home, instead gets discharged to the streets sometimes because he doesn't share that he has a family or a place to live. 42 CFR is also a barrier. It's about drug and alcohol treatment. It's even more restrictive about sharing anything about someone's substance abuse issue. It requires written authorization. It's also a barrier to finding out any past history, person who's been using heroin, family member said, yeah, I know they use Oxycontin, things like that. We don't get to know that unless they share it. If John's in the hospital, he's psychotic enough, he's depressed enough, he's severely compromised enough, and he continues to not win his hearings, we can go down something called a conservatorship. It's the most extreme kind of silver bullet, last-ditch effort where you can actually assign someone, a public guardian, to follow that person and to make decisions for them as though they're like the parent over that person. So placement decisions where they're going to live, medication, what they're going to take, medical decisions, things like that can be assigned to a conservator. And that conservatorship can last up to a year. In Butte County, there's about 68 clients who are conserved at this time. And every year they have an annual renewal cycle where they get to get in front of the doctor, get in front of a judge to say, I no longer feel like I need to be conserved and here's why. Or we can get in front of the judge and go, this person's doing great, they're taking their meds, they're in stable housing, we recommend they don't continue to use conservatorship. Or the last option is, no, we really think this person needs to continue and here's why. Lots of rights behind that and protections, but it's a very powerful tool and can be very effective. So people say, well, why don't you place, we're going to create more inpatient beds. Would that solve the problem? Well, if you do build more inpatient beds, that will help you probably with the emergency room backlog, the boarding of clients in the emergency room. But it's not going to help you get people like John off the street because LPS law is so strict on how you can get them off. So some of the things that we do say can help is inpatient hospitals have to address referrals in a timely manner. We will send a referral on John every single day to a psych hospital. Even though they got the referral yesterday, they want another referral the next day. Then they want an updated referral six hours later. It's this unfortunate game that happens where unless you're on top of it and you're constantly faxing packets to sometimes 20, 30 hospitals throughout the state, you lose out to other hospitals. We need more medical psych facilities for people who have comorbid mental health and medical issues because with the medical issue, it gets very complicated. There's only a couple of med psych facilities that will take someone with open wounds who can't ambulate or walk, use a walker or needs a colostomy bag change, things like that. The closest one is Shasta Medical Regional Center. It's a great facility, but it's constantly full. So we're seeking Southern California placements with an aging population with more medical issues, which makes it difficult. One thing that's really critical, and I mentioned it in the 60s, they discharged everyone, and currently the board and carers, the homes that typically our clientele go to, have evaporated throughout California. As property prices have risen, board and care operators have determined that it's much more profitable to sell their home than to operate something that's governed by licensing and comes with a lot of rules and restrictions. But a board and care for a seriously mentally ill person is probably one of the most effective housing resources. You're basically living in a house with a number of roommates, typically it's two to a room. You have an operator that lives there 24-7, or there's staff 24-7 that makes sure you take your medication as scheduled, makes sure you get three square meals a day, snacks, you do your laundry, and helps them with what they call the ADLs, or the adult daily living skills, showering, cleaning, hygiene, things like that. And the nice part about it is during the daytime, you get to go out in the community, you get to go to wherever you want to go, it's completely unlocked. Those are the facilities that have dried up, and we're down to one in Butte County. When I worked in Santa Clara County, there was probably 42 board and carers back in the 90s. I had a lot of resources, and they have shrunk and shrunk and shrunk as housing prices have gone up. So that's something that we're working on. Another issue would be state funding for conservators. Currently, the state does not fund the conservator's office. It comes through county general fund. Conservators don't have enough funding to allow them to have smaller caseloads. Remember, they're like the parents, and if you have a caseload of 60, 70, 80 people who are seriously ill, you can't really give them the care and follow through and ensure that they're getting what they need. So the state needs to support that and fund conservators better. People say, okay, well, the mental health route's broken. What about drug use? John's openly shooting heroin out in public. He's smoking marijuana. He's constantly using drugs. And there is a correlation between homelessness and drug addiction. The longer you stay homeless, the better chances you're going to potentially start using or your addiction issue is going to get worse. I can't emphasize how bad things have gotten since the 60s with highly potent drugs now that are making mental health issues, people who didn't have mental health issues, a significant issue. Fentanyl, the methamphetamine P2P, and now the very high-potency THC marijuana that some of these people are taking is really starting to exacerbate psychosis and aggression in people who either are mentally ill or who weren't mentally ill who are now not coming back from some of those drugs. Drug-related activities can also lead to more violent encounters amongst the homeless. We've seen that. We follow the news. And there's an increasing pressure to decriminalize drug possession, and the use has weakened laws and law enforcement options. So law enforcement officers have fewer options now to deal with drug issues than they did in the past. Substance abuse treatment is also voluntary in California. So I can't compel anyone to go into drug treatment without their consent. The motivation to quit is very low typically. People who are addicted to severe substances are using those substances to cover up demons, to cover up issues, or just to feel good. You know, they're out there, they're homeless, and it's a cold night, and heroin can take you for a couple of hours and make you feel like things are pretty good. Telling someone that they need to come off a substance and get into treatment is very scary, especially if you're on severe forms of street drugs. So the number one way to get someone off who's really addicted is a medical detox, where they come in, they're supervised by a doctor or a nurse, they get detoxed safely, they get medication to help with the side effects. The California state system right now is broken. They're looking for detox. Detox, which should be the number one easiest form of treatment to access, requires pre-authorization. So I'm an addict, I have to go to an emergency room, which is the only place that can do a medical detox, I have to wait in the emergency room while the emergency staff process all the people with broken bones and other things, you know, if it bleeds, it leads. And then they get to the addict who wants to get off their drugs, they take the information from that addict, and they submit that form up to the state. The state can take one to two days to give authorization or denial. Tell an addict who's crawling out of their skin to sit there just a little bit longer until the state gives you an answer. They don't want to do it. Drug court is a very effective alternative for some of the addicted population. If they're willing to do drug court, an alternative for lighter sentencing or sentencing of being waived, it's been shown it's very effective for those people who follow through with that program. Medication-assisted therapy is also another very effective tool that's come online in the last couple of years where we can actually give you a medication to deal with your substance addiction craving, whether you're creating your opioids or your alcoholism, where you don't either have the addiction cravings or you don't feel the buzz, the positive feelings, and you can actually come down off of some of that stuff safely while we also medicate the underlying depression or whatever you have that caused you perhaps to take the substances. So some, I've probably thoroughly depressed most of you at this point, so I'm going to talk about some possible solutions. The number one one that we are talking about taking forward to the legislative bodies this year is LPS reform, the definition of grave disability, danger to self, danger to others. We're trying to incorporate a couple things, including the number of encounters with law enforcement or crisis services within the past year as being a factor, as well as perhaps, well not perhaps, but as well as an untreated medical issue. The laws only focus really on mental health issues, but untreated medical issues are causing our clients to die. I can't tell you how many people in the last 21 years here in Butte that I've heard about who we found behind dumpsters dead, overdosed, or have been shot, or have been in bad encounters because they are not willing to get treatment. The Reese hearings I talked to you about that are in the hospital where they involuntarily medicate need to be adjusted to allow for long-acting medication. I can give you a long-acting anti-psychotic medication if this changes that will last 30 days in your system. So even if you're still psychotic, but you win your hearing and you get discharged, if that medication is in your system, you're going to continue to get better as you get better. As you go out in the community and hopefully be more coherent and willing to understand consequences and perhaps get into treatment. I can also give you a long-acting injectable to treat your drug addiction issues. So when you go out, you're not going to start slamming beers and doing heroin and things and potentially you can get into a place where you can say, maybe I do need some addiction help and some treatment. HIPAA and 42 CFR need to be reformed. One of the greatest examples of HIPAA and the challenge we have is we partner with law enforcement. The sheriff and police department, mobile crisis team go out. We go out and we see a client and we're like, we know this guy. We know his history, we know his diagnosis and we know what he's done and his trigger points. I turn to the officer as the crisis worker, I can't share anything. But we're co-responding to this person. So it makes it more difficult for encounters to go well when you can't share critical information with law enforcement or with family members to help get people the treatment they need. So we're advocating to have that changed in 42 CFR. That's a federal change that needs to happen. LPS and RESR are state changes. NIMBY is another issue. When we do get limited funding and we do get it a number of times to put in housing of any kind, it has shown us that there are a lot of people in the community who do not want the mentally ill or addicted population in their neighborhood or anywhere near their neighborhood. And so it makes it very difficult to put in new facilities. Despite that, I think we've done a good job getting low-income housing projects started and moving forward. And we have a number throughout the county that we house a lot of our clients in. And you don't know that they're our population because we go out and we see them every week or every day, sorry, and provide supportive services. As I mentioned before, the state needs to adequately fund conservators. Without the funding, the conservators can't do their job and support this population. Got to overhaul the voluntary detoxification system. Eliminate the pre-authorization. If an addict wants to get off the street and get detox, that should be carte blanche. They should get whatever they need to do. It's not a good thing. It's a very short-winded motivation and you got to strike while the iron's hot. There's something happening right now called CalAIM, which is California Advancing and Innovating Medi-Cal. It's the Medi-Cal reform that's happening. One of the things that it's allowing is more outreach on the street and support for people who aren't open to services. But another more important issue is the health plans have the ability to put sobering centers in every county, multiple sobering centers if they want to. Sobering centers don't exist right now. And if you have an addict out in the streets, or not even an addict, maybe someone who's had too much to drink, too much to use their hide, they get in front of law enforcement, crisis services, and they say, I'm willing to get help. Okay. They can go to a sobering center for up to 24 hours, get sobered, become sober, with medical intervention and support, and then get connected to drug and alcohol services. Right now that's not a resource available. I encourage you, if you have any sway with the health plans, they have the funding to do that. If you have any concerns about the health plans, they have the funding for it. They need to find the providers and to put these in place. It's not a behavioral health responsibility or something we're funded for. But it's critical in the continuum of care. And it's, there are very few, I think there's less than 10 sobering centers in California right now. It's criminal, with the number of people who are intoxicated on the streets. I would also recommend you require, if we're going to pursue it, requiring drug treatment post-incarceration for people who have been arrested on drug-related charges. That was very effective. Prop 47 took that away. I think it was a mistake. We also need to incentivize employers to hire former inmates or people who have been in the mental health system. Their options when they come out of the inpatient or the jails are very limited. Welcome to McDonald's. How may I help you? They don't have a career ladder. And they don't have enough money or income to find any housing or to be successful. Obviously the housing piece, I can't beat that over people's heads enough. There's not enough low-income housing. And there needs to be a continuum of housing resources for our population as well. Not just low-income apartments. But board and care homes. Boarding homes. Sober living environments. Whatever the need is. It should be a menu of options. You need to strengthen the laws to allow law enforcement to arrest people for theft and property crimes under $950. It's no secret that people know on the streets who are criminals that you can get into a car without breaking a window, steal enough property, and it's not going to hit that certain magic trigger level where you're going to jail. Or you can steal a bike that's worth a certain amount of money. The list goes on and on. There's issues with shoplifting. You've seen that as well. That needs to be strengthened back down. People are running amok with that. That's not necessarily the mental health population. But there's some crossover in some cases. You need to increase the penalties for drug sales and manufacturing. There's too many drugs. They're very potent. And they're not stopping. You still can get them on the Internet, which is shocking. And you can get them delivered to your door. And then the most important one is allowing more low-income housing flexibility with services offered on site. There's a lot of advocates out there that believe that low-income housing is the solution to homelessness. And that's not the case. It might be for homeless who aren't severely mentally ill like John. But John can't go into an apartment or a low-income house without concurrent treatment happening and support and supervision. We have placed people like John in apartments trying to help them, saying, well, if they get housing, maybe they'll be willing to get treatment. I've gone into those apartments. There's holes carved in the walls because John's looking for microchips that are hidden behind the electrical outlets. He's not in a place where he can do that. Or he's shooting up with his buddies and he's being taken advantage of and there's squatters moving in. So, that's not the case. We have to have the support and supervision for this population in addition to the low-income housing. So, final thoughts. Thank you for being patient. As a society, I believe we've normalized drug use and protected the rights of the mentally ill at the expense of allowing many of them to ultimately die homeless and on the streets. Again, I'm talking about the severe, not the mild, not the moderate, not the voluntary, but the ones who don't want care. Compelling the seriously mentally ill to submit to treatment is not oppressive but rather humane. And the pendulum has swung too far in the opposite direction since the San Francisco! So, thank you for coming to do this. Do we have any questions? No? Thank you. That was incredibly informative. I really appreciate it. I just have a couple of questions. It is my understanding that the County Board of Supervisors opted out of Laura's Law and opted into a different type of a program. I know since that kind of fits into this line of thinking and discussion, what are you doing in lieu of that program? So, just a little history on Laura's Law. It's court ordered mental health treatments. It was something that all counties had the opportunity to opt in or out of by the end of, or the start of this fiscal year. And our county looked at Laura's Law. There's very specific requirements. And it's meant for people like John in some levels. People who are really severely mentally ill who's not engaged in treatment. And it requires an intense amount of outreach and engagement to this population. And you're building relationships. And you're trying to get them to trust you and to come in for services. But Laura's Law is too restrictive. It's a very narrow hole on how you qualify. You have to have a certain number of assaultive behaviors towards other people or towards yourself in the last three years. And people like John who, maybe not John, but people like John who maybe aren't assaultive but are really checked out on the streets, that we talked about, maybe they haven't threatened enough people or been arrested enough times, don't qualify for Laura's Law. So we saw, when we did the analysis of the Laura's Law population, that probably four to six people in Butte County, the 220,000 population, would qualify under Laura's Law. And what you do is you exclude a number of people and family members, when they heard about Laura's Law, were really excited. And start saying, here's my story with my son. He's got no insight into his illness. Yeah, he lives at my home and I'm constantly having to support him and do this. But he won't get medication. He's not a bad kid, but I really want to get him into treatment. Sorry he doesn't qualify for Laura's Law. He has to go to the hospital. He doesn't have a history of violence. He doesn't have a history of threats. So what the county decided to do is, not only is it too restrictive of a criteria, they passed a law with no funding. And Laura's Law is a very expensive program to run. You have to have full service teams that do street outreach. You have to have housing. You have to have all these things in place. And counties, for the most part, have most of their funding expended in different ways. So we were looking at a team that was going to be over a million dollars. And we were going, where are we going to cut? Oh, that's the last part of the law. You can't cut any other mental health program to put a Laura's Law team in. One of those laws where you said, who thought of this? It doesn't make any sense. So there is one funding stream that the county has still got funds in that we looked at. It's our Mental Health Services Act Innovation Funding, which is for specific innovative projects that are kind of off, that haven't been done before, haven't been tried, or innovative, for lack of a better word. And we said, what if we took a team like a Laura's Law team, expanded that definition to qualify anyone, like John, whether he's been assaulted, or he's gravely disabled, or he's confused, or he's addicted, and we did massive outreach and engagement for that entire population, could we serve more people? Our belief is we can serve far more people like John on the streets who don't necessarily qualify for Laura's Law. We partnered that innovation funding proposal with Everhart Village, the sleeper cabins or tiny homes. And that is part of our innovation proposal where we are proposing to the state, and it goes in January for comment. And if anyone wants to weigh in, we would appreciate it. It's the MHSOAC that makes that determination. A fully integrated campus for the homeless, mentally ill. So they have the tiny homes at Everhart Village, they have behavioral health services across the street, 100 yards away, drug and alcohol services, crisis services, a pharmacy dedicated for that population, and now an embedded medical facility where we can have medical services provided, as well as crisis residential and our inpatient unit across the street. So one of the big issues with the homeless is I can't drive all over the place, I don't necessarily have a car, and the buses don't come frequently enough to get to all my services. We're bringing everything to them. So that's our alternative to Laura's Law, it's called the Rest Project. And that team, even though the campus is in Chico, will be county-wide. And if people want to come and live at Everhart, great. If they don't, we'll support them wherever they're going to go. But they're going to have street psychiatry, where we're going to medicate on the streets if needed, nursing support on the street, case managers on the street, therapists and peer support specialists. Peers are fabulous working with this population. And that's a new addition. So that's a long answer to tell you. We looked at Laura's Law, we didn't think it was going to help enough people. Did it better. Expanded it. That's great. You mentioned peer support, and that was actually one of my questions. Peer support being one of the more evidence-based and cost-effective strategies for intervening in both behavioral health issues and substance use disorders. How does that fit into this conversation and into the work that you're doing? We are adding peers. So historically, behavioral health has had extra help or part-time peers that have worked in some of our crisis units. This past year was the first time we started adding full-time peer support positions. And now we're looking at adding a career ladder for those peers. To try and allow them to, you know, it's not just a position, that's all you're going to do. There's the opportunity to hopefully in the future add a peer supervisor position. And then we're having loan and tuition reimbursement for peers or any of our staff who want to go back to school and get a degree to incentivize them to keep growing and learning. So we're adding more peers. We're committing to adding peers in all of our outpatient centers. We know they're very helpful. But I just want to highlight, because I've heard from the peers too, while you might like my presentation, Mayor Kulich, some people really hate it. They think I'm doing this draconian, I'm going to hospitalize everyone and take their rights. Including I had a peer group that said, that's not right. You just need to hire more peer specialists and that'll solve it. Well, my peer specialists are going out with my mobile crisis teams now. And they're effective for the people who are willing to respond and who are willing to engage. But they're not effective for John, neither are the therapists, because John's too checked out. And he doesn't believe he needs the help. So I don't care if you have a badge or a doctorate or your peer. That population doesn't want your help. So we do use them. They're very valuable. And we plan to keep growing that type of staff. Fantastic. You keep setting me up for my next question. So I'm just going to go ahead with some of that. Just, you know, basically what you just said about some folks having a concern about crossing the line. When we do bypass somebody's rights and put them into a more forced treatment scenario, which is some of these issues, what are the risks and how do we address them if some of these laws are passed ethically? And who's responsible for that? So I cannot hospitalize someone into a facility that does not have checks and balances and rights for those clientele. What we're asking for is the ability to have a wider net to scoop up those people who are not coming in despite everything we've thrown at them. And to take them for a time-limited period, get them off the drugs, get them on whatever medication for the psychosis, or the mania, stabilize them, and then back up. So we're not talking about conserving people for the rest of their lives. But we are talking about potentially conserving, well, we're talking about being able to hospitalize more people who need it. And for those who don't get better in the hospital, conserving those people long enough to keep following them so that they don't return back to the streets to do the things that are driving all of us batty with the broken laws and the scary behaviors and the things on the streets you talk about every day. Mm-hmm. And the last question is, how do, given the efficacy of harm reduction, how do harm reduction models fit into the conversation as well? So behavioral health has shifted from an abstinence model many years ago to a harm reduction model. If I can get you off heroin and you're just smoking pot, that's an improvement. If I can get you from five times a week down to three times a week, that's an improvement. We work with each client on what their comfort level is. We try to help them see the pros and the cons to abstinence and the benefits to that. But we do recognize some clients that are not. Some clients are not going to stop. Some clients, marijuana is not a drug in their mind, and that's what they're going to do. But if I got you off meth and I got you off heroin and that's the only thing, that's a success. And it's called client-centered treatment as well. So we have to partner with our clients. Now, a conserved client doesn't get to choose and say, I'm going to smoke marijuana. The conserver is saying, no, that's not appropriate. But the majority of our clients have choice. And we try our best for them to see the pros and cons of their use and what it looks like when they clean up. And the ones that are cleaned up, they're not going to stop. They're going to come back to us and say, thank God you got me a drug court or thank God you conserved me. I wasn't in my state of mind, but I really appreciate it. I hated you. I swore at you. I spat at the psychiatrist. But now I have a house, and now I have a job, and I have a meaningful job. I want to become a peer support specialist. I want to work with my own population, which is a great source of referrals for our peer support specialists who live that life and know all the ins and outs. Director Kennelly, thank you. Thank you. All right. Did we have any other questions? So go ahead. Mayor Coolidge, if I may make one last statement. Yeah, please. So I did a similar presentation with the Board of Supervisors. I've met with Assemblyman Gallagher and his team. Assemblyman Gallagher is very interested in putting forth some recommendations for legislation, including the LPS reform. He would like to have a bipartisan bill that goes forward. The Board of Supervisors would also like to put forth a letter to advocate for what they want to add to the bill. And I know the City is considering that. I would recommend, if it makes sense, that a joint letter has a lot more power going forward than two single letters. Yeah. That's up to your discretion. Vice Mayor? No, I did have some questions, but I didn't know if we wanted to break because of the technical issues or if we wanted to finish this and then come back. Well, Granicus is actually remoting in, and so I would probably ask that we continue, and then after this item take a short break. So that I can check the video feeds. Okay, great. Thank you. You mean none of this has been recorded? Do I have to do it again? No, it's all recorded. It is. Yeah, it can't go viral if we don't. Oh, good. So you'll have to just give it, yeah, a couple times more. So I do want to let you know, it is being videotaped, and once tomorrow rolls around and we get it all fixed, we will reload the meeting so that this very important presentation can be heard and go viral. So I did have a couple questions. Okay. The first one was back when you talked about deinstitutionalization. You said that the allocated amount was supposed to come back to the counties, and of course the state didn't come through with that. My question, did they come through with any of it? Is there a percentage at all that was sent back? So, yes, funds were reallocated. It's called realignment funding, 91 and 2011 realignment funding. It comes as a percentage of vehicle license fees and sales tax revenues, but it is in no way enough to provide the adequate care and support. So what counties have had to do is they sought this new funding stream called mental health. It's called mental health services act funding, and we are getting as nimble as we can about obtaining grants. Grants are great. It's feast or famine, though, because when you have the grant, it's great. You've got all the support, and the grant dries up, and you're like, okay, how do I cover this service? So the state has never really fully funded behavioral health or drug and alcohol services. Okay. Thank you. And then there was one other question on the sobering centers that you mentioned. Is that money that did you say the insurance companies get? So in our county, it's Anthem Blue Cross and California Health and Wellness, and every insurance company in California has some requirements that they need to put in place, resources through CalAIM. I'm not getting into too much detail. Sobering centers, one of those things. There's post-hospitalization care. There's homeless outreach services. There's services for people who need medical follow-up. There's a lot of different components to it. And the sobering centers, they have the money for. And we had some initial dialogue with them saying, please, this is critical. Could you do it? And they said, well, we don't have anyone who's interested in providing it. And I said, well, that's not necessarily acceptable. Start finding someone who would run a sobering center, partner with a hospital who would, you know, have a doctor who would come on site and help manage it. We will come and put our drug and alcohol counselors at that center so once they're sobered up in that window, we'll take them into treatment if they're willing. But we can't operate a sobering center. The county can't do detox and can't do sobering. Those are two outside of our realm medical pieces. So as we're writing letters and calling out for help, then it sounds like that could be another place that we could reach out to search for more resources, too. And then the last one, I had one more, but I'm not finding my note on it right at the moment. So I'll let Mr. Coolidge go. So I just, you mentioned the rest project. And what board are you going in front of for funding, you said? The MHSOE. The MHSOE. The Mental Health Services Oversight and Accountability Commission. Maybe you can email me that. I can email you that. That is a board that is in Sacramento that, similar to you, is made up of a diverse group that looks at all the proposals that the county has and determines whether or not they are deemed innovative enough to approve. I'll just be frank. There have been some projects that they've determined are not innovative enough. And my feedback to them is you have the Behavioral Health Advisory Board. You have the Board of Supervisors. You have the community input. You have peer input. All saying this is something Butte County needs. Why would this not be innovative enough? They haven't said that about this project, but they said that about other projects, which is really frustrating to counties because, for the most part, we have funding that comes and we have requirements on how we spend it. The innovation one comes to you. You see it grow in your account. And then you say, okay, great, here's a project, and you have to pass this gauntlet to get it approved. One of the things I talked to Gallagher's office about, too, was wouldn't it be great if you could get this project approved? So, what would that same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same that we've got a couple of directions that'll be really good. Thank you so much for your time. Thank you. Yeah, we appreciate it. All right. With that, we'll take a short break so we can resolve our technical issues and move forward after that. Okay. Thank you. Are there no public speakers on this? We do not take public comment on presentations. Yeah, you can speak on it from... Yeah, typically on presentations there isn't, but you can speak from business on the floor on it. It's how it's been for years. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

But we're going to turn over to the city clerk for a minute to explain the technical difficulties we're facing. We're going to explain the technical difficulties to the people who can't see. Well, we're going to explain the technical difficulties to the media and to those watching on Channel 11. Thank you, Mayor Coolidge, and I apologize, council, for our difficulties with the technology. So for... Okay. So our Channel 11 is live and it's working well. Our streaming is what we're having difficulties with in Granicus. Our third-party vendor was unable to reset it. They're going to have to work on it tonight after the meeting. However, the DVD is rolling and the recording is rolling, and I will be able to upload the meeting to Granicus for our city's website in our archives first thing in the morning. Actually, it will take several hours to upload the meeting. So I should say by noon. Technically, we are in total compliance with the Brown Act. Our streaming has worked every single time I've been here for 21 years, and we implemented Granicus in 2008. This is the first night it has ever not worked for streaming. So I apologize for those difficulties. The encoder is not working, and they're going to work on it and hopefully resolve that issue. It is... I'll turn it over to the council. The meeting, again, is in total compliance with the Brown Act. We are still providing some access via, unfortunately, just by Channel 11. And, again, we will upload the audio and the video first thing in the morning and have it available by noon. All right. Thank you. I have a question. Is that why I can't get Granicus on my iPad? Possibly. Unless you haven't changed... Did you... Did it ask for a password? No, it's just saying it can't connect to the meeting. That says it joined the meeting. It joined it, and then it doesn't bring up the... That's because VoteCast... You're not join... You... We are not using... You joined the meeting through that... Well, it would bring up the agenda. Now I can't get to the agenda. Okay. I have it on my... So I don't know what's working or not working. I move to adjourn. I'm dead serious. That's a motion. All right. I have a motion. I'll second it. I have a motion and a second. Madam Clerk, take the role. Council Member Bennett. Yes. Council Member Brown. No. Council Member Morgan. Yes. Council Member O'Brien. Yes. Council Member Tandon. I have a quick question, though, before I word on it. If we adjourn today, do we have a meeting next week then? Or will we just going to on the 7th of December? We can actually adjourn to a date certain. So if you wanted to try to hold it, I don't know what we might have in the council chamber tomorrow night, but we could adjourn tomorrow or you can adjourn to next Tuesday because I reserve the chamber facility for all council meetings on Tuesday nights. So next Tuesday it would work as well, if that's what you would like to do. No. Vice Mayor Reynolds? Aye. Mayor Coolidge? No. Okay. It carries 4-3. So the meeting, and then when would you like to adjourn it to? We should stop it all and move another regular meeting. What does the calendar look like for the next meeting? It's got a lot of regular items on there. There is one time-sensitive item on tonight's. We were anticipating on getting the MOU with the county for the collaboration with the $1.7 million on their special meeting of the 18th, so we wouldn't have to wait until December. I think I should at least let you know that. I know the vote's already been taken. And then, but this one, it's pretty full, but obviously what staff will do if it's council's direction is adjust and push things to December 21st to level that out. The vote has been taken to adjourn the meeting. Can another motion be made, or is the meeting adjourned? I would turn that over to the city attorney, obviously. I'm still trying to wrap my head around. Sure. The meeting, the motion carried. The meeting is adjourned, and now it sounds like ministerially or administratively the council is figuring out when the next meeting is going to be. That's the only option that we have. We couldn't hear an item tonight, hear business on the floor tonight, and none of those things can take place. Oh, no. You can do another motion to hear the one item, the time-sensitive item, and then, you know, and... Modify the motion such that after that one item, the meeting would be adjourned. And then you might want to discuss the dates that you want to do the next, the rest of the agenda. Sure. That would be an option. Did you have a question? So I was just going to say, I think that MOU is very time-sensitive. I'd hate to miss that opportunity. I would like to hear that tonight, get that out of the way. If there's others that are likewise, I'm willing to do that as well. I agree. Thank you. Yep. So... So my thoughts on this is we should at least approach that item and business from the floor. Agreed. So I'd make a motion that we continue the meeting, unadjourned, hear business from the floor, send an apology to everybody who is here for our interviews for the committee, the commission, rather, and then also hear that one item. Which is item... Five points. Yes. Thank you. So could I ask how many people are here for those interviews? Show of hands. We're five. I would add that we hear those interviews as well. I don't want to be disrespectful to them and their time. All right. I already voted against ending the meeting, so I'm happy to hear that too. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. So I'll accept that amendment, but we'll need a second. Second. All right. We have a motion and a second. And that was to hear business from the floor, the MOU, as well as the climate action, and that would be it. Correct. Are you going to also adjourn closed session, or are we going to do the whole meeting? Well, I... We're going to do that one. Just two. Okay. Okay. So I can accept that amendment as well. But, Councilman... I think Council Member Brown would have to accept that as well. Oh, yes. Fine. Yeah. All right. Thank you. Council Member Bennett. Remind me, please. This is to hold the whole meeting, to continue the meeting again with everything that's listed on the agenda. This is all being recorded. For parents and students. So, we're going to adjourn tomorrow. Yeah. Yes. Council Member Brown. Aye. Council Member Morgan. No. Council Member O'Brien. Not a deal, but yes. Council Member Tandon. Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds. Aye. Mayor Coolidge. I just think that's the best, most interesting motion in progress we've ever had. So, aye. So, that was an aye. Okay. I believe that carried 7-0. All right. So, we'll move forward with consent agenda. All right. So, we'll move forward with consent agenda. All items listed on the consent agenda are to be considered routine and acted in one motion. Do we have any speakers on the consent agenda? No, we do not. All right. Any council no's or disqualifications on any of the items? All right. Any entertain a motion? Move to approve. I have a quick question. Can I register a no vote on a subset of an item, such as confirming resolutions, ratifying council actions of cannabis permit appeal hearings? Can I say no to one of those? I wouldn't say no. On the, you want to change your vote? 2.6, no. I'm not changing any votes. Okay. I'd like to vote no on one of the resolutions listed here, consistency in my decision making from the previous meeting. So, be consistent with your vote? Yes. Right. I mean, yeah, procedurally, yes. I mean, you've already registered the vote at the last, at the hearing, at the public hearing. Great. I would like to register a no vote on item 2.6 on only the denial of authentic consent. I would also like to register a no vote on the appeal to the City Council. Which one was that I'm talking about? Authentic Chico LLC's appeal to the City Council. Okay. Well, then I'll register a no vote on 2.6, a resolution granting an appeal by Velvet Chico. So, just, I can turn it over to the City Attorney. That was a duly noticed public hearing, and so you didn't hear from the City Council. participate council member Morgan in that in that public hearing so I so I would abstain yeah all right so is there a case we have a registered no vote on one of the resolutions from council member Brown and an abstention on item 2.6 from council member Morgan and was there a second on that motion council member Tandon had the second thank you just a moment I think I'm cursed council member Bennett and this is on the consent agenda as noted with one no vote on one of the resolutions and an abstention on item 2.6 yes thank you council member Brown council member Morgan yes council member O'Brien yes council member Tandon yes vice mayor Reynolds aye mayor Coolidge aye carry 6-0 with one abstention all right thank you very much okay we'll move on to business from floor members of the public may address the council at any time on this on any matter not listed on the agenda with comments being limited three minutes are determined by based on the number of speakers the council cannot take any further questions or comments on the agenda. please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please I've been kind of rethinking what I was going to talk about after I heard Scott Kennelly's presentation. And what I want to say is that, well, first of all, thank you for going back to deciding to have this meeting in full and doing that because many of us did give our time to be here. And I appreciate that. And it shows a humanity that has been rare for me and many to see from this council, excepting Alex Brown. And that piece, I think, has been missing in a big way. And I felt it was missing even from the director's presentation. I've been a licensed clinical social worker since 1999. I had a brother with extreme psychosis. He was schizophrenic. And hearing auditory hallucinations. And so from that perspective, and that was in a different county at a very different time, needless to say, it's a very extremely difficult, complicated population to serve. And I just wanted to hear more of a balance with a more humane perspective versus you just have to force treatment on people who are schizophrenic. I think that's extremely resistant. My brother wandered the streets even though he had a home, a safe home to sleep in. But the voices took him there. And voices took him to the top of a building and his ultimate demise. And through my work with my clients over all these years, I just know that it's from this caring relationship that change happens. And to transition from that to. The same way that same way that same way that same way that same way that same way that same way that same way that same way that same way that same way that same way that same way that same way that same way that same way that same way that same way that same way that same way that same way that same way that same way that same way that same way that same way that same way that same way that same way that same way that same way that same way that same way that same way that same way that same way that same way that same way that same way that same way that same way that same way that same way that same way that same way that same way that same way that same way that same way that same way that same way that same way that same way that same way that same way that same way that same way that same way that same way that same way that same way that same way that same way that same way that same way that same way that same way that same way that same way that same way that same way that same way that same way that same same people that the police department sees on a fairly regular basis and some juveniles too with probation and I'm only four foot eight I have of course never carried weapons and I've been able to manage some pretty intense crises in which lives were on the line and I've managed those effectively because I've been trained in de-escalation and I come to these situations with a very compassionate approach that is sorely needed here and I just want to again with respect to our murder victim guy Steven Benzant and the community that is victims of the housing crisis I want to underscore this need for the human approach thank you thank you Jessica Giannola followed by Kimberly Pemberton so the Chico ER they quoted recently the mayor identifying those that had served a recall notice as seeking to advance extremist agendas within the city and from where I'm standing repeated requests and outreach made to our city on behalf of citizens in crisis has been anything but extreme they've been outright reasonable and necessary to prevent life loss and total city destruction that we are on the path to achieving asking law enforcement to provide a way to prevent law and justice be used to protect citizens and not harm them is not extreme asking the city to do better for all the people is not extreme we've we have asked for more affordable housing plans for good faith efforts to come from the city or a bare minimum to allow other programs to take on this task all we have seen so far is resistance and denial have but ends turning a blind eye to our reality denying city responsibility and supporting inaccurate narratives gained voter support and it's extremely extreme spending enormous amounts of funds on irresponsible litigation is another example of extremity there also extreme is leaving people to fend for themselves while floodwaters surround them and their belongings every year we have freezing people lining walkways of the city and we don't have to and when they become too much of an eyesore the extreme actions of the city go further by penalizing their existence in public spaces promoting a false belief that poor citizens prefer to be poor and homeless that's pretty darn extreme and yet that is what some city leaders have said promising to clean parks should also mean that the people living in them out of necessity are considered and plans to improve their life situation is part of the plan promising to keep our citizens safe should always include their safety too there should not be an us versus them the people who are on the ground they have accurate knowledge and answers to many of the questions that you should be asking are not the enemy of this city we are not extreme we are caring and giving smart and supportive and we continue to beg for the help of the city to help your own citizens from living without basic necessities we need representatives to value truth fairness lives above profit and community over politics this is not extreme this is what we all of the citizens of Chico deserve also want to hope to support you in recalling the words of Kennelly and what he said tonight, because he tried very hard to help you understand the position that people are often homeless out here, what they're facing, the barriers they face, and how hard it is for them to obtain housing and life security. There are reasons for it, and he did explain it quite well. So please remember those when you're moving forward on policy and ideas for the future of our city. Thank you. Kimberly Pemberton, followed by Patrick Newman. I appreciate this council has a difficult job in which you have a duty to serve the entire community, so thank you for your public works. I understand the city of Chico has an ice skating rink set to bring tourism, boost local business, along with a green plan for recycling the water. I understand the city of Chico has an ice skating rink set to bring tourism, boost local business, along with a green plan for recycling the water on city trees. Unfortunately, by putting a pay for play in a public space, we are enforcing the message that the haves can have access to it and the have-nots cannot. This all during a time when Butte County has the need for over 6,000 supported low-income housing units. I recognize homelessness as a federal government neglect. However, everybody must take accountability where they can, and it would be nice to see the city show a sign of good faith by doubling the access to the bathrooms separated from our homeless. No matter what the health an individual starts with, homelessness in and of itself creates a disability. It places the brain in survival mode by over-activating the amygdala, bypassing other important decision-making and memory-related regions, such as the hippocampus located in the limbic system, responsible for emotion. It essentially renders someone with a disability of the nervous system, making this a matter of not only discrimination against our poor, but a matter of discrimination against our disabled. Females without access to bathrooms for menstrual hygiene are at a higher risk for UTIs and kidney infections. These conditions can not only be life-threatening, but they're incredibly expensive for the taxpayer. Public spaces provide a marginal amount of safety for the unhoused. They provide a little bit of streetlight in Cambridge, but they also provide a little bit of protection for the homeless. We also have a serious food insecurity in these public spaces, allowing a little bit more access to sustenance. I suggest this city as a whole take a glimpse in history at some of our segregation laws and pay careful attention to the verbiage. Start with Plessy v. Ferguson. During the 60 years of its rule, our country made way to the Black Coats reinstituting slavery, also creating our historically famous racist Jim Crow laws. Next up, brief yourself on the Board of Education v. Brown. This is when we segregated in our schools based on race. This is what we're doing now in public spaces, enforcing enablism versus invalid by discriminating against the homeless, individuals in favor of able-bodied individuals. Thank you for your time. Thank you. Patrick Newman is our last speaker. First of all, over 10 years I've spoken on many presentations here, so there's some confusion, maybe because it was put in the 1.0s. Public comment wasn't allowed, but I just spoke about Bill, I mean, Paul Webster's presentation just a little bit ago, so it's really not clear to me what the policy is, but my three minutes now will be taken up with what I was going to say about the earlier presentation. Mr. Kennelly is a dazzling, pretty convincing speaker, but there's nothing about this that's written in stone, and I'm sure that his colleagues across the state of California have very different views about what he was saying tonight. So it's not like you can just take that to the bank, you know, a meeting between Mr. Kennelly and Mr. Gallagher, and they can hammer out what we need to do to change, you know, laws protecting people's civil liberties, upping penalties for drug use, increasing incarceration rates. These things are not necessarily widely accepted, and I think that in fact there's a lot of dissent. So I don't think, I think, I wrote a 13-point critique of this. Mr. Kennelly had it earlier today, we went back and forth a little bit, he addressed some of my points tonight, but there's a lot of issues with what's being presented here, and I can't possibly do justice to that three minutes. It was a 30, sorry, so a minute presentation. Beginning at the beginning, state hospitals were overcrowded, and incidents of client abuse, neglect, and mistreatment were common. Well, that's a very, a very limited understanding of why we'd be institutionalized in California. We had, and Mr. Kennelly addressed this a little bit, we had a pharmaceutical revolution, but we also had a civil liberties revolution around that time, and that meant that we looked at all disabilities, and we tried to normalize life for disabled people, and that's largely why we do this. We deinstitutionalized our mental hospitals in California. Mr. Kennelly referenced this, and I'm glad he did. We absolutely failed to follow through. There were two sides to that coin. One was we're going to deinstitutionalize, the other was we're going to put this in the community, we're going to put together a combination of housing and services that address people's needs so that they can integrate into the community in the, with the least limitations, the least restrictions, and the least restrictions. The same way that we came up with a way that was a way that was a way that was a way that was a way that was a way that was a way that was a way that was a way that was a way that was a way that was a way that was a way that was a way that was a way that was a way that was a way that was a way that was a way that was a way that was a way that was a way that was a way that was a way that was a way that was a way that was a way that was a way that was a way that was a way that was a way that was a way that was a way that was a way that was a way that was a way that was a way that was a way that was a way that was a way that was a way You don't know who John would be if we had 50 years of careful, well-funded follow-through on what people with mental illness need in California. So you're at the end of this process with this person who you have identified as the problem, you're not looking at the solution, or you're not looking at the cause. So you're looking at a symptom. Anyway, I wish I had more time. Thank you. So Patrick Newman was our last speaker, and Council, I would just like to clarify very quickly, just especially since we have two new Council members, that presentations are placed at the beginning of the meeting. Public input has not been allowed before. And the item that was referenced for Mr. Webster, that was found under reports and communications under the city manager's verbal report. We've been consistent that was a policy that was adopted by the Council years ago, that presentations, as long as they were not going to be used, they were not going to be used any actions taken. It was an overall informational item that that could be placed at the beginning of the meeting. So I just want to let you know that it wasn't something that was inadvertently changed on this agenda. All right. Thank you. No public hearing. So we're moving on to the regular agenda. Lost Park Economic Development Project. Ms. McCarthy, welcome. Well, no. We don't want to. Reboot now. No worries. All right. Thank you for your patience. Good afternoon. Mayor Coolidge, Vice Mayor Reynolds, Council members. I'm Jennifer McCarthy, Deputy City Manager for the City of Chico. Tonight, I have the honor of talking to you about the Lost Park Economic Development Project. This is a really exciting project for the City of Chico. Something. That's been envisioned literally over the past 20 plus years. And I'm feeling like we're getting a little momentum here. And so these are some exciting times that we can start reporting out. To give you some such as some general boundaries here, what we're talking about, the Lost Park Development Area is generally in the northeast part of downtown Chico. So it's bordered on the north by Big Chico Creek, by the south by East First Street. East is Sierra Central. Credit Union and West is Main Street. The area consists of approximately two point seven acres. And that includes municipal parking lot number five owned by the City of Chico, as well as two buildings owned by Chico State Foundation. That's at twenty five and thirty five Main Street, affectionately referred to as the cheese greater buildings. And then there's also a private property that is on in the area as well. That's just about. Point two five acres. So this is the area that we're talking about today. And today I'm going to give you an update of where we are with that development project and talk to you about where we've been and where we're going. So in the early 2000s, through the Chico Redevelopment Agency, a feasibility study was done to examine what is the highest and best use of this property. And back then it was mixed use. No surprise there. It's a beautiful piece of property. It is a gateway property into the downtown area. However, at that point, the project did not move forward for a number of different reasons and was put on the shelf that was never really forgotten about. And then you fast forward to 2019 and conversations began again about this property. And then it began cooperatively with Chico State as well, whereas originally it was just the city looking at our municipal lot. So in 2019, this item actually came to the council and the council specifically made two actions. One was to allocate twenty five thousand dollars. Towards this planning process. And the other was to agree to work in cooperation with this with the Chico State and Chico State Foundation or Chico State Enterprises on this development program. In spring of 2020, Chico State completed their 2030 campus master plan. And if you pull up that plan, you'll see that they too envision a mixed use development on this property. Then fast forward again to August of this year and planning efforts started again. We got to know the city. After that, we brought together city staff with Chico State staff and started re-engaging the conversation about how can we make this beautiful gateway project happen for our community? In addition, we drafted a memorandum of cooperation that outlines the roles and responsibilities of each one of the organizations, basically saying that we're going to continue to work together from a staff's perspective to bring this project forward. So, Lost Park is really an economic development project that's going to serve downtown, and that's what we're going to do now, as a gateway. It's envisioned as a development that reactivates the beautiful greenway along Big Chico Creek, allows for a mix of activity, including commercial, housing, and parking, and creates a connection to both the downtown core and the university. Lost Park will create positive economic impacts for our community in terms of both revenue generation and visual stability. What you see here is an example of Ashland, Oregon, where they have done an excellent job of really activating their greenways. And what you see here is buildings, pathways, and activation along a greenway. So in terms of the steps in the process, where we are completing the first step, which is that memorandum of cooperation, the second is we're working towards what we will publish will be a request for qualifications. And this is for a development team that will take on this project. So a request for qualifications comes in and it will basically narrow our list of individuals that are in the project. And then we're going to go ahead and do a little bit of work around that list. And we're going to go ahead and do a little bit of work around that list. And we have that smaller list then, we will issue an RFP to that group. And that will be the group that we will consider for the final public-private partnership. I put down here that it's community involved design, because I think we can all agree that this property is key to our downtown area. So it's important that we hear from the community about the design, that we hear from downtown businesses and the university, and that it works in a way that really benefits everyone. So once we get through that request, we're going to go ahead and do a little bit of work around that list. And we have that final development team that we're interested in working with. This will be what's called a public-private partnership, where the private sector will really take the lead in the design, the financing, and the build. How that process is completed will be negotiated with whomever that final agency is. It could be through leasebacks, it could be through bonding, it could be back through ownership. The city will have opportunities to engage in that process as we go down that line. So I'm thankful today that we have Mike Gezzi with us from Chico State. Mike is the Associate Vice President of Facilities and Capital Projects. And as I stated since August, he and Vice President Ann Sherman and Sarah Rumiano, along with city staff, have been working hand-in-hand on this process, developing what our planning collaborative was going to look like, what our first steps would be, and our next steps would be. So at this point, I'm happy and I'm sure Mike is happy to answer any questions that the council might have. All right, questions from council? I've got a couple. Yeah. So anytime we do anything. I'm sorry? Anytime we tend to do anything, people go, well, why is the city going to invest millions of dollars in this instead of fixing my roads? So we're not investing millions of dollars in this. We are not. This is what's called a P3, and it's something that's different. It's a process that the city hasn't typically used. But a lot of communities are looking towards this. It's a basic design build. . .
