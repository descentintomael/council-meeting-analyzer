Due to the COVID pandemic, the public shall have an opportunity to address the council and engage Chico and via Zoom on any item described in the agenda before or during consideration of that item. The city council is prohibited by law from considering any other business at this meeting, which is why the business from the floor is not provided. Item 2.1, board and commission interviews and discussion of subcommittees. Ms. Bresson. Okay, thank you, Mayor Coolidge and council. Thank you for being here on an off night for a special meeting. At our last meeting, the council said tonight to hear directly from the applicants interested in serving on the arts commission, bidwell park and playground commission, and planning commission. The airport commission, ARHPB and climate action commission will be considered at a different meeting. Applicants have been invited to participate via Zoom and please note that attendance is not a requirement for appointment consideration. We did hear from several applicants that they could not attend and we'll try to make a note of that for you. Each applicant will be given three minutes to introduce themselves and to highlight why they want to serve on a city of Chico commission or board. Please note that each applicant has completed the required application and will be given three minutes to complete the application. Please note that and supplemental questionnaires, which were included in the agenda packet. And you have probably from several meetings because it got continued. At the end of the interviews for the three commissions, we will check to see if there's any additional public input. Final confirmation for appointment to these advisory bodies will be made by the council at its meeting of March 16th, which is just next Tuesday. After the applicants have been heard from, I will provide the directions for the nomination form that you can find that's right in front of you. The remaining two items will be discussed following the interviews. If you will recall, council asked for an overview of ad hoc and subcommittees currently in place through the city boards and commissions and associated staff time or resources dedicated to these meetings. In addition, you're going to discuss the possible need for additional recruitments for the remaining three border commissions. At this time, I would ask that the applicants who are waiting to speak on behalf of their interviewees, who are interested in serving on the Arts Commission, to please raise your hand in Zoom. Okay. Arts Commission to speak. Once each speaker is finished, then we'll move on to the next one. And let me just make sure. Let me pull up for Arts Commission. I know that for the Arts Commission, if you look at the summary with the red matrix, that's for the Arts Commission. We're looking to fill four positions. And I believe that Kimberly Rinala, who currently serves as a commissioner on the Arts Commission, is unable to join us tonight. So let's check and see. Okay. So, Monica McDaniel. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Do I have a camera I can turn on or just a picture? You can turn on your camera. There you go. You have that ability on. I don't see it on this. Can you upgrade her? It's not necessary if you want to just proceed. Okay. Okay. Thank you. Good evening, members of council. Mayor Fulich. My name is Monica McDaniel. I am a current member of the Chief of Arts Commission. I'm a member of Good Standing. I've been a member of the Arts Commission for a decade now, for 10 years, and I'm seeking great appointment for an additional four-year term. A little bit about myself. I work for the County Office of Education at the Hearthstone School site. I'm the enrichment and resource coordinator there. I also teach CTE, Career General Education Professional Theater, and I'm also a junior high drama teacher, so I work in arts education. I volunteer at the local school, Blue Oak Charter School. I'm the president of the charter council there. I'm also a member of Good Standing of the Chico Arts and Culture Foundation, which is a fundraising auxiliary of the Art Commission. And I'm also a member of Good Standing of the Josephine Chico Chapter 104, where the history starts. And then my most important job is that I'm a mother of two teenage girls. I'm a sophomore at Inspire School of Arts and Sciences. I'm a senior at the University of Michigan. And I have an eighth grade year at Chico Junior High. Since I've been on the Arts Commission, I've done a number of things. One of my greatest accomplishments was to found the Chico Arts and Culture Foundation. City of Trinity's Alicia Roth wrote a corner on my loss, and we partnered with the North Valley Community Foundation and Alexa Balvanes to create a funding mechanism for the Arts Commission. That was back in 2011. I worked with that fund to start this project. I worked with that fund to start this project. I worked with that fund to start this project. I worked with that fund to start this project. I worked with that fund to start this project. I worked with that fund to start this project. I worked with that fund to start this project. I worked with that fund to start this project. I worked with that fund to start this project. I worked with that fund to start this project. Thank you. Thank you. Yes. Ms. McDaniel, thank you for your service on the Arts Commission. You said that you had a number of new ideas. I'm curious what kind of work you'd like to continue as you're taking on your next term. Well, the commission used to have, I see that you're going to review the committees. The commission used to have two different committees, Art of Public Places and then Outreach and Education. And I did get to serve on both of those committees before they were decided. And my time there gave me lots of ideas about cultural events that could be happening in Chico. I'd love to see a seasonal module of art celebrations. The Snow Goose Festival is already in place. Art Topica still thrives. I'd love to see a spring module that couples with the ballflower event. And I'd love to see a summer module that couples with, you know, something all night that goes with our city's heat. Another thing that I've done since I got on the commission is I've made it a practice to visit other cities and check and see what their best practices are. One of the cities that I went to was Palm Desert. And they have a huge public art collection. And I was trying to figure out how they paid for it. And basically what they do is they have a lending program. So the city partners with private artists. The city covers the insurance. The artists basically loan art to the city. And therefore the city gets free art all the time. So I'd love to see projects like that going. And I'd love to further the city art tours. We've had, through the years, we've had people want to volunteer to be docents for the public art collection. But that's one project I'm very passionate about is training others to, so that tours can be ongoing for the city. Those are just a few of my ideas. The other one is city repair. That's another big one that the Chico Arts and Culture Center is working on. And we've actually had some funding for, but we haven't had a chance to do it. So that's a whole other project on itself. Thank you so much. Sure. Okay. Our next speaker is Bonnie Pipkin. And you're being unmuted in just a second. And if you could unmute yourself. Go ahead, Bonnie. Okay. There you go. Thank you. Hello. Hi. My name is Bonnie Pipkin. I am a Chico native. I grew up here. And I graduated from this team. I was gone for a couple of decades. Most of that time was spent in New York City. I am an author. I write in field novels. And I currently write for the North State Voices column in the New Yorker. I use the name EIA. Thank you. And I'm a professor at the University of New York. I'm so happy to be back in the community here. I'm the vice president of the board of Chico Community and Culture. The well-known New York. I got a master's degree in performing arts administration. I studied in the Netherlands and Canada with an arts administration focus. And then I worked for almost 10 years with the New York AI National Financial Forum. How good is that? I was the first organization that was fully in our budget. And it's the largest multi-art school in North America. And I also started an after-school theater program in Brooklyn. Writing and producing plays with teenagers. So I've done a lot of arts administration work. I am definitely new in town and in my hometown here. I'm not coming to this application as an expert in what's going on in this city here. And I hear at the time that I said that there's a very complex environment. So I won't be able to get out in about too much of it. But I am very passionate about a healthy, artistic community. I've seen a reflection of the health of a community. I'm here to learn about the projects that are available. And also just be open to bringing the experience that I have in New York back to my community here. And I think that's all I have to say about myself. But yeah, questions? Okay, seeing no questions. Thank you, Bonnie. Our next speaker is Louie Nava. So you will be unmuted in just a second. And it looks like we might have just lost him. But so if Louie can get back on. And I want to let the council know. This is the first time we've entered using the video capabilities. And so it's a little awkward. And I apologize. Is he able to talk now? Okay, go ahead, Louie. Yes, there you go. Okay. I'm Louie Nava. I'm coming to be on the arts. We should first of all say thank you for having me here and taking my application. And hopefully it goes well. I basically come with a background of I'm an avid collector of local art around town. Mostly local. I've traveled worldwide looking at, you know, the museums around and just love the artwork and would love to be on a commission to help, you know, the local artists kind of get in there and make Chico more of the artist town that we want it to be. My thing would be to try to get more events to really highlight these local artists that we have so we can get some of those people coming into town to look at their art rather than just, you know, doing a lot of their stuff online. And also I enjoy mentoring others on validation and doing research on historical importance of artwork. I have a friend. I have a broad and personal network to draw from around town. You know, I know a lot of the artists around here to help hopefully get their art into our, into our, oh my gosh, I'm trying to think of a word here, into like a display so people can see it. You know, a lot of people need to know what's around, you know, for them to enjoy the artwork. You know, everybody should be able to enjoy it from here. All right. Great. I have a comment that I have that I really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really

really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really I'm nervous here no no it's okay so my thing was you know I've been my background was I got two daughters older daughters now 29 and 24 and I was a coach here in town I coached competitive soccer for 12 years so I'm a local been here pretty much all my life went to school for two years and then came back just missed it loved the town hoping to bring that town back up to what I think everybody wants and that would be make this the art town that it is with all the worldwide recognized artists that we have I think we need to really show that a lot a lot more in this town and then I'm also bilingual so that would kind of help in helping out the kind of some of that population kind of gets left behind and doesn't get to see this stuff you know it's just that's kind of where I'm coming from and I hope that I'm doing alright and if there's any questions I'm willing to take questions at this point Thank you Louis Thank you and I know I see I think it's Danella Ferguson or Daniella she's on there if you could raise your hand or if my staff

order received. And that will be that matrix that is in green that the council has in front of them. Uh-huh. Did you not get a packet up there? Okay. I apologize. Here's planning. Mark, could I borrow your... I apologize. I don't know where... There should be another page behind it. Oh. No, that's just it. Thank you. I apologize. Mark stole my coffee. Okay. So in this particular commission, we have four four-year term positions, and we're going to be looking at And we have one two-year position that needs to be filled due to an unscheduled vacancy. On that particular position, the two-year, that will be voted on by the full council and nominated by the full council. So when we get to the nomination form, I'll explain that process. But... So there's actually five positions that will be filled. So let's hear from the applicants. The first one in the queue is Paul Cooper. Hold on one second. Let me start over. Oh. Okay. So you need to let me call him before you promote. Okay. Thank you. I wouldn't know that. So who is it? Joshua. Okay. So Joshua Pierce is the speaker. Hello. Yes. Hello, everybody. Hello. Hello. Can everybody hear me okay? Yes. Great. I'm sorry to interrupt on my video. I'm actually traveling at the moment. So that would be terribly safe for me to turn on my video. Not much to see anyway. But thank you very much for having me. And thank you to the council members. And Joshua Pierce. And I'm excited and honored to be here. So the park commission, given the three minutes that I have, I think maybe there's three things that I would like to highlight. To the council regarding my candidacy for the park commission. I guess the first is that I have a very personal relationship with the park. I grew up in Chico. I went to a product of the Chico school system as well as a two-time product of Chico State. I went once for fun and once to actually pay attention to study. So I've been engaged with Chico natively. And I can't wait to see what happens. I grew up riding my bicycle to school through the pathways and trails of local Big Boat Park. And spent my weekends at upper Big Boat Park enjoying the many adventures that it has to offer and continues to have to offer. I'm an avid outdoorsman, participant in the park on a regular basis, and the same is true for my children. I have two teenage children here in Chico. We've recently returned from a day abroad. I was in Africa and came back for the last few years. And now my children travel the main trails and roads and pathways. So thank you.! Thank you. The collaboration of the local population, which given the circumstances of the last several years, I think it's a unique aspect of the Park Commission and the struggle and challenges that the Park Commission faces today. It's brought into a position not possibly previously and that requires a local collaboration. Josh, sorry to interrupt you, but your time is expired. Uh-huh. Sorry about that. I know you don't have a timer on the phone, so it's harder. or when you're on the phone. Yep, thanks. Yeah, thank you. So our next speaker is Martin Nichols. And if Martin could unmute himself. Can you hear us, Martin? I can hear you. Okay. I can hear you. Okay, we can hear you. Go ahead. Good evening. Thank you for considering my candidacy for the Commerce Commission. As you can see from my resume, I've been 45 years in the town. Both of them have elicited the executive role of the Council. It's the Danley Group County Minister's Office of Advantage Specialist and the Run Ridge Line. You can see it. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Are there any questions for Martin? Thank you, Martin. Thank you. Our next speaker is Liz. Larry Willis. And Larry, if you could unmute yourself, there you go. I can, yes, go ahead. Okay. My name is Larry Willis. I've lived in Chico since 1955. I went to Chico Junior, Chico High, Chico State. I've lived here all my life except for four years in service and three years in law school. I was married. My wife taught at Boson Valley High School for 34 years and I helped myself on it. I have three grown children, six grandchildren, one child and two grandchildren live here in Chico. My wife passed away a couple of years ago. I got very active in volunteering, first with Michael Hicks' group at Cedar Grove, or not Cedar Grove, but Eight Breakers on Fridays. And since then I've been very active in IVA, modeling the park. I walk in the park, some part of the park every day, just unless it's raining. Like I say, I raise my kids here. Three of them were born here. I understand. I spent most of my life volunteering with my children. I coached softball. I got a little league. I coached soccer, pro soccer. I was a scout leader for many years, along with the chief of breakfast lines for many years. I was president there. I'm an active member and past pastor of the local Masonic Lodge and the past president of the local Shrine Club. . And of course I do have one advantage, and that is I've been practicing law. I practiced law in the state and city for the better part of 50 years. So I speak legalese. And I felt that it was time to act as a volunteer in the park. I should be on the park commission, and that's why I volunteered. So I'm here. That's me. If you have questions, I'd be glad to take them. Thank you for having me. Thank you, Larry. Our next speaker is Paul Cooper. All right. Hello. Can you hear me? Yes. Go ahead. Hi. Hope everybody's doing good. I jotted down a little speech because I think we're going to have a little bit of a break. I'm really nervous around you guys. So I do have, I wasn't sure how I was going because I didn't go into the parks and the planning, so I sort of combined them into one little speech here. So I just want to go ahead and say thank you for considering my application for parks and planning. I am here with a never before request. I would like to apply for the four-year term of planning in either the half term of parks or the full term parks positions. In researching this, we found it is possible. Maybe it don't go exactly crazy, but I do have the ability and time to take on two commissions without a problem. So I will say I am not a geologist. I'm not an engineer. But I do have a lot of common sense in the business world and in life. I've been here since 1993, so I'm very familiar with Chico, Bimble Park, the growth. I was here with the old mall, Montgomery Works, all that good stuff. Back in the days, I mean, Washington Road to where we are now. But the common sense is our infrastructure in the park, and it's beauty is falling apart. I'd like to help be part of that. I do back up to Bimble Park, which would not be a conflict at all. But it is, I did chose, my wife and family have chosen to move to the back of Bimble Park. Out of all the places located in Chico, we chose here. So why two commissions? It doesn't seem fair. I'm applying for two with all these people. I make a difference. It will be very hard to find a more passionate person like myself. My house, like I said, is in the right back of Bimble Park, and I'm part of it every day. I love it. This is our dream come true. And I get to gaze at this beauty all day. As you can see on my application, I have a lot of great ideas for Bimble Park, whether it's generating money, whether it's making it better. I know it's very hard to get. I know it's very hard to get funding for it. So we could do some things there. I also, as for planning, I do feel it's the most important commission. My experience for the past 26 years has taught me to know almost every street neighborhood, from the builder to the flow to the demographics. Though I've been in Chico since 1993, I still remember my small town in North County, San Diego. It basically, it was, that turned into a super suburb in a few years, and it wasn't planned well. And so planning is so important. Instead of thousands of just track bones, a better community could have been created in this area where I grew up. So basically, I just, I wanted to bring my outside the box thinking, help our community grow while not noticing who we are as a city and community and people that live there. So thank you very much. And let me know if you have any questions. I don't see any questions. Thank you, Paul. Our next speaker is Anjanette Shadley or Shadley? And I misspelled her name, and I apologize. Can you hear me? Anjanette Shadley? Yes. Go ahead. Okay. My name is Anjanette Shadley. My name is Anjanette Shadley. I have 25 years of natural resource management. I'm a graduate of chief of state in the agricultural department. I'm assistant general manager at Western Stoutwater District for over 10 years where I'm in charge of admin, communications, and sustainable groundwater management act. I've worked with Linda Herman, the current staff member, and other city staff who I highly value. So I think my background in government and as a special district in PISA and NIFA will help look at proposals coming before us. A few things that I'd like to highlight are the vegetative fuel management project is super important. I think as we all know, it's a fire-dependent drought. That's a big problem. And I think that's going to be even more important in the future. I was listening to the other interview week, and I think there's opportunities to work with the other commissions or the park council to bring programs that highlight our parks being an asset, especially visible parks, bringing revenue to the city with festivals. Or I remember seeing concerts in the parks, which I hope one day will come back soon. I'm also interested in, I'm a mother of an adult with high functioning autism and maybe work to improve the ability of programs for people with disabilities. I'd like to pursue grant opportunities to bring our back dollars to the community to the cancer facilities. I'm also a Chico Health member. And I know that we have the opportunity to do that. So I'm going to be working with our local organization and enhance our neighborhood park source with this area of the 12 parks. And then finally, I just, the reason that I submitted my application is because I was raised with a strong value to contribute to our community. And I think using my strengths and my background and my profession could be helpful to our community. So I'm going to be working with the other commissions. So thank you for your consideration. And I can answer any questions. Okay. I don't see any questions. Thank you so much. Our next speaker is Ryan Brown. Okay. You can speak now. Yes. Go ahead. Hey, good evening. Hey, thanks. I want to thank you all. For serving the community here in Chico. And the opportunity to serve on the commission. I know there was a PDF put out with all the commission applications on page 80. And there, that helps too. In my application, I think the top two important needs of existing Chico parks are maintenance and safety. I think that upkeep of our parks is extremely important. Also, I think keeping them safe for residents to live that will be a huge endeavor. I'll need to keep contributing to those. For all of these generations. I'll just say that I live in Chico about 20 years. I'm a graduate of Chico State in biological sciences. I've had a lot of, a real successful career in the natural resources for me as a biologist, certified . I really have worked really hard to live that life that I live. I really have worked really hard to live that life that I live. I really have worked really hard to live that life that I live. I really have worked really hard to live that life that I live. I really have worked really hard to live that life that I live. I really have worked really hard to live that life that I live. I really have worked really hard to live that life that I live. I really have worked really hard to live that life that I live. I really have worked really hard to live that life that I live. I really have worked really hard to live that life that I live. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you guys for giving me an opportunity to say hello. I would like to, so I'm doing this as a 24-year-old. For the community, I'm the Bigwell Park and Playground Commissioner. It's been an interesting couple, four years for me now. I've been involved in some issues. I know a lot of you guys know where I stand on these issues. My camera's on. I've never reduced myself to passing on this thing. Generally, in Canada, you have some of our best. I just wanted to really kind of say that I think together over the next four years, you know, we can really affect some real change in the park. And I think that we can kind of bring the little park back to being a ground-breaking park. I feel a fear that it is really not that at this point. I think it's going to take a lot of work to kind of get us back to where we need to be from an environmentalist aspect to recreationalist aspect. Yeah. I just like the opportunity to sort of plan it. See if I can answer any questions. No. Thank you, Jeff. Our next speaker is Jesse Alexander. Good evening, Mayor. I'm a California resident. My name is Jesse Alexander. I've lived in Chicago for 25 years. I've worked for the CHU Fire Department for 19 years. I have a key position. I have a key position in mediating the Santos and Stony Fire, or course, mediating fires in the Caribbean. And I have a good wall. I have experience in reverse preparedness and tools reduction, and doing the aviation aspect. I have a very strong depth of knowledge in regards to many challenges, threats, and hazards associated with the park, including working with city staff, current city staff, including pursuing grants for real aviation all the time. On the personal side, I'm a fatal agent. I live next to the park. We've been in the park and work very well. I think between the personal and professional side, my experience, it's like I bring that balance back to understanding the ability to have accessibility to the park, but also knowing how to make sure that it's healthy and having a good board. Thank you. Any questions? I don't see any, Jesse. Thank you. Our next speaker is Megan Thomas-Petty. Okay. Hi there. Hi, I'm Megan. You can hear me, but you can't see me. That is correct. We're having a discussion about the We're having some problems with the video feed, and so we are trying to make sure at least the audio is coming through. Okay. That's fine. I would like to say good evening to the council and city staff. I am Megan Thomas-Petty. I would also like to welcome and congratulate the new city council members and welcome back Mayor Coolidge. Thank you for all of your hard work thus far. Council really had to hit the ground running. Thank you. I feel that there's a negative dialogue in part surrounding Chico's public spaces and our parks and playgrounds right now. People are afraid to use them at times and uncertain as to what they'll find and do. I'd like to help flip that narrative. I served an interim appointment on the parks and playground commission in 2018 and the beginning of 2019. I started to get to know city staff and the local collaboration and collaboration and and feel I already have, began developing a good working relationship with them and with my fellow commissioners. I am an attorney, and I have been for 22 years in Chico with a specialty in natural resource and environmental law. I love to write and... Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Megan. I'm sorry, your time is up. Sure. I think you all have any questions. Okay. I don't see any questions. Thank you. Our next speaker or next applicant is Nathan Muthven Terry. Nathan, how are you guys doing today? Great. Thank you. Go ahead. Excellent. So, first off, thank you for taking the time and doing this off-session, special session, focused session. I greatly appreciate it. So, I just wanted to get right into it and let you know that the reason I decided to get an application for the liberal arts and playgrounds is because right now our town has a major, major mental health crisis going on. And the best way to solve the mental health crisis is to get out into nature, to better utilize our parks. We have a lot of parks around town that, besides Goodwill, that are very underutilized. So, I'd like to kind of spearhead some ideas and some initiatives to get people into these playgrounds. I sent an email a couple weeks ago about a plan to turn... People Park into a small dog park where, you know, it's in the high-density areas where we're going to park. It is to guard them out. And people live in the apartments where they have cars to make it to guard them out. And there's a lot of other cheap, you know, very inexpensive ways to get people to use our parks, such as setting up maybe like a geocaches, where, you know, if someone finds a geocache, which could be a QR sticker, they can just give it, you know, congratulatory... letter from the mayor to increase your workload. But, along with this, I'm also a very research and focused person. For example, right now, I know the big front-runner topic is the vegetative fuel management plan. In preparation for possibly getting on this commission, I've read the entire plan. I've read the community comments and the state's responses. I've read the community comments. I've read about the dangers and necessities of controlled farms. The importance in pitfalls and raising animals, such as the goats, which are fun goats. And the importance of protecting our endangered species in there, the turtles and crops. But I also think that'd be a good fit because I do have a great background in the outdoors and working with youth. I'm currently a scout leader for two different troops. And I'm... I'm constantly up in Midwell Park. You know, taking countless kids up there, teaching them about the policies of Leave No Trace, of trail management, of the outdoor pedal, how to be considerate of the outdoors. And I also work there and teach hiking skills, teach geocaching, planning the end-line education, hiking, first aid, all of these things. You know, I really enjoy teaching to the next generation. And I would love to have a say in how these parks are, managed and whatnot, and how to get more people out there to enjoy them. And just in conclusion, I cherish the outdoors and fiercely ethical. And I will make sure that if I'm selected for this position, I will be ready on the very first day. That's all I have to say. Thank you for your consideration. And I'm open to any questions. Thank you. I don't see any questions coming. So thank you, Nathan. Our next speaker is Melissa Peters. It was on... Okay, so I don't see Melissa on there. If she wants to get back on, So, Luis Nava, he applied for both the Arts Commission as well as the Bidwell Park and Playground Commission. So go ahead, Luis. Good evening, again, Council. I am eager to serve the capacity because I feel just as many others in the park that the park is a jewel of Chico. I would like to see it preserved and have the ability to increase the attention to aging buildings and science. I walk miles in the park every day. Multi-general... I live in this park every day. I live in this park every day. I live in this park every day. I live in this park every day. I live in this park every day. I live in this park every day. I live in this park every day. I live in this park every day. I live in this park every day. I live in this park every day. I live in this park every day. Thank you. Thank you, Lewis. Our next speaker is Philip Baker. Go ahead, Philip. Hi. Thank you for the opportunity to introduce myself to the city council and the EPPC. My name is Philip Baker. I've lived in Chico for nearly two decades. And I moved here from Central Nevada. I'm passionate, young, and enthusiastic about outdoors in Bell Park. I'm intrigued and love the beauty and high level of biodiversity that California has to offer. Professionally, I manage a local plant nursery where I've been employed for nearly a decade. I've gained a wealth of knowledge for cultivating plants, identifying plants. I remain. I maintain a creative mindset. And I'm also hard working. In my free time, I enjoy biking, hiking, swimming, gardening, and swimming. And professionally, previously, I also worked at the paper science museum for two and a half years. So I hope to gain community ties and opportunities for the public with my skill set. And I'm excited to be here. Thank you. I really appreciate having this chance to exercise that exercise of having this exercise of having this exercise of having this exercise of having this exercise of having this exercise of having this exercise of having this exercise of having this exercise of having this exercise of having this exercise of having this exercise of having this exercise of having this exercise of having this exercise of having this exercise of having this exercise of having this exercise of having this exercise of having this exercise of having this exercise of having this exercise of having this exercise of having this exercise of having this exercise of having this exercise of having this exercise of having this exercise of having this exercise of having this exercise of having this exercise of having this exercise of having this exercise of having this exercise of having this exercise of having this exercise of having this exercise of having this exercise of having this exercise of having this exercise of having this exercise of having this exercise of having this exercise of having this exercise of having this exercise of having this exercise of having this exercise of having this exercise of having this exercise of having this exercise of having this exercise of having this exercise of having this exercise of having this His hand was up a second ago. So if there are any other applicants for the Bidwell Park and Playground Commission still wanting to speak, will you please raise your hand in the group on the Zoom? Okay, so I'm going to just run down the list because I can see a few in there. Debbie, just to be clear, Larry Willis did speak to us already on this. Right, he spoke to the other position. But you are right, absolutely. We did hear from him. Is Garrett Lyles there? Paul McCrary. I do see, I think Paul is down. So is Melissa Peters back on? And Nancy Wolf, I'm not sure. Oh, she indicated she couldn't make it. I know. Let's see. So I do not see any other Bidwell Park and Playground Commission applicants at this time raising their hand. All right, we weren't able to get Larry Willis back for a second. No, he's not back on. I don't see. Larry Willis. No. Okay. Okay, and so then we would move on very quickly to the Planning Commission. And I don't have that list. But I have the names here. So if you are applying for the Planning Commission, if you could please raise your hand in the app so we can call on you. And the order received. You're starting to come in. So let's start first with Lupita Arum Law. My name is Lupita Arum Law. I'm sorry that the camera is not coming on. Thank you, our board, our citizens, and our council members. I have been on the City of Chico's Park Commission for the past four years. And I am seeking the appointment. My husband, eldest son, and I moved to Chico 21 years ago from the Bay Area. Although my husband and I no longer work for Fafcom, that is currently Southern Chico, I was intimately involved with the decision to choose Chico. I built the facility there. I fell in love with Chico. I still love Chico very much. So I pitched it and thought for us to move up here. And it had not been extended yet. My mother, Chloe, I believe they're now 26, 28. I consider myself a servant leader. I work at the university. I work in procurement and contract services. One of my responsibilities at the university is to manage all student internship agreements across all regions. I'm also a CSU chief lawyer. I'm also an alumni of the degree in political science. And I'm scheduled to receive my master's degree in public administration in May. The topic of my master's paper is a town of doubt collaborative violence project. California has a housing crisis. And I want to be part of the solution. I'm a strong proponent of info. I respect the green light. And I take representing my community seriously under great honor. Man, use, and development is in the hands of the community. It's a community proposition and can become, can get and does get quite emotional. With each development, neighborhoods are transformed. Some community members love it and others do not. I ground my decisions with the guidance of the general plan, my fellow commissioners' opinions, and the public's opinion. I think it's wonderful when the public comes and addresses the commission and I always make sure I would thoroughly read the letters from the public regarding the development of the community. It is a pleasure and honor to serve on the commission, and I hope that you will allow me to serve on the commission. Thank you. Thank you, Lupita. Martin Nichols, and he did apply for the airport commission as well as the Bidwell Park and Playground Commission. Yes, you're on. Thank you. I'm sorry, Martin. Not to repeat what I told you a few minutes ago, but I want to remind you of my long experience in local government, my experience in working with departments, and my full understanding of climate and climate functions, and my experience on the airport commission. I'd like to give you some of the, some of the other people that have applied for the position. I realize it's an understanding of the planning commission, not the people who are advocating on the job, but it's the policies adopted by the city council and applied to the projects that are before the commission. My value to this would be my experience in local government, and particularly the radio experience in the neighborhood. I have been to Sheppardville. Several major public projects at Sheppardville have been through the land. I've been to the land use and the land process, and through SEPA. I've been involved in several SEPA policies, and I'm very knowledgeable about those issues. I really believe that I've all experienced local government and my strategic vision for what's before the commission in passing to the city, and I'm very much in consideration of my role in the planning commission. I've been to other campuses. I actually serve on the planning commission for parents. If you have your time, I'm looking forward to your time. Thank you. Thank you, Martin. Our next applicant is Austin Barron. Good evening, council, and thank you for having me here. My name is Austin Barron. I grew up in Chico in the Amber Grove neighborhood, and I've lived in Chico ever since. I've always loved this town, and I hope to continue to see it evolve and grow. You're welcome. I'm Austin Barron. I have a commercial and residential realtor at Century 21 in Chico, as well as a member of the Sierra North Valley Association of Realtors, and I live and breathe real estate. I learned the trade of real estate investment and development from my great-grandma, Georgina Sanders, who taught me many lessons on responsible development and showed me a refreshing perspective on the relationship between land and land. I've always loved architecture and buildings, land and development. It inspires me, and it excites me. It's three principles, hard work, diligence, and honesty that I carry with me every day. For every job that's come before me, every transaction that I deal with, every client that I meet, I carry these with me. I thank you for the opportunity to serve on the boards and commissions of this city, and I hope that you consider me for employment. I'm happy to answer any questions that you might have. Thank you, Austin. The next applicant is Tony Scott. Good evening. Thank you, City Council. I am really honored to present my application to you tonight after serving for eight years as a planning commissioner for the City of Chico, several of those as the chair. I am speaking in a four-year term on the planning commission. A little bit about myself. I am a partner and a business consultant from here in Chico, primarily focused on serving clients in food and agriculture. I am a homeowner in the avenues, and I am a little bit of a planner. I really love reading municipal codes. I have a leg team. We get around the city and see where those codes aren't making alignment. I'm really eager to serve on the land. I'm a member of the planning commission. I'm the voice that holds equal pay attention value based on commissioners' stories, development and growth, and maintaining our high standards for building. I really view my approach on the planning commission much like I experienced Jim Walker in the City Council when I wrote the City Council's recorder for the Chico-Lake-Ferris record. I could never pre-write my stories with Jim on the City Council because I never knew how to hold a vote. That's partly because Jim took a lot of the testimony into his decisions. It became really undecided when he walked into the meeting. That's how I approach my role as a planning commissioner, doing my homework, listening to the city staff presentations, and that's maybe the best way that we have to move forward. I think one of the unique factors that impacts us as planning commissioners that might be different than the other boards in commission that's really important is we do make policies and decisions, but by and large what we're doing is deciding on applications that are before us. At the point that we see those, significant business investment has been put into those applications, and with that in mind, I do believe it is incumbent upon the city to have predictability in the process and to have planning commissioners who are well-versed in what our brand-use policy and design guidelines are. Not to share any personal accomplishments, but just to highlight one of my favorite projects that we as a commission had the honor of approving was probably the Salvation Army building, and that was a meeting that I chaired. It was the most inspiring meeting that I have ever been in, seeing families and children come to the diaries and to speak for three minutes on how land use decisions really could impact our daily lives. That is what I think our role as a planning commission is, to have an open forum to share, to put those land use decisions into action, and to see the people that are behind the lot line adjustments, the variances, the infill development, and really look at the applications that we have for the city. Thank you for your time. If you have any questions, I'm happy to answer them. I don't see any questions. Thank you, Tony. Our next applicant is Mark Breckenridge. Hello, Council, and thank you for taking the time to see me. As you know, my name is Mark Breckenridge, and it would be an honor to represent this community on the Planning Commission. I've spent half my life in this town. I came here for school over 20 years ago, and was one of the lucky ones to have the opportunity to continue to call Chico's on my graduation. In that time, I lived in Collegetown, the Cal Park area, and downtown in the Golden Triangle right here on the left side. All different neighborhoods, all of which make Chico unique. Growth is the curse of a thriving community. We all want that small-town vibe that Chico gives us, but yet want the conveniences of the community. I believe that we can offer both by embracing our heritage and values while looking towards the future. Smart development along with infill projects are all socially and economic classes and continue continuing to protect one of our biggest assets prime agriculture ground is the blueprint that we need to follow the right base of residential commercial and retail will obviously grow this population i'm not a developer but we'll have numerous years under our belt when it comes to planning or government but what i will bring to the commission is common sense and calendar keep yourself shape me for the last 20 years and i like to have an opportunity to do that thank you any questions thank you mark uh paul cooper is our next applicant for the planning commission did apply for the bidwell park and playground as well yes that is true um and i sort of put it all in one because i wasn't sure so there's not much other to say than um you apologize you guys made me really nervous for some reason i can literally control a room of 500 people and when i talk to you guys i just get sweaty palms though um so i just want to reiterate that my energy my passion my knowledge started so many i've been starting so many businesses from scratch from apps to coffee shops to property management on my own commercial vacation residential property um i know chico in and out i've been here since the beginning of where it started to boom so i've got to see a little bit of the whole chico mixed with the new and um i just my passion for the parks and uh nine recognition um will not disappoint with you to council that's about it um we've got plenty of people so i'm going to go ahead and make this really thank you thank you paul lindsay poland good evening yes go ahead lindsay thank you good evening um i'm no stranger to hard work difficult situations and having crucial conversations. The Planning Commission carries a heavy amount of responsibility in ensuring Chico is a healthy, sustainable community that offers high-quality life while maintaining its small-town charm and providing opportunities for future generations to thrive. Not only do I have the relevant experience and background needed for a commissioner, I'm very knowledgeable on the current issues facing our community. I have excellent written and verbal skills and the ability to be fair and listen with an open mind. Having worked on numerous projects throughout the U.S. before returning home to Chico, I've witnessed firsthand planning successes and planning failures in other cities. I'm familiar with the legal principles behind the planning process and am knowledgeable about ordinances and these codes. I promise to do my homework and adequately prepare for every meeting and issue that comes before the Commission. I understand the long-term impact of the Chico City Planning Commission and the importance of avoiding relative consequences. I have the analytical ability to comprehend complex matters and balance competing interests. If appointed, I pledge to serve the needs of Chico, including increasing economic development, establishing better organizing to protect our community, and recommend policies and actions to remove barriers to better encourage healthy production. As a commissioner, I would serve the needs of the public and provide intelligence and knowledge to the community. I would also be a good example of a good advice from my citizens' perspective as we adapt to growth and encourage business to locate in communities where employees want to live. All the applicants who have applied for the planning commission are more than qualified. So tonight, my plea to you is to give those who have not served an opportunity. The commission could use new energy and perspective and momentum to make an impactful change that is good for all Chico citizens. Thank you very much. Thank you, Lindsay. Thank you, Ms. Harrison. We have a phone call and I'm not sure who this applicant is, but we'll let that person introduce themselves. You can go ahead. Good evening, Debbie. This is Larry Ball. Can you hear me? I can hear you, Larry. Thank you, Ms. Harrison. And good evening, Your Honor. I'm getting a house of commerce. I'm a resident of Chico, and I work with the City of Chico City staff. My wife, Mary, and I have been residents of both Chico homes for several decades now. In addition, the items under application form, I also have served in several non-profit here at the Chico and the Sunset Planning Commission Council as a Board of Supervisors. One of the things that I see on the Planning Commission that could be structured a little bit differently are the items that are in the Planning Commission. time, cost, and regulations. I think that means it's going to move faster, and the agenda items can move less costly, and the regulations and the post-procedures can be lessened. On the flip side of that, our purpose is to run more efficiently, applications and agenda items can be more efficient, commonsensical, and transparent. Very important on transparency part, because we don't see it a lot, even at some of the boards and commissions, because it's just not something to talk about. And most importantly, perhaps, is that everybody who uses the State Department can take a look at an agenda item or an application or a message to have an opportunity to make their dreams come true. Thank you very much for the opportunity. Thank you, Larry. Thank you, Larry. Our next applicant is Michael Guzzi. Yes, hello. Thanks for this opportunity. My name is Mike Guzzi, and I'm very interested in joining the Planning Commission for the City of Chico. I'd love to be able to join the team and find my skillset to help steer the future of the city by law. I'm currently the Associate Vice President of the Facilities and Construction at Chico State. My scope includes maintenance as well as management of the construction and sustainability for the entire campus. Additionally, I'm directly responsible for our master planning efforts and our compliance with the California Environmental Quality Act. I also serve as an adjunct faculty in the Civilian Development Department teaching leadership ethics and construction engineering. And while those are my normal duties, right now I'm also being tagged by the President to be our head of our response for the Urban Scott Operations Center and managing all facets of our COVID planning. I have a Bachelor of Science in Engineering, from Chico State, Master of Arts, and an Income History and Master of Science in the area of UCLA. I'm also a professional engineer, and I have a leadership in energy and environmental and climate professionals. I'm very interested in sustainability initiatives. Prior to coming to Chico State, I served 20 years in the U.S. State as a Civilian Engineer Corps, managing construction engineering, strategic planning, and military growth at home and abroad, to include multiple deployments to places like Korea, Southeast Asia, Europe, Africa, and the Middle East, and to include Iraq. Some of my goals for being on the committee would be to perform the detailed analysis required to really properly advise our city planners and counsel on all matters of maintenance and execution of the city general plan. I'm a firm believer in creating plans and following through with them. That's really been my initiative here at the University, we've just finished our master planning effort, and I'm a firm believer that we don't just create plans and throw them on the shelf to the best. We need to make sure that we follow through and put them into action. Some of the issues I wrote and had the chance to dive into in the research are really, like others have mentioned, how to allow growth while maintaining the character and charm that makes Chico such an exciting place. Really interesting is reinvigorating our downtown district and the post-covid world, and then also maintaining affordable housing and bringing in businesses that are stimulated to improve the normal economy. In closing, I just want to be a part of this community from when I met my wife and my children at Pride, and I want to help get back to the city. I grew up just down the road in New DC, I went to Duke College, met my wife while I was in Chico State, and when I retired from the Navy, we came up with the first opportunity to come back. I'm deeply invested in the community and want to do what I can to help it grow and prosper and rise and matter. We plan to make this our forever home and embrace the opportunity to help the community. So thank you for your time this evening, and we hope you have any questions. Thank you, Mike. Steve, I'm going to turn it over to you. Steve LaForee. Hello, council members. I'm Steve LaForee. Thank you for your time this evening. I submitted an application in my resume in your consideration of the appointment for the commission. My wife Kathy and I are names of California, and after having spent 25 years in Iowa, we were back when I retired from University of Iowa in 2018. After visits to other states and communities, we were sure that Chico was our new home because of the proximity to our families and the many, many qualities it has. You'll see that I have a combination of professional and volunteer public service where I've gained skills that make me a uniquely qualified candidate. I served two times on the city of Kelowna City Council, and one of the things I enjoyed about that was I had the opportunity to co-chair the city's new general plan about the steering community. That is where I provided input for all segments of the plan, including city profile, strategic planning, growth of land use, community access, recreational lifestyle, public services, and downtown improvements. Also, in addition to the time I spent on the city council, I was hired by Washington County, Iowa as its first planning and zoning administrator. I worked with all aspects of county land use ordinances, including zoning, subdivision, and floodplain, under the direction of Supervisor Christian. This experience combined with my city council experience honed my listening, communication, and collaboration skills. In addition, it provided me with a tremendous experience working with the public in comprehensive understanding of land use concepts and regulation. At heart, I'm a steward, and that's something I would bring as a commissioner. I believe in open and unbiased forums. I've seen them work to the benefit of all parties involved. I will maintain this by studying the staff reports and listening to all the facts presented in public and private meetings. I will continue to work with the public for writing my conclusion on any matter presented to the commission. I want to serve because I feel it would be good to be, first of all, a good representative of the city council and give back to my community. If you have any questions about anything that's new on the application, I feel free to ask. Thank you. Thank you, Steve. Mike Nelson? Yes, good evening. Can you hear me? Yes, go ahead. Great, thank you. I just want to say thank you to the mayor and council and members of staff. Thank you for having us here tonight. I want to acknowledge you. You have a number of very highly qualified applicants. I'm pleased to see so many people interested in supporting this energy. All of these communities. So just quickly a little background for me. I'm a resident of Chico, three properties in and around Chico. I have kids here in town, grew up in school in Chico State. I served the last year on the Climate Action Commission and I'm continuing to do so depending on the updates from these meetings. I have a degree in environmental engineering and I'm also an AICP certified planner with the Northern Plain Association. I'm also a member of the National Environmental Protection Agency. I'm president of an engineering consulting firm with offices in Chico, Eureka, Ukiah and Santa Rosa. I have many years of experience throughout California and New England. This experience includes both representing and reviewing and analyzing proposed projects. Everything from design review to subdivisions to commercial and industrial hospitality projects. And this includes both representing private projects for employers as well as working closely with city and county governments as well as tribal communities. I'm a firm believer in the planning process. I understand the need to balance community needs with proposed projects as well as adopted city, county and state standards. In my current role working both for applicants in government, I read, review and edit the staff reports and think about the documents and number of projects on a weekly basis. I learn from my own with that. And I do not have any projects within the city of Chico, so I do not have any conflicts of interest with the city of Chico or the planning commission. I see a number of challenges in our community with housing, economic development, homelessness and many other issues. And I would be happy to by my experience and my commitment to our community to assist. I would be pleased to serve as the funding commissioner for the city of Chico. Thank you for your time. Thank you. So I don't see any other hands up, but I'd like to just run through this list to see. Gary Moeller is also someone. Ken Rensink, he's also a member of the board. I don't know if, I know he had said he would make it for the interview. He currently serves on the planning commission. I don't see him. So I think that's all that I have. I just wanted to give a... Okay, do you just want to repeat those names one more time? Maybe they'll pop up or I'll give them a chance to connect. That would be Ken Rensink and Gary Moeller. Not on. Not on. I don't see him. Okay. So I think with that, we'll resume discussion in 10 minutes. We're going to take just a short break. Thank you. We're all here. Okay. All right. So we'll resume a little earlier than we thought we would. So I'd just like to start by, you know, thanking everybody who applied. You know, certainly we have quite a few number of people who applied for these particular committees. And I can tell you, amongst all these applicants, there are, you know, more than enough to staff numerous committees. And that speaks highly for our community. But, you know, I myself was an applicant for the planning commission in 2013 who was not chosen. So I know how that works. And please do not think that necessarily because you're not chosen, if that's how it happens, that it means something else. But I think that's one of the things that you should not reapply or reconsider for the future. So, you know, we need good people for the long term. Some people, you know, favor one particular person over another for whatever reason that might be. So please keep applying. We'd like to see your names in the future if you perhaps don't get a spot. And please don't take it personally because, you know, we do have a lot of people involved in this process. So, and I think that goes for the rest of the council too. We all kind of feel that way. And we appreciate your participation in our process. And it's an important part of our process too. Ms. Preston. Thank you, Mayor Krulich. And thank you for letting the applicants know that. We do keep their applications on file. And should there be an unscheduled vacancy, anyone not selected, we would reach out to them and ask them if they would like to still be considered for an appointment to fill in an application. And if they do, we would like to see them fill in an unscheduled vacant position. So I just want to touch very briefly on the 2020 biannual recruitment form that I've laid out there. And hopefully, can someone make, do you need this one? Okay. Can you get that to the mayor? Thank you. Thank you. I need ours. Oh, I've got mine. Thank you. On that one. So I just want to talk briefly about that, about this form. You will see, that there are four positions for the arts commission. There's four four-year term positions for the Bidwell Park and Playground Commission, as well as one position with two-year term remaining on that. And that one lists out every council member's name, all seven for the two-year term. As you will recall, the council voted in to do individual appointments, a process that was in place for some time by prior councils. And they reinstituted that, or you did. And so under arts, council member Denley, council member Morgan, council member Tandon, and mayor Coolidge will bring their nomination or nominee forward. If you could select one person to move forward, fill out your form for the arts commission, and you will do the same thing for the Bidwell Park and Playground position. That first section is for the four. And then the next section is for that two-year term remaining. And I will need all seven council members participating on that. That will be a general appointment by the full body. Now, planning commission is the same thing. There are four spots. And council member Denley, Morgan, Tandon, and mayor Coolidge will make their nominations. I just want to reiterate that just like with, regardless of how you make your appointment, they all require a final vote by the majority of the council. So council members may bring forward their nominees. There may be some discussion. There may be some changes possibly. But at the end of the day, it's the full body, it's the majority vote, four votes or more, that actually makes those appointments. And so that process is still the same. I apologize for a short turnaround. We have, we obviously started this in 2020. And we have board and commission members still participating and being gracious and giving of their time, even some who haven't reapplied. And for the arts commission, mid-world park and playground commission and planning commission, it was our hope to maybe make those final appointments at next week's meeting. So that means that typically the agenda goes out tomorrow, but I would say, if you have any questions, I'm sure that's going to give you till the end of day tomorrow to maybe figure out based on your interviews, or if you have other questions for some of the applicants and you want to reach out to them, you can do that. And then if you could complete that form and get that to me by midnight tomorrow night, then I, on Thursday morning, we'll come in and consolidate all the nominations and prepare staff reports that will go out. And then the agenda will be released on Thursday. So that is the nomination form. Are there any questions about that or the process? Okay, great. So moving very quickly. So the council at its last meeting asked me to do an evaluation or bring back an overview of any board and commission subcommittees, ad hocs, that kind of thing. I did reach out to all the staff who actually support boards in commissions. And what I found that the board and commission subcommittees were that was that planning commission and ARHPB have never had individual committees. The climate action commission doesn't have any, they did talk about it, but they didn't create one. The arts commission, which I staff that one, we have two, I believe two ad hoc. We might've had a third one at one point. And those are considered, well, they were temporary in nature and they were there for a purpose. And once they finished their process, they actually disbanded until the next cycle for the grant funding. And I want you to understand that on an ad hoc versus a standing, the ad hoc committee, if it meets that intent and is truly just an ad hoc for one, one purpose, didn't rely on staff. We did not staff those. They were held off site. There were only three members of our arts commission. And so it did not impact staff resources. And so, and so it's not a collaboration of staff resources at all for the, for those particular ad hocs. Airport commission had one ad hoc several years ago and they completed their work and, and then that was disbanded. Currently we have under the bidwell park and playground commission. They have three standing meetings. They have a policy advisory committee and natural resources committee and a tree committee. Those are standing committees. They are Brown act committees. And I wanted to, to talk a little bit about, obviously with COVID impacting us, a lot of meetings were canceled across the board. The Arts Commission hasn't even met for a very, very long time. Their first meeting will be this April. So I went back to do my research. I went back to 2019. I also reached out to staff and they provided me with information that indicated that those three standing committees typically meet every single month in addition to the regular Bidwell Park and Playground Commission. The staff members who support those standing committees and the Bidwell Park and Playground Commission, this is something that I thought I do a lot of agendas and minutes and that's what we do in the city clerk's office. But they also support the Vina GSA, the airport commission, the Butte County Energy Board that was created. And they actually for Vina do agendas, minutes, staff reports, obviously airport commission are the same things. And at the Butte Chico Energy Board, they actually participate. I believe it's Butte County that actually prepares that or someone prepares the agenda. But the rest of those boards, they handle all of the work that's related to that. So based on what the time factor was, there's three staff members that do work on the policy advisory committee. And that's the park and natural resources manager, the park service coordinator, and the administrative analyst who prepares the agendas and minutes. You have a natural resources committee, three staff members, park and natural resources manager, park service coordinator, administrative analyst. The tree of that having worked really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really eliminated two commissions and a couple of committees that the council had. And so using that same formula, although with updated numbers, the policy advisory committee runs about $4,500 per meeting, and that's including staff resources, and that's at an hour and a half. On an average, I heard from staff that they typically run one to two hours. And then the facilities runs PG&E, janitorial, that kind of thing, runs about $274 per meeting. So the same for the natural resources committee, because it's the same people running that, and the tree committee is about $2,700 per meeting. And the estimated yearly cost for the subcommittee monthly meetings for the Bidwell Park and Playground Commission is about $20,724. And those are, again, in addition to, the regular one meeting a month of the Bidwell Park and Playground Commission, and those costs are estimated at about $91,000, almost $92,000, for just Bidwell Park and Playground Commissions. In 2006, the council dedicated $778,000 towards the support with staff resources and the facilities and everything for its boards and commissions. I recognize that we haven't done a complete analysis of all of them, but I would say that it's probably about the same, maybe a little less, because we have fewer commissions. But I just wanted to let the council know, as I mentioned at the last meeting, it used to be that the creation of subcommittees or ad hocs had to be approved ahead of time by the council. That was in the AP&P 10-1, and that was taken out some time ago. And so I wanted to alert you to that. At the time that the original policy was made where subcommittees and ad hocs couldn't be created without council approval was because the council was concerned at that time there were tons of meetings being called and special meetings in the commission. And so the council felt like if a commission was working on an initiative, that maybe the council should be engaged at the front end so that it can say, we want you working on that, and we want the staff resources to go to that. So I turned that part over to you. Thank you for further discussion or any additional questions. All right. What was the total again for the, not run through all of them. No, $21,000 for staff costs and room costs and janitorial for the subcommittees alone. And is that per month, per year? Excuse me, that is per year. That's in 2018-19 when they were having full meetings every single month. Obviously with COVID, we can go back. They might have only had a couple of committee meetings, and then again, their meetings are just starting back and they're all virtual. So they're a little bit different. Although the same players, the same staff members are still involved. Well, and that's where the brunt of the cost is. Okay. Any questions? And I don't know if Eric or Linda wants to interject anything. You know, I actually had a question about the VINA, forgive me for forgetting the acronym. The GSA. Thank you. Because we live in the world of acronyms here. So can you tell me, so is the VINA, GSA, is that something where we have to do that? Or did we volunteer for that? Yeah, yeah. No, we're part of that. I know we're part of it, but... Yeah, we're part of the GSA and we're under SGMA regulations. So we're part of it. Okay, so we're required. State requirement. Okay. And they meet monthly and we split those duties with the county. So we share the agenda responsibilities, but we're commonly drafting staff reports and helping with presentations during those meetings. County, on many occasions lately, as we get in the meat of the groundwater sustainability plan that we're drafting, is really doing a lot of the heavy lifting, which is nice, but it's been a very collaborative and great partnership with Butte County. All right. And then the other committee, there was a mention of another... Yeah, we also staffed the Butte Choice Energy Committee, a JPA, again, that is in conjunction with the county. It's monthly meetings for some time. Obviously, the Butte Choice Energy Authority is on hold for now, but that is also a staff burden as far as agendas and staff reports and so on and so forth. So you're like a mini clerk's office. Yeah, it's really starting to look at this and where we spend our time. And it's pretty mind-boggling because we do have operations to run and we have a pretty lean staffing model from an office perspective. Yeah. But yeah, we have the Bivouac Park and Playground Commission. We have the Air Force. We have the Air Force Commission, the Vina GSA, and B Choice Energy. And then, of course, as Clerk Preston was mentioning, within the Bivouac Park and Playground Commission, there's the three subcommittees of the Tree Committee, Natural Resource Committee, and Policy Advisory Committee, which all take agendas and staff reports to do. So it's a pretty herculean lift to produce that each month. Okay. Any other questions? No? All right. Do we need to take public comment at this time? Ms. Preston? We can. I don't believe we have. And we didn't receive any comments on Engage Chico. Okay. And if anyone wishing to address this matter who are in attendance, we have 20 people on, but maybe just the applicants listening. Sure. I don't see any new names. Okay. If anyone's on there and wants to address the council at this time, if they could please raise their hand. I want to give you a couple of seconds here to get your hand up. So if you have a hand raised, and then if in fact we have anybody with a hand raised, we'll give you three minutes to speak on this item. Okay. So we do have a hand up. Erin Horst, I believe that that was an Arts Commission applicant that disappeared off the chart. So I believe that they may be wishing to speak to that. I think it's fine. Okay. Go ahead. Hi. Thank you. Thanks for letting me speak. And I appreciate that. I am excited to be considered for the Arts Commission. I have a BFA in acting, a master's degree in theater history, and I've worked as a theater director, actor, producer, and now a lecturer at Chico State in the Department of Music and Theater and at Aspire School of Arts and Sciences. I love the arts. I love Chico. My husband and I came to Chico about seven years ago. We're raising our kids here. We love this community. We love the arts community here, not just theater, but the music and the finance all of it. I think that our community is a beautiful place. Our artists and as a board commissioner, I really support the efforts of our community and the council to celebrate the arts and performing arts in our community. I think that a thriving arts scene can really create stronger communities and families. I know from personal experience that that was the case with my childhood and my young adult life. And I just have that passion to share that with our community and help make it a better place for the arts. And I know that that trickles out to the rest of our city. So I'm just thankful to get to share that a little bit with you and I'm happy to answer any questions. Any questions? No. All right. Thank you so much. Thank you, Aaron. Okay. So that is it for. All right. No other hands up. No other public comment. All right. So I don't know if council wants any, you know, to provide me with any direction. If you're looking at the review of AP&P 10-1 to talk about subcommittees again, I don't know what the council wants to do with that or if that was just a broad answer. So actually at this point in time, I make a motion that we, any committees that we currently have would need to be approved by the city council. So for example, at the planning commission or parks commission wants to actually have a committee, they need to bring that forward to the city council. The city council needs to approve that being started and run and that all our other committees should finish immediately. That our subcommittees should finish immediately. So you would would that, would you like that inserted into the policy for boards and commissions? Because that's what we use to guide their work and what will be 10-1. Yes, we can put that in there. Now, so that's any future committees? Yes. Well, any future or established committees, like if they have established committees and they want to, they would need to bring them forward to council to actually move forward to continue those committees. So the three policy or the three committees of the Bidwell Park and Playground Commission you want brought to you? Would cease until council either approves them or denies them. Okay. Alright. And current, currently established committees would cease right now and for council consideration? Yes. Okay. I think I can second that. I just want to check with Mr. Gustafson that since those three committees are under your purview, is that going to prevent you from doing any important work that you need to do? I think it's, you know, it's fair that the, Bidwell Park and Playground Commission could probably hear most items at this time and if there needs to be something that's, you know, submitted to one of those committees, I'm sure we could request council approval to do so. So, we have a motion and second. Any discussion? No. I just wanted to clarify, make sure I understood. So, if there are committees out there that wish to continue, they need to come forward, ASAP, I guess, to make a case for that committee? Is that? Well, I think, for example, if the Planning Commission had, well, let's just take the Parks Commission because they actually have commissions. So, their tree committee, for example, the tree committee would now need to be, whatever work they're doing could just carry forward on, in terms of actually at the Bidwell Parks and Playground Commission. But if they wanted to carry that committee forward, they need to put a request forward. And that's what we're doing. taking that committee forward to council. Gotcha. And we determined that the two committees that Director Gustafson was talking about with the county were sort of outside of the purview of what you're talking about. Yeah. I mean, we're one of many agencies or, you know, that are part of those. And obviously, we have some legal ramifications of having to staff those or, you know. Okay. So, yeah. Thank you. I have a quick question for the clerk. Could you just run through what it would look like for them to come forward if, like, the tree committee wanted to say they wanted to continue, what's that process look like? Right. So, again, those committees are comprised of three of the commissioners. And so, if the Bidwell Park and Playground Commission didn't want to take up the matter and vet it at that level, then, and they felt that it was important for the tree committee to meet, then they would talk about it at a commission meeting and forward that request through and I would place that on the agenda for consideration. We haven't had a request for a long time from a commission, but we've had them from time to time over the years. And so, we just agendized those items. But they'd have to vote on it as a commission to do that. And the work of those committees would continue on. It would just be done at the commission level versus an additional ancillary meeting. So, I would like a clarification, if I could, for the ad hoc arts commission grant funding groups. Those do not use city resources or anything and actually just review those grants and then bring back their recommendations to the full commission. Well, and our ad hoc committees don't necessarily meet with staff, correct? Correct. Or don't? They don't. They don't have to. They don't have the Brown Act violations. So, I think we could continue with an ad hoc committee. Okay. In that respect. All right. Yeah. Okay. All right. No other comments? You can go ahead and take the roll. All right. Council Member Brown? Sure. Council Member Denley? Aye. Council Member Huber? Yes. Council Member Tandon? Yes. Council, excuse me, Vice Mayor Reynolds? Yes. Mayor Coolidge? Aye. Carries 6-0 with one absence. Thank you. So, the final thing that we're going to do is Yes. Council Member Brown? So, the final thing that we have that Council asked me to make sure was part of this item was whether or not we needed additional recruitments. As you noted in many of the interviews that we had multiple people applying for multiple positions in different commissions, and we've also had two applicants withdraw their applications. One on the Bidwell Park and Playground Commission where we had a lot of applications. I have to say that that was really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really So I believe if they were selected, it would leave you with only maybe two people for two positions, and that's not how council normally does it, where you don't have a choice. So I don't know what you want to do on that one. In regards to the Climate Action Commission, we have five positions, but we only have seven applicants. And for the ARHPB, we had six applicants. However, four of the six applied, and their first choice was either planning or Bidwell Park and Playground Commission. So if those people are taken out of the mix, you only have two applicants for two positions, and you have three positions that you need to fill. So I have a feeling we may need to look at the ARHPB board. So I'll turn that over to you for any questions and further direction on what you'd like my office to do. So in looking at this, and particularly because we brought up particular information, and we do have a few new councillors, not that they don't necessarily know what all our committees do. I'm sure they do. But I think it's worth looking at to see just specifically the roles and duties of those, and then the costs associated. And I think that's something that we're going to be looking at with each committee. You know, especially as we move forward here, and we're trying to tighten our belt a little in terms of our staff time, particularly spent with these, because we are stretching limits of our staff. I think it would be helpful just to have that information. So I'd like to see that just brought back to a future meeting, and that we hold off on doing a recruitment at this time. Mayor Coolidge, are you saying for the Airport Committee and the Climate Action Commission, and is there another one? They are. Architectural Review Board. Do you want to pause recruitment on them to review costs of running those commissions? No. What I'm saying is I'd like to look at each of those individual committees in terms of how they function and what exactly their duties are, so we can assess what their duties are exactly. So, for example, there's been different people in our community have talked about maybe having the Architectural Review Board act more as a review board of appealed planning commission decisions, rather than acting as an additional hurdle for some of our developers or builders in town. And then, you know, in terms of the Airport Commission, they meet, what, four times a year? Correct. So, you know, there might be a need for them, especially as things start moving forward on the airport. You know, if that's six times a year, I think that's necessary to look at. If it doesn't seem like anything's going to be necessary, then maybe two times. So I just think we need to have some discussion about these particular committees and how they function. So would you like to have the staff that support those boards and commissions provide you with an overview of... I'll make that a motion. Okay. I'm fine with getting that overview, but I think we definitely need to go out and continue the recruitment and if we need to do some advertising and whatever we need to do, but we need to continue to get applications in for qualified applicants because... Okay. We've got people that want to retire and move on from their positions and... So let's make that amendment then. Okay. So we'll work on providing the council with an overview. At the same time, you want me to proceed with recruitments for all three of them? Okay. Sounds good. And that, I think, is probably a pretty decent compromise. Alex, because then we can move forward on both. I'll make my vote. Was... Um... You made the motion. Are you seconding the... Okay. Thank you. So... Okay. Thank you. Thank you. So there was a motion and a second to direct... Or ask staff to bring back an overview at a future meeting for the ARHPB Airport Commission as well as the Climate Action Commission and continue on with an additional recruitment to have backup applicants for those in case... We'll know more after next week's meeting because that'll pull possibly some people out of the mix for the other committees that we're talking about right now. So, um... Council Member Brown? Thanks to Vice Mayor Reynolds' amendment. Aye. Council Member Gently? Aye. Council Member Huber? Yes. Council Member Tandon? Yes. Yes. Mayor Reynolds? Yes. Mayor Coolidge? Aye. Carries 6-0 with one absence. So quick correction, Ms. Presson. So would that be open and available as of now? So if each of us wanted to put something on our Facebook pages and all other places, we could let people know that we are reopening applications for those three boards? Or is that going to take some time to be... No, we just need to upload it tomorrow morning to the website. And please, if you know of anyone interested, please let us know that this video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video video weren't able to come through anyway. We were, some of the audio and video was dropping and people were texting saying that they couldn't hear on channel 11 or through the streaming video. So we'll be working with our vendor to make sure that those things are rectified. I just wanted you to know, I mean, it was clunky and it wasn't as smooth sailing as last time, but felt like, you know, wanted to make sure that we could ensure that at least the vast majority of it could be heard. Thank you. I appreciate the clarification there. Okay. Yeah, and I did get that note actually during the break that there were some audio problems at the beginning. Right. We were trying to manage that and, you know, obviously in the video booth. So it was a little crazy and I apologize. Sure. All right. Thank you everyone. Adjourned. Thank you. Thank you.
