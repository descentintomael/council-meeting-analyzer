Anyone wishing to address the council on any matters listed on the agenda  should first complete a speaker card found at the back of the chamber.  Once completed, turn your cards into the city clerk.  The speaker cards are taken in the order they are received.  Once the first speaker begins, no additional cards will be taken.  Persons demonstrating rude, boisterous speaking on matters  outside the jurisdiction of the city council  or engaging in otherwise disruptive behavior,  will be called to order by the chair.  If such conduct continues, the chair may call a recess requesting the removal of such persons from the council chambers,  adjourn the meeting, and or take some other appropriate action.  City attorney can report out from closed session.  Thank you, Madam Mayor, City Council.  Earlier this evening, the City Council recessed and closed session on four items.  For items 2.1, 2.2, and 2.4, the City Council was briefed.  Direction was provided.  No final action.  No final action was taken on those items.  For item 2.3, the City Council did begin discussions.  We did not complete.  The plan is to recess at the first break and reconvene into closed session  to continue the closed session discussion on that item.  That concludes my report.  Thank you.  Consent agenda.  All matters on the consent agenda are considered routine in nature  and can therefore be enacted with one motion.  Do we have any speakers?  We do not.  All right.  Any council disqualifications?  No.  All right.  Consider a motion?  Move to approve.  Second.  We have a motion and a second?  Okay.  That was a motion and a second to approve the consent agenda as read,  and it included ordinance.  Hold on one second.  Let me grab the title of that.  And I clicked into the motion.  Ordinance of the City of Chico amending Chapter 1.14  to the City of Chico Municipal Code, adding additional conditions of  real property constituting a nuisance related to missing and boarded up doors and windows.  Final reading and adoption.  Okay.  Okay.  Council Member Goldstein?  Aye.  Council Member Hawley?  Yes.  Council Member O'Brien?  Yes.  Council Member Van Overbeek?  Yes.  Council Member Winslow?  Yes.  Vice Mayor Bennett?  Yes.  Mayor Reynolds?  Aye.  Carry 7-0.  All right.  Public comment.  Members of the public may address the council at this time on any matters not already listed  on the agenda and within the jurisdiction's authority.  The council cannot take any action at this meeting or request made under this section  of the agenda.  How many speakers do we have?  We have five.  All right.  Three minutes apiece.  All right.  I'll call the first two speakers, and if you can line up in the middle aisle.  Vic S, followed by Aurelia Lopez.  Go ahead and approach.  Yes.  Come up to the microphone.  If you can move it down closer to you, that would be great.  Hi, everybody.  Happy April Fool's Day also.  My name is Vic.  It has been over three months since I last attended a city council meeting regarding  safety on our streets.  I walked my adopted dog usually about four times.  I've been on the road a few times during the day on different routes through the side  streets of Palmetto and Sheridan, such as Macy, Marguerite, Mildred, Naomi.  Our beauties are just a few to state.  I've talked with numerous neighbors and residents on side streets, and they are also frustrated  how motorists are rolling through stop signs, texting on their phones, and speeding, especially  on Palmetto and Sheridan Avenue.  Once again, we need to have white stripes going down.  We need to have white stripes going down.  Middle of these roads, speed bumps if possible, and surveillance cameras, which I understand  is on your agenda tonight, yay, which would capture license plates of motorists speeding  and would also generate monies where motorists would have to pay for these tickets.  On Sunday, two weeks ago, in the San Francisco Chronicle, I was excited to read, speed cameras  looking to save lives.  Move.  Move marked San Francisco's most aggressive attempt to change drivers' behavior, where  they are putting up surveillance cameras and generating monies throughout, and also to  help pay for all of these.  I was ecstatic to read that the city council here teased up parking cameras.  Yay.  It says, councilors will resume a discussion and continue the process of installing cameras,  which I was ecstatic.  E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E  Hi, good evening.  My name is Aurelia Lopez and this is my husband, Uriel Lopez.  We are owners of 1017 Francis Drive in Chico, California, 95973.  We recently connected to SOAR.  We had septic, so we did connection to SOAR.  And Aurelia, can you pull down the microphone so people can hear you?  Okay, thank you.  Should I repeat?  No, you're good.  Go ahead.  And we would like to put it in the property taxes.  We would like to put the remaining of the balance in our property taxes.  Okay.  What we can do is refer you over to somebody on staff that can help you with  that.  This is just for you to make a comment to us.  I can't really give you the information from here.  Well, actually, if I could, Mayor, you approved it in the consent agenda.  Okay.  So it has been approved.  Okay.  So that was a comment for...  Okay.  Congratulations.  I wasn't too sure what I had.  It's taken care of.  Thank you so much for your time.  Have a good night.  All right.  Michelle Jordan, followed by Rebecca Galern.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Hello.  I decided to come down here because I saw an article in the Enterprise Record on Saturday  about the tree maintenance and that they're going to be trimming over 500 trees, trimming  the canopy.  And I hadn't heard about it at all.  I'm in the park.  I'm in the park all the time.  I'm a runner.  I'm not afraid of the trees falling down.  They fall down naturally.  And we have great maintenance in the park.  The trees fall down.  If they're on the roadway, they get cleared away.  And I find it to be prompt and great.  What I'm concerned about is that over 500 trees are going to be pruned, the canopy,  and we need that shade.  The raptors.  The raptors are in the nest right now.  The birds are in their nest.  It's terrible timing.  We aren't like the national and state forests where they had no maintenance whatsoever over  the years.  We have great maintenance.  I really don't understand why we would be doing this to our beautiful lower Bidwell.  And it's going to be super expensive, I imagine.  I'm sure you must have discussed it.  I don't know how I totally missed it because I usually follow things in the park.  But the goats can get the understory.  It isn't the trees that cause the fire.  It's when you don't have clearing out, which is what has been so controversial with the  state and national forests.  So I just want to say that.  I don't think people know.  I don't think people know about it.  So somehow it's happening.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Rebecca Galern.  Hello.  This is my first town hall meeting.  I'm a Chico alum, but I have moved back recently.  I'm here to kind of speak about our representative Doug LaMoffa and to see what we can do to  make sure that he is represented in the community.  I would like to point out that he is representing our county correctly.  Specifically, I would like to point out his sponsorship of HR 2202, which would remove  taxpayer funding towards gender-affirming healthcare.  Point of order, Madam Mayor.  What?  I believe that gender-affirming healthcare is life-saving healthcare.  The Transgender Member and Stay was yesterday.  I believe that the bills that are happening in the federal government are not city.  So as I read in the beginning, this is something that needs to be local to the city.  Is there a way that we ask you guys being our representatives?  He has an office here in town and has a local person.  Do you communicate with him or tell them what your constituents are telling you?  Absolutely.  So you can send us an email and we can forward that to you and we can forward you his information  also.  Thank you.  Okay.  Okay.  So, Mayor, we have one last speaker, Kelly Lesser.  And I apologize because it is confusing.  The boarded-up buildings ordinance was actually on consent, but she has asked that she speak  on the parking meters, which is down under regular business.  And so we missed her for that item.  Would you be willing to take her comments under public comment?  Okay.  So, Kelly Lesser, if you could come up and speak, whatever.  Okay.  So, Kelly Lesser, you wanted to say about the boarded-up buildings in the downtown area.  Hi.  I'm the owner of Urban Couture, a local business owner.  I'm sorry if I missed where I should have...  No, no.  It's okay.  It is confusing.  Okay.  Okay.  I just wanted to give my opinion on the support of the free hour of parking.  I know that...  Oh.  Okay.  So, you actually...  That item is still coming?  Yes.  You said you wanted to talk before us, but you had also said you wanted to talk about  boarded-up business in the businesses.  Boarded-up business buildings, the ordinance moving forward on addressing those, I think  that that would be a wonderful idea because it already looks a little concerning downtown  with other situations, and having up boarded buildings that are constantly getting under  hit with graffiti.  It just kind of  sets a different  vibe for downtown.  And I think if those things  were addressed, it would  help maybe the community  feel a little bit safer  coming downtown.  As a business owner, I know  that those are concerns  for a lot of us.  And it does impact us  and the rest of the community.  So thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  And that is it for public comment.  Thank you.  Public hearings.  Mr. Brendan  Ottoboni, we have 4.1 hearing of  ordering a formation of a maintenance district  A53, Orchard Creek Estates  subdivision. Yes.  Good evening, Mayor, Vice Mayor, State Council  members. Item 4.1  is requesting the  formation of CMD A53.  So a condition of approval  for a new subdivision  or sorry, approval  of a final subdivision map requires  the property owner to have a means  to have ongoing maintenance  of the facilities built that will be owned  and maintained by the city.  So our mechanism to do that is maintenance  districts. So this maintenance district  would effectively provide that  funding mechanism in perpetuity  assessed through property taxes.  That concludes my report. I'm available  for any questions.  All right.  Do we have any questions?  Do we have any questions from Council before we go to public?  No?  All right. Do we have any speakers?  No.  Okay. Open the public hearing.  Sorry.  It's okay.  Now do we have any speakers?  No. We still don't.  Okay. We will close the public hearing.  Do we have any further questions from Council?  If not, I'll consider a motion.  Move to approve.  Second.  Okay. We have a first motion and a second.  Okay.  Second.  Okay. Council Member Goldstein?  Aye.  Council Member Hawley?  Yes.  Council Member O'Brien?  Yes.  Council Member Van Overbeek?  Yes.  Council Member Winslow?  Yes.  Vice Mayor Bennett?  Yes.  Mayor Reynolds?  Aye.  The motion carried 7-0.  All right. Our second hearing is for Code Amendment 24-2, General Plan Amendment 20-01,  Rezone 20-01, Architectural Review Hubbard Apartments, Southwest Corner of Ceres and Lassen.  And I have Tina.  Tina Wilson, Associate Planner. Thank you.  Thank you very much, Mayor Reynolds, Vice Mayor Bennett, and Council. Good evening.  Good evening.  If I could have a moment just to pull up my presentation, I'll get started here shortly.  Thank you very much.  Yes.  Yeah.  Yes, please.  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem ! Typically I'  podem  you who are here saying  recommending approval of a  project. I strive and I know my  fellow colleagues in planning  always strive to find a way  forward to recommend approval  of a project. We'  re not here to deny  projects. That'  s not what we do as planners.  That'  s not our profession. I want  to begin with that because I  want people to have an  understanding of what we do.  This is a code amendment general  plan amendment rezone and  architectural review.  It'  s very simple. It'  s very unique that we'  re here today. The project  site is at series and  lassen. Southwest corner. The  zoning is or and the focus of  my presentation today is not to  go over the entire written  report. I'  m going to focus on a  couple items because I want us  to hone in on the !  The project site is at  real issues here and why we'  re recommending denial of this  particular project and why all  of the bodies that we'  ve gone before with this  project are also unanimously  recommending denial as well.  The main issues here are safety  the airport overflight overlay  zones. This particular property  is in mainly the b1 but also a  little bit of b2. This is for  safety. It is in direct line of  the runway at the chico regional  airport which we'  re trying to obtain  carrier service for. So what'  s at stake?  The airport is a  little bit more than a  Here on this slide you'  ll see that the project site  is about a little over a mile  away from the end of the main  runway. It'  s a two acre site.  And yes there'  s development  surrounding it.  The issue here is we have  overlay zones for both airports  We have a small airport and  then there'  s a chico regional  airport. The applicant is  recommending code amendments  that completely eliminate our  airport overflight overlays  which that'  s what protects our airport  and our airport compatibility  overall. That'  s what makes us consistent  with the butte county airport  s all of our  airport safety just gone.  It really just doesn'  t make sense. It doesn'  t make any planning sense.  So you'  ll see here in this aerial  this is the runway.  Here'  s the site.  Yes it'  s surrounded by some development.  There are other things that can  be built here. The issue is it'  s a two acre site. There'  s no way with  an AOB1 or AOB2 to get to the  density that'  s allowed in B1 or B2. You can  only have an AOB1 one unit per  10 days.  E  E  E  E  E  E  E  E  E  E  E  E  E  E  E  E  E  E  E  E  E  E  E  E  E  E  options we welcome working with the developer on other options.  This is another slide showing the other areas these are worked on by airport engineers this  shows really critical safety infrastructure.  It is important to maintain.  These are the following people and groups that have looked at this project up to this point.  Again it is with a heavy heart honestly.  We are working with the airport engineers to make sure that we are able to get the  We are working with the airport engineers to make sure that we are here  recommending denial.  That concludes my presentation I' m happy to answer any questions you might have.  we have ten minutes for council discussion and or questions for staff.  Mr. Van overbeck.  I went out to the site a few days ago and between the site and the airport is an  end low facility.  I went out to the site and the airport is an end low facility directly across the  street on Lassen and behind that is a law school.  Kitty corner is a church to the northeast.  There'  s an apartment complex on the other side of series across the street.  There'  s single family houses to the south.  I don'  t know what'  s on the west side.  I thought they were houses but it doesn'  t look like it from the aerial.  Given that this is surrounded by development and in some cases fairly dense development  why is and I understand the problems with the code.  I'  m struggling to understand why this is building apartments on this site are a problem.  it'  s because of the type of use that'  s being proposed.  Other uses would be allowed at this location.  It'  s the multi-family.  There'  s multi-family across the street.  That particular location might not be in the b2 or b1.  It might be in b2 or a different designation.  We'  d have to look at that location and see what.  If I can add a lot of the development out there did occur prior to this plan being approved  and adopted by the county.  I'  re looking at the plan being approved in 2000.  Again with the intent that in many cases we'  re probably looking at and seeing all the intents and density being developed in this  departure or arrival zone.  Again this is all pre the plan being in place in 2000.  I have a question if I may ask.  Associate planner wilson sounds very formal.  use of what would be an acceptable use on that piece of property so I understand what that would be.  restaurants, offices.  there are uses that could be placed on that site and be perfectly legal and acceptable.  that'  s correct.  thank you.  also it is the nature of the residential and the 24-7 use of the site is a higher bar as it relates to the plan and some of the restrictions.  thank you.  thank you.  my question for you tina or associate planner wilson.  would this site theoretically allow for lower density residential because one of the issues brought up was that this is too high of a density.  if the site would allow for lower density residential I'  m confused then why what the difference would be whether it'  s a few houses or 39 units.  I believe it would allow for one house.  it'  s okay if the plane crashes into the one house but not the 39.  trolley problem or something.  it allows for one house per I think 10 acres.  I don'  t even know if it would allow for a house.  or one house per five acres on a b2.  council member winslow.  there'  s a couple things.  a lot of things that we have to consider.  the  I think we have a lot of things out here.  I was talking to staff about it.  we didn'  t do expert take communications.  I did talk to the applicant about it.  one thing is it'  s b1 and b2.  b1 allows for half the density of b2 which is still nothing practically.  b2 I learned is just that portion of b2 is actually a ditch.  is that correct?  it'  s not really a usable piece of property what is within the b2 overlay.  right.  and so that we understand.  I would say this is within the code says this is the density that'  s allowed.  but the reason why is because of this safety concerns around the airport overfly zone.  just so that we can be clear about what that is.  because there'  s multiple things.  noise and different components of safety.  the airport the report to the airport land use compatibility commission said that the project would not penetrate the air space protection surface at the project site would not cause a physical hazard to overhead aircraft.  so it'  s not a  very accessible effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively  s the whole  purpose of this of its zoning  and this overlay that limits any  kind of residential development  practically there.  I don'  t believe the only issue  is related to just safety then  you'  re looking at this  project as a one by one basis  it'  s also  anticipating the entire area  and if you were to allow  the residential uses you would  have more and more residential  uses in the area.  This is just a single project.  It'  s a bit of a slippery slope  there which I think is a good  point because what'  s being proposed  here is we not just allow this  as a one off because it borders  it because it'  s adjacent to existing  higher density uses but they'  re proposing we eliminate every  reference to the airport overfly  and we are not going to  I think it'  would be helpful to  explain how that became the  proposal and what the engagement  with city staff that allowed  that.  I can give a quick  We have about two minutes left  and council member Hawley.  The original proposal was to have  the apartment.  We shared that'  s not allowed in the B1  zone and he said then we'  d like to change my  overlay to B2.  It'  s also not allowed in the B2  zone and he said let'  s get rid of all the references  that would therefore be city wide  to these requirements.  We said that'  s not consistent with our  general plan and then let'  s modify the general plan to allow  it.  Whatever is in my way please  remove.  council member Hawley.  I think I ran into a similar question as council  member  it was very dramatic of a shift  being requested by the builder.  Is there any other leeway or  route we can have moving forward  more effective and have a higher  density than what'  s currently allowed?  I would suggest it would be a  pretty high bar. These plans are  prepared by professionals intending to  protect the long-term longevity and  operations of airports both safety and  noise and their ultimate build outs.  The county is the one that approved the  plan there was a time where we were  not compliant with that plan and I think the staff report speaks to some of the concerns related to if we'  re not consistent with the plan then all development proposals will be  make sure that the proposals moving forward that fall within those areas have to go through an extra step they have to be referred to them for a compatibility determination. We have worked very carefully with the aluc and the airport commission staff on making there are some areas in the b2 zone we created an infill list where there would be some allowed density as long as they were consistent with other projects built out in that area. Following the campfire we have a  difficult to get there when housing was so dire as it still is but at that time we worked with them on an interpretation of how to determine the median density to get higher density but again it was a very involved process for a small nuance for them to just make a cataclysmic shift and say we are now going to allow normal densities in the b2 zone consistent with city zoning I think would be a far stretch. Something we could request and we have as part of any future update of their  plans. update of their airport land use compatibility and the city       plan. I think we would be able to get a second bite of the apple on the infill in the b2 zone but  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  do you have any  communications?  no.  I know the applicant and  happened to go to high school  with him and I did ask a quick  question over the telephone we  did speak about one matter that  I had on one of his things he  sent to us in e-mail but that'  s it.  that'  s my own.  I'  now we will go to the  appellant.  It has 15 minutes additional  speakers we will take for 30  minutes and then rebuttal if  granted will be for three minutes  so you know how this works.  Mr. Hubbard.  Madam mayor and honorable  council I'  m here.  about the 14-way infill and it  is permitted under a luc under  b-2.  Under normal circumstances my  property would be b-2.  But in 2017 when the a luc  compatibility plan was passed  they based the contours of the  zones on 141,000 flights a year.  Now by comparison the  Burbank International Airport. You can see the numbers for yourself. It's the sixth page of the  packet that I sent you. You'll see Hollywood Burbank Airport has  131,000 flights.  Sacramento International Airport when this was passed  110,000 flights.  Santa Barbara 102, Fresno 97, Chico. When Chico had commuter service  the year before  was  terminated.  49,000 flights. At the time the ALUC was passed Chico had  34,000 flights.  Smaller flights, fewer flights means smaller zones. I should have had a zone  remarkably lower and so I'm not opposed to  flight zones. I  think flight zones are necessary. Matter of fact, I think they're required by the law. What I oppose is flight zones  that prevent me from adding  high density housing when we need it. You can't fight homelessness and oppose homes.  Unless you have any questions for me I'll reserve the rest of my time.  Thank you.  Do we have any speakers?  We have two additional. Norm Rosini followed by Rebecca Gelerne. Galern. Good evening my name is norm !  podem  podem  podem  podem  smaller zones, that's not true at all. The zones were created based on safety and noise contours.  The noise and safety maps were studied. And statistically, they don't come just from Chico.  They come from airports all across the country. Because when you have a runway, the traffic  pattern for, say, Reno is very similar to the traffic pattern at Chico. Despite the number of  flights, despite the kinds of aircraft, the pilots are still doing the same thing.  And so the altitudes that they fly and the directions that they fly, you can statistically  look and say, okay, where is the highest likelihood of safety issues or crashes?  It happens to be the accident scatter is right off the edge of the runway, both on approach  to landing and on takeoff. That's when aircraft have the most problems.  This  is  a !  The location for the project is right there. To address Tom's question about, well, there's  already apartments there and ANLO is there, that was mostly pre-existing development.  So when we looked and developed our plan in 2000, we were saying, what can we do right  now? And we had 15 public hearings. So there was plenty of public input to say, oh, I want  to do this project.  I want to do this project and we accommodated all of those needs at the time  But sooner or later you have to if you're gonna protect your airport  You have to come down with a plan and you can't just infill all around it at the time in the 90s  That we were working on this plan late 90s. We were losing an airport  Every week in the United States 50 a year  We're going away mostly because of residential encroachment and that's the problem with airports  It's not just safety them the planners right safety is important  But noise is the big killer of airports pretty soon people start complaining  They get worried when they see planes flying over when I was on the a look  We had complaints every month from someone who wanted us to move the pattern or the aircraft were too low  And if you ask Tom, they still get complaints  So if you're going to protect the asset that you have  Which is chicken regional airport, which you're never going to be able to build another airport the last Airport in California  I think was Rio Vista 20 years ago because the cost and the environmental concerns  You're never going to get another airport your best  Duty is to try to protect the airport as it exists and this is why the plan exists and I'm happy to answer questions  I've got a question  So nor what sort of plane do you fly I forget what is our what sort of aircraft you fly  I fly a Mooney 201  Okay, and so when you're on final  What is as a person percentage? What is your?  Glide slope when you're coming in on final  I don't know what my percentage is but I know that over this property when I'm on final  I am well below a thousand feet and and you look at and say well  That's a mile away from the end of the runway. Well at 90 or 100 miles an hour  That's a few seconds  so  The glides we don't fly a glide slope. We're looking at in my aircraft because I don't have  Percentage glide slope like an airliner might have but I'm flying the numbers  I'm flying at an airspeed at a certain descent rate to shoot for those numbers and end up on the number  But when you're a mile out your thousand feet up is what you're saying less than I'm over this  I'm on final I if I've turned base and I'm coming in on final I'm well below it  I'm going to be a little bit higher than that. I'm going to be a little bit higher than that  I would also point out that the tanker is going out on hot days  If you watch them, they're struggling for altitude and you know over 50% of the tanker traffic goes straight out  I looked in the numbers that were in here  65% I think going out and 50% coming in are straight over  They're not turning. They're not making a turning departure or turning arrival. They're coming straight in  Thank you  Just a second our last speaker is Rebecca go learn  I was going to  remove  my  time  but  I  wanted  to  make  a  quick  statement  One  that  if  we  are  going  to  to be putting low income housing in those that are potentially like our homeless population  in this, in this location that is a risk of a bad accident. Um, I feel like that is a  bad idea. That is not, um, ethically sound of us to put, um, people in, in risk or at,  uh, at risk or already at risk of other sort of, sort of trauma, um, to face further trauma.  I think this plot of land could potentially be used for, uh, better, uh, betterment of  the community in the form of a park and or garden, um, that would provide natural resources  to the community, including fruit trees, um, and shelter for said homeless population and  nourishment for the community instead of passive income for someone else.  Thank you. That's it. All right. Um, Mr. Hubbard, it is your turn again, if you would like  to. Does the council have any questions for me? This is high density housing, not low  income housing, correct? It is high density. Okay. Um, yes.  Um, it is. It is high density. I was just clarifying. I thought that that was my understanding  of what was proposed. Yes. Okay. Thank you. That's all right. I do a lot of work at home.  I'm king of the homeless or mayor of crazytown. Take your pick. So, uh, thank you. I'll submit  it. All right. Council discussion. Does anybody? So I will jump in if I may. Okay. Mr. O'Brien.  So I don't want to. Um, I'll just say it's a good idea. Um, it's a good idea. Um, it's  thank you Mr. Hubbard I  appreciate you coming forward  with this project but I can'  support it from a public safety  community safety issue and just  the concerns regarding the  firefighting planes is enough  for me I'  m sure staff  did a marvelous job  communicating the concerns to  all of us we'  re willing to  discuss with you Mr.  Hubbard as to other potential  options for the future which  this council may support. I  pay attention to language and  when I hear our experts  community development director  airport manager city of chico  airport commission city of chico  planning commission butte county  airport land use commission and  caltrans aeronautics division all  oppose this that means something  to me and for that reason alone  I cannot support this there  was zero zero ambiguity in  their positions and left no room  for discussion. I'  approval in my opinion.  Mr. Winslow.  I have some conflicted feelings  on this and when it comes to the  proposal is to delete every  reference to airport overfly zone  and that'  s inappropriate if it  wasn'  t this is about building  housing I could liken it to  demolishing a building to get to  a yard on the other side and I  would like to think there'  s a way we can find a better  use for this. What I really I'  m not sure I understand all the  rationale but when it comes to  putting noise and the concern  that complaints about noise are  going to shut down an airport I  really don'  t like that because you  know where we get multi-family  housing we still have the need  we still build somewhere maybe  less than we need people  struggling to sleep outside but  we still get it and it'  s in the most noise  intensive areas in our city it'  s almost like you can predict  where multi-family housing can  go by where'  s the most noise  intensive area in our city.  effectively effectively ! when a train derails we put all this housing next to it we have oil trains that go by there and we don' t have the same assessment.  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively [inaudible]  think the reason I know to a  project doesn'  t make there are  cumulative impacts of not  approving housing and it means  we are putting housing  elsewhere or not getting it and  I think those are real health  impacts to look at. Again what  we have on the table here isn'  t just approving a project we  haven'  t found a smooth caveat  in order to make this happen so  going to support that so it'  s not something I can support  now.  this is a tough one. I  guess I start from the standpoint  that these codes were created by  very talented people very well  meaning very talented people and  I don'  t care how thoughtful and  experienced and talented you are  when you create these sorts of  building codes you can'  t really  and there has to be the  flexibility for situations that  make sense but maybe don'  comply with the code to be able  to approve them. And we can  never forget that these codes  exist to serve us. It'  s not for us to serve the  code. So everybody I'  ve heard argue against  this it all relates back to some  requirement or code. This is a  clear case where you have  completely surrounding the subject property and on the on the east side very high density development  The argument that it's a danger because it's close to the airport. I mean anybody's ever flown into San Diego  You know your mom  Or flown into LaGuardia Airport. I mean the housing is much much closer  As far as the encroachment argument it's already happened  I mean his encroachment all around it  and so  We are struggling to find  suitable infill  Projects so that we can house our people. We have a housing crisis  We have people who can't find places to live  I don't know that in the history of Chico there have been people who have died on final approach  But I don't know that there's ever been planes that are crash on final approach  I don't ever been anybody has died in a structure  It was it  by a plane in the history of Chico, but you know, we got a bunch of people dying because I don't have a place to live  so  Yeah, I get there's danger in this probably a lot less danger than getting in your car  And and going through an intersection being potentially hit by a red light runner. So  With all due respect to the people I respect who opposed this I support it. I think it makes a lot of sense  I think if there were there was no development to the north  I would say okay  Or the east or west but there is so we've already that horse is out of the barn and I  strongly support this project  Councilmember Holly. Yeah, I struggled with this quite a bit because obviously bit because obviously aluc and our own community development department had very convincing letters on the risks. We' letters on the risks. We'  city of california is in dire  need of this missing metal  housing and I think all of us  reviewed the architectural  design and saw how this fits all  the boxes of the missing housing  projects that we so desperately  need. What'  s really  stalling me here is our path  forward there really isn'  t a  lot we can do it'  s kind of a slippery  slope situation if we change  what this airport overlay zone  means it'  s going to allow  for a whole lot more risk than  just this one development and I  understand slippery slope  fallacy is a real thing but we  have to see it how it is and I  do worry that approving this is  going to be a much larger issue  in the long run however I think  we all need to take this example  into consideration in the future  when we'  re looking at  major projects that are  potentially going to be  looking at land use reforms such  as exploring form based code  which I know our ad hoc committee  did so a couple of months ago  that was a very productive  conversation but we really need  to diversify our options here  when this is being built out.  councilmember goltze.  say the same things that others  have said largely but I support  generally doing what it takes to  ensure we can build housing in  infill areas so when I first  looked at this it seemed as many  have pointed out this is  essentially an infill area it'  s adjacent to other apartments  other single family houses  medical facilities and such and  I want to also echo what council  member kenslow said we are  building multi-family housing and  low income housing largely in  areas that are next to highways  or arterial roads where the people  living there are not only impacted  by noise pollution and air pollution  from those roadways but the way  that I see it is also when you'  re putting people next to  highways you also have a risk of  vehicles crashing into people'  s yards and houses which is  something we take for granted.  It'  s a very important issue and I  think it'  s a very important issue and I  s unlikely but I'  ve seen cars literally flip  over on 9th street so we have  risks everywhere I do take it  very seriously that this is in  the air flight overlay zone and  so I would have concerns with  approving it because of the  aforementioned problems with that  so I struggle with this one and  I would love to see if possible  for something to come back with a  change to the zoning or change to  zoning or change to the zoning  more research I know you'  ve  already done so much so I don'  t know how much further there  could be to go but without impacting  the entire air flight overlay zone  as was proposed.  can I ask one question  staff because I didn'  t earlier if this for some reason  we were able to just approve this  one project and not affect the  overlay zone would or could this  airport service in the future?  I will share first of all we  have the airport manager here as  well behind me and he can maybe  speak to that but I want to first  answer the contention that we are  slaves to these codes we have in  the past have done some overrides  unique circumstances over near  ranchero airport something that'  s in the b2 not the b1 near the  c and there was a small subdivision  and it'  s like this does not make sense this does not pass the straight face test and it'  like this does not make sense this does not pass the straight face test and we  process that and brought it through council.  We look at things on a case by  case basis and we don'  t just are slaves to the  code. I want to share I don'  t know you can just peel off the  one. One of the points I also wanted to  make tonight was the equal treatment  what'  s to stop the next person with the  adjacent parcel to say hey you just did  this overrides why not me as well and  that would be reasonable for them to expect to get the same treatment and  the same treatment.  I think that'  s the  domino effect of what then can as  one of the public speakers shared can  cause difficulty for the future of the  airport.  Again I asked tom to be here tonight  so maybe you can share some thoughts as well.  I would be happy to.  If it'  s going to impact the ability for us to get air  service just building the apartments right there I'  m going to say probably not.  But if it'  I think airlines going to want to be in an area where they know the  airport is going to be sustainable growing expanding it'  s a possibility.  It'  s hard to say exactly right now yes or no but it likely wouldn'  t be a good impact.  are there more properties you think that  would just follow up that would put some in an application because this is  one that is kind of maybe uniquely  surrounded by residential uses on three sides.  effectively effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively identified but that was b2 this  california but that was b2 this  is predominantly b1. That was  an opportunity for the city to  engage a luck again this is in  the 2010 time frame I'  m not  even 100% sure where there were  areas in the b2 where they were  built out a lot of the area has  been built out it was built out  in the county and there was  and there was large open areas  opportunities that we pursued  and identified to allow  development where otherwise it  wouldn'  t be. There isn'  t as much opportunity still out  there there are a few locations  but b1 is different than b2 and  we'  ve been talking about the  approach zone in particular.  thank you. Consider a motion?  I'  m going to make a motion  to approve the resolution of  the city of chico city council  denying code amendment 24-02  denying general plan amendment  2201 denying rezone 22.01 and  denying architectural review 22.03  otherwise known as the hubbard  apartments with all due respect  to Mr. Hubbard.  I'  ll second the motion.  okay.  thank you. !  councilmember goldstein?  with great hesitation, aye.  councilmember holly?  yes.  councilmember o'brien?  yes.  councilmember van overbeck?  no.  councilmember winslow?  yes.  vice mayor bennett?  yes.  we will take a quick break.  let'  s power through  red cameras and then we'  ll take a break.  request for proposal for red light camera system completed with two vendors responding.  chief aldridge?  thank you.  good evening mayor and vice mayor  members of council.  thank you for allowing me to speak on this  tonight.  this request tonight was not meant to be a very long presentation for you.  it was just a quick update on where we stand with the process of working through a request for proposal with the red light camera project.  so tonight I put together a quick little powerpoint that does not stand up to my fellow colleague in the public works division.  but I do feel it is appropriate for tonight.  so we recently had our request for proposal submitted through public purchase.  it was out for some time.  we got two proposals back.  one from red flex or vera mobility.  another was from a company called genoptic.  and I felt like once we received those back.  we would be able to get them back.  after the rfp process closed it would be appropriate for me to remove my department from the grading process of that.  so I asked the engineering department under brendan and his staff to grade that for us.  they completed the grading of that.  those two proposals that were submitted.  and vera mobility came out quite a bit ahead of genoptic.  to be clear.  they received an overall score of 93.  genoptic received a score of 78.  and I' m sure director adeboni can speak to the level of professionalism with vera mobility versus that of genoptic.  so we are here tonight to say we have selected vera mobility as the potential organization that we would like to go with for this project.  so we are here tonight to say we have selected vera mobility as the potential organization that we would like to go with for this project.  we would like to go with for this project.  just some next steps.  we would need to move with an award letter after tonight' s meeting if you decide to move forward with this project.  we would then create an insurance plan between vera mobility and the city of chico and then the writing of a contract which would include our city attorney'  s office and the attorneys for vera mobility. mobility. This is just an  the board members beyond  council'  s decision tonight and  then it would include director  audubon and his staff and most  likely some staff members from  director gustafson'  s department.  Once that launch meeting is over  we would create some business  rules and what that means is  what is it we'  re looking for in  the red light violations are we  looking for people who violate  it by two seconds or are we  looking for to only site a  business owner if it'  s a clearly marked business  vehicle would we send  notifications when it was a fire  truck going through or a police  car or an ambulance things of  that nature that'  s what a business rule  would be.  I would have to defer to  director audubon for that kind  of stuff that'  s outside of my  wheelhouse.  Then the back end roadside piece  to that again that would be more  of director audubon'  s wheelhouse but I  do believe that is like your  construction where it'  s occurring and safety plans  and things of that nature.  Once all of that is rolled out  and the construction is ready and  they have completed that portion  of it we would do a public  outreach training to our  community to let them know  exactly what it is we'  re doing and why we'  re doing it.  I think that'  s been pretty clear how the  project would or the program  would affect the community and  what to expect from that program.  So that is from today to that  public outreach training is  roughly five to six months.  We have quite a bit of time if  we vote to move that forward  tonight.  This is the camera system here.  I only put that in the slide  just so you understand what it  looks like at the intersections.  It'  s not like the old cameras you  saw back in the 90'  s or 2000'  s where it looked like a giant  white box next to an  intersection.  They'  re very small.  They blend in well to the  intersections.  They'  re not an eyesore at all.  And I think that was built this  way so that they'  re more aesthetic to the  community, don'  t stand out and then also of  course they'  re right there so that they'  re not very visible for the  folks who just want to keep  running the red lights in town  so they'  ll get caught with them.  Thank you.  I got a lot of questions about  this from a couple council  members and I thought I'  d go over it real quick  tonight.  It looks very confusing, looks  very busy, but it'  s actually not.  If you look at say the first  four, I'  m sorry, yes, the first four  lines, that'  s one intersection.  And you see the arrows, so the  arrows indicate direction of  travel, you know, north, south,  east, west, so you see there in  the northbound lanes they would  put three cameras, southbound  lane they would put two cameras  that also captured a turning  lane, so on and so forth  throughout their list of cameras  they have recommended.  Now I understand I only worked  with them to identify, hey, we'  ve got these intersections we  feel are very dangerous in the  city, but they actually come out  and do their own analytical  analysis.  analytical data on this.  They do all of their own research  to figure out what areas of town  they feel like need the cameras  the most.  And since one of their models is  that they guarantee the selection  criteria that they'  ve given us will generate  enough revenue to pay for the  cameras, they are the ones that  say these are the intersections  you should actually place the  cameras at.  If you look at the columns over  past the arrows you see average  daily traffic, that means how  many vehicles come through those  intersections every single day.  I'  m not quite sure how they got  that number to be honest with  you.  I think it'  s on an average count most  likely unless they sent someone  out without my knowledge.  And then next to that you see  constructible, that simply means  that yes they can put a camera  in that location.  I removed the ones that said no  simply because there'  s no need for you wasting your  time looking at that.  If it'  s conditional it just means they  need to do a little extra work in  that area.  So if you look at eastbound first  avenue at esplanade that'  s the third one down you'  ll see that it says conditional  and the condition is that they  need to do some major tree  trimming right there in that  area.  So they want to remove that  visual impairment for the camera  in that intersection so they get  a clear view of the area.  And then the next one is the  vehicle coming and going through  the red light.  And as you work your way down  through that you'  ll see right of way easement  issues and I believe that might  be, correct me if I'  m wrong, Brendan please, but I  believe that means that it may  have to be on private property.  Is that what that means?  An easement issue?  So there may be some work that  needs to be done from that part.  Let'  s see.  So just a real quick snapshot of  the way the process works.  So the camera would come on when  the light turns just before it  turns red.  It knows when it turns red.  It captures the event, uploads it  to what they call their back  office.  That'  s the processing of the  citation.  They have someone in their  organization that reviews all of  the images and video to make sure  that yeah it was a violation from  their standpoint.  They look through the dmv  database.  They get the registered owner.  The license plate matches that  vehicle so they confirm that if  it, the camera showed that it  was a red honda accord, the  registration that comes back to  that license plate is registered  to a whatever year red honda  accord.  And then from there they send it  over to the police department.  They send it over to the  We review it from our side and  then once we determine that that  is a good citation we send it  back to the organization or the  vira mobility and they have a  system that sends out the notice  that we would request.  We can request a warning or an  actual citation.  They send it out.  It goes through the back channel  system into the courts traffic  department and they send those  citations and then the person can  then go in and pay or dispute the  citation.  They can also challenge the  citation at the police department  where we would have to come up  with a process for them to view  the video of the violation.  Just so you understand how that  worked.  Here'  s a quick  The intersection is considered a  system.  As you read the rfp that came  back from vira mobility they keep  referring to a system.  I had a meeting with them last  week and I said I wanted to know  exactly what is a system.  Is that a full intersection or is  that a camera?  When they say system that means  a camera that captures a lane.  One lane is captured by one  system.  As you see here northbound esplanade  at first avenue would capture three  lanes of travel.  That camera per month $5150  likewise all the way down the list  there.  Each lane essentially is $5150  per month for a grand total of  $77,250 a month.  On the police department  department of the state we have  On the police department side we  did request three community  service officers to be added to  our staff of which they would be  added to our traffic unit all  three.  They would rotate through  managing the red light violations  and when they'  re not doing those they would  be assigned to do the lower level  traffic details so it frees up  to help us get up our sworn  traffic officers to go out and  do proactive enforcement.  We get a lot more activity out  of those sworn officers in the  traffic unit instead of the more  clerical details they get stuck  in the office on.  Those three community service  officers have an annual cost  roughly $340,688.  Now mobility talks about cost  neutrality. What is cost  neutrality? What they'  re submitting to us is  that due to them selecting the  intersections where they want to  put cameras they guarantee us  that those intersections will  create enough revenue in fines  that come back to the city'  s general fund from the court  and the city of redding.  There are situations where if  you look at the city of redding  worked with them starting in 2023  I think it was when this was  first brought forward and found  that they were bringing in  roughly $400,000 a year in those  fines after the fines were paid  to the court and the fees were  paid to veer mobility they were  using that money to pay for  using the excess funds for their  fleet replacement account in the  city'  s budget.  They were buying patrol cars and  whatever other vehicles that were  needed for the city.  The system does not produce enough  citations to cover the cost.  They absorb the overage.  For an example if our bill was  $77,000 a month and through all  the cameras we were only able to  recoup $50,000 that month $27,000  would be moved to the next month'  s required payment.  If in that next month it didn'  t cover that full month of $77,000  plus the overage of $27,000 they  would absorb the $27,000 from the  month previous.  That'  s their loss not ours we don'  t pay them for that overage.  And then with the  additional fines we have to  look at the potential employee cost  recovery.  Like I said the fines that come  back to our general fund from the  court there'  s potential I don'  t know I can'  t even guess at that at this point.  But that is their sale is that you  could possibly bring back enough  fines to pay for your employee cost.  And with that is an update.  And so my report is that the  council is now in the process of  making a decision on whether or not  you would like to move forward with  that next step.  thank you.  I'  m going to go with the  council member questions.  thank you so much for the  information chief.  I was curious on any information  provided by vero mobility on how  to work through those right of  way easement issues if usually  they work with the  m.  I would like to  property owner what that  projected cost.  there'  s zero out of pocket cost to  the city no matter what.  That was a guarantee from them.  They fund everything to get their  cameras in your community.  I'  m not sure if maybe they I'  m going to go back here for a  second.  So I know one area we removed  that was a property owner that  The one area we removed was  mangrove at 9th avenue.  Eastbound 9th avenue at mangrove  .  So you see right there down  toward the bottom portion it  says eastbound 9th avenue at  mangrove avenue.  That'  s 9th avenue coming across  mangrove.  We removed all of mangrove going  across 9th.  because there'  s a cell phone repair  business there in front of s&s  produce I'  m sure you recall  that. If you ever drive by  there look at the sidewalk it  literally butts up against the  building and it runs for quite a  length of that sidewalk. So in  their analysis they said hey we  can'  t put one right there  close by we may be able to get  property owners to allow us to  put it on the side of the  by that building or in a parking  lot that'  s close by like s&s  produce but they would work with  those owners and most likely with  brendan to identify what that  easement issue would look like.  that'  s great it sounds like  that would also eliminate the  burden of staff time as well.  councilmember rutten over back.  just to make sure I'  m clear  I'  ask you about the survey before  installation to determine where  the cameras should go. The  actual cost of the  installations the labor to put  them in the hardware the  software the maintenance and  upgrades what happens if  somebody runs into a light pole  and damages the camera do they  replace that or do we?  s'  s all on them.  we have no out of pocket  cost?  to this point that'  s what I'  ve been  told zero out of pocket cost  they manage all of the equipment  whether it be replacing it if  it'  s damaged if it breaks  hardware upgrades software  upgrades any of that kind of  stuff. We'  re two years into this and they  figure out they have a better  camera system that they want to  install because it'  s much more clear or it captures  more light and it'  s effectively  how How long do they guarantee the revenue you said they  They guarantee it initially but presumably people in chico  effectively  effectively expect the revenue to decline over time. How long do they  time. So how long do they guarantee it? So that's all written in the contract. Okay. You don't  remember whether it's a year or two years or six months. It's during the length of the contract.  Oh, it is. Yeah. It's the whole length of the contract. And we keep some issues in years past  with that. I know that I've read a lot about it. Um, and they, they made some changes within their  organization. Um, and so now you, you ensure you write that into your contract that there's no  out of pocket if it doesn't meet its needed funds through fines. And if there's excess revenue,  we, we retain it. We retain that into the general fund. Right, right. Okay. One last question,  if I may. Um, so you said there are three community service officers that you've hired for  this. And then I also heard there was one full-time equivalent community service officer necessary to,  um, um,  you know, review the tickets, you know, that, I mean, my calculation is you have to write five  tickets a day per system. And so maybe that, what is that 50 or 60 a day total? I would think one  person could do that. And I'm wondering why do we have three? Yeah. When we first kind of started  talking about this project, we didn't really know how, how much work was involved in it. And over  the past year and a half or so that we've been looking at it, um, we've kind of determined that,  yeah, we probably,  we probably only have enough work for one full-time CSO just with cameras. And so, uh, our thought was  if we're trying to grow the department and grow traffic safety, um, in our city, then here's an  option for us. We could add three CSOs, uh, to our traffic unit. One dedicated directly to cameras.  The other two would be, um, dedicated to going out and handling those low-level traffic issues that  our traffic officers are having to deal with, uh, around the city. Um, and then we'll see how it  which would free them up to then go to these locations maybe say where there's not a red light camera and work it  from their own perspective or deal with the complaints that we continually get about the speeders such as  our speaker tonight and so  I think that it's a it's a great  Idea I think that it's a low-cost idea. It's much cheaper than hiring  An additional officer for every one officer you hire you could probably get close to two  CSOs I'd imagine  It's right around in there  so  That was my idea moving forward  definitely, I do believe and I think my response to to the council members that I responded to was  We could probably do this with one full-time  dedicated CSO in our traffic unit  and  That would be what they do all day  And to kind of go back if I can I don't know how much time I have I'm sorry  You're correct as we install these the number of citations will spike  So the same will be said for accidents. They will spike so we have to be prepared for that  We install a camera. There's gonna be signage  Someone's about to run a red light they slam on their brakes because they don't want to run the red light and then they get rear-ended  So in talking with reading they saw a huge spike in  Their citations and accidents, but once the community started realizing wait a minute  These are the intersections that are dangerous intersection. They put red light cameras here  I need to stop their accident rates plummeted and their citations for those intersection intersections plummeted which then means that  The revenue that's coming in from those violations plummets  So in theory if it does its job, right?  We should see a reduction in all of those three areas  Okay  Councilmember Goldstein  Did you want to talk now or after speakers? Yeah, I just had one question. I'm trying to figure out how to phrase this  Yeah, so do we know what the contract length will be?  The recommended life is five years  Okay  And what happens?  So if we find that we're just not making revenue from these can we back out of that contract before the five years?  I would imagine that  You can but you're going to have to pay a fee an exit fee an early exit fee  Okay, and then I'm also concerned about like if  if we were losing money and we had to exit and then we've already hired officers and that could be a  potential bad situation  Financially and employment wise so to be clear you're not going to lose money on the cameras  They will lose money where the city would potentially lose money as if we're getting revenue from the fines that's helping pay for say that  one CSO  Community service officer and then the fines drop off now the city is starting to have to absorb that cost of that one employee  Say we only approve one the city manager approves one for my budget this year and says that's what you get to run that  So is that that revenue falls off?  Then we have to be prepared to come back and say hey we need supplemental funds to fund this because we're no longer  Generating the revenue we need  Okay, good to know. Thank you  I  Just had one quick question  Warning versus citation you said you might issue somebody a warning why in the world would we send anybody a warning and not just a citation?  Or does everybody get one morning or that's just how you program it in the beginning of what we choose to do  Sure, the first 30 days everyone will get warnings. Oh perfect. Okay, just as a community education campaigns and hey  Here's you running through a red light  Here's your warning. Just know that on this day. We're going live and you  Have to effectively effectively effectively effectively  the !  I think it'  s  red light  but you get the citation and how do you deal with that?  there'  s  some ways to deal with that.  thank you.  I think that'  s all we have up here.  We will go to speakers and we may have more for you after the speakers.  thank you.  how many speakers do we have?  we have one.  that is todd jones.  I will go to the next speaker.  Mr. Jones.  thank you.  good evening.  Todd jones here.  adjusting what you just said, I got a red light ticket in reading because I sold a car.  and they gave it to me.  and I spent hours, hours, DMV, court, reading police finally came through.  so it is not a fun process by any means.  anyway, I have heard a lot about the  I have heard a lot about revenue, revenue, revenue.  a little bit about safety.  I was looking very quickly like Roseville, Rockland, Yuba city, Davis, Fairfield, Stockton all got rid of their cameras from what I understand.  because it didn'  t work for them.  I read too that one thing that could help with instead of spending a lot of money on this even though revenue is generated is possibly tweaking the red light.  have both red lights and red lights.  I am going to say it again.  it is a good idea to have both red lights and red lights stopping.  if we are truly interested in safety, having both red lights stop for a second, maybe two seconds.  and that late distracted driver zipping through is not going to run through.  and that I think would be a nice way of preventing that.  red light cameras are never going to stop the drunk driver, the distracted driver, the people who are going to be doing that anyway.  it is not going to help.  too that and maybe this is my own personal thing is that a lot of the tickets are given for  the creeping right turn i come come to a turn right slide nobody's around i'm just gonna just  roll through bang i got a 500 fine i don't know if that comes under warnings or some of the revenue  enhancement ideas i don't know but the idea is i just heard two cutting down trees and things  like that to put up these lights city of trees look how many trees we've been taking down already  i i think possibly tweaking the light time i noticed my time's running out is better i think  than just revenue enhancement as as i keep hearing oh we're gonna make money make money make money  after the contract goes they're going to take down  the  lights hopefully now we got a eyesore empty spot or maybe just leave them up and fake everybody out  i don't know that works too i read that that helps too but anyway i'm not in favor of these for the  reasons i mentioned especially when you don't own the car thank you thank you that is it all right  thank you council member winslow there's a couple things out of that comment that i want to refer  to one is that we've had a number of meetings about this now going back to summer 23  i think and the whole time um i i feel like we've all been consistent the point of this is not it's  not generating revenue um we're talking about offsetting the cost of it um and the point of  it's not to like catch people doing things like accidentally like a creeping right turn and and  so we have the ability to to get that kind of direction given the fact that we're guaranteed  to not be paying out of pocket for these cameras it makes a lot of sense for us to say we're gonna  set i wouldn't say like a high bar but we're looking to stop people from doing things that  are blatantly unsafe not people who are making little mistakes like not coming to the car and  not being able to get to a full stop before a turn whenever nobody's put in danger the other  thing was mentioned at intersection improvements and we have some intersection improvements going  on along those lines i wonder if mr out of bunny you wouldn't mind like just quickly explaining  uh are you talking about the uh ss4a grant that we received that sounds like it yeah yeah so we  received a grant to do mostly focused on pedestrian uh signal improvements um throughout the city so  we're still waiting on the grant award for that um so we're probably  two years out from really implementing that but we've been engaged with uh the police department  chief aldridge through this process and uh fully support it yeah and there's a couple of those like  um broadway and first is that the pedestrian cyclone goes first caltrans have been installing  them i imagine that would reduce t-bones because you don't have people crossing the intersection  at the same time cars anyway vice mayor bennett so i never pull the microphone forward so i'm going  to do it now i'm going to do it now i'm going to do it now i'm going to do it now i'm going to do it now  i'm going to do it tonight so i want to thank you i had quite a few questions for you my biggest  concern as i said in one of the emails was i was scared to death about the cost i did not know that  it was being going to be guaranteed revenue from them and they were going to pay for everything  which makes a huge difference otherwise i was wondering where is the money going to come from  and i i'm concerned about the cso's you need more people  you can find a place for them so if it ends up that you've got a few extra people  good that's good that's the way it should be and lastly our whole and i'm going to steal  my counselor brian's thunder here our number one goal is public safety and this is public safety  this is going to make a big big difference in chico with all those people that just don't pay  attention for whatever reason and they'll now have to write a check and it probably will hit them  pretty hard at least i hope so  so i think this is great thank you very much for your work and the work of your colleagues  i i'm fully in support thank you so i want to thank if i may real quick i want to thank  councilmember overbeck for really championing this cost thank you for that  and this really is about safety it's not about revenue we need to continue to remember that i  know chief aldridge is not about raising money we know in government we do not produce anything right  we do not produce safety things of that nature we do not produce revenue that's not what we're about  this is about safety and i've said before the three e's if you want to reduce traffic collisions  fatalities it's engineering enforcement and education and this actually this system touches  upon all three so i want to commend again councilmember van overbeck chief aldridge for  coming up with an excellent plan and i am going to strongly support this  effectively effectively effectively effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  the public safety is the  number one concern and we need  to be addressing all angles of  this crisis with as many tools  as we can use. I think most of  you know as a transportation  planner I'  m an advocate for designing  our facilities as safely as  possible proactively by making  sure our infrastructure is not  incentivizing speeding and is  not incentivizing distracted  driving but with our  intersection of the two  solutions that already exist we  need to make sure we can do  whatever we can to get people to  stop speeding and pay attention  and it seems like we ought to  give these red light cameras a  try if they'  re not going to  negatively impact our city  financially or on citizens  privacy which we'  ve covered before. I'  m willing to support this and  see how it goes.  thank you.  thank you.  I would also like to echo my  support of this project largely  because the chief and ferro  mobility have done a substantial  amount of quantitative analysis  saying yes red light cameras do  work we'  ve seen it work before even if  it isn'  t a maintained revenue over time  we'  re still going to be paying the  price for it.  climate and people running red  lights and I know we have some  leeway for sending warnings when  it is a good faith action that  the camera may have picked up  such as running lights through  the red light but at the end of  the day going right on a red  light without stopping is  against the law and will  increase risk of more accidents  so that is something that maybe  we can do.  councilmember vandenberg.  so chief I really thought you  guys did a great job with the  rfp it was very comprehensive I  spent a lot of time on this and  you guys covered every single  point and I also would like to  recognize lieutenant durfee who  I think has taken point in the  department on this project. I  also wanted to address a couple  of things mr. Jones brought up.  I think the rfp is a great  example of how we adopted them  with the idea that they would be  some sort of revenue gushing  machine and sent tickets to  people in an automated way and  didn'  t have anybody actually  reviewing the videos. So what we  found out in researching this is  that the successful systems  reading is a great one because  it'  s a town about our size that'  s close by and I went up there  and spent a day with them and so  they have a set of rules they have  the reason that rolls through  makes the left turn in a red and  rolls through at three miles an  hour they don'  t give them a ticket  because the point of this isn'  t to play gotcha it'  s to keep people from running  into each other at stoplights.  So the chief has hired cso'  s who are human beings who can  review the videos and make sure  in fact that this isn'  t a clear cut violation. So the  police department has a very  clear idea how to do this  successfully and thank you for I  think it'  s been two years since we'  ve been working on this but thank  you.  I would just add if reading made  $400,000 in a year I guess we'  re probably going to make like  six because I think we have some  of the worst drivers around. But  what we'  re dealing with right now is an  absolute crisis of what happened  when we took most of the  traffic to our police department  and we didn'  t have a traffic division for  10ish years, 15 years. So when  drivers get used to the fact that  there are no cops that are going  to give you a ticket they drive  really, really bad. So I hope  that we can Pavlov dog this that  once they find out that they are  going to get a ticket that all of  a sudden people in chico will  wake up and have a lot better  drivers because I would like to  not have one more fatality in our  podemob effectively effectively  effectively effectively effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively Councilmember goldstein?  Thank you.  Thank you.  With that we will take a break.  It will be about 15 minutes.  Five minutes for a break.  We will finish closed session and be back in 15 minutes.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you. [inaudible]  All right.  We are back.  Sorry.  Just a couple seconds over.  But we are.  Anyways.  We will go ahead and start.  Yes, good evening mayor vice mayor and city council members as mentioned at the  February 4th  2025 City Council meeting City Council directed staff  To analyze the feasibility of a one-hour free parking  concept program  within the core downtown parking areas  So tonight I'm going to kind of break this down into three sections  First we're going to start with kind of high-level parking management program objectives. Why do we do these types of things?  then we're going to go into the current operations, and then we'll kind of delve into the  analysis that our staff has performed  So first and foremost parking management objectives  Parking is obviously a huge component of business  patrons to businesses and so in many ways  The core really main objective of parking management strategies  and the  objectives is to support business functions  I've heard the question and so I'll answer it or provide context. So why is downtown the only area that has parking meters?  That's a great question. And one of the main reasons is throughout town as new development occurs or development occurs  Depending on that land use that building or that property is required to provide adequate parking to support that type of land use  in the downtown core when we have this type of concentration density  Of buildings obviously the parcels don't have the footprint  For providing parking individually and so there's kind of a consolidated or concentrated effort to provide  parking so we utilize public private  Different types of parking lots on street parking as the means to provide adequate parking for those types of businesses  so in order to create  Turnover which is the concept of having patrons constantly?  Having availability of parking nearby  Those businesses you'll hear the 85th percentile concept throughout tonight and anyone that talks about parking management  that idea centers around  occupancy of  parking 85th percentile so if you have above 85 percent  Occupancy you want to deploy different strategies to try and get that you know below or around that 85 percent which essentially equates to  one available parking stall per  block face  So there's constant turnover people aren't having to circle the blocks  And you see on the third bullet point kind of add to congestion so by having these strategies  And I'd availability of parking you're reducing that type of traffic congestion so the two main  mechanisms we use  To create that turnover and manage that is through time limitation so you see like the two-hour parking spots  for our 10-hour and so on and then we use rates so  Obviously in our downtown core premium premium area  It's one dollar per hour and in our economy areas outside of that core where we have less occupancy  We we have 50 percent or 50 cents per hour  The other aspect of why we charge also is obviously there's a cost associated with we have  Personnel in multiple departments we have enforcement  Through PD we have the parking management stuff that occurs through the engineering department  And then we have operations and maintenance staff that perform ongoing maintenance of the facilities and infrastructure  So there's a cost associated with the concept is that we want to be cost neutral if nothing else  So that we're recovering the cost to provide that service  So current program operations we have two main  software programs  So for the kiosk and the smart meters we use the IPS technology and then  Obviously we have the passport app and so that's a separate software program  From a capacity standpoint. We have 52 time-restricted saw so those don't have meters and then in our economy zones again 50 cents per hour  We have six parking lots plus the on-street parking areas  That's a total of 865 stalls and then within that premium core zone at one dollar per hour. We have  449 on-street parking stalls  our two parking and four-way parking  but the enforcement officers  utilize license plate reader  technology as a means to  virtually chalk and manage the  enforcement aspect. Here'  s a map of those parking zones  and throughout downtown with  the reddish call it salmon hue  and the reddish color is the  premium zone. The third and  final component I will spend a  little more time on staff  analysis and break this down  into three separate components  first is the revenue analysis  enforcement analysis and then  the occupancy slash customer  experience. First the revenue  this table is revenues by zone  in the downtown area. The  revenue analysis is the revenue  that is allocated to the  to the area. The revenue analysis  is both passports of the pp  column and ips we track those  separately and add those  cumulative together. By zone the  revenues associated with each of  those zones as you can see  highlighted in red in the middle  the area for consideration the  premium downtown zone equates for  43% of our revenue which equates  to just over $350,000 per year.  That is the revenue that we  have in the downtown area for  the holiday season.  So parking revenue as we take a  look at revenue not just on an  annual basis but a bigger  picture how is the program  functioning since 2020 the  parking fund has been operating  in the red and so we have been  relying on reserve funds to  subsidize that essentially and  stay solvent within the  853 parking fund. You will see  In the fiscal year 22 there is a  spike in the revenue it'  s a little  misleading as there was over a  million dollar transfer from  fund 854 which is the parking  reserve fund so it'  s not like the  revenues from meters and such  actually outpace expenses there  is a transfer in from the  reserve fund that year.  So as staff when we look at that  we have concern because we have  the last year and these fund  things again not just our staff  but other infrastructure and  programmatic investments in the  downtown core.  Here you go what does parking  revenue pay for?  We have done annual ada and  pedestrian improvements in  downtown we use those funds for  parking lot rehab we use it to  fund the downtown access plan  portion of it goes to the general  been using for the last year and  the smart meters and kiosk portion  this funds also the maintenance  of Wayne cook alley we have  purchased downtown street barriers  in years past as a safety  protection for thursday night  markets and so on.  Fleet replacement for the staff  associated again parking  management operations and then  future parking structures to  consider.  reserve fund obviously revenues  to cover our costs.  So based on that analysis we  have identified concerns that if  we further reduce the revenues  we are only increasing the  potential or likelihood of going  into the red and needing a  subsidy from another funding  source to cover those ongoing  costs.  The other aspect is it then  limits our future opportunities  general fund to pay for those  types of improvements.  Next is parking enforcement.  We met with our two parking  enforcement officers again they  utilize the license plate reader  technology in our conversations  and coordination with them on  average it is about a one hour  cycle time by the time they make  it back to certain areas.  We have a lot of parking  departments in the area of  valambroja way, enloe, the  mansion park area, valambroja  way where we have other parking  districts and parking management  demands where they get called to  service there. Again they will  stop if they issue a citation  so that time varies greatly  there'  s no real consistency based on  that in terms of the frequency  in which they'  re making it back  through an area using that lpr  technology. What they'  that they use to park a car  and if someone parks it'  s a two  hour zone they'  ll move that car and  essentially they cannot be  cited because they claim they  left and then came back so  there'  s no way to prove otherwise  they simply moved it. For some  of their experiences that  misuse of that system moving  zone to zone or just moving  within the same zone still.  So what we heard from our  podems effectively effectively  Again those are the folks using  the kiosks or smart meters on  average in the premium zone is  just over an hour so about an  hour and 15 minutes. The  passport app users on average  stay about an hour and 25 minutes  and then the economy lots and  zones again longer term stays  typically so you'  re seeing over two to three  hour stays on average in those  areas.  So again the 85th percentile  from that occupancy  consideration one thing we don'  t have is a lot of current data  that we'  re able to capture in terms of  occupancy it'  s a kind of manual process at  this point. But again we utilize  that when we can to implement  different strategies again the  concept of one available parking  space per block face. At 85%  there'  s a lot of data that we'  s enough vacant parking spaces  to minimize congestion from  drivers searching for spaces and  again we use that 85% as a  target. This helps again  maintain accessibility of  parking nearby the businesses  that those patrons are looking  to go to.  So some further insights from  our staff analysis is that free  parking causes downtown areas to  be congested especially in those  areas where you are eliminating  some of those concepts. Which  then leads to typically that  circling of the blocks adding to  that congestion and that traffic.  The likelihood is that with a  free parking concept you would  likely go beyond that 85th  percentile so then you'  re again having to now  implement different strategies.  And then from a software  standpoint the best way to do it  is to have a free parking system !  Passport app has a convenient  way to accommodate a free one  hour parking implementation  however the ips with the kiosks  would be really challenging I  think add further confusion to  users who interface with that I  know we'  ve heard a lot of  concerns from residents on that  and businesses in the downtown  so it would not be a real clean  and easy and efficient way to  navigate that program I think  adding to the frustration of how  to navigate that. As part of this  analysis we'  ve reached out to several  other cities Santa Rosa  Ventura Santa Barbara Paso  Robles my main take away from  this is every city has  different challenges and  different nuances and variables  that factor into their parking  issues and demands and so I  think it'  s important to  understand what our dynamics are  we'  re a smaller rural northern  California city we have the  university here those are some of  our constraints. Some of the  common themes in talking to their  parking personnel was that there  was a severe impact on the  revenues associated with free  parking. Free parking led to  higher occupancy rates and lower  turnover creating challenges for  access to businesses. We have  The enforcement capacity was  enhanced when you try to implement  these types of programs and then  clear communication consideration  was something we heard over and  over again about if you do this  it'  s really important to  communicate and identify the  steps in the process of how it'  s going to  function and work. Then the  complexity of free parking while  it seems simple there'  s a lot of  complexities and nuances to  implementing a program such as  this and those are some of the  common themes we heard from some  of those other agencies.  In summary revenue we see  declining and would have concerns  with the impacts of that. Again  we'  re talking in the tune of  potentially $300,000 to $400,000  lost revenue that would require a  subsidy from a separate source.  Enforcement challenges these are  our two enforcement challenges.  enforcement officers that handle  all of our parking enforcement in  the entire city. Then again the  occupancy and customer experience  impact that we identified. That  concludes my report and I'  m available for any  questions.  council member Winslow.  do you have anything good to say  about the idea?  it'  s hard from an operational  standpoint as a city staff I was  tasked with providing analysis from  an operational standpoint. Based on  that I don'  t see a lot of positive  outcomes from the city perspective.  I know there'  s belief and interest from  businesses in these types of  ventures and we totally support  business we look at ways to always  enhance and provide opportunities  for the city to be able to  to provide opportunities for  businesses to be able to  thrive. I think that'  s been experienced over the  years especially in downtown with  our efforts. This one is just hard  to understand how it would work and  I think cause more confusion and  looking at the fiscal aspects it'  s hard to support from just  purely a fiscal aspect requiring  likely a general fund transfer of  several hundred thousand dollars per  year.  I think that allowing people to  run out and run back in have really  been a challenge for us.  really high turnover short term  usage of parking is really good  but it seems like we don'  t really have a  method of not requiring people to  interact with the kiosk or meter  or something like that and really  you lose a lot of benefits that  way.  We do have these ten minute  spots we had a bunch of them in  front of colliers have we don'  t have colliers anymore.  We added a bunch to corners and I  see that is somewhat addressing the  issue that there is high turnover  short term parking that doesn'  t require any kiosking.  That'  s a good point. We did add a  We had a couple of spots that  required I believe a dozen or so  15 minute free parking.  Strategically throughout downtown  near businesses that require that  type of quick turnover so that  patrons could jump out, go in, get  their coffee or whatever they need  and then go back out without having  to pay at all.  That was one of the strategies as  an initial effort that we looked  at doing to enhance that customer  experience and parking  availability.  council member  colstein.  thanks.  I'  m wondering if you see other  opportunities for better utilizing  our downtown parking or for better  improving and reducing complexity for  the users or for the city?  With that I also wanted to ask how  is our parking during peak hours  because my experience is that people  definitely are parking downtown but I  don'  t know in the  periphery in the non premium zones if  that'  s always the case.  I'  those are great questions.  First I think from our experience  definitely that downtown core premium  zone experiences kind of a higher  occupancy rate.  We definitely see very low occupancy  rates like in the 40s, 50s, 60% in  those peripheral areas and in the lots.  So again we'  ve tried to incentivize that by  having those at lower rates.  So from a to answer your first  question, second, you have a lot of  concerns about the parking  Yes, I think utilizing best  practices in the parking management  world is I think best to do.  So utilizing those time restrictions  and the rates to better disperse the  traffic and the parking throughout the  downtown.  Also that incentivizes employees or  limits employees from wanting to park  in those premium zone areas.  And so those are typically strategies  used to address these types of concerns.  Okay, thanks.  Council member van der  Berk.  So I read the staff report.  By the way I like your earnest suit.  I read the staff report and I was going  to ask you what your grades in math  were in college but my wife said that  would be really rude so I'  m not going to do that.  But I know they were really good  because of what you do for a living.  So you said in the staff report that  it was going to reduce the parking  revenue by 50% and that would be  a little over $100,000.  So we're talking about a little  So we're only talking about the  11 block premium zone, right?  Wall to Salem, first to fourth.  That'  s the only place we'  re talking about one hour free  parking.  Okay.  And that zone generates you said  a little under $350,000 or 43% of  the total.  So if we charge people for we  don'  t charge people for the first hour  but we charge them for the second  hour it seems to me that it would  cut that $350,000 down to $175,000  because the average person parks  there in about an hour and 20  minutes you said and they have to  buy a full hour even if they'  re only parking for 20 minutes.  So the hit is $175,000 it'  s not $300,000 or $400,000.  That was not the intent of the  staff report it was applied to  50% in the staff report 50% of  the parking revenue for the  So.  you'  re telling me  that half of the parking revenue  would be reduced by half if we do  one hour free parking in the  premium zone?  I have no way of specifically  knowing how that'  s going to play out.  d be an estimate.  let me help you.  wait a minute let me correct  one other point.  If you don'  t have to buy an hour you can  buy less than an hour.  you have to buy the first hour  right don'  t you buy this in increments of  an hour it'  s a buck?  no.  okay.  So there'  s $350,000 that comes out of  the premium zone so it can'  t be more than that.  because that would be 100%.  one of the spillover effects  that we would anticipate if you  have free parking and this goes  back to the discussion with the  enforcement officers.  I think that'  s a good question.  I would say that the increase in  misuse or abuse of the system so  employees has always been in  parking in those premium areas  has always been an issue in  downtown for the 10 years plus  I'  ve been here.  so if you have free parking in  the downtown the likelihood of  having employees now parking in  those areas because they'  re free versus 50 cents per  hour in the lots you'  re going to get an increase of  occupancy so you'  re going to increase that  amount and then from the it'  s not clean it'  s not at all !  in that one hour you lose 50%  so as I showed the average stay  is in those premium zones about  an hour and 25 minutes I think  it was.  so if an hour if it was clean  in the best case scenario an  hour out of an hour and 20  minutes would actually be 75%  that would be 60 of 80 minutes.  but from an enforcement  standpoint that cycle time the  reality is that the enforcement  s a big problem and  understanding that they know  they can stay an hour and 15  minutes or an hour and 20 minutes  without getting cited because the  reality is by the time that  enforcement officer virtually  chalks them could be up to an  hour into their park.  right but it'  s an hour cycle like I  drove without all 11 blocks and  it took me a little under seven  minutes right so what seems to  be happening if it'  s taken an hour is  you'  re having these guys drive  the whole the 10 hour zone and  the two hour zone I read a  couple of times and I realize  they have to stop write tickets  sometimes there'  s some other parking  problem but you have two guys  who are two people it looks like  two men and presumably they work  five days a week what is it 9  o'clock to 6 o'clock right so if  you had one guy and given that  43% of the revenue comes from an  11 block area I would think you'  d want to dedicate 43% of their  time I don'  t want to get in the weeds on  this.  effectively effectively  effectively effectively  effectively so I'm just I think you guys have a very strong and obvious bias against this and The overriding question is is this good for business downtown that that's the main consideration and The overriding question is is this good for business downtown that that's the main consideration and !  effectively Hopefully we have some people here from downtown to tell us whether they what they think I I just met with and reported  the parking lot and the parking  I just met with and reported  what the parking enforcement  officers said I don'  t control their  operations.  thank you.  I will throw out to council  member goldstein a better  utilization I was in san diego  last week two weeks ago and they  still have other parklets set up  from covid and they are rocking  it down there.  I would say we turn them on and  have fun.  That'  s not what we'  re talking about tonight.  Do we have speakers?  we do.  We have four.  three minutes each.  the first speaker is audrey  taylor followed by kelly  loessler.  good evening mayor and council.  I want to thank the council for  looking into this for the first  hour and as you already know  parking is the biggest issue for  businesses downtown.  we have done a number of  discussions with businesses and  surveys and parking continues to  be that number one challenging  constraint for businesses  downtown.  also I think the holiday pilot  project that you are talking  about is a great thing.  we had a pilot to find out whether  this worked or not.  it was the first time we did it  and for the businesses it was a  success.  we had more business people come  downtown so that was a great thing.  on behalf of dcba we would support  looking at the free parking,  having the free parking  downtown so we could get more  people to come downtown.  understand the challenges of  implementation that we have  faced.  I think the first thing that  comes to mind is obvious after  reading the staff report there  is a lot of challenges there.  I attended your strategic planning  process and was very happy to  hear that every council person  felt that our beloved downtown  was an asset and something that  we need to protect and that  downtown is made up of businesses.  so whatever we are looking at I  think dcba wants to be at the  table to say what are the options we can have around parking that removes construction and  constraints for our businesses so  we can bring more shoppers  downtown and more visitors  downtown to our businesses.  however we do that, I think this  is a good first step is having  this free parking down there to  encourage people to come downtown.  we want to be there with you to  make sure we have a very private  downtown.  thank you.  thank you.  good evening again.  I'm kelly lesser owner of urban  couture.  I'm here to represent my neighbors  on third street and broadway  that I speak to about this.  the one hour parking, free parking  would be huge to us.  I think you have to kind of take  into consideration some of the  different types of businesses and  how it affects them.  like for example,  the one hour parking  for example, the watchman.  that business they really only  need to run in and change out  like it's for batteries.  the older customers that have the  time pieces.  you have cats meow that's right  next to me that are grandmas and  grandpas and moms that are just  wanting to run in quickly and  then come back out.  so I know that the parking has  affected their business and  they're not going to be able to  I have a little bit of a younger  crowd with what I do and they're  very savvy with their phones and  the apps but it's not like that  for everybody.  so each individual is having  different challenges with that  and I know I hear about it all  day long.  my average customer is probably  about 30 minutes in my store  sometimes it lasts an hour if  it's really you know they're  but on the whole it's like a 30  minute time for me in and out  process.  I know that I have felt it  financially I have heard about  it.  I also think on another thing  regarding the kiosks I think if  people had more you know like  when you work out at the gym and  it has like a step-by-step you  do this and then you do this  motion.  I think that would be a  that are challenged and if there  was something on the kiosk itself  giving a little more step-by-step  I think that would be super  helpful as well.  Listening to you speak about the  different challenges I get that  too.  But again back to downtown we  need our merchants to stay in  business.  And I think that would be a  fabulous olive branch to the  community.  And I think it might be a little  challenging but would love the  opportunity for you to look into  it a little bit further.  You know.  So thank you for your time.  Thank you.  Jesse Horgan followed by  LaDonna Kanegi.  Good evening.  Once again I'm Jesse Horgan I am  the parking services manager for  Chico State University.  I did have very much to add to  the report.  It was very thorough and impressive.  But I did want to provide you with  some information that I think might  be pertinent to the discussion.  So for the university there's  1700 general parking spaces which  are open to hourly parkers.  Those spaces are full by 1030 a.m.  Monday through Thursday.  There are 14,500 full-time equivalent  students.  Of which we have pretty good polling  that say 40% of those bring a car to  campus.  So when you add faculty, staff,  visitors and students, my 1700 parking  spaces have a turnover and need to  accommodate 6,000 cars.  So right now there's significant  spillover into the neighborhoods  around.  Downtown is not included in that  right now because of the  parking space.  Because you have the dollar an hour  parking.  If you were to take away that,  put in free parking, you would have  students competing with your  customers for those parking spaces.  This year we will be upgrading  enforcement to come in line with  the city.  So we'll be adding additional  parking spaces.  And more enforcement, making it  more likely that people need to  pay for parking.  If you were to go towards a free  parking model, you would be  dangling free parking spaces in  front of students who have more  enforcement in the university.  Finally, why do people come  downtown?  It's not for free parking.  I love free parking when it's  available.  It's not why I come downtown.  It's why I come to downtown.  it's a way to make storefronts  be full of businesses.  So there's tons of things you can  do with your existing passport  technology.  You can offer codes to businesses  that they can give their best  customers free parking.  You can have zones where codes  allow employees to park.  You can offer different free  parking options using the  technology rather than making a  vibrant, better investment of  the parking funds into better  infrastructure, improves it for  everyone, businesses, parkers,  the public, everyone.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Our last speaker is LaDonna  Kanegi.  Hi.  Thanks for letting me have a  chance to speak of this.  I think it's important to  make the parking zone bigger so  you don't have to walk to number  one as big as whatever the  largest letter is on there so  they can be seen from several  spaces away.  I think that the making one hour  free downtown, I didn't realize  it was just in the premium zone  too.  That's just like a magnet to park  there.  It's going to make people go from  the economy zones to that free  zone and it's going to make less  turnover and have more parking  congestion, I feel like.  I feel like maybe there's a way  you could do this one hour as an  incentive.  Maybe there's a way you could  have, you can get one hour free  parking if you download the app  to encourage people to do the  Passport app and learn how to do  it.  Once you do it, it's really easy.  You have to use a credit card  and you can get a free hour.  You can get a free hour if you  Is there a way you could give  people the first year on the app  free, a free hour or something or  as an incentive to use the app  and then make that more, make it  so that people have an incentive  to try it and figure out because  it actually does work pretty good.  Maybe having a trial.  From my understanding you would  have to go ahead and sign in with  a free hour.  early just so you have that record.  So I think that data is really  necessary.  I don't know how that works on  the kiosk.  It's probably it sounds like it's  clunkier from what you said,  Brandon.  And then maybe think about  strategically placing the free  hour.  Maybe you only have a few places.  I don't know how that works.  the free parking is free and  you can park anywhere for free  so really old people who are  getting their hearing aid  batteries changed can park  wherever but is there some way  to be it feels like there'  two ways you could do this one  either by place of where you  place the free parking if it'  just in the premium zone I feel  like that'  going to be a mistake because  it'  going to make it a magnet for  everybody and second can be the  method of a way you can  incentivize people to use the  to get the app and use it and  maybe only have a certain time  period or something.  I also think that there was a  mentioning one that'  s enhancing the pedestrian  environment and also more  bicycle parking and parklets and  making it so it'  s more of a destination to come  downtown without your car is  also a really great incentive.  I think I'  m almost out of time.  I think number one I had here  make those signs and I think  make those signs bigger with  the numbers.  thank you.  that'  s it.  thank you.  quick question does the passport  app have the ability to do some  sort of validating type procedure?  one point we looked and I  believe there'  s a capability but we would  have to further explore what the  actual logistics of that would look  I think it would be a little  that done.  I think it would come through.  I know we'  re not san diego I'  m not trying to compare but  everywhere you go down there when you park they'  re like do you park in our parking lot do you need us to  validate you?  if the downtown in the core had the ability to do some because if we do free parking they still have to enter in their information into the kiosk to get the free hour correct?  yes.  that'  s all my questions I'  m sorry I didn'  t mean to go first.  any other council members have comments?  council member goldstein.  I'  ll do my spiel.  I'  m  very  very  very [inaudible]  very Resources as opposed to just big box stores elsewhere in town. So I really agree with that sentiment  very !  I agree with that sentiment I  don'  t think this is the  solution according to the staff  report if implemented the one  hour free parking in this  priority zone could have  significant negative effects  including cutting our revenue  for the parking enterprise fund  in half and that fund is already  underfunded it could reduce  turnover and make it even more  difficult for short term  visitors to find parking  basically defeating the purpose  of this to begin with and it  could increase congestion with  more drivers circulating around  looking for open spaces which  makes the whole downtown less  pleasant. As mentioned the  enterprise fund is already  struggling that fund helps fund  things like making it a better  pedestrian environment and it'  s already hard to find parking  downtown so this hour of free  parking in the most desirable  parking areas isn'  t going to fix  our problem. The other thing I  think we'  re looking at is  approaching this backwards by  at least looking at the premium  zones we should be looking for  ways to incentivize parking in  the lesser used areas like we'  talking about the parking  garages or lots and areas that  are maybe just a couple blocks  from businesses and if we were  talking about ways to lower  prices to incentivize people to  check out those spaces I'  d be  more interested and we could even look into maybe an educational campaign that is going to be a lot of  more interested in  I think that there are probably  spaces in the garage and people  could go right there instead of  circling around just ideas and  I'  m really grateful for the  ideas we heard from our audience  members too and from the mayor  about parklets, bike parking,  walking and biking facilities  and some other really good ideas  about how to make sure that  employees can park in ways that  don'  t impact our downtown  negatively. So beyond the  I think that the !  I think that beyond this I just  think we need to be looking more  broadly at how to get more people to  want to be downtown and to make  sure that people can access  downtown. I really appreciate the  spirit of this again but I can'  t support this specific  proposal.  councilmember holly.  we have to remember that the  number one issue here is the  viability of businesses downtown  it'  s not maximizing the revenue in the parking fund. That'  s point number one.  I think that'  s very effectively That means that we can effectively Charge for that capture the violators  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively And put a one-hour minimum on the add-on after the first hour, right? So that's 350,000 bucks becomes  effectively And put a one-hour minimum on the add-on after the first hour, right? So that's 350,000 bucks becomes  the minimum on the add-on after  the first hour right so that'  s $350,000 becomes  $175,000 so it'  s $175,000 hit so the  question is what is the benefit  to businesses downtown and we  don'  t know we know  it'  s positive because we  got some experience from the  holiday season the holiday  season is always better but  there was a sense that it was  quite good but the other thing  is I mean and I wish I have a  huge amount of respect for Mr.  Odeboni but the staff report  was hugely biased against this  and I'  ll stop there.  I'  m going to jump in if I may.  So I think director Odeboni was  providing us with what we asked  which was the financial impact I  don'  t think necessarily tom it'  s his job to tell us what  we were doing and what we were  and whether we were supporting  downtown or whatever he was  doing his job as far as the  revenue impact if we went to one  hour parking so let me say that  and you made a very compelling  case director Odeboni you really  did but I do agree with council  member van overbeck this is about  our downtown our downtown is in  crisis.  It'  s in crisis and yes this is a  singular issue and we do need a  the problems going on downtown I  agree with you council member  goldstein but we do need to find  those little things that will help  in the meantime yes we have to have  a broad plan we have to look at  this very comprehensively but we  just can'  t ignore downtown when it'  s slowly dying before our very  eyes I was in colliers on  Saturday and no parking did not kill  colliers.  I know that but we cannot have any  little thing that we can do to bring  some relief to those businesses because  we do not have a downtown without  business without a business district  and businesses downtown we do not have  a downtown so we have to figure out a  way again with a broader sense a more  comprehensive sense later on but in  the meantime find some short-term  solutions at least some things that  will help and I think this does that I  think I'  m willing to try it but I  ll have to wait for a while see  where we'  re at but we have to do  something and doing nothing is not  acceptable.  council member holly.  thank you mayor reynolds I would  say it'  s a great thing we got this  agenda it'  s a great thing we got our  department head to provide us with an  excellent feasibility survey but I  think that the evidence is clear both  from the survey and from the  expertise of our university'  about this.  I think I am an expert in this  field that this probably would not  help our local businesses it would hurt  our local businesses I think business  owners need to be in the room every  single time giving their feedback and  what they think the outcomes will be  but that'  s not the entire picture.  So I am not supporting this not  because I'  m not  supporting our local businesses it'  psychological phenomenon that needs to  have special care when making decisions  like this.  So even if it weren'  t economically viable but would be a  solvent parking issue then I would  support it I don'  t think that economic  viability is the only thing to look at  but the factors of not being economically  viable alongside with this would  significantly decrease the  parking turnover.  And also I don'  t think the holiday is a really good  example to pull from because who'  s gone during the holidays?  Students.  Those are what our customers are competing  with.  But with that being said I hope we can  have more ideas agendized.  I hope we can have more ideas brought to  feasibility surveys so we can just get  as many answers as humanly possible and  move forward from here.  Thank you.  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem !  podem  podem  podem  podem  get it over and I imagine maybe  we'  d find ourselves in this  survey that we'  re at this spot  where we'  re not seeing that blocks are  full occupancy above the 85% and  then we can say we want to  incentivize people so we can  remove the need to pay for  parking and then if downtown  does a little better then we  run into that problem again and  I imagine if that was the case  and I don'  t think it is I think  downtown is doing well enough  enough people want to come down  there or at least the university  is doing well enough that we  don'  t have an issue with parking  occupancy. If we did set it up  for a time period and then  things got better and then it  was difficult to park downtown  people didn'  t go because they couldn'  t find a spot  not because it was inconvenient  to pay then we would want to  re-implement paying for parking  and that just sounds really  confusing because I'  m even confused just  kind of like going over this  right now you still have to  check into the kiosk but you get  an hour free and I'  m seeing this out of these  other cities that were surveyed  Paso Roble and I'  that free time creates  confusion this is like a key  take away that they wanted to  emphasize and I'  m worried that that would  be worse and these kiosks have  caused so much confusion we'  re still dealing with it like  a couple of years after they'  re implemented and I think  that probably the right path  for us now is to try to resolve  some of that use some of these  incentives and other ideas even  like the December free parking  if it worked really well and we  have evidence of that and  students weren'  t around then that'  s a thing that we can  continue to do but I don'  t see it making sense in the  long run.  deal and I think it'  s going to bite us in the  butt down the line if we were to  do it.  does it change this  conversation at all if this is a  buy one get one versus first hour  free?  because they have to use the  kiosk and Mr.  Van Oberbeck said you have to  pay for the second hour does that  change the logistics of it?  because I really want to support  this and I want to figure out a  way to get the kiosk free and  I want to figure out a way to get  there on it I'  m just logistically not  understanding how we'  re actually going to be able  to do it with the kiosks and I  don'  t were people complaining  about parking before when we had  the meters is it the fact that  they don'  t want to use I mean we'  ve always  complained about parking I know  that that'  s not what I'  m saying but when you'  re dropping quarters in the  thing right in front of your car  I don'  t remember the dollar amount  being the problem I feel like  the real elephant in the room is  the fact that it'  s not effectively  college mom and grandma's in my store but i don't get as much pushback i do hear everybody hates  the meters i kind of i personally like them for myself i find them very convenient i have the app  i can pay for my chico state student if she's parking over there she calls me i'm like sure  boom it's done honey you're good it's my my other neighbors that you hear too like the cats meow  like the watchmen um those folks you're you're getting pushback on on that and it was more the  meters to be quite honest with you you know but i think that the meters are a good thing too  but it yes that's when all the hubble low you know started was was with those and you touched  on something as far as like what about getting it validated what if the store instead of like the  i don't know how to say it but the i don't know how to say it but the i don't know how to say it  I don't know, did you say that the kiosks have that capability?  Instead of doing like one hour free parking,  what if that customer came into that store  and that store owner validated one free hour?  Wouldn't that kind of take away all this other stuff  that people are concerned about that's causing other issues?  And then it is that customer coming in,  receiving that one hour for patroning an actual business.  That' s just a thought.  You stole my thunder, Kelly.  That' s where I was going next.  No, I' m kidding.  But anyways, yeah, so thank you for answering the question.  I appreciate it.  Mr. Arnavani, I' ll give you.  Yeah, based on, again, the analysis that we' ve seen  and what we' ve observed is the downtown premium area  isn' t the issue that has a higher occupancy rate.  It' s the lack of utilization, actually,  of the peripheral economy zones.  And so doing one hour  for patroning an actual business,  I think that free parking seems kind of counterintuitive  in that core area when that' s there' s not a lot  of availability there.  And I think that was a great point brought up by jesse  is the likelihood is you' re going to see a significant  misuse and abuse of that by students now utilizing that  and not having to pay for it and they' re going to go  to their one class and then they' re going to leave.  And they' re taking up those valuable parking spots  in that premium area that are closest to businesses.  And so I think that' s that was the intent of our staff report  is to highlight those values and then we'  re going to look at those concerns that from our  perspective and what we' ve seen and observed and engaged  on we see that as actually a detriment or a negative impact  to businesses of this type of program that we'  re asked to assess.  maybe this needs a little more work.  I think kind of what I' m hearing everyone say and I hate  to do this again I' m falling on the sword all the time with  internal affairs but maybe this needs to go back to our internal  affairs and really look at this a little more comprehensively  and find some ways to address the issues that we'  I think we' ve had some compromise because I think  these are all valid concerns that people are bringing up.  I don' t think we have a finished product right now and  I think we need to do some fine tuning.  this is about marketing.  people are always complaining about parking downtown.  one hour free parking brings people downtown.  they come downtown and the core area is fully parked up if it'  s after 10.30 or 11 o'clock and then we'  ll be back in the morning.  so what are they going to do?  they' re going to drive a couple blocks to the economy  zone where there is space and they'  re going to park there.  so sure downtown is parked up in that 11 block area in the peak  business hour so it' s about 11 o'clock to 5.30 or so but  they' re still going to be down there and they'  ll end up parking in the economy zone.  the second point I make and I haven'  t talked to you about this Brendan but if we change the  way we deploy and this is a police matter.  change the way we deploy the meter the enforcement so that  they' re concentrated on the core area.  we spend more time in the core area less time in the economy  area and we can they can drive by more quickly it means I don'  t know why we couldn' t do this where we say you don'  t need to deal with the kiosk or the app until you'  re parking for the second hour.  for the first hour you'  ve got a license car with a license a camera and a license  plate reader.  You drive by takes a picture of your license plate and if it'  s there an hour later you get a ticket.  You get a ticket.  I don'  t know why that'  s not feasible but I think there'  s a way to get around using the kiosk for that first hour.  I'  m going to use a line that somebody who used to be up  here for a long time said that we set policy and our staff  operationalizes stuff.  So if what you'  re saying is true and that can be done.  You know that goes back to the message that we  maintenance and I think sending  it back to internal affairs is a  great idea and maybe we can have  sergeant lefkowitz come in and  tell us how he deploys the  traffic division and maintain  that. I talked to him about it  this morning.  I want to continue the  conversation and get this there  if you would make yours a motion  I would second that. I will  make that a motion to send this  issue to internal affairs for  further discussion. I will  second that.  council member goldstein.  aye.  council member holly.  because I don't want to take  any more staff time on this  issue and I want to implore us  to agendize more different  ideas, no.  okay.  council member ross.  council member o'brien.  yes.  council member van overbeck.  yes.  council member winslow.  yes.  vice mayor bennett.  yes.  mayor reynolds.  aye.  carry 6-1.  how long is ground floor  office space going to take?  I think it could go pretty quick.  office space lease.  another idea my esteemed  council member van overbeck sent  off to internal affairs I do  appreciate that. In all  seriousness I think it is an  important conversation again I  just said a few minutes ago  that downtown was in crisis.  Really the purpose of this  particular issue was to  consider alternative appealing  pedestrian zone uses. Brenda is  the first one to speak.  I will take that.  thank you.  in our downtown north area  specifically with the overall  objective of finding compatible  uses for some of our vacant  buildings.  principal planner mike selig  provided an excellent presentation  and options for internal affairs  to consider. I'  m sad to see that mike had  left I was going to compliment  him on his presentation.  the specific discussion center  on whether to allow ground floor  office space in our downtown north  area. After discussing that issue  in IA we voted 3-0 to approve  vice mayor bennis motion with a  friendly amendment to recommend  to the full council to amend the  municipal code to allow ground floor  office space in downtown north for  a period of one year. I will  allow my other colleagues who are  on that particular committee to  chime in and see if I missed any  points.  effectively effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively We don't need to go do code amendments. It's kind of to just Thank you for that clarification. Thank you Brendan. I Think the intention was to leave a lot of discretion towards staff Well, we had said it was a vice mayor Bennett's suggestion to not allow these on Main Street Broadway ! Well, we had said it was a vice mayor Bennett's suggestion to not allow these on Main Street Broadway  I think it'  s a suggestion to  not allow these on main street  broadway just look at the number  streets which is trying to get  less.  I know if you want to chime in  on the intention of that.  We'  re trying to avoid the big  anchor spots become tied up in  office in a way that in the long  run does not create an appealing  pedestrian environment.  to clarify it'  s not administratively  approved it'  s an administrative use  permit.  We still do a notice to the  adjacent property owners  somebody could appeal that  there'  s a process there'  s some findings  made it'  s just a very reduced level  much more reduced cost I think  something around 1600 so there  still is a process it'  s just greatly reduced.  there'  s not the absence of any  barriers anything happening but  we'  re saying we'  ll invite some proposals  for better utilization of  downtown space.  anybody else before we go to  speaker?  I'  m going to ask the  s okay before we go to  speakers?  do we have any speakers?  three minutes.  okay.  kerry welch.  good evening.  kerry welch.  I'  m a commercial real estate  broker and I'  m really appreciated  that you guys are taking a  look at this today.  my request is simple.  I would like to extend it to  more than a year if possible.  I think the administrative  review is a great solution.  I don'  t have a ton of people  flooding down the  street downtown saying hey I'  d like to have an office.  But personally if somebody  comes down to me and says I  would like to be downtown I  want to be like how wide of a  red carpet do you want?  Not that hey it'  s going to cost you 10  grand.  so if maybe we could have  more than a year because a  year flies by it feels like it  was just February.  It is now April 1st and I  would like to be successful and  show you that you can do an  administrative review that we  can keep a robust retail  downtown but also allow office  to allow more pedestrians  less vacancy and all the stuff  that we know is very important.  thank you.  thank you.  all right.  council member van  overack.  I want to thank members of  internal affairs for approving  this for a year and moving it  forward.  the argument against this is  that somehow magically retail  is going to come back.  retail has been in decline  unfortunately for about a year  least a decade and it'  s an important  component in downtown but it'  s going to be a reduced  factor in our downtown  commercial environment. It'  s just a fact of life and it'  s true everywhere it'  s not just chico.  so the question isn'  t do we want office or retail  the question is do we want  vacant buildings or office?  because right now we have a  bunch of vacant buildings and the  other point I would make is that  the problem with the year to  echo ms welch'  s point is it doesn'  t allow for  planning. let'  s say your addison is going to  buy the colliers building and  is sitting down with his  partners trying to figure out  what he'  s going to do and they'  re going to put  office in the ground floor.  well it takes a year just to get  the architect and the various  things these things take a long  time. so a year is nothing. the  council always has the ability  for the district to do that.  and the district decides it  made a wrong decision to undo  it. but when you say we'  re only going to do it for  a year it says a we'  re not really sure we  want to do this and b it sends  a signal to anybody who wants to  buy a building and plan for its  development that they might get  left out hung out to dry. so I  would like to see us approve this  without a time limit with the  understanding we can unwind it  any time we decide to as long as  anybody who has a plan to do it  effectively effectively effectively Honored you know that permit can be honored if it's approved So I'm gonna and I appreciate that Tom. I'm not necessarily opposed it. I would like to hear from our director  effectively effectively effectively  effectively effectively effectively  effectively effectively  effectively  effectively my understanding was in the conversation and when I wasn't in attendance was that  construction of this was there  was a lot of understanding about  the importance of having that  active engaged uses of the  ground floor. This was a little  is there interest and the staff  would come back in a year and  share had we seen anything back  to council at which point it  could be extended. That was how  I understood from mike it wasn'  s interest in that  use again one of the things we  have shared about offices in the  downtown is who wants to do that  it'  s hard for your  employees to park it'  s hard for your clients to come  to you it'  s supposed to be our most active  and engaged pedestrian engaged  retail restaurants bars art  galleries theaters so it wasn'  t a lot of work to do that  extended and I would like that  I would be willing to support  that keep it open ended like you  said tom let'  s have a review  after one year.  council member bennett.  is that a motion?  I will make that a motion.  I will make that a motion.  I would like to have a friendly  amendment which would add that  maybe this is already true  brennan but if you have applied  for office on the ground floor  when the year is up and we decide  not to go forward that the city  would honor that so you could  build that out.  I would agree with that as well  I will accept that friendly  amendment.  thank you that'  s how we function.  you do that anyhow?  correct at this point we'  re talking about a planning  entitlement if you have your  admin use permit it'  s a much shortened  time frame it'  s done administratively there'  s a lot of  get a building permit.  I think the process that takes  longer tom I think you'  re reflecting is getting a  building permit but once you have  your planning permit the building  permit is just perfunctory and  ministerial it'  s not non discretionary.  one further question for you  what would be the process if  somebody were to appeal one of  these they feel like I heard from  a business owner owns a building  effectively effectively effectively  effectively So if she were to appeal if there's a bad proposal for the use of that building, what would be the process? Probably end up right here  effectively  effectively  effectively But um, the notion is there would you know, we we don't do as big of a broadcast for an administrative use permit It's smaller. So it's usually the adjacent knowing down feet 500 feet tonight that no It's literally the adjacent property owners for the admin. That's the reduced costs But the way the downtown works, I'm sure people would know about it But the way the downtown works, I'm sure people would know about it  and the way the downtown works  I' m sure people would know  about it. Again we' re  acknowledging it' s an allowed  use based on the council  direction so they have the  benefit of investment in  something we' ve suggested is  allowed unless there was some  extenuating circumstances it  was somehow couldn' t make  we' d make findings that it'  s a good active use of a vacant  building so it could end up  here like almost anything can  end up here.  anybody has the right to  appeal that' s not just the  adjacent property owners who  were noticed?  they would have to have some  standing.  any other local business if  it was a friendly amendment that  if someone applied for a permit  on the ground floor and the  work is not completed the city  would still honor that permit.  staff indicated that that  happens.  you can include it if it makes  it clear.  who was the second? there wasn' t a second.  councilmember holly?  yes.  councilmember o'brien?  yes.  councilmember van overbeck?  yes.  councilmember winslow?  yes.  vice mayor bennett?  yes.  mayor reynolds?  yes.  carry 7-0.  we' re going to take a quick  break.  come back and finish up.  E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E  that all right we are all here back ready to go and we're alone almost except for evan  um 5.4 eternal affairs committee recommendation tenant protection  um mr or councilmember o'brien are you taking this one i do have that one as well all right so  at our meeting of the march 3rd 2025 the committee received an update on the changes  made to the city's website regarding additional resources for tenants and discussed tenant  protection this discussion was held by the committee it is being noted for the record  that a substitute motion was made by councilmember winslow  to direct staff to research and create an ordinance modeled on the fresno modesto ordinances  to create a rental inspection program that motion failed due to a lack of a second as  mentioned we did have a robust discussion about this and the recommendation to council  on a 3-0 vote was to enhance the education efforts regarding tenant rights on all city  social media platforms websites etc as well as to seek city outreach efforts with community  organizations on these issues  you  thank you for that question.  I will throw in my two cents I believe california has some of the most robust tenant protection  laws in the country new laws are not required but I do agree that getting information to both  tenants and landlords on these laws and protections are beneficial there are bad tenants or bad  landlords I think the majority are good on both sides but getting information in the hands of  both tenants and landlords I think is a beneficial thing and that was our recommendation to full  effectively effectively Yeah, we had a good discussion I mean I appreciate people  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively Entertaining this and this having all this go on I Think that some of the some of the direction there with you making sure that we are Doing our due diligence to make sure that people in our community have access to that information for what laws do exist and protect them There's certainly some philosophical differences among us on the council in regards to what the city's responsibility towards  the council in regards to what the city'  s responsibility towards protecting tenants in these  situations where people are taken advantage of by  landlords and that'  s okay maybe I'  d give a speech about it  but there'  s nobody here so it'  s good that we'  re having some  attention on this.  councilmember van overbeck.  well I'  m a landlord who'  s been taken advantage of by  tenants so you know as councilmember o'  bryan said no literally it goes both ways.  It goes they'  re good and bad people on  both sides and that'  s just humanity  but I do think it'  s a great idea  that we publicize the contacts in the city for tenants that have a  problem that can'  t resolve them with their  landlords and so I support this.  I'  ll just add that sounds great in  the past a lot of people asked me for my help providing  resources of where to go to find legal help things like that  we'  have a lot of information or basic  information about their rights as  tenants and so having things in a  central place for people to access is a great thing for our city to help with.  move to approve.  second.  I don'  t see any  speakers we don'  t have any.  in case there'  s somebody  hanging outside that wanted to speak.  we have a motion and a second.  who has a second?  all right.  councilmember goldstein.  aye.  councilmember holly.  yes.  councilmember o'brien.  yes.  councilmember van overbeck.  yes.  councilmember winslow.  yes.  vice mayor bennett.  yes.  mayor reynolds.  yes.  carry 7-0.  5.5.  councilmember van overbeck's request bidwell park 20-year plan.  councilmember van overbeck.  yes.  I think we all recognize the value of bidwell park to the community.  we have a number of things that we have to do.  we have to do a lot of things moving around.  there'  s a headway transportation  report.  public works has some great projects envisioned.  really this is not a request to ask butte park and playground  commission to supplant or rewrite the 2008 master management plan.  it'  s to add a layer so we can clarify all the things that are on the table when they'  re going to happen so we can deal with budgeting to make them happen.  and mr.  gufson and I had a meeting with addison winslow.  addison was there.  and two members of the butte park and playground commission explained to them what our goal  was and they were on board.  I think that'  s a fair characterization.  so my request is merely that we put this on their agenda to make sure that we have a fair  and let them figure out how they'  re going to deal with it.  which is to generate a 20-year road map incorporating the existing master the bidwell park master  management plan headway report and the things that public works already has teed up.  so that we have a everybody'  s on the same page.  the way I saw it too was more like ranking a list of priorities and giving a list of priorities.  and then the public and the commission involved in deciding out of all these things we can do to improve the park maintain it what are we going to focus on for our funding requests and such.  may I speak?  vice mayor bennett.  we'  re supposed to do that.  and this is just the commission?  you'  re not going to have ad hoc groups and the public and everybody else coming in?  just the commission.  they may decide they want to do some public workshops but I want to hand it to the commission and say what do you want to do?  right now what they do you know what they do they approve permits for salsa dancing contests and mountain bike races and the staff can do that.  so I'  d like them to do something more meaningful and think about what do we want this place to be in 20 years.  bidwell park.  may I ask that they consider also our request to have a partnership between card and the commission?  and the city?  be included in that evaluation as well?  that'  s obviously a major piece of this?  well so this is I'  m nervous about putting another variable into the equation.  and I think if I can ask that we figure out what the relationship is with card and then tackle it with them at that point.  as long as they'  re able to pivot because obviously that'  s going to change those dynamics that'  s perfectly fine but that can change that entire dynamic for sure.  right.  it sounds like those things could land on the same agenda because we already have they'  re going to have that discussion.  Mr.  grifteson can you explain to me maybe a little bit more how you think this might work?  when I was assigning who my park commissioner was I wasn'  t picking somebody that I thought had the you know the  I think the park commissioner was going to be doing a 20 year plan for the park and that feels almost more like a council level discussion and not park.  so I just maybe you can describe a little bit about it.  sure.  yeah.  I think we had a nice robust discussion yesterday.  I think we kind of landed on what we'  re after in the short term is really a project list initiative.  there'  s a lot of items identified in the master management plan but also a lot of items that we'  ve identified as staff.  re going to have a lot of projects that we'  re going to have a lot of projects that we'  want to accomplish in the next 5, 10, 15, 20 years.  most recently there'  s a big infrastructure push with the reconstruction of both south park drive and peterson memorial drive.  we have plans to redesign one mile pool, add some parking features.  there'  s a master plan to bring in new features for caper acres.  so items along those lines that we want to just align, make sure the park commission is aware and prioritizing.  we could add, make a list.  Again, I'  m going to call it a project initiative list.  I think we also want to be cautious on a full-fledged master management plan update.  You know, it took 5 years prior.  A lot of work was done in the early 2000s on that.  I think my colleague on the planning side, Mr.  viegue, was heavily involved in that.  It was completed and approved in 2008.  It had a large component for paragon point but it was hundreds of thousands of dollars.  Again, we'  the project and the cost to do  that. Are there some items or  components of that plan that  need to be revisited and updated  likely and I think we kind of  landed on maybe two parallel  tracks of a short-term and  projects initiative list that we  could all agree on and also  maybe have the park commission  analyze certain sections of the  master management plan over the  course of the next year or year  and a half and determine if that  particular section needs to be  updated and if it does and we  keep that ongoing list and maybe  a year and a half or two years  from now we go forward and  consider a master management  plan update but focused on those  sections that the bidwell park  and playground commission thinks  that need to be updated.  essentially this is bringing a  report back to council of  recommendations that would  ultimately be done and approved  by all of us.  one of my concerns was being  respectful of staff time and  not taking up too much of your  time because I know you'  ve got a  lot to do. Hurry up and get it  done. I want to make sure. Yes  sir?  go ahead. I was going to make  one point but go ahead.  that'  s all I have to say.  as to the talking with card  about taking over some of the  parks such as depot the plaza  comanche creek and the  park and the park and the park  the park and the park and  tigert and ninth and hazel  those are outside of the bidwell  park and playground master plan  or the bidwell park master plan  so just to clarify that.  do we have any speakers?  all right.
