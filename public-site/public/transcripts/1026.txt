 Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Item two, consent agenda. Is there a motion to approve the consent agenda? So moved. Thank you. And is there a second? Second. Great. So we have a motion and a second to approve the consent agenda. All in favor signify by saying aye. Aye. Any opposed? So that passes. Seven zero. Business from the floor. Members of the public may address the commission at this time on any matter not already listed on the agenda. Do we have any business from the floor? All right. Thank you. So item four, public hearing. We'll start with item 4.1. And is there any ex parte communication? To my left? Nope. And to my right? Nope. And I have none. Thank you. So I'll turn it over to Madison Driscoll. Thank you, members here and commissioners. This is a proposal to provide an 11.4 acre site in two parcels for residential development. The site is located on the north side of the Oak Drive, south of Deer Creek Highway, The site is identified as medium density residential on the general planned land use diagram and his own R2S with an SD2 overlay. So medium density residential with a Humboldt Road foothill overlay zone. Currently, the site is a vacant parcel. There are several rock piles along the eastern portion of the site and there are no existing trees on the parcel. The site is part of the Oak Valley Master Plan that was approved on September 20, 2005. The project was subsequently approved for a more precise planned development permit approval and approved on June 18, 2020 for 204 residential units. The current subdivision proposal would facilitate the phased development of this project. The project would be a separate project for separate financing. The proposed project would subdivide the parcel the property into two parcels. Parcel 1 would be 8.66 acres with 156 units and parcel 2 would be 2.48 acres in size with 48 units. The project would yield a residential density of 18 dwelling units per acre for parcel 1 and 19.35 dwelling units per acre for parcel 2. Both are part of the project. 2 is a 2 r 2 r 2 r 2 r 2 r 2 r 2 r 2 r 2 r 2 r 2 r 2 r 2 r 2 r 2 r 2 r 2 r 2 r 2 r 2 r 2 r 2 r 2 r 2 r 2 r 2 r 2 r 2 r 2 r 2 r 2 r 2 r 2 r 2 r 2 r 2 r 2 r 2 r 2 r 2 r 2 r 2 r 2 r 2 r 2 r 2 r 2 r 2 r 2 r 2 r 2 r 2 r 2 r 2 r 2 r 2 r 2 r 2 r 2 r 2 r 2 r 2 r 2 r 2 r 2 r 2 r 2 r 2 r 2 r 2 r 2 r 2 r 2 r 2 r 2 r 2 r 2 r 2 r 2 r 2 r 2 r 2 r 2 r 2 r 2 r 2 r 2 r 2 r 2 r 2 r 2 r 2 r 2 r 2 r 2 r 2 r 2 r 2 r 2 r 2 r 2 r 2 r 2 r 2 r 2 r 2 r 2 r 2 r 2 r resolution number 21-08, approving the parcel map subject to the attached conditions. That concludes my report, and I'm happy to answer any questions you may have. Are there any questions? Start to my left. Great. I think I have one question, but it might be a MAC question. And I understand what the units that would be with this is probably doesn't trigger this, but are there any plans on Yosemite? That's just a term right now to get onto Yosemite from 32. But we're looking at that being a lot of developed area. What would we do there as far as? They have all their permits in place and are going to start on a traffic signal. Perfect. It's been overdue, but they're finally getting around to do that. Okay. That's exactly what I was looking for. Thank you. And then there's another project that would be down on Bruce Road at the entrance to Native Oak Drive. Currently, it's just one lane in each direction down there. So we need to build some left turnpockets to try to avoid rear end collisions. And then the third project that they're going to work on is connecting from the roundabout at Yosemite and Native Oak Drive, continuing that over and connect to Humboldt. So they finally have all the permitting for the bridge. And then they're going to have to build a new road bridge. But whether they undertake construction during the winter in that dead horse slew, probably questionable, but we'll wait and see. Great. Thanks, Matt. So we will open the public hearing and we will begin with the applicant. Sorry. I'm the engineer on the project, Josh Glander. If you're not already a r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r that we have don't include any schematics, any, what am I trying to say? What's the term? Construction documents? Yeah, site land, not site land, I apologize. Renderings. Renderings and some of the facade and things like that. There's a term for that, but I'm blanking on right now. And I'm just curious where the project is in terms of that kind of work. Is that still forthcoming or do you know what approximately things are gonna look like? Yep, Madam Chair, I'd be happy to provide any answer to that. In hindsight, we probably should have included the previous staff report, but the Planning Commission approved the plan development permit approval for this. And that included the architecture and everything else. And that we just did that in 2020. That was a year or so ago, right? Yeah. Okay. Yeah. So it was an affordable housing project with a density bonus. And it was a plan development permit approval. So that's the highest level that comes before the Planning Commission. Got it. Okay. Thank you. Appreciate it. Thanks, Bruce. Any other questions? Okay. Thank you. We'll have you come back up if anybody from the public comments and you want to rebut anything. Is there any future, any additional public comment? Not at this time. Thank you. So with that, we will close the public hearing and bring it back to the Commission. I have two questions for staff and it's not necessarily specific to this project. And I understand where we are in the process with this project, but I noted a couple of comments that I'm just curious, Madison or Bruce, what the thinking is on this. So one under the environmental finding and the staff report, as I recall, and as this certainly indicates, that the EIR was done in 2005, and the staff report says no new significant environmental effects or increases have been identified. And just in terms of the process that staff goes through and the thinking, certainly we've seen an awful lot of change since 2005 and in 16 years in terms of climate change impacts and droughts. and two major fires, one of which came down the ridge. So I'm curious whether, again, what the thinking was there with that statement that really no change has occurred since 2005, because that doesn't quite sound right to me. Yeah, that's a good question. What we look at is there's actually several findings we need to, and that's one of them. Have there been any substantial changes, any new impacts identified, any new mitigations identified that reduce or eliminate the impacts? And we look carefully at how this project was originally approved. And so it was a master plan area that was approved for ambient development, which meant that the rest of the general plan and all the other areas around it were ultimately to be built out in the way that they have been. So it's an extension of the general plan in a master plan community like this. And we looked carefully to see if there are any changes, any discernible changes from what was originally approved to how they were undertaking this project today. And there weren't any significant changes. And the environmental documentation was still adequate, in our opinion. And that's in part based on this being part of a larger expectation or set of plans that will include other developments. That's right. And all these improvements that are part and parcel to the project, and let's get all these road ramps, all these other improvements, all these other things have been taking place out there. A lot of this, like Matt mentioned, the signal's part of the project, too. So a lot of these other things have been built in this up to now to help implement and support the project. Okay. And I think my other is really just a comment, and it's more just for my own edification as well as anybody who might be observing and wondering. There are a couple of places, again, under, under, it's this project adherence or being in comport with the general plan, which mentioned infill. There are two or three, three, I think, places that talk about infill. And I think to some people, this project might, this specific project might be a stretch to define as infill, given its location. I think a lot of people think of infill in a fairly different way than, you know, pretty far out at the edge of town. I, so, so that's, and I kind of, I think that's a very interesting observation. And if there is any clarification that you want to provide, great. If not, I, I would understand. And I think part of what you just explained, again, as most of us know, this being part of, of larger planning in that area at some point, it probably does actually look more like infill than it might right now. But is there anything more to add in terms of how we define infill? No, I think the development of the staff report was informed by the plan development permit approval, the previous one, and those findings that were adopted, when that project was approved, included those same findings. So that's probably what informed this one to the, to the degree that it is. Because as I indicated before, the details of the build out of this down to the architecture, the amenities, all of that stuff was included in the original approval. Firstly, in the master plan area, and secondly, in the more precise plan development permit approval. Okay, good. Thank you very much. Thanks. Those are great questions. Any questions to my right? One question. I was wondering if you could elaborate a little more on the history of the master plan and the, I forget what was it called, transfer of density, which allows development of a slightly higher unit count. This has a long and messy history, and there's a box on my desk in my office, and there's, it's been the topic of a lot of questions in that direction. But suffice it to say, when this project was approved by the council in 2005, they pretty much shifted most of the development to the easterly side of the property, which was flatter in the westerly, excuse me, to the westerly side of the property. And the easterly side of the property was a little bit more hilly. So that's how the kind of, the master plan in it, that's how they, they said the whole, we're going to put a blanket over the whole project, and we're going to shift all the density towards the west end of this, where it was more suitable for development because it was flatter, and avoid the hilly, more environmentally sensitive areas to the west. That's how the whole master plan performed and was approved. So that's kind of a long explanation for how they shifted all these densities to this end. As part of the entire approval of the Oak Valley master plan. I think that's a great explanation. Thank you. Thanks. Any further questions? Motions? I'll make a motion to move to the Planning Commission to adopt Resolution 21-08, approving the partial map subject to the attached conditions. I will second that. Great. So we have a motion and a second. I'll make a motion to move to the Planning Commission to adopt Resolution 21-08, approving the parcel map subject to the attached conditions. Is there any further discussion? All in favor signify by saying aye. Aye. Any opposed? So that motion carries 7-0. We will move to Item 5, Regular Agenda. We have none. Item 6, Reports and Communications. Bruce. Yeah. I overheard Matt indicating that they submitted the administrative draft of the specific plan document. And it's staff's job to work to scrub through that before. And so this is a kind of a pre-stage before it's even, so to speak, a project. Because we're just trying to make sure we can understand their approach and just make sure that the thing conforms to the standards. And it's in a digestible, packageable format. And so the internal review process involves engineering, police, fire, all these other folks. We're kind of scrubbing through it. Once we go through that process, it'll go back to the applicant and they'll interpret whatever they're going to do. And then once after that, then we will have a public review draft of the specific plan document for the Barbara area neighborhood. Yeah. So for the, for Barbara Yard, excuse me, the Barbara Yard specific plan. Great. Thank you. And then will we have a meeting on Thursday, December 16th? No. No. Okay. All right. So we won't see you before Christmas. Yes, ma'am. Okay. Happy holidays. We will adjourn to our next meeting the first week of January. Good. Good. Thank you, Robin. Thank you, Robin. Thank you, Robin. Thank you, Robin. Thank you, Robin. Thank you, Robin. Thank you, Robin. Thank you, Robin. Thank you, Robin.
