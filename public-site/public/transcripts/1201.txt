 Okay, it's six o'clock, so I'm going to go ahead and call to order the City of Chico's  Bidwell Park and Playground Commission regular meeting.  It's December 16th, 2024, and we'll do our roll call.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Commissioner Alexander?  Commissioner Blashley?  Absent.  Commissioner Glatz?  Here.  Commissioner Shadley?  Here.  Commissioner Scheer?  Here.  Vice Chair Nava?  Here.  And Chair Thomas-Petty?  Here.  Thank you.  Item two on our agenda is the consent agenda.  All matters listed under the consent agenda are to be considered routine and enacted by  one motion.  Do we need to?  Do we need to pull any of the items on the consent agenda for discussion?  No, but I'll be abstaining from 2.1, as I was not present.  Okay.  I'll make a motion to approve the minutes.  I'll second that.  And 2.3.  I mean, the whole thing, 2.1 and 2.2, sorry.  And 2.3.  So there's a motion to approve the entire consent agenda with a second.  Correct.  And then second by Commissioner Scheer.  So because there's an abstention on the one, should we take these separately just in case  for that so that Nava could vote on 2.2 also?  Sure.  Just because of the minute part of it.  So.  Okay.

I appreciate it.  I had talked to my friend Tom because he's a member of the board.  Because of the time, I wasn't able to talk to him on time.  Because of the time, I wasn't able to talk to him on time.  Because of the time, I wasn't able to talk to him on time.  Because of the time, I wasn't able to talk to him on time.

Because of the time, I wasn't able to talk to him on time.  Because of the time, I wasn't able to talk to him on time.  the park and have a holistic  approach to addressing it.  There are plans out there but we  see opportunities coming up.  And share the belief that the  parks and playgrounds commission  should have a large role in that.  There hasn't been in the recent  past and I will note I did not  support something the council did  we removed the ability of  commissions to agenda their own  items and something like that is  important and maybe we are in a  period where we can reevaluate  that but I wanted to say on  behalf of myself Tom is well but  not well enough to make it  tonight that we would like to  have the conversations with you  so those of you who I don't know  I would ask if you want to reach  out and we can talk about the  things that can happen between  the council and the commission  and what the future of the park  is going to be.  I met recently the author of  this book Paul belt and he is  He noted to me it is the 120th  anniversary of the park this  coming year and had hope to hold  a sort of event to commemorate  that as there was with the 100th  anniversary and I am hopeful the  city might be a sponsor of such  an event if an organization does  pick that up and run with it.  There is a lot of exciting things  on the horizon and we want to be  able to do that.  Thank you council member  Winslow.  Thank you for being here we  appreciate it.  Could we ask questions or comments  of council member?  Does anyone have a comment or  question?  No comment just say thank you.  Just thank you for we haven't had  a council member here in a positive  way in quite a while so thank you  for showing up.  I have a question.  I know you are  going to be a part of the  discussion on the park circulatory  pattern and all that because I know  it came to us and then it kind of  bounced out back to you guys and  it hasn't necessarily bounced back  and so I am just wondering if that  would be one of the priorities that  you are willing to be part of that  discussion?  Yes, so we know that south park  drive, peterson memorial drive and  vallon brogier are scheduled to be  redone in the coming years. That is  We have a plan that is  being put in place that is with  measure 8 funds I think in the order  of peterson memorial then south park  and then vallon brogier. Eric can  tell you more about where exactly that  agenda item is. We anticipate it  coming back about now and it seems  like there will be a staff report  prepared for us to discuss that in the  near future.  I think time has gone by rather  quickly to have discussions with  council member van der vebeck last  about the north park drive and  peterson. I was under the impression  that that was the direction for  staff was to consider that, look at  refresh ourselves with a headway  report from 2023 and then bring some  items back for discussion and council  consideration. We looked a little  further at the minutes from that  particular meeting.  Clear that, I apologize.  I was going to go forward with that  but then bring back some items  six months later. There is a  second by council member morgan to  bring back how that was going six  months later.  We had a good discussion at the  staffing level on this and the intent  is to  next year peterson drive is  scheduled to be fully reconstructed  in the summer of 2025.  South park drive is in the design  phase now.  The intent is to let the industry  engineering department move that  design a little further along and  then bring that back to the commission  for consideration on some of the design  options. I know they have established a  working group now that is going to  start meeting a working group of  stakeholders that will have some input  as well. The intent is to in the  coming months to bring that design  back as it gets a little further along  to the commission, discuss some options  for vehicular closures. I think that  some of those concerns at least on  south park drive will probably be  solved by the design because as you  recall when we had that meeting on  site a while ago the intent is to  separate vehicular traffic from  pedestrians from one mile to caper  acres and then reconfigure the caper  acres exit. So I think there will be  some design considerations there that  might solve a lot of those problems.  At any rate the intent is to bring  that back to the commission level and  council member van overbeck also agreed  with this process and then have the  commission make some recommendations to  council to give engineering department  some final direction on how to tidy  up the design before we go out to bid  for construction.  I appreciate you bringing up some of  the latter part of what you just stated  because I know there were other elements  of it not just repaving that were a  part of that plan. Thank you and thank  you very much council member  Winslow I appreciate it.  I really would encourage you when  looking at that the one design of south  park drive to think about the holistic  view of all the streets around here.  We can really change a lot of things or we can keep it all the same.  I can speak to that also  I did send that headway transportation  report to council member van  overbeck last friday actually.  He and I have had a line of  communication open.  I sent him our recommendations from  the April minutes.  I think those were and we did meet  again in may but we didn'  t vote on any recommendations  May of 2023.  He has that report I can send it to you.  I have seen the report.  I am glad you all have got it then.  We had it and we had  the two  representatives come and present the  report to us at our April 2023  meeting.  We made our recommendations.  That'  s what we do here.  They came and presented the report to us.  We asked the firm who made the report  we asked them questions directly.  We have a lot of  recommendations.  We made our recommendations based on  the written report and the presentation.  Then we met in the next month in  lower park to walk it with  Eric was there.  I'  m not sure who else from city staff.  Brandon was there.  We had our meeting down there.  It was so great to be down there  and put some of these  take these ideas and  visualize them in the park.  That'  s great.  I sent those things to council  member van overbeck.  It'  s great that we'  re talking about  there seems to be a lack of  communication between not just  this commission but all the  commissions and council.  We make recommendations other  commissions do and then they go up in  smoke.  I'  m not sure.  s a very  Because I think  Because I think  Because I think  Because I think  Because I think or sometimes two months for minutes. I mean, we don't meet every month if we don't have pressing matters.  Because I think  Because I think  Because I think if we don't have pressing matters. So some of the stuffs can be outdated by the time it even gets to you. I fully concur. I think there are conversations that happen here that don't reach us, or maybe it's in the fine print of a staff report,  the staff report but often  doesn' t make it and you'  ll notice there'  s no press  here so it is on us to make sure  that communication is happening  it'  s not going to be done by the  enterprise record or anybody  else.  that'  s by no fault of your own in  my opinion you have so much to  do so much to read so much to  prepare for your meetings so my  thought and my theory has always  been to make your job easier to  make staff'  s job easier by  delegating to us whatever we can  do to make your job easier and to  make sure you'  re better informed and can  do your job better that'  s our purpose I think one  of our purposes so again thank  you for being here we appreciate  it means a lot come back sometimes  we have more pressing agenda but  we do have a really cool project  that'  s coming up here you might  want to stay and hear about that.  I imagine you don'  t take too long in  meetings.  we don'  t it'  s not a  city council meeting that'  s why it'  s also great for community  members to come here because it'  s more welcoming it'  s more relaxed than council  meetings.  so anyway.  thank you.  anybody else have a question?  just a quick question for  eric I guess so to simplify that  original closing of peterson so  that'  s kind of on hold until it  comes back to here and then as  part of this whole thing?  correct yes as it stands now  peterson is just going to be  fully reconstructed as it sits  in its current footprint.  that'  we have a lot of  construction to do.  so we would like to I think  it'  s prudent to let that south park  design move a little further on  and I'  ll step back for a minute  too.  staff bear some responsibility  we'  ve a very busy construction  year the largest construction  season yet in city chico'  s history which is a fantastic  component and thing to have.  the redesign of south park drive  also is triggering some  environmental permitting as well  which really takes some time.  so it'  s been in a holding pattern  for a bit and we'  ve likely should have  brought some updates to you  just to let you know what the  current status is and we intend  to do that very soon.  so yeah I think it'  s going to be prudent to let  that design further along.  we get it to a 60% 75% design  bring it back to you to talk  about and make recommendations  and consider the vehicular  closure item.  if there'  s an appetite to close  peterson drive vehicles as  well then I think it'  d be best to talk about it at  that time and do it all at  once versus you know segmented  or hodgepodge one or the other  that type of thing.  thank you.  there was some discussion  about including a commission  member on the working group but  we wanted to wait until there'  s a new commission sat.  so I don'  t know if that'  s going to be too late  or you'  re already going to be in the  process.  I don'  t think they'  ve even scheduled a  meeting yet so I think there'  e still a possibility you  could do that in january.  okay cool.  okay anybody else have a  question or a comment on this?  no?  thank you.  thank you.  any other public comments?  no.  okay.  number five is public hearings  we have none.  number six our regular agenda  6.1 consideration of an eagle  scout project to improve trail  signage in upper bidwell park.  and we will hear are we going  to hear from shane first or  mr.  forte first?  just a little bit of an  introduction.  we will be hearing from  so mr.  forte he approached the parks  division and said that he had  this idea for his eagle scout  project to improve the signage  in upper park and presented some  ideas.  he has full support of the chico  composite mountain bike team,  chico velo trail works and his  ideas are fantastic.  there was some damage done to  signage up there through the  park fire and even before that  that'  s signage in upper park  fire.  i think it wasn'  t dead dead dead dead dead  They worked out for everybody.  All right, Jordan.  It's all yours.  Thanks, Shane.  All right.  My name is Jordan Forte, for those of you that don't know me.  And I'm here to speak to you guys about my Eagle project, which is implementing and creating new signs in Upper Park in Chico, California.  All right.  So we need new, more consistent trail signs.  The current trail signs in Upper Park in Chico are outdated, and some of which are damaged or difficult to view because of plants or vandalism of sorts.  And some have also been removed from the fire.  As you can see on screen, here's two examples, one of which is wooden and can be burnt, and the other one has little information.  All signs can use an upgrade.  All right.  So our park has many trails, and therefore many opportunities for new and improved signage that can have more organized information, and that more organized information will equal less confusion in the park.  Once we have added these new trail signs, we will need a new way to view them.  And therefore, we will update the current kiosks and add a new one.  These new, more informative signs will have mileage, trail names, and number junctions.  At the Green Gate parking lot and NEB Trailhead, we will add new kiosks, as well as updating the Monkey Face and Northam kiosks and making them new and more informative.  We do this to encourage more visitors in our park.  Here are some examples of current trail signs, which are damaged and or difficult to view.  Some of them have little information on them, which can be improved.  Less confusion equals more information and increased education.  Here are some more examples, which are difficult to view, some of which are faded and others are oriented in the wrong direction.  Some examples of new signage would be trail names and mileage.  And the metal placard in the bottom left-hand corner, which says hiking trail on it, would be a great way to get more information on that small space that we do have.  And on the right side, you can see my new trail sign.  This is a design concept, which would include the current trail, the next trail, and the mileage to the next trail, as well as a number junction and the original decals on the original signposts.  Some examples of kiosks would be the current kiosks that we have, which are one big map that has been slid in there, which is just a piece of paper.  And then the new kiosks on the right, which on the bottom right-hand corner, you can see some examples from New Hampshire.  I thought that showed a lot of information and were very helpful.  And then on the top right, here's an example.  It's not full, but it is one of my examples that I came up with, with the original warnings on the signs, as well as the junction number and upper park map.  All right.  With approximately 50 signposts to update, as well as two kiosks to add and two to update, who's going to do all this work?  From the help with Troop 1555 and North State Composite Mountain Biking, we can improve the trail signs.  Thank you.  The materials can be donated or fundraised with the help of the Chico Parks Division, you guys.  The partners will be Chico Velo Trail Works, the City of Chico, and you, as well as other sponsors.  My milestones are that December through January of 24-25, I would like to get approval from you to implement and put out signage.  And in winter of 2025, I want to collect materials and start to put together the signage.  And in spring, I want to put together times and build signage and construct.  The full pieces to be input.  And then in summer and fall of 2025, I want to implement and put out the signage in Upper Park.  Are you guys ready for new signage and kiosks in Upper Park?  Make Upper Park even better by supporting my Eagle project and making new informative signs and trail kiosks.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I must go ahead.  I will preface this with I have known this kid since kindergarten and his family.  I think this is absolutely fabulous and ambitious and much needed.  It'  s almost like you have been to one of our meetings before because we have been talking about signage in all of Bidwell Park.  This is just fabulous.  I'  m not supposed to speak first as the chairperson but I just wanted to preface this whole thing by saying that I know this young man.  I'  m really impressed and proud of you.  I think this is great.  Does anyone have comments or questions for Jordan?  And Jeanette?  kudos again.  Ditto to what the chair said.  The Eagle project is amazing in and of itself.  Thank you.  You give me hope for the world.  Thank you for that.  I just had a question.  I know I'  ve gotten lost up there.  Me and my girlfriends I think I know this trail.  Let'  s go this way.  I think your idea is right.  t know if I'  m going to be able to get to the top of this.  I'  m just wondering is there a way I know it takes work and I don'  t know what'  s involved like a qr code that somebody could download the map and then zoom into where they'  re going?  Then another thought is you get hurt up there?  What'  s the cell availability?  Just like maybe yes there'  e widespread cell coverage or it might be limited to a certain spot.  I'  m just thinking public safety wise I think we have really good coverage up there but I don'  t know what the fire has done to that.  Those are the things I'  I think those are just a couple of thoughts I had but again kudos and thanks for being a bright light.  Thank you.  Vice chair Nauva.  First off I also would like to echo what they have said and said young man if I could hire you at my work we have a bunch of project managers that could learn something because that was fantastic.  Good job.  Love the milestones love all of that.  I love the qr code idea.  s a great idea because a lot of us use that and that is very informative.  I think the signage was a fantastic idea so I'  d love to figure out how we can lean in.  Thank you.  thank you for stepping up and doing this I never got all the way to eagle.  I appreciate you taking the extra step and this is a wonderful project.  Thank you.  The next question would be just to make sure we have a question from the audience.  Because I think it wasn' that he's funded, and I think that's not a problem, and Eric Shaken has said yes, so I think you're good to go, as long as these guys kind of approve the final look of everything. the final look of everything. Thank you. Thank you very much. And I think if, I don't know how this would work, And I think if, I don't know how this would work, but if you open this up to the community, that funding probably, private funding would come in too. I'm not sure what your plans are as far as that goes.  that goes.  I have talked to a couple  businesses in Chico and I have  felt support from them and I have  had offers.  It seems like something that  people would really jump on board  and want to donate to.  I would assume  that through the process you' ll come and update  us on what' s happening  maybe give us some  preliminaries when you do have  signed designs.  I do think the QR  code is where we' re  at right now.  That would be a good thing to add.  This is an  action item, isn' t it?  On the funding, I' m  hoping we don' t have to wait for  donations. I' m hoping the city can just  take care of this. If we get  donations, we can help.  We also have a  donation.  We have donation accounts  already that have funds in them  as well. Trails is one of them  and some of the other park  improvements. We can look at  what' s already in our donation  accounts as well as our operating  budget.  I don' t want to slow it down  for any reason.  Sorry, I do have a follow-up  if that' s okay.  What would be helpful then is  once you do get some of that, if  we could have the skinny sign  posts included and the quite  large ones, to have an  approximate amount of money.  price ranges because I know some  groups to and I would love to  try to promote that and say,  adopt this. People love doing  things like that. That would be  helpful. That will be the first  question asked. Thank you.  I do see one. I don' t think  this is a problem but let' s say  this project goes through, we  have all these new amazing,  the park.  we have a lot of  we have no up-to-date brand  news shiny signage. I think we  need to make sure it'  something we can duplicate in  lower park we can have some  consistency throughout the park  that'  s just another  consideration.  maybe for staff to  so we have funding to  duplicate this in lower park.  we work through a company  called rock art that we get our  signage through that'  s very consistent  whatever signage we end up  whatever design will probably be  ordered through them so they  keep a file of all that stuff so  we can duplicate whatever we do  up there so it'  s consistent.  thank you.  thank you.  thank you.  sorry but again as a follow-up  the circulatory pattern study  did have references to way finder  signage and other things so I  really would like to make sure  that we'  re cross checking and if we  go down a different path with  the report for this that we'  re just keeping  mindful of what came up there  and if there were any  recommendations tied to that we  examine it maybe now it would  not be appropriate any longer  because we'  thank you.  any other comments or questions  for jordan?  this is an action item.  I will make a motion that we  approve the project.  I will make a motion they can  approve the project.  I second.  thank you very much.  thank you.  Mr. Gasman? Commissioner Glatz.  Commissioner Shadley. Yes. Commissioner Shear. Yes. Vice Chair Nava.  Mr Gasman?  Mr Gasman?  Mr Gasman?  Mr Gasman?  Mr Gasman?  Mr Gasman?  Mr Gasman?  Mr Gasman?  Mr Gasman?  Mr Gasman?  Mr Gasman?  Mr Gasman?  Mr Gasman?  Mr Gasman?  Mr Gasman?  Mr Gasman?  Mr Gasman?  Mr Gasman?  Mr Gasman?  thank you.  thank you.  we are now on item 6.2 of our  regular agenda consideration of  a heritage tree application for  an american elm at the historic  and low mansion located at 488  east third street. We will  consider an application from the  owners of the historic and low  mansion to designate 120 foot  tall 87 inch diameter american  elm as a heritage tree. The tree  was purportedly planted by john  bidwell and is one of the last  surviving bidwell elms. We will  hear from richie bamlett our  urban forester.  good evening chair thomas  petty vice chair narva  commissioners. As you mentioned  this evening we have a  presentation for the historic  and low mansion. We are  considering an application for  consideration of an american  elm. The new inductee to our  very exclusive club of heritage  trees in the city of chico.  So I do have a few, I have put  some of the photographs that are  in the agenda packet just for  the benefit of everybody else.  And a few more photographs as  well. So I just thought I would  start with the main passage of  chapter 16.68. Which was put on  the books in the city of chico in  2010 I believe.  So I will read this out.  The purpose and intent of the  voluntary heritage tree program  is to identify, promote public  awareness of, maintain and  protect designated trees within  the city of chico. This program  acknowledges that heritage trees  whether located on public or  private property are distinct  and unique living resources of  the city of chico.  So I will read this out.  And just a few photographs.  The photograph on the left was  taken last week. So that's the  winter photograph of the tree  that's in the center of the  photograph. And then again on  the right hand side that was  taken in the summer.  I'll go back to that photo.  And here's another photo from  the side view of the house.  And then I pulled this photo  from the CRMLS and this shows  the house that we're in.  And this is the house and the  grounds of the tree.  Where the tree is situated.  You'll see the tree is on the  right hand side. So it is worth  mentioning that the house is on  the agenda of tomorrow night's  city council meeting.  And that is to have that house  considered to be inducted into  the local historic list for the  city of chico.  Because this tree, this house  is known as the Enloe mansion.  So I believe it was built in  the year that it was first  lived in by Dr. Enloe.  So there is some history there  for sure.  But going back to the tree,  really these photographs really  don't do justice how massive  this tree is.  So you see on the left hand  side there is a small  range finder  which is what we use to measure  trees. That yellow object that's  at the base of the tree.  So just for scale that yellow  range finder is five inches  wide. So you can kind of see  how massive that trunk is.  You know it's just  pretty big.  So  and of course we have the  very cute and cuddly raccoon  because when we did assess the  tree we saw that there was a  snag. And usually we would remove  those. So when I asked the arborist  Scott Wineland why did  you leave that snag? Well  they produced this photograph and  it's very clear why  they left the snag. So there is a  family of raccoons that do  take up residence in the tree.  So  I just want to go back to that  map. It was out of  sequence. So this is the  current map of heritage trees  in the city of Chico. Currently  there are only eight trees  that have heritage status.  And if you look at the  bottom right of  the map, near the  Annie's Glen, 67 inch  valley oak, that little  red dot to the right,  that is the location of this  new tree.  So it's literally within a stone's throw distance  of the valley oak in Annie's  Glen. So I guess there's  something in the water in that part of town  that there's really good dirt,  excellent irrigation, and trees  get massive in  that part of town.  So  going back to the  map,  this is the  map of the  area of  the !  So this is  the  map of  the  area of  the  valley oak.  And here you can see the !  This is the  map of the  valley oak.  And here you can see  the  valley oak.  And here you can see  the  valley oak.  the  the botany department in San Luis Obispo.  We did reach out to the botany professor there,  Professor Matt Ritter,  and we showed him the findings of this tree,  and he agreed that, yeah, we need to put the application in  because this tree is a champion.  So that's pretty cool for everybody.  So my final recommendation,  the urban forest manager recommends the Bidwell Park and Playground Commission  approve the application for heritage tree status for the American Elm,  located at 488 East 3rd Street,  and recommends City Council approval of the designation.  And that concludes my short presentation.  I'll be happy to take any questions the commission might have.  Does anyone have a question or a comment for Richie?  I had a question.  Does the...  Does the city have any responsibility toward the tree  if it's listed as a heritage tree?  The city does not own...  Well, only to ensure that the appropriate city codes are then followed.  Because one of the obligations for a private property owner is that...  Well, currently, there are no city ordinances  that govern how you would manage your own property,  and that includes the trees.  The only exception is when you're developing,  you're building your property,  then development codes kick in.  What the Voluntary Heritage Tree Program does  is that it assigns those codes to the property  even though it's not being developed.  So the bottom line for the tree is that  if the owner or a future owner wanted to cut down that tree,  they would need to come to the city  and either pay mitigation  or discuss with us other remedies  that...  may involve not removing the tree.  So basically, there would be a roadblock to removing the tree.  Not a guarantee,  but it creates an extra hurdle.  And that is one of the reasons  why the current applicant does want to put heritage status on this tree.  One of the other caveats is that  it does need to also be recorded on the deeds of the property.  So it does carry with the land, if you like.  So, you know, if...  they sell in the future  and someone else purchases the tree,  this would remain a heritage tree.  So it does afford a level of protection for the tree.  Great. Thank you.  I have a question.  This is not really even relevant,  but it looks like there are a couple of steps and a rope on the...  Yes, we can go back.  There used to be a tree house in there?  And I did ask the homeowner if they knew about those  or the history of those.  They said they've always been there, I guess.  And I guess it may be tied to the history of this house.  It did used to be a fraternity house at one point.  So it's had many uses.  And, yeah, there was a chapter in the history.  And I would guess that might be the era  where those ladders or steps appeared.  But they don't seem to be causing any harm to the tree.  You did an assessment on it, too?  Yes.  Yeah.  It's leaning, but that's...  There is a lean, yeah, for sure.  It doesn't seem to be any movement, though.  That would be worrying.  So it looks like the tree's always grown that way.  And we've seen historical photographs,  and it's always had that lean.  So it looks to be responding well to that lean.  You know, it's got a root system that can hold it up.  It's a beauty.  Okay, this is an action item.  If we don't have any more questions or comments for Richie,  I have a general heritage tree question.  I don't know if I should ask it now.  I suppose I should.  It's not about this tree.  It's about, and this may not even be an agenda item,  but it's about a tree that is in front of Bidwell Mansion.  And...  Um...  Of course, after seeing the damage to the mansion,  I wondered about the monkey puzzle  that is in front of the mansion.  I didn't know if you had any information on that tree,  because it's a...  Do you know the tree I'm talking about?  There's a huge monkey puzzle.  And those don't grow around here.  And then I have since looked it up.  They're supposed to live only about 15 years.  That tree has been there for as long as I've lived here,  which is 26 years.  And they're endangered.  Right.  So...  Um...  I didn't...  I was worried after seeing what happened to the mansion  that that special tree had been damaged, but it hadn't.  So I didn't know if...  That would be maybe...  I looked at your qualifications for a heritage tree,  and since it's technically in a state park,  I didn't know if that would even be one that we could nominate.  They could be...  It could be considered the state park folks would need to...  to nominate that tree.  So, for example, we do have similar nominations in the pipeline  on Chico Unified School District properties.  So, yeah, so long as you're in the city limits,  then, you know, and you are the applicant,  the owner is the applicant,  then the city council can consider that.  Well, that's a pretty special tree.  After I did some more research on it, I thought,  oh, wow.  Anyway, okay, so...  Let me just follow up on that.  So perhaps in the next couple of weeks,  because you guys are going to be talking about this,  this becomes...  becomes a point of mention to the state  about let's protect this tree or let's look at what happens...  It's an endangered tree.  ...with the possible rebuild, possible redevelopment,  possible reuse of the bidwell mansion  and make sure possibly that they're at least aware  that the city of Chico is interested in keeping this tree.  Just part of the conversation.  Yeah, definitely.  We've been in contact with state parks reps  regarding the scenario, and we'll bring the tree up.  I noted it, too, on scene.  And it did appear to receive...  some damage, a little bit of blackening on the trunk,  but not a whole lot compared to some of...  There's a couple of palms on the other side  that received quite a bit of damage and will likely not make it.  But that tree, hopefully, will go unscathed.  So we'll take a peek at it and connect with state park reps.  So just to clarify, I know the tree you're referring to  is the magnolia tree.  Maybe that's what I'm referencing.  The one in the very front is what I'm talking about.  I don't know the species.  It's charred all on one side that faced the mansion.  I think I might be referencing the magnolia  in the very front of the house.  The monkey puzzles are really strange-looking, tall,  kind of very jagged, skinny tree.  And you might not even notice it if you didn't know,  but my husband and I had one in a pot,  so that's why I always pay attention to it,  and we killed it, of course.  But anyway, I shouldn't have even brought that up.  It's not on the agenda.  No, it's a fantastic conversation,  and we'll definitely bring it up with state park reps.  Absolutely.  Okay, so back to our American Elm here.  It's an action item.  I'd like to make a motion...  I'd like to make a motion to approve the applicant's request  for heritage tree status for the American Elm,  located at 488 East 3rd Street.  Second.  Commissioner Glatz?  Yes.  Commissioner Shadley?  Yes.  Commissioner Shearer?  Yes.  Vice Chair Nava?  Yes.  And Chair Thomas-Petty?  Yes.  Thank you.  Thanks, Richie.  Thank you.  Thank you.  We're now at item 6.3 on our agenda,  which is the confirmation of Park and Natural Resources Manager.  We will hear from our public works director.  Eric Gustafson.  Thank you, Chair.  Thomas-Petty.  Appreciate the opportunity to speak to you tonight.  I'm looking for a meeting with the state.  note of the approval of the  confirmation for our new park  and natural resource manager.  We have some very big shoes to  fill here shortly.  It will be tough on all of us  after a fantastic 28 year  career with the city of chico  and almost a 40 year career in  public service starting out  with the city of  san luis obispo and then  the city of visalia and then  we are fortunate to have miss  herman here at the city of  chico. We will proceed with  some recognition at the january  meeting for miss herman and  sad to see her go but very  excited for her retirement  endeavors. With that it leads  to kind of a succession plan  that we put into place several  years ago with mr. shane  romaine sitting here next to me  and I thought I would talk a  little bit about shane. I  know most of you or all of you  know him well. Shane wanted to  be a park ranger since the age  of five. After visiting chico  in bidwell park like his  predecessor linda after visiting  bidwell park moved to chico.  That was kind of the draw to  chico. I' m pleased to share  that with you after visiting  bidwell park shane moved to  chico in 1997. Shane put  himself through school and  earned a bachelor's degree in  management after a short stint  with state parks and california  fish and wildlife. He was hired  at the city of chico in 2007.  Shane started out as a hourly  park ranger permanent status  senior park ranger was promoted  to park services coordinator and  then in 2023 promoted to  assistant park manager and now  I' m pleased to take the steps  necessary steps forward and  move forward with appointing him  as the park and natural resource  manager to succeed linda. I' m  very excited for what we have in  store moving forward. 2025 is  going to be a fantastic year for  bidwell park. With that I' d seek  your approval for appointing  shane romaine as our next park  and natural resource manager for  the city of chico.  thank you.  we need to move.  if there were any comments  I' d be happy to make that motion.  absolutely.  I' d be happy to second it.  thank you.  take a vote?  want to take your own vote?  laughter.  this is incredible.  this is really an honor.  big shoes to fill is quite the  understatement.  it' s been my privilege to be  able to work closely with linda  over these years. I' ve learned a  lot and I really appreciate under  her leadership for our whole  division but for me personally  for her allowing me to have the  freedom to make some major  decisions and trust in those  decisions and provide that  support. My plan is to continue  that with our park staff and  help them in their growth and  bring them up all the way.  Because I think it' s just  wonderful to be able to do  everything on the farm and  behind the vaccine vaccine vaccine  vaccine vaccine vaccine vaccine  vaccine vaccine vaccine vaccine  vaccine vaccine vaccine vaccine  vaccine vaccine vaccine vaccine  vaccine vaccine vaccine vaccine  vaccine vaccine vaccine vaccine  vaccine vaccine vaccine vaccine  vaccine vaccine vaccine vaccine  thank you for your support.  Take your vote.  Ceremonial Linda do it ceremonially. Let's do it Linda. Okay. Let's see. It's been a long time. I'll forget how okay  Commissioner Shadley  Absolutely 100%  cheer  Commissioner Glatz yeah, and I just want to add congratulations and a mash will happen  Thank you to Eric and Linda the process worked and you've been with the city for a long time and it's great to see promotion  From within and and I think that's also indicative of a strong city to so everybody I think wins on this one. So thank you guys  Vice chair Nava  Yes, and I'd also like to add that  Bittersweet with you outgoing, but thank you for all that  You have done and I look forward to whichever January meeting to be there to clap my hands when I see up there and Shane  You've grown so much. I've watched  your journey through the various roles he named and  You have a career to be proud of and I'm sure for you. This is kind of like a pinnacle thing. And so congratulations. Thank you  And lastly chair Thomas Petty. Yes. Thank you. Congratulations  and thank you very much to Linda for all you've done for our city and  for our  Commission to thank you. I've enjoyed working with all of you and I'll miss you all  Well miss you to come back and visit  Okay item seven on our agenda reports and communications  items are provided for the  Bye guys  Thank you  Items provided for the Commission's information only no action can be taken on any of these items unless the Commission agrees to include it  on a subsequent posted agenda  7.1 parks division report Linda Herman Park and Natural Resources manager  Thank You chair  As usual, this is an informational report  And I can answer any questions  but I would like to make a statement about how impressed I am and how proud I am of the park staff and  How they took ahead and and charged forward immediately after the storm to clean up we had the running for food that week and they had  Everything pretty much in good place. I walked it  I didn't run it  But I could see the the hard work that they did and how much effort they did  But they did it with heart and care and and it's it we have a very young staff  But a very enthusiastic staff, and I'm just really happy to see  the the teamwork that they do and their leadership also with James  And I just think that it's only going to get better and better every year, and I think we're slowly building our staff  We're getting equipment. We're getting experience  and I'm just really hopeful and thankful that we're moving in the right direction.  And with Shane at the helm, that's going to be even better.  So thank you.  Thank you.  Does anyone have questions or comments on the park report?  Go ahead.  I got a question, but first thank you, of course,  for everything you've done for the park over the years.  I understand we have a third ranger now, but I didn't see it.  I believe that they are out of the academy, but they're in field training,  so they still have another probably four to six months in field training  with the police department.  Before they can be on their own?  Correct.  Okay, gotcha.  Yes.  Go ahead.  Thank you for the update.  The sediment was crazy after the storms,  and we had talked beforehand about how many of those, you know,  leaky rock weirs or whatever they were, were in place,  and I'm glad that quite a bit was captured by them,  but there was an insane amount still on the creeks and Lindo Channel and everything.  So I don't know, just a comment there,  because it was kind of a big impact to just kind of point that out.  I don't know now with Lindo Channel running again  if it's going to wash some of that out.  I haven't been down there this week.  And then also I saw a $100,000 donation for the Caper Acres Fence Project.  Was that a public donation or was that anonymous?  Can you say who?  Anonymous, yeah.  They would like to remain anonymous.  But yeah, very generous also.  Yes, absolutely.  And that's moving along.  I think we...  We have also in the division report that we had a great presentation  by the PV students and Fairview's...  I think Fairview High is involved too.  So I'm really looking forward to...  Well, Shane's really looking forward, I guess.  I keep saying we too, so...  That to move that forward,  and I think you guys will be pleasantly pleased.  Oh, good.  The design review and, you know,  just kind of double-checking all of that looks great.  Yes.  Good, good.  Thank you.  Vice Chair Nava.  Thank you.  So, Linda, on item B,  if I could,  regarding that fence,  I know that before one of the action items or requests,  I guess I'll say,  that we had as a commission  was to, like, see the plans when they're available.  I'd love to see the mock-ups that the PV students were shown.  I mean, great that they saw the presentation.  But that would be good  if we could have that brought before us.  And the other is,  when there's opportunities for this in the future, Shane,  if you could just kind of earmark  that maybe you put it out there  that something like that's going to happen  if you're made aware.  So that maybe if we have the bandwidth,  there could be some representation there  to be present during those type of presentations.  Yeah.  This was,  they purposely did this.  These were rough drawings.  They're not finished products.  We certainly will,  Shane will certainly bring those to you  when they're final.  Great.  But, you know,  they did not want,  they didn't feel they were ready yet  and wanted to put some more time into it.  And this was just to make sure  that they were going in the right direction  and sought our help.  with that as well as with the actual roadway members too there was a couple roadway members  there to make sure that they were meeting their their expectations because they're the funders  of this project so that it was nothing a slight on you guys at all it was just they they wanted  some input from on a preliminary design and want to wait to show you when it gets closer to being  a final designs makes sense and then I just also on the storm stuff you know we live across so  it was amazing how quickly the city responded to everything and my husband's always an early Park  user and he's just very impressed by the stuff when you mention the young eager stuff there's  evidence of that all over the place so kudos because obviously you guys are hiring you know  good enthusiastic people who really have the follow-through so thank you and thirdly I just  want to bring you know when councilmember Winslow brought up the one hundred twenty !  this is the 20th anniversary I  want to throw out a comment  since this is part of the park  report just an opportunity for  me to say maybe you guys throw  out a request to talk to anna  bell grim of card to see if  there is some way we could all  collaborate and figure out  something that would be doable  to celebrate and maybe get the  word out and if donations are  needed to be able to do any  celebrating we can have some  runway.  Just a thought.  Unless you want to wait for  the 125th.  I know right but hey we  got to cheerlead along as we go  because there is good things  happening with measure h and I  think it is important that we  expose the park as the jewel it  is and all the little facets  within it so that there is a  lot of people wanting to tear  into the funds and so I feel  like we have been waiting and  waiting for some of the things  and I think it is a golden  opportunity. We can lean in for  the 125th but maybe some  stepping stones along the way.  any other questions or comments  for linda?  I do have a question.  Didn'  t I write one down when will the  new commissioners be appointed?  that is a great question.  I know we have received  applications but there is four  vacancies.  We haven't seen those applications  or who has applied yet.  It generally would probably I  don't know has to go to council  and I don't know if it is on the  council agenda yet that I have  seen on the forecast but it  would probably be more likely  going to be in February at the  earliest.  February or March and  Addison is shaking his head it  is a good time to get to the  if you please.  yes we will.  Any other comments or questions  for linda?  thank you linda.  is that your last report?  that is my last report.  was that signing off?  mic drop.  there you go.  thank you all.  thank you.  item 7.2 the street tree  division report.  richie bamlett urban forest  manager.  thank you chair thomas  peddy this is informational only  but I will be happy to answer  any questions the commission  might have.  any questions or comments  for richie?  are you guys keeping up okay?  I mean we had a big storm  everything is looking good.  we came through okay from the  storm.  just really some big trees came  down in the park and there is a  photograph of one of them in the  report because it did fall into  parkview elementary school so  thankfully that was during the  break and no kids were around.  we got that cleaned up and  everything is looking good.  have been removed within 24 hours  and that was with the contractor  north valley arbor management.  just to jump tracks a little  the assessment of the park fire  damage is ongoing and you will  see in the report we included a  map of the latest assessments  and that is on 10 mile house  road.  more trees than I would have  liked have been earmarked for  removal but I would like to  note that we are looking at  I believe the fire was a lot  hotter in that part of the park  so probably no surprise.  but we will take another look at  those trees and try and if we  think we can downgrade a few to  monitor instead of remove then  we will do that.  but it probably not going to  the number probably won't change  that much.  I think we are looking at over  the next three years.  happening fairly shortly.  but they are also varying  sizes so not all of them are  big large trees.  we will definitely look at them  in modern term like we did on  upper park road on the north  side.  so all those hazard trees  are coming out?  the ones that went after the  second assessment is determined  will be marked with a white X.  thank you.  refresh my memory when the  city removes a tree and it is  more in like a residential area  or commercial area.  and how much of the stump is  typical for us to leave behind?  is it supposed to be ground as  low as it is to do it?  or are you leaving pretty  healthy amount of the trunk?  the contractors are instructed  to leave a stump two inches high.  however what I am trying to push  forward in everybody's mind is  that we are not just removing  trees we are removing and  replacing the trees.  so those stumps are in fairly  short fashion are ground out.  and the contract states that  they have to be ground down to  24 inches below ground.  and that enables us to basically  create a new planting bed for a  new tree.  so you know we are not  going to be doing that.  we do have a big backlog of  stumps.  we have about 800 stumps around  the city.  we will prioritize service  requests if a homeowner is  particularly motivated to get  rid of a stump because it is an  eyesore or they feel it is a  hazard and what not.  but typically stumps are not a  hazard so we have to take a  balanced approach with those  requests.  but it is just a matter of  prioritization and funding.  because stump removal is not  cheap.  but yes we are two inches high  until they are gone and then  there is a new tree.  thank you so much for that I  appreciate it.  any other questions or comments  on this?  we will adjourn to the next  regular meeting on January 27,  2025 at 6 p.m.  right here.  thank you to members of the  public and council member  winslow and thank you staff.  thank you linda and congrats  shane.  thank you eric we always like  seeing you here.  and we will see everybody in the  happy new year.  thank you.  thank you.
