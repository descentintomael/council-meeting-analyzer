 On the day of May 19, please join me in pledge of allegiance to the flag. Stand, salute, and pledge. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. Madam Clerk, would you please call the roll? Council Member Huber? Here. Council Member Morgan? Here. Council Member Horry? Here. Council Member Reynolds? Here. Council Member Stone? Here. Vice Mayor Brown? Here. Mayor Schwab? Here. So this is a special meeting. We're only permitted to discuss the items that are on the agenda, so we won't be having... public comment or anything added to this agenda. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the public shall have the opportunity to address the Council by email and or engage Chico on any item described in the agenda before or during consideration of that item. The City Council is prohibited by law from considering any other business at this meeting. And this meeting is being conducted in accordance with Executive Order N-2920. The public may view the meeting live on CAMCAST 11 or by streaming video via the City's website. Minutes and agendas view meetings online. The Engaged Chico Civic Engagement Program will be available for citizen input on individual agenda items both prior to and during the meeting. Additionally, public comment will also be accepted by email via publiccomments at chicocca.gov. publiccomments at chicocca.gov during the meeting prior to the close of the public comment on an item. And we sincerely hope that you will submit comments on items that you're interested in sharing your opinion on. When you send your comments, we will be happy to answer them. When you send an email, we would ask that you restrict the comments to one agenda item. It makes it easier for that item to be found and to be read. We have been meeting for two months now without the public present and have been trying to make adjustments so that we can get as many comments as we can and allow Council time to make adjustments. We have a lot of room in the room right now but we have a lot of room in the room right now but we have a lot of room in the room right now but we have a lot of room in the room right now but we have a lot of room in the room right now but we have a lot of room in the room right now but we have a lot of room in the room right now but we have a lot of room in the room right now but we have a lot of room in the room right now but we have a lot of room in the room right now but we have a lot of room in the room right now but we have a lot of room in the room right now but we have a lot of room in the room right now but we have a lot of room in the room right now two purposes. First it allows us some time to process the information. It assures the public that we are actually hearing the comments and it allows the public to understand what other members of the community are thinking. So if Council is agreeable to that, we can try that and see how that process works. I would be opposed. You would? It's kind of like a show that we're reading. It's read. Just spend an extra hour a year reading each other's emails just so we can read something we've already read. It's certainly much more common than we would ever get at the podium because we've got all of the emails and all of the messages that have been coming in all week. Yeah. Any other comments from Council? I would concur with Mr. Horry. I understand the sentiment. People want us to hear it. I think if we're honest with, I'll just be honest, I can't speak for the rest of you. If you have one of the clerks sit here and read emails to me, I will fall asleep. I will, my eyes might be open, but I'll zone out. But the other part of it is certainly we'll get, I don't know what number of people that would never show up and speak from the podium to just send in an email. And we've got to read a bunch of stuff. I think we've got to read a bunch of stuff out loud that we've already read. So while it's symbolic and I understand it, I'd side with Mr. Horry on this one. I'd have to agree and just echo those sentiments. One thing that I would be open to, and I know that the Board of Supervisors has transitioned to doing, is stating the name of anybody who's made a comment and whether they've indicated they oppose or are in support of that item. That way it's on the record and, you know, might be a healthy compromise to save some time. But also allow folks to be registered. Other comments? I'm in agreement with your proposal. I'm usually pretty typically opposed to spending more time that can be handled offline and not addressing, you know, the million dollars a year. So that we have a staff in the room and absorbing their time to process what we should have been doing all along. These comments come in all week. Since the agenda's out, we encourage them as much as we can. And as Councilmember Horry mentioned, the comments are more verbose, more robust, as people have some time to think about them. I think reading them aloud from the podium just publicizes more than what is already available. Am I correct, Madam Clerk? I don't think I've ever called you madam before. Ms. Presson, all of these comments go into the public record and there is a public statement of those opposed, those that are neutral, those that are in support every single time, correct? That is correct for the Engage Chico component. That allows them to oppose or support or be neutral in those items. But the public comment emails that we're receiving in during the meeting, they're not in support. The state right right right right Yeah, and I think expending more and more time for staff to go through what is already rudimentary and already available, and we already have a system available to review that, is just adding an expense in time to meetings that already go with one or two items well into the 11 o'clock hour, such that we have to start meetings earlier so that we don't go too late. So, yeah, for a million different reasons, I'm opposed. I would just echo Ms. Brown's sentiments that I think how many opposed, how many support, and maybe even the names of who sent them in should be sufficient, in my opinion. Okay. And to be clear, if I may, I supported Vice Mayor Brown's compromise proposal about these opposed or support, if that wasn't clear. And I would just. Make a note for the public that if you want that support or opposition to be clear, start your email with I support or I oppose. Makes it a little easier to categorize. Okay. So we will continue our practice of when it is time to have public comment, we will break action and read the comments, allowing plenty of time to read them all. And then as the clerk and the. Assistant clerk are providing us numbers of public comments, they'll indicate whether the person is in favor or opposed. And the public comments are available as part of the agenda. Or actually as part of the minutes. As part of the minutes. Okay. So item 2.1, modifications to emergency declaration resolution number 7-20, and direct action. Okay. So item 2.1, modifications to emergency declaration resolution number 7-20, and direct action. This report is from Mark Orem, City Manager and Emergency Services Director. Yes. Good evening, Honorable Mayor, members of the Council. This, I'm going to be fairly pointed and direct on this item. You've had the staff report now, and I know all of you have read it. It's pretty straightforward. It's an opportunity to be able to modify the emergency resolution that this City Council put in place in order to help manage this emergency scenario. You all know this has been a very dynamic and very day-to-day, ongoing changing scenario that's unfolded. And various components of your resolution pointed to some specific timeframes for a number of these things. And so I wanted to bring those back in order to better accommodate your desires, in order to make it very clear to the public what aspects of the resolution are being modified or not. One of the most primary items that are on there is in relation to the business reopening plan. And as you're all very well familiar with, the County of Butte has been very proactive in attempting to improve the emergency resolution. The City Council has been very proactive in trying to get us through this time logically and in a healthy fashion. And it has been really a collaborative effort, not only by the County and their healthcare professionals at Butte County Public Health, but too from your local agencies. Mayor Schwab and myself sat on one of the committees to help start to create these work groups which put those particular and specific areas of business industry together. And allow them to be able to evaluate the recommendations that we have so that we can get them going. from our healthcare professionals to see what phases can be conducted in mitigation efforts in order for them to reopen, not only timely but also responsibly. And that has gone through immensely successfully to this date. And one of the things that our resolution pointed to was simply the governor's order without any subsequent modifications pursuant to the governor to be made with each county. And so one of the things that you will note in here is the iterations surrounding those efforts that have taken place for Butte County in collaboration with the governor and with his approval and authorization. So I want to make that very clear. This isn't Butte County going rogue, the city of Chico going rogue. This is basically following in line with what Butte County has done logically and with the approval of the governor. So you'll find those modifications in there. In addition to that, one of those areas spoke to when the meetings would be conducted regularly. Basically, they said in 90 days. The resolution that we would continue to have, or that was actually direction given, within 90 days that we would be having one meeting per month. And one of the things that I'm recommending in there, and it may not be something that council desires to do, maybe it's a different date, or you want to leave it open-ended, is when we would start commencing regular meetings. And so I envisioned coming back at that first meeting in August and then commencing regular meetings at that point. If you want to do it earlier, please let us know. We can modify it here and get it approved. If you want to do it later, please let us know, and then we can modify that and move forward in that fashion. And finally, the other modifications to this is surrounding the waiver of late fees for payments on sewer service bills, parking fines, et cetera. And I am recommending that we do that for an additional 90 days. It really coalesces well with that August timeframe of coming back into some level of regularity for our body and the council of the whole when they come back. I think we have a lot of legislation going on so we have to come back together again. So that will give some level of surety to our citizens that we know that there are still impacts and they're coming out of this, and that will give them some level of surety that they're going to have those waivers in place for another 90 days from the date of this. Finally, all of those aspects of the resolution that were previously approved will remain in effect. This is simply modifications to the items that we felt needed to come back to be modified at this time. So with that, happy to answer any questions. The City Attorney and I worked on this and we're hopeful that you will either let us know and give direction on certain areas where you want to modify or move forward with what we've recommended. Thank you. Comments? Questions? Seeing none, we will open public comment and perhaps some additional questions or comments will come up after that. Madam Clerk, how many comments do we have on the engaged Chico? We have 21 on this particular item and I can read the names of those individuals. However, I will let you know that 17 of the 21 speakers opposed the extension of the emergency declaration. And so with that, if you're okay, I will just read the names of the people. I have a list of individuals who sent those in. Nicole Nava, Julie Treat, Jessica Gianola, Penny Oster, Pamela Copping, Carolyn R.P., Jamie Stregay, Kimberly Burke, Dave Lisk, Crystal Maddox, Margaret Hicks, Michelle Hale, Herbert West, Allison Hart, Marcie Pittman, Terese Lee, Lee Rocker, and Justin Vargas, Susan Smead, Karen Wilhoyt, and Rob Berry. And then let me check and see if there's additional ones. Karen Henderson, Ann Nielsen, Peggy Gerlin, and those were the three that were received since the meeting started. And how many emails did you receive, Assistant City Clerk? I received one from Caroline. I think I read it. Okay. So we have 26, 27 comments. Would 10 minutes be appropriate? So we will have 10 minutes to read the comments. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Has everyone had an opportunity to read the comments? Okay. So will we. Madam Mayor, I have some questions for the skipper whenever you're ready. Yes. Questions? So, skipper, my questions are the greatest sentence I can find in this entire resolution is that some of the responses to the virus may be eligible for state and federal reimbursement. I know may is a big word. So that alone makes me go, well, we should keep this thing going so maybe we get some money that I think is going to run out from everybody. All the other stuff, though, well, and I'm happy with waiving the fees and keeping the parking fines gone. I don't have a problem with that. The other stuff I question a little bit. So if we did away with the... Whatever it's called, the emergency resolution. The social media that's going on, I don't personally see any value in that at all. Essential services are going to happen anyway. Protecting the vulnerable populations has been something that this council has been adamant about for a long time. Mitigating impacts to business, I don't know that the city has a role or any expertise in doing to begin with. And then... And then management, responsible management of public spaces has actually gone away as a result of one of the other ones. So I guess my question is, what are the ups and downsides of the entire thing? I think that the overarching umbrella question, I think the city attorney wanted to speak to anyway. So I'll let him kick it off and then I'll kick in what's ever necessary. So, Andrew, if you wouldn't mind. Thank you. Thank you. There were a lot of comments about... They were focused on extending the emergency... The emergency order through August. That's not what this resolution is about. As you recall, under the Emergency Services Act, a city that declares an emergency order declaration is required to renew that every 60 days, max. And one of the first things that the governor did in his initial proclamation was to waive that provision. So a city would not have to come back every 60 days to renew. So that isn't what's at issue here. August 4th is identified in here only for the... Not for the purpose of extending an emergency order, but for purposes of addressing a date when meetings of the city council would go back to from once a month back to twice a month. So this isn't intended to extend a declaration. It's not intended to truncate the declaration period at all. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. The declaration in place is for that funding purpose primarily. And then also to address any local issues you want to address. Is it in a... Sorry to interrupt. No, it's fine. Is it in any way... Does the order speak to the content of the meetings as opposed to the recurrence of them? So this resolution... If you recall, the resolution that you did, I believe it was, what, the 25th of March? That was... About 10 days after the governor enacted a statewide order that was a stay-at-home order. Subsequently, a new concept came about with this roadmap, resilience roadmap, and the road to recovery, and all those types of concepts are going with guidelines that are being updated frequently on state websites. Those types of ways of managing this crisis were not anticipated when we crafted that initial resolution. So this resolution does exactly, in many ways, what you're talking about in Sections 3 and 4, regulation of public gatherings, regulation of businesses, and so forth, taking the city out of that regulatory business and instead picking it to what the county is doing. And what the county did with its attestation and that plan that was accepted, that kind of leaps ahead. Of what, where we were as far as opening up. And so if this resolution is not passed, there's an argument that all of that opening up should not be done, cannot be done. So we want to make sure that what the city is doing is in line with what the county is doing, and that it's also not being held back. The city isn't being held back to what the governor was doing back in March. So that was a great summary. Well, thank you. Do you have stuff to add? No, because I thought he had a great summary. But I was just going to answer her question, unless you have more. Okay, and I'll come back to anything. The intention of the August date would mean we'd get back to norm, the norms, two meetings a month, and then Ann and I wouldn't have to continue that dialogue of what's an emergency item versus what's a non-emergency item. So that would be my intention with this language. Is that it was all us to get us back on that path of, okay, here's the items that council wanted to dialogue over, which weren't deemed necessary for city operations to be conducted day to day. And we'd slide back in at that in those August meetings. That would be the intention. So is it possible to say yes to what the city attorney said, but start opening our meetings up to other things more quickly? Absolutely. If it's council direction. And in fact, Mark and I had that discussion yesterday of what might be on the June agenda, what might be on the July agenda. Things that were left hanging back in February and March that are still very important to us. I would, I mean, I would, this is not a motion because I don't even know how to make it given what's going on. But knowing what's coming up on the agenda, I would be open to going back to our regular meeting schedule everywhere, with some conditions for the public. Well, and I guess for us, too. It just kind of goes hand in hand with what the county is doing with our businesses. For us to remain in essential business mode through August is, I don't know what the right word is. Yes, sir. If I could, I'm kind of breaking down the meeting part or city services part as to meetings into three components. One would be the number of meetings and frequency per month. One would be. What's on the agenda. And the third would be. Who is in attendance in the room or how the meetings are being handled in that regard. So, and I think that August, June, whatever date could address actually all three. My concern about the third part, who's in the room, I think that might take just a little more research and refinement as to how to implement that aspect. But if you're talking about this is very similar to, let's say, a retail setting where 50% of the capacity, something along those lines, we could try that. And with six feet of separation. And masks. I mean, those are the things that we're asking our businesses, our office spaces. But I think. Part of the direction from the, from Butte County. So. If they, I mean, I could get behind. Let's go back to our regular meeting schedule. I don't want to wait till August. Allow everything that was on the table before to be discussed and cut the capacity of the room to 50% and ask people that are coming to speak to wear masks. Council Member Morgan. Yes, ma'am. Would you consider those first two items without the third? Which part was the third? Oh, yeah. I mean. If we have to. And I think that, I mean, personally, I think it's ridiculous. But I think that might be prudent. Let's get back on a normal schedule. Start doing the business of the people. And then when we can all agree or the public health officer, who I'm not a fan of, decides it's okay. Or the new, then we can let people in. I'm probably not the one to make that call, obviously. I'll understand. Those first two items, I'm ready to support. I think we're ready. It's time to get back to the people's business. I am hesitant. Extremely hesitant to open up our chambers at this time, given the state order and the recommendations that currently exist. I don't think I could support that. I get it, like 100%. I just, I do have a lot of difficulty potentially putting people at risk. Can I answer that? My only challenge with that is the perception is we're trying to do the work of the city and not let the people in. And we will all get hit with that, rightly or wrongly. Yeah, I do. Yeah. No, I... It's a conundrum. I get that. Yes. We can always modify that later if the county's guidelines change or the state's guidelines change. I'd be supportive of it. Katie? That was pretty much exactly what I was going to point out is that we are being very... I don't want to border on being hypocritical by saying we're getting back to doing the work of the people's business without the people here. So, and sending something in on Granicus and it's not... Yes, we... We can read of it. I just... We just need to be careful what we're taking up and what we're doing and to be sure that we're... And, of course, public safety is of utmost importance. So I would rather push things off a little bit and to make sure our public can be involved in the decisions that we're making if that's what it takes. But I'm ready to get back to work as well. I would just add, you know, a lot of these items that are on our agenda planning calendar that were, you know, I would call in the queue in terms of being visited have involved the public. Extensively. Of course, I want that continued engagement. But I think there are some items that, you know, have taken hours and hours of public engagement. And that might be priority items to kind of move forward on if that's of concern. Rand? You know, I would support us going back to a full schedule. I'm not sure we could open up the doors. And, yeah, you are not the right person or we are not the right people to make the decision as to what's appropriate in terms of capacity. And how we can protect the public. But, you know, we could have at a minimum two people here from the public at one time. I'm being a little bit ridiculous. Probably much more than that. Right? But clearly we have an opportunity to have some people in here. That's possible. I just can't believe that we don't have other technological solutions for this. I mean, communities all across the state are also weaving in WebEx. I know that the planning commission is doing this. So why we couldn't open up immediately in June. Have some public engagement via WebEx. That's far better than reading their comments. I'd like to see their faces and have them communicate directly with us. We should be able to do that electronically. The city clerk is nodding her head. And I know that's thrusting a technological challenge. But I know that it's possible. And the community is expecting the city's business to continue. We never stopped doing it. We just had to limit what it was we were working on. But I can't believe there isn't a technological solution that would help us through this. Well, the city has purchased the licensing for the WebEx. And it's been used for the finance committee once. And it's going to be used, I believe, this week for the planning commission. They don't anticipate a large number of people. So hopefully they'll be able to see how that works. Having them call in or be also on a video and being able to be seen. Okay. Thank you. Thank you so much. The reason we've hesitated just bringing that into here is because, like on one item, a couple of meetings ago we had almost 80 comments. So at that point, I'm not sure how we could handle that adequately without a level of frustration for our citizens if they get kicked off like what happened in the finance committee. But staff is willing to work on that. And we already have it. And we're testing it in smaller venues. So hopefully we'll have something come up. through the Planning Commission meeting that we can rely on? Great answer. Appreciate it. When these guidelines were brought forward about reducing the number of meetings and just going to essential services or essential items, it was like at the very beginning where we didn't know what impact that this was going to have on our community. We didn't know what added work would be asked of our staff. And so it was with caution that we moved forward with that. And I think now that we have more information, Mr. Orme, do you think that it would be an impact to staff to have additional meetings? Okay, well, that. No, not at all. I think that, you know, here was the only concern, and it's not as much of a concern to me. It's more of an impression that it looks like you're already speaking to and challenging the staff. You know, ensuring that the public is aware that it's not what is actually taking place. And that's the impression that everything's back to normal. And then people start to. But that was the only caution. But that's more of a perception issue than anything. And you framed it extremely well that, you know what, people are taking responsible measures to do the right thing, but we do need to get back to the public's business, even though things aren't back to normal. We have to start continuing to do those items. And so, no, I mean, if you look at June's meeting, it's already packed. And so we've got a lot of stuff that we need to come forward with. And so we would appreciate that. But I also wanted to have that caution in there as well. Yes. One other comment that a lot of the members of the public touched on was with our homeless camping situation. Now, that was determined by the CDC guidelines and the state guidelines of, of allowing people to shelter in place. And to my mind, that guideline is still in place and doesn't change with this resolution update. That's correct. That is one of those provisions that is referred to here as that this current ordinance that you're considering would not amend. It's basically what the city, how the city is responding to the external, you know, measures that are being put on as, as, as a result of the pandemic. Yes. Okay. If I could add, hopefully something other than what's been said, you know, I support the concept of going forward with the opening the meetings and waiting on opening the audience until we have direction from the governor. I think we've done a pretty awful job of conducting essential and essential meetings. As it was suggested 90 days ago, three of the meetings to me were, I totally agree with Juanita Sumner were unnecessary. I would think most of tonight's meeting could have been handled in June. There's nothing here to me that's could not have been put off two weeks. So since we haven't done a very good job of it and have had a record number of special meetings instead, I don't see too much of a change. I want to point out that. July and August, we often only have one meeting. It's not like we're all going to be running off on vacations perhaps this year, but you know, I again, don't see having a second meeting in July or August as being necessarily helpful. What I'm trying to get to, and I, I guess we really can't get to it yet though, is a six month plan. What we need to do is have a plan in front of us that doesn't start opening up or closing up. It's, how do we get the university back? I mean, it's almost like we're fiddling while Rome burns, you know, it's without really addressing that elephant in the room. Yeah. If students do come back, it may be the most terrible idea to be rushing into opening or certainly at least have a plan that things change in September or October when they start to coming back. I really, don't have any concerns about July and August myself. I mean, other than, you know, the fear we all are living with, but it's September and October that I think we need to be looking at. If we've all of a sudden every opened everything up and we have a spike, we have to have to have a plan. So I'd like to see that. And I, if we are going to go forward with necessary and, and essential business, only I would like this to be a more stricter on that and try not to have any more special meetings. So a couple of comments. Mr. Stone, you're right. I am not the best person to figure out neither are you and neither any of us. And one thing we don't, neither is anybody else, right? Certainly not who were the CDC or the president or the governor of Michigan or anybody else. No one's got it right. That's the only thing we know for sure on the WebEx thing. I do a lot of meetings with WebEx and Zoom. My fear there is there is a certain amount of the population that doesn't have access to those services just because we give them the code or whatever it is. If they don't. The seats are four. Yeah. That's the one or two people, remember? Oh, yeah. Yeah. So I'm actually going to allow Vice Mayor Brown to have changed my mind, but in the wrong way. I'm sorry. I say that we don't start talking about non-assist. I think we have to have a plan so we can get back to the essential business until the public is allowed back in the room and to participate. I think if we try to split the baby we end up losing. I think that's part of what the chancellor did with the California State University system saying you can kind of go back but not really. It doesn't work. So I'm listening to your thoughts, which I think were well articulated. I'm going to stick with until the public gets to participate in the democracy, I think we stick to the essential business and then I'll agree with Mr. or worry that we've got to be careful about what those things are. Fortunately, the budget could take two meetings, and it's what we should be doing. I see that there's a lot of issues that we left hanging. Two on my mind are the report that we had asked for from the North Valley Harm Reduction Coalition, and we had almost gotten to a point where we were ready to make a decision on the cannabis action. And I think as Vice Mayor Brown had said, there has already been a lot of input on those issues. I mean, I'd be prepared to hear both of those items if that's the council's will. Housing as well. And housing, yes. And I think your point is correct, as well, all of them. On those issues, and a number of us have sat through them for many years and heard from the same people over and over and over. And there's a big part of me that would be like, you know what, let's just do it this way. We don't have to hear all that. I can just read it, but it's not right. If cannabis is coming back, nobody wants to get rid of the needle giveaway more than me. Nobody. Not even Roxanne. But the public has to be engaged. If it's going to be one, to me, if it's going to be one, it's going to be, oh, we can't choose. Well, we'll decide these things are essential while the people aren't here, and then we'll push this stuff back. I would hate to be the skipper. I would hate to be the mayor trying to make that call. Because you cannot win. No matter what, you could agree with me every time and be wrong. You could agree with somebody else every time and be wrong. Just what a horrible position to be in. And we've all been in it. I don't know how other communities do it, but communities throughout this state are planning to keep their business and keep in operation to one way or the other. And if they can do it, I don't understand why we can't. But so. I think if the community sees all of those things as valuable and staff and counsel. If the people sees that that is all valuable. That we will implement the technological solutions immediately in order to have the public here. I don't understand why this is other communities are able to do this and able to do this successfully right now. And we seem to have this problem with these really heady issues that so many people have been wanting to put off and delay and delay and delay. And, oh, geez, we have this technological problem that every other community in the state of California doesn't have a problem with. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. So, Skipper, listening to this, and this is kind of a question for you, too, Mr. City Attorney. Sorry, I don't have a cool nickname. Watching this deliberation, and you brought up three items. We talked about three items. How do you, how would you move forward? Short of doing nothing or doing nothing. Yeah. Well, I think that, I think that your comment on it's a no-win situation. I think that your comment on it's a no-win situation is probably the most apropos thing for me to say on that front. However, the three objectives of the resolution modifications were to better enhance our ability as an organization to communicate clearly to our community. That communication is predicated upon the City Council's desires in order to, A, engage, and, B, ensure that our business population understands the path of travel that the City of Chico wishes to abide by. In addition to that, it gives a level of understanding to the City of Chico. In addition to that, it gives a level of assurance to our residents as it relates to any of the issues surrounding the fees associated with parking fines, sewer service bills, and so on and so forth. If the Council desires to go ahead and continue extending those time periods, then I put in a recommendation of 90 days. The City Council wishes to ensure that the public and the businesses have a clear understanding of how to reopen and the path that we are saying we like this, we're a part of this. Then that's in here and it's iterated within this resolution to bring clarity that we are abiding by and within the boundary lines were the County is abiding by with approval of the Governor. The final piece was the recommendation was to come back and continue regular meetings in August. If the Council desires to bring back all of those items earlier than August then by all means change it to the new time frame. The intention of that as the Vice Mayor had asked me earlier was to get back to business as usual by August. August. If the council desires, which seemingly there's been some really good conversation here, there is an interest in moving forward with regular items sooner, then by all means change that to June 2nd or whenever the council desires. The last thing that any city manager would care to do is to usurp your authority as policymakers and make your mind up for you. However, I've given a reasonable, I believe, parameter within this recommendation in how to move forward. So that's the best I can do for you. I would move the city manager's recommendations. I'm going to ask if we can cover them one at a time. Well, is there a motion or a second for Council Member Ori's motion? I will second that motion. So I'll make a substitute motion on item three of that entire thing, that regular items return to the regular meeting. I'll make a substitute motion on item three of that entire thing, that regular meetings and items return to the council agenda when the county and the governor agree that we can safely have 50% capacity in the room. So what you are saying is that we will extend the provisions in the resolution for 90 days, that instead of having a state finance finance finance finance finance finance finance finance finance finance finance! finance really addressed in this? Well, I made it as a condition of return to regular meeting agendas. Instead of August, the date becomes we deal with regular meeting items when the state or the governor or both, whoever we deem smart enough, when we can have at least 50% capacity. So you've set the number. I mean, you've just determined that 50% was the number that was appropriate to be healthy, which is what we talked about. Well, I guess I could. No, that's a good point. That's a good point. I guess I could say when the governor and the county deem it safe for us to have public meetings at whatever percentage they say. Is that? I think they say that now. Well, no, I'm just agreeing with you. Right. But I could pick 2% too, which is. Right. I guess we're splitting hairs. I guess the point is I don't I'm asking for a substitute motion. I'm saying we don't return to a regular meeting schedule with non-essential items until the county and state deem it safe and allow the public in some capacity to return. I'll second that. Madam Mayor, I did not deal with the first two. So to be clear, is that has that happened or is it going to happen where they allow the chambers to be opened? In other words. I don't believe it has happened. I don't either. And it gets to that assembly use type thing. And there's been a lot of talk about assembly uses here recently. Not in this room, but in this county. And I see guidelines that border on something like this. The state guidelines talk about a restaurant. The state guidelines talk about office use. And other types of places where people of very diverse groups are coming into buildings together. I think this would classify as a sports venue. So public meetings are a phase four? Is that under the phased process? Are they considered a phase four item? Public meetings? I think they are being as a default. Yes. I can see where, however, that will be moved to a phase three or a phase two B if there are case by case basis. I think that there is room in the guidelines for, and that whole method that this is going, for there to be case by case analyses where a room that doesn't have fixed seating could have movable seating. A room that does have fixed seating could have seats cordoned off to make accommodations. I'm comfortable tying it to the county's direction, county health department's direction on whether or not we should be allowed to have a meeting or not. Right. So perhaps not so specific as 50%, but. There we go. Yes. By the county's public gathering guidelines. Presumably. Presumably. But I'd prefer the public health director's expertise. I'd prefer the public health director's expertise on whether it's safe for us to be congregating within such and such a proximity rather than certainly us or the city attorney, all due respects, sir, or anybody else in this room. So that's my resistance to your original motion is we are arbitrating on it. I'd love to call the question up. I knew what the question was. Yes, I'm trying to decide that too. So our essential items, we are only to be meeting on essential items until we have public participation. Correct. Okay. In person, public. Okay. No, it's the same. And video engagement's not on the table in terms of discussing items that are on our agenda planning calendar? My challenge with the video thing is I don't know how well it's going to work. I've run a lot of Zoom classrooms. They work fine. But you're excluding a certain amount. I don't know what the percentage is. You're excluding a certain amount of the population that don't have access to that stuff. Yeah, I think that's exactly why it has to be additive. You can have WebEx, but if we're having some seats available, you still allow the opportunity. Look, there may be a pileup outside, and we can't have that, which means people won't be able to speak. But you're offering everybody else the opportunity for WebEx, for public comments. We're giving Granicus the whole nine yards. We can allow all of these things electronically and still have a public presence here for the people that want to physically speak. I think that's easy. You're easier to do and certainly much closer to August, or I would expect that to be the case. But in determining who or how many we should have in here, I left that to the public health experts. They can tell us, you know, it's safe to have four people in here, but it won't be safe for another month to have 15 people in here. Well, maybe that's what we have is it's just four seats for that opportunity, and we have WebEx that will work. If all else fails, of course, we still have Granicus. We haven't limited public engagement at all other than the physical presence here, which is to speak to some cameras. Perhaps we could give direction to staff to explore WebEx and other alternatives for people who do not have Internet connection. And that if that is brought back to us, then we could modify our decision. I thought that's what the clerk said that she's doing already. Yes. I think I just wanted to state that. Okay. We will be able to determine what happens at the Planning Commission meeting on Thursday, and we'll be able to use that as the stepping off point. Can a friendly amendment be made to that motion that at the next meeting we get some sort of report and have an opportunity to make a decision? And what was the friendly amendment to add? To receive a report at our next meeting and have an opportunity to refine. Okay. And I think the City Attorney probably needs to do some exploration also on how to determine who could come into the room, our limited number. Correct? Yeah. Okay. I was going to pick them. You were going to pick them? Okay. Good. So. At least I want to hear that. I know. Oh, gosh. Mr. Mayor? Ms. President. Oh, Mr. Chair. So, for clarity's sake, the changes or the discussions. The discussion was essentially about Sections 3 and 6. Section 6 is a 90-days bit. And as I'm understanding it, that's not, there's nothing in the current motion that would amend the language that's presented regarding Section 6 of the proposed resolution? 10 to 2. That's extending the penalties and provisions extended for a period of 90 days regarding bill payment. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Right. And then, so then we're in Section 3, which deals with the effective date of August 4th. And the amendment that you're wanting to see there sounds like it is including a sentence to the effect of items other than essential business shall be postponed until the state or county guidelines address allowing attendance of the public at public meetings. Okay. Okay. Okay. So, I would then insert that before that sentence before the last sentence in Section 3. The remainder would remain unchanged. So you made a substitute motion but I don't recall if someone seconded it. Council Member Hubber did. Okay. All right. So we have a motion and a second. City attorney. No. Is this a No. made the clarifications. And then there was a friendly amendment to bring back a report on electronic communications at the next meeting? Yeah. Perfect. Okay. Okay. Good. Council Member Huber? Yes. Council Member Morgan? Yes. Council Member Ory? Aye. Council Member Reynolds? Aye. Council Member Stone? Nay. Vice Mayor Brown? Aye. Mayor Schwab? Aye. Council Member Brown? Carry 6-1. Okay. So item 2.2 is Council Member Morgan's request to discuss public attendance at future meetings. So just a protocol question. So I made a motion only dealing with the third part of that, to which we added a sentence into the overall resolution, but the resolution itself. Oh, okay. We either need a new motion or go back to Mr. Ory's motion. I move to accept the city's mandatory recommendations. Okay. Thank you. Okay. Council Member Huber? Yes. Council Member Morgan? Aye. Council Member Ory? Aye. Council Member Reynolds? Aye. Council Member Stone? Aye. Vice Mayor Brown? Aye. Mayor Schwab? Aye. Carry 6-1. Okay. Thank you. So item 2.2 is Council Member Morgan's request to discuss public attendance at future meetings. I think we don't need to do that anymore. We'll take care of that. You run a very efficient meeting, Madam Mayor. Combine the two of them. Okay. Item 2.3, Council consideration of sending a letter to the governor and state health officer regarding COVID-19 report from Mark Orm, city manager. Sure. Honorable Mayor, members of the council, really straightforward item. The Board of Supervisors had... Offered up a letter that they had sent to the governor, really encouraging him to see if there's some way to expeditiously move into even a more forthright phase of mixing some phase 2 and phase 3, potentially, if we meet the health criteria necessary to get there. And in accordance with what the governor's approval and the state health officer's approval. So with that letter came an opportunity for the city of Chico to also... Send a letter similar to the letter that you see in your packet. Basically encouraging the governor to evaluate whether or not this is something that he would approve as we move forward through these phases of reopening for the businesses. So with that, if the council desires staff to write a similarly phrased letter, we will do that and get it out. If not, then we'll leave it at what it is. Question? Yeah. I have a couple of questions. I think one of my major confusions... Is around enforcement. You know, as we continue to open up and adjust these orders, I've heard kind of mixed explanations of what enforcement looks like. And one of the major kind of repeated things I've heard is that the city has little or no authority to enforce regulations provided by the state. That's of significant concern to me as things are starting to open up more. And I'd love some clarity in terms of what that means. Particularly, you know, we've got places that serve food but are also known as bars and there's congregations outside. And we just saw what happened in Palermo with a church opening for Mother's Day service. And, you know, I have a lot of concern if people are not abiding by the guidelines set forth, how we are able to intervene and make sure that people stay safe. Yeah, that's been a question that we've asked from day one. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.! and really are pointed to the order that's currently in place. That's the role that we have been meeting over the past couple of months. Now, does that necessarily mean that we are enforcing the rules? No, but what we're ensuring is that our community members, those businesses and the operators, understand that there potentially will be consequences that could come down by the state. The city doesn't necessarily wield a heavy enough hammer to be able to really dictate a lot of those openings that are being done against the rules that are in place. The state does. A lot of the state agencies, from the ABC all the way down to the folks that give out licensing for various businesses and industries, really wield a much heavier hammer than the city ever will as it relates to the livelihood of those businesses in order to succeed into the future. So it's been a fine balancing act. What we've done is we've gone, we've proactively engaged with those businesses to ensure that they know what those potential consequences are. And that's really the role we've been playing through this. And a few questions, I guess. Is the communication that the city will not take any action? And then the other piece was, you know, there are certain businesses that have a CUP, for example, which seems like something that could... could be leveraged, you know, for the health of our community. And then what are the hammers that we do have? Yeah, so, no, we've not taken off the table an enforcement action. Obviously, if there's something that's truly a public health and safety concern, we have to enforce those rules. And we have that option to be able to do that. You know, I think the city attorney can speak to those remedies better than I can, but there are various measures that a city could take to really... push the envelope on that front. But from an operational perspective, we haven't had to go there because, candidly, our businesses have done a fantastic job of listening, hearing, seeing, and doing their best to abide by it. There will always be outliers, and I think that those outliers will be caught by the state. And I think that it's a very difficult position for the city to be in to attempt to enforce a state order, as is in this instance. It's a... very dynamic and fast-moving situation that we continue to see the rules being changed every day that we don't dictate. And so, for us to pretend like we know the exact moment that the governor has made a change or modification to the order is... it puts us in a very awkward position, so we really have to rely upon the state. Your second point you're going to have to help me out with a little bit. I didn't quite catch exactly what that was. The U.P. Did you say process? I was just curious if that's... What is that? Especially... Additional use permit. Oh, the C.U.P. process. Sorry. Yeah, it's particularly for establishments that serve alcohol, tend to be more congregating environments, and particularly outside of them. And so, I'm just curious... Yeah, I haven't had that conversation. And then the question that ties into that was, what are the hammers that the city has, if it were to be needed as the reopening continues? Yeah, sure. I haven't looked into the C.U.P. component. The city attorney may have an ability to be able to define... further define the hammers. There are a number of different hammers that we do have as a municipal agency. So, if I could ask the city attorney to speak to that, that would be helpful. So, there is a lot of debate about how effective the stay-at-home order is and the guidelines that have recently been published. There is clearly a focus on education and less of a focus on... seeing these measures as punitive in nature. And there are, I think, with few exception, most agencies throughout the state are falling in that framework. That being said, there are agencies in the state that are issuing... police agencies that are issuing citations or egregious violators. There are courts that are at least accepting those filings. Many courts are shut down. And I don't think that anyone is being taken into court immediately and receiving a fine and being... a fine being levied in a trial by any means. So, there is criminal enforcement. There is also civil citations. There are the administrative citation process. And there is also civil enforcement seeking legal action. And there is also the You've raised a different one of conditional use permits. Typically, CUPs deal with a specific set of issues. And when a business goes in to address those issues immediately around that location, because of the type of business it is on day of application, that's what the CUP is about. Bringing in extraneous issues like COVID-19 into that and revoking on those grounds would have to be analyzed. And there's typically a catch-all, obey all laws type condition in there as well. So, we could probably work that in. With all of these, the issue is staff, whomever can go out and write a citation, start the process. We can start enforcement. In some cases, it's brought to the council. In other cases, it's taken before court. That all takes time and resources. So, I think what the city manager is underlying all of this is always that balance between expediency of achieving compliance with the cost of how it's going to be to get there. Totally. And I appreciate the thorough answer. Obviously, the compliance approach is the ideal approach. And I'm glad to hear that that's been working so far. I just felt like I hadn't had a clear answer to kind of the process and what was going on. I will say, as to the alcohol uses, the ABC citing and advising the ABC of the issues, that probably is the most expedient and most effective way of dealing with that. There are other license facilities, doctors, dentists, whatever type of license, I think estheticians and things of that nature also have licenses. Those licensing agencies are taking action on those types of businesses. I'm sorry to take up so much time. I just have one more question about the letter specifically. In Stage 3, I think one of the uses that would be allowed is playgrounds. And, you know, there's several in there that I feel like it's kind of difficult to manage the contact with services and making sure that those services are sanitary. And playgrounds seems to be one of the more significant ones, especially as kids who contract COVID-19 are having other health complications. So I'm just curious about that and if that's been explored, discussed. Yeah. So one of the things that we're leaning into are the medical experts that the county has assembled in order to make determinations of what mitigations can affect the health of the child. And I think that's something that's been put into effect in order to allow for any use to reopen earlier than the governor says. So I don't have a specific answer as to when playgrounds would be a part of that. What we're doing is we're just simply encouraging the governor to see if he'd be willing to allow us to evaluate opening those earlier. And you're right. Lap pools and playgrounds is explicitly in the letter. If the council desires not to include something in the letter, something that you have more concern with over others, we can definitely not add that language into the letter and make it explicit that that's one area that the city doesn't agree with. So yeah, absolutely. Okay. You brought up the lack of real teeth that the city has. And that's kind of my concern is that we're sending out enforcement letters as expected, the best that we can do. We can't issue citations. But as we saw with some of the restaurant openings, there's a far cry from that enforcement. And the legal remedies are not sufficient to protect the safety of this community. It's an impossible task. And we're going to have outliers, as you pointed out. But there was a significant number, at least at this initial restaurant opening, and every time we go through a new phase or a new development, it was already too difficult to identify which businesses were considered essential and which ones weren't. And we couldn't fix that enforcement. As I said last time, I don't know how in the world we're going to do this with different varying levels of, well, you're okay, but you're not okay, and you've sought compliance. So this is going to be a mess right out of the gate. Hopefully their licensing agencies, where it's appropriate, are helping them out. But perhaps there's something that we can do other than just route enforcement punitive. Something like my wife and I were spitballing these ideas, as sometimes we do, and closing off the downtown streets to a restaurant, but also a lot of the American American American American American American American American American American American American American American American American American American American American American American American American American American American American American American American American American American American American American American American help the businesses, the restaurants make more money, provide more of that community feel downtown, which is something that we're certainly all needing if you can't allow people to come close. And that is a reward, a privilege of those businesses in that immediate area. And this doesn't have to be subject to just downtown, in that immediate area, that are following the rules, that have kept their run six feet of distance and that we haven't had contact with over these issues. I don't know how physically possible that is because it's a nightmare to block streets like that, but something like that. In fact, I think specifically I have asked for that to be a discussion soon. Do you want me to speak to that? Yeah, I think those kind of ideas are what make Chico special. We try to find innovative solutions to difficult problems, and so I do believe that the city clerk is a very important part of that. I know it's going to be coming up here. I don't want to wait until September. Right, right, right. So June 2nd, I think it's showing up on the agenda. So yeah, I appreciate those comments. Any other questions? I just wanted... I have comments. Comments, okay. Don't you have to wait for us to read the comments? I was going to. I just wanted to check if people had questions. I also wanted to comment that I don't want the impression to be that there are no remedies available or that there are no solutions. I think there are. I mean, I think as was pointed out by Council Member Stone, it was already difficult enough to cite and take folks to court and cause legal enforcement prior to COVID-19. Then with these regulations, the statewide order, the guidelines, et cetera, there have been, I think, hurdles that are now being addressed. And frankly, I feel more confident that we're going to have to do that. I feel more confident in enforcement activities now with the current level of county guidance and state guidance on these OSHA guidelines that have come out. I think that increasingly we're in a frame where enforcement could happen if the direction was provided. And again, there are multiple ways to do enforcement. And certainly if it were a civil order, essentially a lawsuit by the city seeking an injunction against a particular egregious, the court is still open for business on restraining order type injunctive relief. And so that can get in on short order. So let's go to public comment. How many comments have we received on engaged Chico civic engagement? We've received 13 on this item. And 10 indicated they, they support sending the letter. There's one that's opposed. And then there were several who did not select one or the other. But I will read their names. Nicole Nava. Julie Threat. Jessica Giannola. Pamela Copping. Carolyn Arpee. Karen Henderson. Karen Wilhoyt. Crystal Maddox. Lee Robert. Dustin Vargas. Susan Smead. Juanita Sumner. Rob Berry. And that is it for those unengaged. And did we have any emails submitted? No, we don't. Okay. Let's just take three minutes to review those. So we have a lot of great messages from the American American Thank you. Thank you. Has counsel had the opportunity to read the comments? Yeah. Yeah, okay. So we'll close public comment and look for comments, questions, and direction. I think that we're engaging the governor in the wrong question. We could sure echo what the county said, and the county already says that the communities in our county agree to this. So I don't know if it has any great impact the way it is now. And I'll sound like a book record. I don't care. I'll scratch all night long. If we don't have a plan in front of the governor to reopen the university, you can have all the restaurants open with closed streets, and it won't make a darn bit of difference. We have to, I think, if we have the opportunity to engage the governor because we're in a disaster zone and because of, you know, all of the other empathy and sympathy he might have, the letter should say, what is the game plan, or this is the game plan, governor. Okay. I'm not one that says that we should accept the fact that the university is closed for the entire semester. To accept that means would there also be closed in December, January, and February. We're talking about closing down this town for almost a year or more, given the fact that when was your last fall? Did we close the university in February? It was the middle of March. We had a meeting the last day. So I would imagine a letter that would say, hey, you know, we're on board with all of this other stuff, but let's engage with you, governor. And I know we have a committee of the university, but it's time for the town to say, and I don't know if I have support on this, the idea that we would not just do the most prudent or cautious thing and close the university and not work to open it between now and next March. But gosh, if anyone's going to have a game plan, let's have it. Let's start talking to the governor about, if this and this and this happens, and we put these protections in place in October, can we start, you know, start out for the first month or two with online classes? But, you know, is there a plan to reopen the university? I think that's the conversation I would like. And I think it's germane that rather than send another letter that kind of, I don't know, just says, you know, let's reopen everything. When? Can I follow up? Yeah. I agree in principle with Mr. Ory. I think this particular letter, again, it's the perception more to our constituents than any thought that the governor's actually going to read it. So they say, okay, they're on board with the county like we've said before. So I would actually motion that we sign this letter and send it. But to Mr. Ory's point, I think, it wasn't the university that decided to close. It was the system that decided to close. So whether we go through the governor to get to the chancellor or we march on Long Beach, it was an interesting decision because of the 23 campuses, very few of them are in our scenario. The town won't survive without San Diego. They're going to be all right. Fresno is going to be all right. San Francisco is going to be all right. Hayward is going to be all right. Humble will probably feel something. But, you know, they don't feel a lot of stuff up there anyway. But whatever. It would be an interesting decision. I think it's a very interesting letter to say this is a community that that university goes away, the hospital follows it, and suddenly we're gridly with way too much infrastructure. And it could happen really, really quickly. So how do we not get treated like the other 22 campuses? And I would love to see a letter, whether it be the chancellor or the governor or both, that said please do not treat us like everybody else because we're not. But I think that should be an addition to this. And I'd be happy to work with you to write it, if it came to that. Actually, during the recession, when the chancellor was looking to reduce enrollments at all of the CSUs across the board, we made a very successful case for Chico and Chico State to not reduce enrollments. And so the rest of the system reduced enrollments, but Chico did not just because of the economic impact that it would have to our community. To all those points that you said. And they're showing flexibility because San Jose State's athletic director said we're going to have football. To have football, you got to have some students around. And there's no social distancing in football, I mean, unless you're sitting on the bench. So there is some flexibility there. It'd be interesting to see what we could do to keep what is super special about this community here. And to your other point, I think we could probably get San Luis Obispo and Arcata to join us. you know. Yeah Cal Poly's got a different plan. They're pushing back. I'd like to be involved in that as well. Okay other comments, questions? I'd be willing to make a motion that we write the letter and include writing a letter to the Chancellor and add the verbiage to put the emphasis on how important Chico State is to this community. I'll make a substitute motion. That we rather than writing these letters, I believe the Governor's staff reads them and forwards them off appropriately. I'm not going to denigrate how my colleagues in state government address their business. I think it's a little bit strange and we badmouth other communities. They don't feel anything up in that area. It's the wrong tone which is all the more reason to be here. It's the wrong tone. It's the wrong reason why we shouldn't be the ones writing the letter. I'd like to see us direct staff, whether that's with the committee, with council members or otherwise, to work and lobby the Chancellor and the Governor to keep the students here and to open up classes as soon as possible. Rather than writing a letter, engaging staff to effectively, or excuse me, actively engage those two offices. I'll make a substitute motion. Council Member Randall, Council Member, I always think you don't have a plan unless you have it in writing. And if you were just to stick to the motion in front of us today, at least we'd get our plan in writing of what we want to do. And then, of course, let's lobby, let's, you know, take pitchforks to Long Beach. But, you know, there's no harm in getting it in writing what our desires are. I get it. I appreciate it. I just think the letters, I think, are very important. I think it's a spinning wheel. So on top of that, I guess, add to the letter and encourage staff to begin the lobbying process. I can accept that as a friendly amendment, if you will. I'm not quite sure I understand what that means exactly. I was really impressed, Carl, at the last meeting, the statements that you made about the factor that you felt that had maybe kept Chico's numbers so low was the fact that the college students were sent home early. And I think you were right on there. I recognize as much as anybody here how important a role the students play in our economy and our culture. I just don't see, you know, scientific facts and research and data, I don't see how they get modified to allow something to happen if it's an unsafe thing. It's a great question. I get it. When I first posted on social media that the university was closed, I was so surprised by the number of people that go right on. But, you know, Sean already pointed out that there are a lot of universities opening, that CSU took a different path. Thank you. So I think a lot of UCs are opening. And so I'm not saying that we go carte blanche or full bore into some kind of unsafe practices, but to close the university for a full year when instead we could try to develop a path to reopening and change the narrative from let's close it to what is it going to take to reopen. And I don't know. I think it's obviously a lot but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but as a university town. Maybe we become a hot spot, is the wrong word. Maybe we become a center, a hub for online education. I don't know how we do this. But I just know that we have 10,000 students that generate 8,400 jobs. And you're right. I don't think, I think we spiral with the university down for a year. I wish it wasn't true, but. Yeah. The University of Arizona is opening in the fall. But they are taking some measures where they're doing testing, rapid testing. They're doing, what was the other thing, contact tracing. So those are the kind of things that we would have to lobby for to allow these students to come back. And perhaps even lobby for the case that we will be the beta community to get this done, to allow this to happen. So. Sorry. Someone else. Yeah. I'm supportive of engaging in those conversations. I'm genuinely curious what university, local university leadership would have to say in terms of weighing into that. So they should be involved to echo what you just said, Council Member Morgan. So. Yes. I'm good with it as long as that's included. Well, let's go back to what the motion was. Yes. Can you please? Yes. It was write the letter and engage staff to begin the posse to work on that, which I didn't include Council on that. I don't see a need to at this point. And that was a friendly amendment. You accepted it? Yes, I'll accept that amendment. Second, I accept it. So just to clarify, that's right, the original letter that the city manager was asking us to write, and ask the city staff to engage the chancellor's office. Okay. Thanks. Along with Chico State. Yes. Okay. Just one last comment that's not related to the motion. Well, I mean, it's related to the topic. You know, I don't expect with that that everyone's going to say, well, gee whiz, now that you mentioned it, August 25th we're coming back full scale. What we're looking for is some capacity to negotiate with the chancellor's office. Thanks, Member Platt. Thank you. And if that's some classes or no, you know, in a different format, we're just, we're special. Let's have the vote, please. Okay. Council Member Huber? Yes. Council Member Morgan? Yes. Council Member Ori? Aye. Council Member Reynolds? Aye. Council Member Stone? Aye. Vice Mayor Brown? Aye. Mayor Schwab? Aye. Carries 7-0. Okay. Been asked to take a break. So let's break for 10 minutes and come back at 7-0-5. Are you ready? Are you ready? Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. So we have a lot of room in the room right now. So we have a lot of room in the room right now. So we have a lot of room in the room right now. So we have a lot of room in the room right now. So we have a lot of room in the room right now. So we have a lot of room in the room right now. So we have a lot of room in the room right now. So we have a lot of room in the room right now. So we have a lot of room in the room right now. So we have a lot of room in the room right now. So we have a lot of room in the room right now. So we have a lot of room in the room right now. So we have a lot of room in the room right now. But also, we have a short update. I was hoping to have potentially a draft document to share at this time. We're still working through it. Unfortunately, the complexity of these issues surrounding homelessness are such that we haven't really found any perfect solution. Nobody has. And so we're still working towards those ends. I will tell you that Homeless Solutions Coordinator Amara has been working tirelessly towards those ends. And so she's going to give you a quick update. But I want to acknowledge up front that probably the biggest concern that we're facing right now is in relation to encampments in the parks. And I've heard from pretty much all of you of your concern with that. And I think that it's something that really is going to fall under the responsibility of staff finding a path forward to be able to have adequate space for these folks to be. And so we are working towards those ends. And I just want to reassure council of that because it's probably one of the most difficult. Issues we've ever faced. And with the CDC guidelines currently in place and not having been modified. Somebody asked that question earlier if they had been modified yet. And at this point in time, they haven't. So it's contingent upon us to help find that path forward. And as simple as it may sound, it's extremely difficult to get to those ends. So I want to have Joy come up and share with the council where some of these efforts are leading us at this time. Hi. Thank you for having me. So let's see. I wanted to start off with Project Roomkey. As to date, there are, and this is countywide. It was reported out at the countywide COC meeting yesterday. There's 11 different motels participating in the program. Primarily, though, eight. Three are kind of like stragglers that have taken people here and there. And 212 individuals, unique individuals that meet the criteria have been placed. Again, countywide. 147 of those are in North County, which is Chico. And of that 147, 25 of those individuals have been placed in permanent and or transitional housing. So as you know, housing is the end all end all with solving homelessness. And so this is timing is of the essence. And so every individual placed in Project Roomkey is, um, has a campus. They're a case manager. And they're working through housing action plans. And so with that being said, there was a call last Friday and we are processing like who can lease up on their own, who can go into a shared housing model, who needs rental assistance, who doesn't. And then ultimately, if FEMA has been extended through the end of May, and then as of the end of May, the biggest question is then what do we do? Um, and so I've been working diligently to create an alternative plan. Um, and that being said, would be a congregate shelter that would be in a large enough facility to where we can, um, social distance, um, according to the CDC CDC guidelines. So there's specific, uh, guidance related to shelters, um, which social distancing such as keeping the bed six feet apart, um, sleeping head to toe, alternate, uh, meal time. So there's all of that, um, literature written up and that's all posted on the CDC, um, website. And so we're still, um, working through that initiative, um, ensuring that all of our I's and T's are dotted and crossed. Um, but I'm very hopeful that we could get something potentially moving forward. Um, soon. I don't have a date, unfortunately. And as you know, there's certain steps that we have to take and vet everything before we can, um, bring something back to, um, council to approve. Um, and also just exploring alternative funding, um, measures so that we can, if FEMA doesn't extend. So Cal OES did, um, did ask for an extension through May 31st, uh, or beyond May 31st. And so if that isn't approved, we're looking with the county partners to see what other funding sources are out there that we can utilize. we're working with the county partners to see what other funding sources are out there that we can utilize. to extend as kind of gap funding until we can get an emergency, um, temporary shelter open for that. So like Mark has been explaining, there's just so many, um, variables and every day is different of new information coming in. So, and then the picture gets painted a little bit differently. So just being accommodating to that. Um, and then, um, as far as mitigating the impacts of the COVID and, uh, 19 and the, and cancer, um, it's become very apparent that the efforts, the outreach efforts, um, from our volunteer groups are beyond amazing, right? They are going and hauling out garbage, you know, by the tons. Um, I don't have a report on how much is being brought out, but it is literally by the tons, um, as well as meeting the, the needs, the immediate emergency needs of people residing in encampments. So they're doing a phenomenal job. The, the thing, the bigger picture, that is missing is a housing focus picture and, um, really be making that a program of its own. And so I'm going to be, um, coalescing service providers to design something that would not be city driven, but at least I can help coordinate efforts, um, and identify funding so that we can get out into those encampments and be strictly how, you know, housing first, um, while our volunteers are meeting our everyday needs. And so, this is something that we can approach individuals, um, you know, and, and essentially triaging them where they're at in terms of their, their housing needs, housing barriers, something that you would already do in emergency shelter, but you're just doing it in an encampment. And so I really think that having that focus is what we can do. Now we can do it starting tomorrow if we wanted to. Um, and so this is something that I will be discussing with fellow service providers and ramping up, so that we can get boots on the ground and efforts at least made in a forward direction. And so that's all I have for you at this moment. Mark said, like we have, you know, a much more robust plan in place. Um, it's in draft format. I need to have, um, our, you know, leadership team to, to vet it. And they haven't had an opportunity to do that type, so I can have sit down and, and to have conversations with them. So it's, um, very thorough and, and detailed. So. Thank you so much for, for your efforts and, and for the report. Um, is, can I ask how many, approximately what we're looking at in terms of, um, shelter bed capacity being expanded with this proposal or project? Um, well, obviously it's, you know, it depends on the facility. Um, so, uh, potentially anywhere from 120. It's a, it's a wide variety. 120, to 200 people. That's an exciting number to hear. So thank you. Absolutely. And the, because of social distancing, for instance, the tourist shelter typically can take 160 people, but because of all the other parameters into place, they would only be able to take 120. Um, Sabbath house, the same thing that there, you have to reduce your numbers in order to be able to protect everyone. Um, so those are the capacity levels and working, um, at a call with, uh, public health on Friday, again, to make sure that all parameters are being met and set forth for the CDC. And so to see if any of our shelter providers needed assistance. I've been, um, receiving comments that, um, that some of the encampments are growing, you know, with shelter in place as of the end of March. Um, but we certainly have seen movement and transfer around. Um, what happens when an encampment gets to be more than 10 people? Do you know? Well, I, I did outreach today with, um, Sergeant sound ball and we had the same conversation. Um, and so it's our understanding that when you have an encampment, a encampment, and you have 10 people in that encampment, and then every, um, tent is like 12 feet away, right? So that we haven't seen 10 people within an encampment. Does that make sense? So yours, so an encampment is a single people that have a distance of 12 feet from another encampment, right? So it's 10 people within one, um, tent area. It's not necessarily, um, 10 camps in one location. Does that make sense? No, no, but I, I think I, so there's, um, very probable that there are more than 10 people in one location. And there could be, 40 or 50 people in one location, but you feel that they're distance, distance enough from one another. From, from what I've seen, for instance today, um, yes, they were distance. Um, and there isn't 10 people in one tent per se. Um, they are all social distance accordingly. Because that direct, direct direction was given kind of by the feedback that we had received. Is that, is that the measure that was being followed prior to the guidance we gave about 10 people or less? Yes. Okay. Yeah. So there have been new encampments popping up. Um, per guidance, we've, um, been tracking those on, um, like a Google maps with pin drop. Um, and we are now going to be color coding those based on this is what we saw from the very beginning. This is what we saw moving, you know, like every other week. Um, unfortunately there has been some encampments that had to be relocated, for instance, like Comanche Creek because of the main project. And so we wanted to highlight that those encampments were shifted, but we also wanted to demonstrate, why? Um, it wasn't because we just, they went in and moved them. Any additional questions? . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . We don't have another place for an individual to go at the moment. And that's what a congregate shelter that could meet the social distancing guidelines could do for us when, in fact, we need to ask someone to move to another location. And currently, we don't have a sanctioned encampment. We don't have car camping locations determined. And so we really need to have that in place before we take any further action. I'm sorry. It sounded like we have to accept new encampments at this time? No. Per the guidelines that no new encampments were. And so the bigger issue at hand, though, is if, in fact, a new encampment is created, we really need to have that in place. We really need to have them have another place for them to go to. So we can tell them to take their tent down. But truly, where should they go? And so that's one of the things that with this plan that I'm putting together would have alternative measures for them to go to. So let me help flesh it out because I think, Joy, you're doing a great job. And I think it's an important question. Yes, we can enforce. No. No new encampments. Absolutely. But like Joy said, what's the result of that? So we arrest the individual for illegally camping. And they don't really go to jail. I don't think jails are really accepting many folks anymore. And if they do go to jail, they get out and they come back, potentially. Or they move and they abide by the officer's request and go deeper into the park. And so they're more difficult to find. It's a really difficult situation. I had a great meeting today with the chief and the deputy chief to talk through this. And it was probably one of the most anxiety-ridden conversations I've had in a long time because as difficult as this whole scenario has become for the city, the one thing that will come out of this entire COVID-19 situation and all the rules and all the laws and all the abidance that we're trying to abide by is it will make government look like fools, regardless of what we're doing. And I will tell you that there is no easy answer to this situation. And so the best answer is having a plan on where they can be that's responsible. It's irresponsible to allow them to be in Bidwell Park. We all know that. However, under the circumstances, there's nowhere else that we've identified to allow them to be. So we're caught in this catch-22. And so this has been one of the most strenuous. And difficult situations we've been in as a staff trying to come up with a solution. And I know it's caused the same anxiety in council members as well because you're pitted in this situation of being compassionate and yet ensuring the integrity of your beauty, Bidwell Park, and other creeks and waterways. So I just want to stay focused on the goal because as soon as we start going into the trappings of dealing with an issue this moment, we get off the track of coming up with a longer-term solution. And so we've put our heads down and we're trying to get to the longer-term solution so that we can get folks out of the parks and into a more proper place for them to be sheltered. And so that's really the goal that we're focused on. And as difficult as that is to say, because I know there's degradation taking place in those spaces right now, we have to stay focused to get that long-term solution in place. Which is housing. Which has always been housing. We had the shelter. If we don't have the space. Wherever we can get them. Yeah. But saying for eight years, matter is neither created nor destroyed. These people have to go someplace. COVID is just making it more particularly clear that we can't have these people in these spaces and we need to provide housing. So you're working on a report and you had hoped to have it ready for us today, but it's not. And will there be decisions for us to make? How long of a wait do we need to do this? Yeah. And that's the same question Joy and I keep asking each other. When do we get to that finish line to get council a product that they can say move forward and prosper? We've had conversations obviously with regard to price and terms related to certain properties. And so the council hasn't been idle in trying to find solutions. Unfortunately, the process by which government goes about implementing such products and products is not efficient. And so Joy's had the joy of being able to, you know, get the money and the money is not going to be in the way of the future. And so we're trying to see that process. And as difficult as it is, we are making immense strides every day. And so one aspect of that is the property. The other aspect is the funding of the property. And so there's various funnels that we're trying to make sure align, not only with regard to physical space, but also with regard to service provision. Those things just don't magically happen together. You have to coordinate it and it has to be done responsibly. And so when the answer, the answer to that question is as soon as possible. And so one of the things that I even hesitate to suggest is that if we do have something, I'd love to come back next Tuesday with another special councilman. I know some of them aren't being viewed as as productive as maybe some would like to see. But every inch that we move forward gets us closer to the finish line. And so I don't even know if that's feasible to even have something together by next Tuesday, but it may be. And I may be asked. I'm asking council for another special meeting if possible. If not, it'll be June 2nd potentially. And so we're going to take it day by day. And one commitment that you have from us is when we have something that can get us to that next benchmark, I'm going to ask you for a special meeting. Because we need to get folks out of the parks. We need to get folks out of the creekways and greenways. And we need to get them into a place with a little bit higher level of integrity and service provision so that they can get back on their feet and get going in a direction that really will help the community holistically. Them individually in the community whole. In whole. So that's our goal. And we're sticking to that vision on the end versus trying to get caught up in these small trappings in between because we won't get anywhere if we continue to do that. Joy, recognizing that permanent supportive housing is the ultimate goal is one of among the options that you're working on right now is a sanctioned encampment appointment. Is that a part of one of those? I can't help with that. So it's twofold. One, we have had conversations with regard to potential sites for a sanctioned encampment. I actually just had a conversation today. It's a site that Joy has been able to visit here very recently. And so it's still in the evaluation phase. A part of that evaluation is that we're going to have to get the site back on the ground. And that evaluation is not only the site but also the service provision thereon. And so those conversations are still ongoing. There's nothing imminently within site. However, there is a prospect potentially that could be. And that could be more imminent than maybe even some of the longer term sheltering solutions. So we're working on these. And I think that if it can work out, we're going to bring it back in front of council. And get even more people involved. And that's either a thumbs up or a thumbs down. But at this point in time, that's not on the front of the stove. It's on a back burner. But it's going to start boiling soon. And we hope to bring it forward. Thank you. I think timing, again, is of the essence. And creative thinking and out of the box solutions is what, you know, there's different pieces to the puzzle. And with FEMA limiting the extension to the May 31st of the motels, my first priority is determining a transition plan for those individuals residing in those motels. Other questions? We did receive some comments. How many did we receive? Unengaged, Chico, Civic. Unengaged, we received 25 comments on the on this item. And a lot of them didn't indicate whether they support, opposed, or remain neutral on it. But I did, there was one support, three opposed, and then 11 that were neutral. And I will read those names. It is, I apologize. We received it from Nicole Norton. C예요 C예요 C예요 C예요 C예요 C예요 C예요 C예요 C예요 C예요 C예요 C예요 C예요 C예요 C예요 C예요 C예요 C예요 C예요 Fedorchuk, Terrace Lee, Lee Robert, Susan Smead, Dustin Vargas, Karen Wilhoyt, and the last one was Rob Berry. And did we receive any email comments? Let's take three minutes to review these. And longer if needed. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for that comment. That was an extraordinary exchange, I thought, when you described to us why new encampments stay where they are right now and are not being, right now, being dealt with. You know, that's probably too harsh a way of describing it. But if there's any evidence that it doesn't matter if this council was conservative or liberal, of whether the chief had more discretion or less discretion, all that chatter all comes down to what you guys just said. We are doing what CDC tells us to do. We are doing what a conservative or liberal council would do, which is not put them in a cycle where they're going to be back in the same place in 24 hours. It just seemed like quite a reality check for us that there are factors beyond our control. That are dictating where we are. And you're taking a long-term solution, which we're not talking years. We're talking months. You know, I totally support that. And I think we just hope that message gets out there, that there's nothing that this council did, if we're not being blamed for COVID-19, that has caused any of the impact, impactment that we're, what we're feeling now. It's the fact that we have homeless people that we can't move. We have no place for them until we have other solutions. That was a long-winded way of saying it, but it does get frustrating to be blamed for things that, you know, there aren't a lot of alternatives. And the solutions for which, which, which we have been saying for quite some time, this is the solution. Housing first, get people housed, get them services and get them into permanent supportive housing, which is exactly what we've been talking about ad nauseum. Just now we have some money, I guess, to contribute to it given it's COVID. And we have a public that's ready to engage with that appetite because there's a public health communicable disease that's related to it. I think I've seen this before. I just want to thank, thank the city manager for his vision in hiring a homeless solutions coordinator. I think we can see just in the very short time that we've had that person that we're suddenly making huge advances on things that have been plaguing us for a number of years. And I'm hopeful that, I'm hopeful that we can retain a person in that position because the issue is going to be with us. And I think that's something that we've been talking about for a long time. So, thank you. Okay. So now it's time to adjourn the meeting. I suppose one thing we should have talked about in our resolution discussion is the time of meetings to start. When we initially said that we would go to one meeting a month, we decided that we would meet at 530. And since then, we've had the city clerk, poll everyone to see if 530 was something that we could do going forward and heard back from a couple of people that that was not a solution that they could continue with. So I'm wondering, can we have our next meeting at 530 or should we switch it back to our regular time of six? 530. 530. Would 530 work? For June 1st? Yes or no. I'm more concerned that why are we changing the statutory time of our meetings? I mean, we're expecting people. People are expecting us at six and now we're changing it. I know the workload's there, but it's 30 minutes. You're not knocking anything out. A particular one is for a closed session. Yeah. So council meeting will start at six, but if there is a need for a closed session, the request is that we start at 530. Yeah. So again, I reiterate, I understand that the public is not going to see that any different, but why are we changing the statutory time of our meetings? Why aren't we starting them at 6? Because there was a request to have some discussion prior to the council meeting at closed session. So with that, we will adjourn to an adjourned closed session meeting in conference room 1 at 5.30 and then to the regular city council meeting on Tuesday, June 2nd at 6 o'clock. I was hoping that the city manager was going to have some kind of report on the incident about the North Valley Harm Reduction Center and the accident. So maybe that's something you can have. I was expecting the public meeting. We've adjourned the meeting, Randall. You adjourned it over my speaking. Point of order. Are we allowed to have a... A report on something that's not on the agenda? No. I can't... I'm up for hearing the report, and it's information that I'd like to have, too, but... Oh, not an agendized discussion. I just wonder whether the city manager... I had asked him a question, and it ended up... We didn't have a city manager's report agendized, Randall. I don't think that that is something... Okay. Well, we'll put that off for another few weeks. Okay. Okay.! Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
