No.  Council Member Yahtzee?  I don't see any other hands.  Go ahead, Jessica.  Yes.  I have a cheese that I haven't done  that's still really really really really really  not investing in college and resolutions for our school.  We had all these three-month degrees.  We suffered with 2018 in the campfire.  We had the most complex fire since then.  We had fires before that.  And those new major impacts in our county,  in our county, in our area.  We had a plan that's going to be ending  now that we've been sitting here.  But our plan is old.  So it's just a matter of how many more people  from that poverty to what we want to see.  Because if we can't get it set up better than that,  and assuming that we don't need to,  that's not what's on our plan either.  Or if we provide housing for them,  that we're going to encourage other people  to come out of areas.  I see that comment, and it just kind of  from our mayor, and it's just,  well, really, that's an excuse  from that way to care for who you have,  because we're afraid that people will come here.  So, yeah.  So when we had our election,  it just wasn't nice to people who were  not vaccinated in our rural health.  Not as much as we were  when we were supposed to go out to study.  So we're getting more opportunities  like tonight and in the future.  We're not going to be like the East Everland  in fact, that we need more scientific  resolutions to be on services  for everybody, including the Dixie too.  And in order to get them to come too.  So we're going to talk about the Resource Center,  and that's going to be held.  All these people are involved.  They're studying.  They're going to be bringing in the places.  They're being part of it.  Because they need to be used.  Now it's going to be a whole new semester.  They're not going to leave us sitting  and looking for food for us.  Everything's here.  And we need to do better.  So anyway, that's why there's two or four comments.  How does it sound?  Thank you, Jessica.  I'm just going to recommend  the hospital program.  I think it's kind of just participating  in the industry.  I'm going to see if I can chat.  I'm glad you're here, Rebecca.  Hello.  So thank you for all of these comments.  Just calling to remind you that  my first start going to the council meeting  there was a person who called himself  a financial planner.  And a person called himself  a professional strategist sitting on the council.  And years later, he's still out of the city.  And our hands are ruined with no long-term plans.  And he's probably raised no long-term plans  with any of the rest of the state.  Not even other than the White House.  The White House plans probably  the most detailed and flushed out plans.  And instead of the seat of the federal law,  I'm talking to people who have  to get serious volumes.  So, you know, this whole prank on the home  is for you.  And, you know, for pushing people out of their perks  and curfews.  And I'm telling you,  I'm telling you more than just  a meeting's length of the last three or four days.  When they're tangled up in what's being known about them.  That said, when this started,  I didn't like the plan.  The plan was to move certain things away  from the public eye,  from public discourse,  and not really give anything other than just  lower the level of response from the citizens.  So the response from the citizens was lower.  They'll come over here.  The plan is clean and nothing is really  needed for it at the time of the plan.  So that is the amount of serious issues.  The other person who is a job,  who is an assistant city manager,  who got ruined in the city, you know,  well, why do we have an assistant city manager?  Why did my farm and my business,  you guys,  have clearly got removed?  Why did we remove the position  and why did we get fired?  Who can teach management and the police  and collaboration and sign off on the  that removal of that position that's what i discovered  um  i appreciate what you're doing  um  yeah we're hearing that people aren't able to hear the sound or that it's muffled  so  and i'm going to ask me that um  um  on december 27 2020 the federal government enacted hr 133  the consolidated appropriations act of 2021 which included 638 million dollars nationwide for a new  low-income household  to  emergency assistance  it  to make  clear I'm going to ask you that.           I'm going to ask you that.  I'm going to ask you that. I'm going to ask you that. I'm going to ask you that.  I'm going to ask you that. I'm going to ask you that. I'm going to ask you that. I'm going to ask you that. I'm going to ask you that.  and providing mass support for all children with disabilities  and parents and families with disabilities.  We have a draft letter we'd like to get out in front of our private,  which is why we're coming to you via telephone after about 30  times a day on the agenda and the report as we meet.  There is a proposal that's being  discussed that would be around  customer response.  So we need to access each of the departments and  obviously the draft will be carried right there and  we'll report what we need.  So I'm going to refer to all of you  who have access to the letter. I spoke to  the capital letters at the library and I will always  be available to  contact you with questions or concerns that you can have  in advance of the process.  I believe we passed our time there as well.  Yeah, we are working on our sound issues.  So, um,  Alright, um, we're going to wait  to proceed on our next item.  We're just going to have a nice little conversation  while they try to work on the sound issues because  apparently Channel 11 is not getting sound.  So, but, um, Eric, unless you want  to give a really long report.  Yeah.  Okay, I'm just concerned about making sure that we're  Do we have any confirmation yet? I haven't heard any.  I'm just concerned about making sure that we're  going to be able to get the sound issues  and we can check in with the  board and see what they think might resolve it.  I think the work group is going to be okay  so I'm wondering if they're going to be able to  get the sound issues.  Yeah, they said the sound, either I'm hearing  the sound quality is non-existent or it's just really muffled for all of us.  Right. So whatever the council would like to do,  if you'd like us to go ahead and pause and wait?  No, because I don't think you're going to be able to determine if  we actually have the sound back.  So, um,  you know, and if folks can hear me at home and they want to go on  and watch the meeting, they can do that via the website as well  until we have Channel 11 back up and running.  So why don't we have Linda, why don't you come up and present?  We'll do that.  Okay, so we'll move on to our next item, which is  on the regular agenda,  item 5.1, consideration of renaming  Tiger Ponds as a  Peace Ponds nature area.  I think I lost the screen here.  And citizens  wishing to speak on this item should  raise their hand at this time.  So please raise your hand if you are interested  in speaking on this item.  Okay, just a minute.  Council Chair?  Yeah.  Okay, this one?  Oh, here we go.  Sorry.  This one's not on, so I can't  I can't, there we go.  Okay, great.  Unfortunately, I'm going to try to  look from there because I have nothing on this screen.  So, and my glasses.  So can you hear me okay with my mask?  It would be better if I took it off because I  sorry, I apologize.  I believe you've had your mask on.  I can't see your shots, or at least  Yeah, I have a  You can't, no.  Sorry.  Yeah, no one can hear me now.  They can't.  Thank you.  Can you hear me okay?  Hopefully the audience  We can hear you fine, yeah.  Hopefully the audience can too.  So I'm just going to give a brief, just kind of a  little brief history about Tiger Ponds.  We call it Chico's Urban Wildlife.  We're a small group of people who live in the  Chico's Urban Wildlife.  This is a beautiful picture of what we see out there  and we're seeing even more water and more wildlife  than we have in the past.  So just a brief history, it's a 40 acre parcel.  Everybody knows it's by Little Chico Creek,  just by the Coles parking lot.  The three ponds were formed by the  gravel mining that was done by Tiger Construction  during the 1960s to bring the  highway over the Bidwell Park.  They accidentally ruptured the  groundwater in the back pond.  There's actually three ponds.  And then it filled up with groundwater as well as  precipitation and rain.  In 1990, a consortium of educators group came together.  Dick Corey, Mr. Dick Corey was one of the founding members.  And they were advocates for the pond and were  encouraging the city to acquire the property.  It was in private hands.  So what my understanding is that Tiger had abandoned it  and then it became private property.  And then they asked the city to purchase it in 1999.  And then the city also developed a habitat plan  implementation plan in 2008 is when the city  was first established.  And they allocated redevelopment funds for that.  The use of the ponds is a stormwater retention area  for neighboring housing developments in the Chico Mall  since 1980.  It provides a wetland habitat for a wide variety  of plants and wildlife.  My understanding is that we see wood ducks there  that we don't see in other areas.  A lot of wood ducks there.  So again, the habitat plan recommended  desilting and deconnecting the ponds  to keep the fresh water.  So the back pond is the fresh water.  The two front ponds are the storm water.  The idea was to do a level of water  and then put some heavy between them  so that kept the fresh and the storm water separate.  That was one of the things in the plan.  Also do some desiltation.  So because there's a lot of tule and silt  building up in the ponds.  Picnic tables and other amenities.  But that was a cost of $2.6 million.  So this is kind of the  water down.  That's a bad pun I guess.  But we modified the plan so that these were things  that we were looking at what we could do  not at that high price tag.  So this would be a bike path trail  all the way around.  And the separation of ponds  was to occur through here.  So that's now been removed from the concept plan.  So we've been moving forward with this  modified concept plan  for tiger ponds.  We have current concerns  as we talked about.  The nutrients and the growth of the tule  and the cattails.  And also the continued growth of non-native invasive plants.  The culvert as you see here.  The ponds drain to little  and the Pico Creek is too small.  And our industrious public works crews  came up with this beaver grate  to prevent the beavers  because they also exasperate.  Not only is it too small, but the beavers  like to use it for their own use.  And block the pond, the culvert quite often.  So that causes the water to rise  and sometimes even cover all the way up to the freeway there.  Then the culvert replacement  and other improvements included  is also included in the city's  storm water resources plan.  Which is good because that allows us to be able  to go for grants.  So it's a prime habitat restoration  grant project in the future.  And because it is in the plan,  we now have the ability to further that  effort to get funds to do some improvements  to the culvert.  And other improvements.  But it's not abandoned.  We have been taking care of it.  We have removed, there was a nice unsightly  cycling fence around it.  We've removed that fence.  Now it's much more inviting to the public.  We have done a lot of invasive plant removal.  We've actually, the young rugby club,  we're removing blackberry on the coal side  next to the culvert there.  We've since then planted red buds in their place.  And then also,  we've done, we tried to do the all around trail  around with the lines for  workforce development crews.  But you know, as vegetation grows,  we need to go back and groom those trails again.  So Mr. Corey is proposing,  he went to the commission  and he would like to rename the ponds  Peace Ponds.  Peace Ponds is what he wanted to take the Tichert  off of it.  And his intent was to instill tranquility  of the natural resources.  He's always been an advocate, a tremendous advocate  for, he's got a long history  and his whole family has a history  and has enjoyed the ponds for many years.  And he would like everybody else,  including school children, to enjoy the ponds  as much as he has and his family has.  He also thought that the Peace Ponds,  he actually wanted Peace Park, actually,  is what he wanted.  And Peace Park, he wanted to elevate it  so that it would have equal status as the other parks,  but to garner interest so that perhaps  we could get donations to make the needed improvements  to the park.  So he went to the Bidwell Park and Playground Commission  Oops, I guess,  to try to rename the ponds.  And we went to the Policy Advisor Committee first,  who made a recommendation  to the Bidwell Park and Playground Commission  in February of last year.  The park, the commission didn't really necessarily  want to name it a park because it really isn't a park,  it's more of a natural area.  So that's when they are proposing  Peace Ponds Nature Area as a suggested name.  for the park.  Or for the ponds, excuse me.  And that is really my presentation  unless there's any questions.  Alright, and I know you  you know, obviously  put a lot of time and effort into this.  We appreciate that.  And I think at the onset of this conversation  we should say that  we appreciate his,  Mr. Corey's,  support of the ponds as  you know, he's had a long history.  He's definitely trying to do the right thing  has a very good thing in mind here.  I had a couple of concerns  which from the information that we had  that he hasn't necessarily  or we don't have any official letter from  Tichert Construction  in regards to the name or whether  they hold the legal rights or if it was through  an agreement that they were given the name of the ponds.  Not that I'm aware of.  I know that Mr. Corey has reached out to Tichert Ponds  a couple times, at least three times he's told me.  And my understanding  it was abandoned, but I don't necessarily  know the total history, but he has not  heard back from them after his repeated  attempts to talk to them.  Okay, and then, you know, often times in areas  like this when you're removing a lot of  source material and putting it into use  like we did for the raised freeways, which was  the original, like you mentioned, the original  start to this, there's a reclamation  plan which  can be filed with both the State  and the Fed, and this is obviously going  back to the 60s, so I don't know  if that existed then, I know it exists now  whenever you move material  around this size and it requires  the future project  and exactly what it looks like, and  often times it also designates  a name. So that would be my concern  is that we're, you know, trading on a  name that's been legally approved  in some way, shape, or form.  And I doubt they dug this big hole without having  someone approve it, so.  There's got to be some process  where a reclamation plan was actually approved  and would likely mention the name  too, so. I could do that research and see  if that's a possibility.  Yeah, I don't know if anyone else has  any questions. I mean, I  definitely would agree with  you know,  the area being important to the  City of Chico and making improvements  when we can afford them, and you know  obviously getting grants makes  sense as well too. Does anyone  else have any comment?  My final  comment was just that  it seems a little odd having  one person in Chico County  and maybe in absent sort of  a City of Baltimore contest, something  that's a little odd. I don't think  anybody's necessarily not in favor  of changing the names, but just  wanted to be more involved.  With the few little small  one-time surveys that I've seen,  not a lot of people are super  excited about that. But I agree  with the intent. I think there's  some really neat things that we could  do. Sorry, I know a lot of people  that live over in that subdivision  and the white body of the room  involved there. I mean,  I think that's a good point.  I absolutely love having this  background. I mean, I have a great  piece of go set and take the kids  and whatnot. So I think the intent  is that I just want to see people  help them out and really create  the involvement.  Any other questions or comments?  Yeah, I was just interested to  ask the councillor's  thoughts on that.  The reality is,  because I've been involved in  Tiger Ponds, I met Dick Corson  about 15 years ago when I was interested  in turning that into a bird sanctuary.  He'd already been working on it  for about 15 years. But the  reality with those ponds is  that nobody is interested.  And it would be ironic  now, I think,  to seek public  input on a name on something  that has been completely ignored  except by one person, really.  And Dick Corry pushed the  city, pushed Brendan V. I remember  going to Brendan long  before I was involved with the city in any way  and he had this book this  thick of the  plan and it was all  motivated by this  one guy.  To  Mayor Coolidge's question,  it's difficult for  me to imagine that if  Tigard, and Linda I'm asking you this,  that if Tigard abandoned  ownership and  then it was sold,  and it sounds like it's been sold twice since then,  that there would be any claim  left to that name.  Is that...  I would have to do the  research to find out, but that was my understanding  is that it was abandoned.  I don't even know who the private property owner was  and perhaps I could go back and check with Brendan  if he knows in the past. But  I can look and see  whether there is any claim under the  recommendation plan they may have filed.  I'd like to ask the city attorney.  Is  there a precedent for  once somebody has  sold a parcel  for that parcel to  for that necessarily to  retain their name or  for them to  demand that their name still be attached to that  parcel?  Barely.  So  the  way you describe  is possible,  but to this  kind of point,  it would require further research  to determine whether or not  someone wanted to  as a term  or condition  wanted to  .  I would encourage  further research  to answer that question.  Thank you.  All right.  Public comment?  Madam Clerk?  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  the Chico Mall, is he polluting the ground water?  Is that one of the sources of pollution for the ground?  I don't know, but that's the first question I had  when I first learned about the ponds.  The first time I went out to the pond,  they'd actually treated the way by an unleashed,  unrestrained, aggressive dog of large size,  and I went straight to the pollution department  to complain about it, and still took them about two weeks  to dislodge that can.  Last time I was out there, it was about two months ago,  and there was a guy with a huge, huge, giant camp out there,  and he had little solar lights, like the little trail warmer lights.  He had rocks like ash-kin brown,  rocks like landscape rocks,  and he had little gravel pathway that was closest to the camp.  So the third thing is all the traffic that's up to our hospital  is really bad.  The malls and all the stuff that's in that area  is closed right into the dirt.  So these are great things that you're ignoring,  and you're worried about it changing.  And this is what I'm talking about going back to  the first time I was in the city of Tuna.  It is not pragmatic, it is not forward-looking,  it is not sustainable,  and you're just driving the city to a cross.  If you want to tie your cross to the beautiful and change the name,  I don't really care about the name.  I care about what it looks like.  Every time I come out here, there's crabs, there's dogs,  and you have to look around every corner and look up,  and you can see different animals.  So they've got a camp that you're interviewing.  So, you know, the fact that this is even coming up is just blasphemy.  It makes me wonder what the parks people are doing.  It makes me wonder if these other parks people are actually doing on the weekly,  if they have the time to sit around and talk about it.  I don't know.  Have a good night.  Thank you, Jeff.  He was our last speaker.  All right.  And I will say this item was brought forward from the Parks Commission,  so that's why we're addressing it.  Comment?  Council action?  Yeah, I'd like to speak to it.  So, you know, I think what both of the speakers are saying interprets this  as a move by the city to take over a development project, which it's not.  This is Mr. Corey's attempt to package this up in a way that he can seek outside donations  so that he can improve this area without the city's involvement.  He is looking to do a, to create a veterans,  a memorial there and veterans events.  You know, all this guy wants to do is make this a better place.  And he feels that if he's got a name that he can market rather than Tichert Ponds  to various organizations that may donate to this restoration,  that he can actually achieve something out there.  So, if all Mr. Corey needs to better attract veterans,  and if all the funding for his restoration of this is a name change  that was unanimously approved by Midwell Parks and Playgrounds Commission,  then I'll make the motion to approve that name change  to Peace Park, Peace Ponds Nature Area.  So, it's involving this pocket for some time and .  So, we have a motion and we have a second.  Any further comment?  So, I would actually say that, you know,  until we get the legal question answered,  we shouldn't move forward.  I think it would just be a bad way.  Like you said, I don't know if there's a reclamation plan  or if the name was designated under it.  I don't know if, you know,  We haven't had anyone look into that.  We haven't talked to the company.  We haven't researched the title.  So I think that's important to do  prior to moving forward on anything like this.  While I appreciate Mr. Corey's dedication,  I think that we need to be careful, of course,  not step into any potential landmines here.  I'd be happy to amend my motion  and make it subject to a determination  that there is no dispute over the previous name.  I accept that, Senator.  All right.  So, Madam Clerk, go ahead and take it off.  Council Member Brown.  Aye.  Council Member Denley.  No.  Council Member Huber.  Yes.  Council Member Morgan.  No.  Council Member Tandon.  Yes.  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds.  No.  Vice Mayor Reynolds.  Mayor Coolidge.  I'm going to say no,  but again, I'd rather, you know,  have the horse before the cart  in this particular instance and actually find out.  And I also think that some more community involvement  and the name change,  but I do not want that to be on record  as not being appreciative of Mr. Corey's involvement  in this.  And I think yes or no,  I think all council members share that.  Okay.  And that failed 3-4.  So, I'd like to make a motion to send this item  to staff for review and at a later date bring it back  to council, possibly with different names involved.  Second.  Second.  Second.  Second.  Second.  Second.  Second.  was to send it back to staff? I'll send it back to staff and then possibly a review  of the name.  Okay. Council Member Brown?  Aye. Council Member Denley? Aye.  Council Member Huber? Yes. Council Member Morgan? No.  Council Member Tandon? Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds? Yes.  Mayor Coolidge? Aye. Carry 6-1.  All right. Moving on to item 5.2.  And if there are citizens wishing to speak on this item, please now  raise your hands on the Zoom program. Do we have any confirmation on the fact  that our sound's been restored or not? It is actually getting better.  Okay. Good. Item 5.2, consideration of an  Upper Park Road parking fee implementation plan and a request  for capital funding in the fiscal year 21-22.  Mr. Guft. Thank you,  Honorable Mayor, Vice Mayor, and Council. It's a pleasure to speak tonight. Thank you  for the opportunity. This is the item regarding Upper  Park Road parking impact fees that was  last heard by City Council a little over a year ago  in March. And Council at that time had asked that we come back with an implementation  plan to see how this would roll out and how we would put it into use in  Upper Park. So, quick overview.  We're going to start with the first slide. We're going to understand there's some new Council members, too. We'll just kind of give a few slides of  historical review of previous discussions. Discuss the  key components, the key elements, if you will, of the implementation plan.  And then end on the recommended action. So, we've actually discussed  this for quite some time at the Park Commission level. Middle Park and Glacier Commission  started these discussions in 2018 and 2019  and really probably talked about it at most of the monthly meetings. So, it's  had quite a bit of public engagement.  Public interaction and discussion over the last few years. They made a  formal recommendation to the City Council on December 3rd of 2019.  Council had some more robust conversations and heard more public  feedback and sent it to Internal Affairs. Internal Affairs Committee heard it in February  of 2020 and had some more public  engagement and discussion and then agreed with the fee proposal but  felt that the full Council should consider the fee. So, they pushed it back  up to Council. Council last heard it.  Council has worked with Council to really start having this exercise  and make that right in the gate, there's a paved section for quite some time. Then it gets into the  unpaved section just past Horseshoe Lake. So that's really what the Park Commission focused  on at the time. And it's just received a lot of damage over  the years. It's got kind of an outdated design that's, if you will,  it's, you know, there's a slope this way and it's inboard. It's got inboard to the slope.  So it's, you know, it was built in the 40s and 50s where it collects water,  sends it to the inside or the interior of the road, and then pushes out the culverts that then  continue out to the watershed. So it's a really outdated design that's really  maintenance intensive. And so over the decades, the use has just  increased. And it's just been a big maintenance burden for the city to  maintain that up there. Again, it's almost five miles long from that section.  It's kind of interesting. A lot of people don't know how long that is. So there's a large  storm in 2012 that really did a lot of erosion damage. And when I got in my role  in my current role in 2015, I saw staff each  year bringing lots of material up there,  a lot of labor hours up there. They would, you know, grade the material, compact it, only for it to wash away  the next large rain event. So I kind of determined that we're putting  good money to bad. So stop, time out, let's get our hands around this, get a plan  and come up with a redesign and put a project together  to reconstruct the road. And something I think that's also important for everybody to know  that the use has dramatically changed over the decades. We commonly  say we're not a town of 40, 50,000 anymore. We're a city of 110,000.  And that really shows in the vehicle trips over the decades on Upper Park Road. We put  traffic counters out in 2017 and measured over  450,000 vehicle trips up there in one  year. I suspect it's well over 500,000 now post-campfire and due to the  COVID pandemic. So in 17 and 18, the city  retained Pacific Watershed Associates to prepare an assessment  study. And PWA, as we call them, they're  an expert engineering and  design firm that has large contracts with  private companies like Sierra Pacific Industries, the state park system,  the Federal Forest Service. They design and maintain long  stretches of wildland, if you will, roads up in the mountains. And so  they have a lot of experience designing and maintaining roads such as the upper portion of Upper Park Road.  They found over 40 significant erosion sites  and those are delineated in kind of the background there is a topographic map and those are  shown or delineated with the blue dots.  There's multiple impacted and completely failed culverts. There's over 50 culverts in the area and most of them have just completely collapsed due to age and are impacted due to erosion and sediment load.  Again, the outdated inboard design is what accelerates the erosion. So we're looking to redesign and reconstruct it with an outboard design, make the road surface robust enough that it prevents erosion from happening and it kind of sheet flows the water off and continues downgrade through the remainder of the watershed into big chunks.  So the assessment study was purposeful because it would position us well for grants and we did find a state water resource control board grant that was designed to prevent erosion and sediment load into local waterways.  And so we applied for that grant with the new plan and success. We were awarded a little over $700,000 to produce the project and deliver the project and costing has come in for the total project of just over a million dollars.  And so the bulk of it, 30% of it, is funded by the state grant. There is a 25% match requirement. We put 29% on our application in the hopes to compete a little bit better, which I think was fruitful because we did receive the award.  So we have the funding, the 29% match in existing capital projects that we funded for this project and an in-kind labor of my staff.  Originally it was proposed to repair in three phases.  Okay.  So we had the funding constraints. The first phase was, which we've already completed internally. There was, you know, five or six significantly impacted sites that we repaired to at least let public safety vehicles pass.  And then, of course, we wanted to reconstruct the road in two additional phases, kind of half, if you will.  And so now with the grant, we'll do the whole thing at once, which we're pretty excited about.  So the project is currently scoped and designed and it's in the CEQA environmental review process now.  We're hoping to get it out of that soon and deliver the project in the summer 2021 construction.  So most likely a late summer construction period.  So access and fees were discussed at numerous Goodwill Park and Playground Commission meetings.  And the Park Commission unanimously recommended that no vehicles are allowed past Salmon Hole.  And I will say, I think the bulk of the Park Commission's discussion was around vehicular access.  They heard from a large faction of the community that wanted no vehicle access past Horseshoe Lake.  There's a lot of, you know, due to the intensive use now, there's a lot of vehicle conflicts with pedestrians, equestrians, and bicyclists.  And so there's a large portion of the community that wants no vehicle access past, excuse me, Horseshoe Lake.  There's also a part of the community that wants full vehicle access all the way to the very top.  So, again, that was kind of the main point of the Park Commission's discussions in a lot of senses.  But they did recognize the importance of an impact fee.  Again, we're not looking at this as a parking fee.  It's more of a parking impact fee to offset the...  It's a parking impact fee to offset the maintenance and operational obligations due to the intensive use up there.  So we landed on $2 per vehicle as a daily parking impact fee.  And we benchmarked many other agencies in the state with similar parks or similar parking situations.  And we were quite lower than a lot of those agencies that we benchmarked.  So we started out with a $2 per day parking impact fee, a $25 annual pass option.  And then there's some exemptions there that the Park Commission voted on, too.  Free parking for seniors, disabled, low-income households.  And then free parking during large special events such as Hooked on Fishing and National Parks Day.  So the council first heard those items on December 3rd, directed to Internal Affairs to consider at the February 2020 meeting.  Internal Affairs heard further public comment and agreed with the fee recommendations,  but I think really felt parking fee should ultimately be considered by the full council.  So the Internal Affairs Committee moved it up to the full council from there.  Council heard that the last, again. a little over a year ago and moved the following, to allow access to the end of Upper Park Road on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, once the road is reconstructed, continue the closure to vehicular traffic on Sundays and Mondays for rest and rehabilitation and allow vehicular access to Salmon Hole Thursday through Saturday. So as it is now, it'll be closed to vehicles past Salmon Hole Sunday through Monday, or Sunday and Monday, Tuesdays and Wednesdays, it's open all the way to the very top. And then Thursday through Saturday, it's open just to Salmon Hole.  just to Salmon Hole. Council moved to approve the proposed parking fee and provide the desired  exemptions through the annual parking pass. So the exemptions below will be handled through an  annual parking pass. So those that wish to take advantage of the exemption will need to  go through the pass application process through our office. And of course, the  leasing members, such as the golf course, council still wish to exempt those. And I think we could  pause for a quick second and chat on the golf course real quick, because I know we all received  a letter yesterday from the golf course. And it's always, you know, some of these items that could  be controversial, we seem sometimes to get these 11th hour letters. And I understand that and  recognize their concerns. And there's always been an intent to exempt golf course users and golf  course patrons. We recently learned, and that was, you know, per the last council meeting, to do that  through their membership through the annual pass option. And we recently learned that in 2020,  the bulk of their business, 80% of their business was from non-members, people that just went up  there to play around the golf for a day and they're non-members. So we recognize that's an issue. We  were always kind of under the assumption the majority of their membership is what played,  and that's how we were going to exempt them through the annual pass. So I think there's  some workarounds there. I'm a little concerned with enforcement. If we're not charging those  non-members for their daily use, that's going to be a challenge for us to enforce.  So we've simply had discussions recently with the golf course.  They're going to kind of be on the hook to enforce that. Then if we're not charging their non-members,  their patrons that just maybe go up there to have a burger at the bar and grill, which is great, we want to see  that. If we're not going to charge them for parking, then they're going to be on the hook for enforcement.  So I think there's a way that we could come to a conclusion collaboratively.  They're a great leasee. They've been involved and engaged in these conversations.  They had a member attend, I think, most of the park commission meetings. So I think there's a way to  come to a mutually agreeable decision. And if that's, you know, if it's maybe something that  we can't, then maybe that's a standalone item that we bring back to council for the full council to consider.  At that last meeting, though, a year ago, council directed staff to develop  the implementation plan in return for consideration. And that's why we are here now.  Excuse me. Thank you.  So staff retained, excuse me, Dixon Resources Services.  Dixon, as we'll call them, that they specialize in, you know, managed parking and  large municipal scenarios, similar parks and other areas. And they're also the consultant for  the downtown access plan. So there's a lot of continuity there. Dixon conducted a full site  assessment in July of 2020 and strongly agrees, in fact, unquestionably, that managed parking is  needed in Upper Park. I rode with them for a day. It was on a Wednesday, the particular day that I  got to ride with them personally in July. And we really saw the impacts of the vehicle load,  the road up there. There was a lot of, you know, vehicular conflicts with bicyclists, a lot of  instances where the wrong vehicle was too far up the road and was blocking traffic, trying to  maneuver to turn around. So we really got to see firsthand what's going on up there. So after their  site visits and drafting the implementation plan, Dixon really landed on the implementation plan  needs to solve the following elements. First, a way for visitors to pay for the daily parking  impact fee or to purchase an annual parking pass.  And this has to be an easy way. A way for the certain qualifying visitors to be granted free  access based on council's recommendation from the 2020 meeting. And a way for visitors to know if  there's available parking within the park. So they need an ample decision-making time before they  decide where they're going to park or just continue on. And then a way for city to drive  compliance with parking policies, so enforcement. Due to remoteness and staffing constraints,  the implementation plan strongly recommends extensive use of technology. So they strongly  recommend that we use technology. And we have to take advantage of technology to make this  successful. I think we all recognize our staffing bandwidth and we're not going to put a parking  attendant up there. So we really have to use technology if we're going to be successful in this  endeavor. To solve the guiding elements, Dixon identified these following key components that  will support the guiding elements. So with technology, they recommend a vehicle counting inventory  system, fully automated. Fully automated standalone payment kiosks. A license plate reader system for  not only tickets and annual parking costs but also for the use of parking. So we have to take advantage of  vehicle's annual passes but also for enforcement. So pay-by-plate scenario. Initial signage and  improve our wayfinding signage that's inside the park. And then a back-end fully automated  permit management system. So vehicle counting inventory, we intend to install counting speed  bumps with sensors in them at the main gate. And this will track in the exit portion. And then  also most likely in the golf course, on the golf course road so we know how many folks are  utilizing the golf course and we can subtract that from the total inventory. So we'll have a real-time  inventory of how many cars are up there at any given time. There's kind of a public safety aspect to this too.  Our park rangers and security contractor, when they close the gates at night, they'll know exactly how  many cars, if any, are still left up there. So there's a big public safety component too to having that  real-time inventory. The signage. So an interest sign shall be located directly after the main gate providing ample decision  making time. So it's a parking availability sign that will let folks know if parking is available. If it's not available, then  they have time to make a decision whether to drop their visitors or patrons off and find an alternative parking  solution. So we want to give them ample time to make sure parking is available. Visitors should also see a welcome to  build park sign. Please pay the parking impact fee or annual pass. Of course, the signage is going to be linked to the  vehicle counting system and should instruct annual pass or free parking pass holders to continue on  the road and to bypass the pay stations. Continued, the signage should advise visitors where the impact fee goes  towards and how it improves the park. So maintaining the road after it's been reconstructed, improving the  infrastructure up there, and even expanding the infrastructure up there. There's room for additional parking with some  expansion of some of the parking facilities up there. Clearly direct them to a kiosk and then of course promote the  option for mobile payment. We hope that a lot of folks take advantage of that. We're going to be working with the  City of Jackson to make sure that they have access to a mobile app and hopefully they're not driving, but maybe the  passenger pays for parking as they drive into the park and they don't even have to stop and get out and use one of the  automated kiosks. They can just do it by their phone. And then Dixon really suggested that we improve our wayfinding  signage inside the park, which we are working on now. They really thought we kind of had a harsh tone. A lot of our  existing signage says no glass, no alcohol, and they thought, well, why don't we change that? Again, it's about improving  the overall visitor's experience, too. Glass beverage containers are not allowed while visiting the park. So we're going to  make sure that we have that in place. So we took those suggestions forward. Of course, adopt a no refund policy and  include the impact fee and no refund policy to the park rules section of the Muni Code. These are what the, I'll blow  through some of these slides pretty quickly here. These are what the kiosks will look like. Fully automated, self-contained,  solar-powered, and will standardize to existing kiosks downtown. We think there's a minimum of two that are needed as you  turn into the park with the potential for a third in Horseshoe Lake.  These are the two options that the implementation plan suggested. Option one, again, as you pass Wildwood and make that right-hand turn  past the first gate, you go a little bit further and there's this cut-out area. That's where they suggest that we put the kiosks. And we  also have an opportunity to add, you know, 22 or so parking spaces there. The plan called for three kiosks there. We feel that we  could probably start with two and see how it goes with the potential to add a third. So we're going to have to make sure that we're  able to get a third at Horseshoe Lake.  Option two that they provided is kind of a multiple drive-through lane pay station solution. And this is nice, but I just, I really want to move away from any opportunity to congest Upper Park Road, whether it's somebody, you know, trying to fumble maybe with payment or if something's not working right, I don't want to congest Upper Park Road at all or give the opportunity to do so. So staff strongly recommends that we move forward with option one.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay. Okay.  a third at Horseshoe Lake. So license plate readers. The kiosks will be fully automated  and administer parking passes or annual passes using license plate numbers, so otherwise known  as the pay-by-plate method. And this will allow for the mobile app, much more convenient for  visitors, will give us a real-time inventory and inventory management solution. It's easy to  enforce. Enforcement will include, you know, our park rangers, park ranger vehicles will be  outfitted with license plate reader cameras on the top and maybe one for the parking  enforcement officer that utilizes a car downtown. But all they'll have to do is occasionally drive  up Upper Park Road, drive through the parking lot, and those license plate reader cameras will pick  up license plate numbers and recognize who's paid or who is not paid. And those that are not paid,  it will automatically generate a parking citation. This also reduces the opportunity for fraudulent  pass duplication, so there's no paper that somebody could copy.  There's no mirror hangers that somebody could also duplicate. And it eliminates litter from paper  tickets. I can just imagine if there's a paper ticket solution up there, they'd probably be blown  and littered all over the area or all over Upper Park. So there is a cost to this, and we're, you  know, we're going to have to improve some items up there to go fully automated if that's the route  that we wish to do so. We need to improve the data coverage up there, the Wi-Fi signal, so there's  really no reason to exercise that exercise that exercise that exercise that exercise that exercise that  exercise that exercise that exercise that exercise that exercise that exercise that exercise that  exercise that exercise that exercise that exercise that exercise that exercise that exercise that  exercise that exercise that exercise that exercise that exercise that exercise that exercise that  exercise that exercise that exercise that exercise that exercise that exercise that exercise that  exercise that exercise that exercise that exercise that exercise that exercise that exercise that  exercise that exercise that exercise that exercise that exercise that exercise that exercise that  exercise that exercise that exercise that exercise that exercise that exercise that exercise that  exercise that exercise that exercise that exercise that exercise that exercise that exercise that  are about $18,000 each, so $36,000.  So we've put a budget request in, a capital improvement project,  in the fiscal year 21-22 request for this at $108,000.  That is a lot of money to start out with, and I recognize that.  I do feel, though, that that's easily returned in the next year or two  with the parking impact fee revenue.  So maintenance parking is needed not just to offset vehicular impacts,  but to really now improve the overall visitor experience  and I will admit that when we first started out on these discussions,  you know, I was looking for a small revenue amount  just to offset some of the operational maintenance impacts,  something to fund maintaining the road once we invest all this money  to reconstruct it with its new design.  And so that's kind of where we were really landing on.  But now after going through this implementation plan  and working with Dixon on developing the implementation plan,  it's really turned to about improving the overall user experience.  I recently hiked Monkey Face with my family on a Saturday morning  and turned around and saw bumper-to-bumper traffic on Upper Park Road,  and I think that's a common occurrence now.  We're not alone.  I also recently enjoyed the Table Mountain Ecological Preserve area  with my family and hiked for a day,  and there was a parking fee included there.  It was $4.98, and my wife actually kind of laughed at me  because I realized it and had to jump online before we left,  and she said, no, that's...  You're proposing for Upper Park, and we had a laugh at it,  but I quickly paid the fee and printed out a parking pass  and put it in my vehicle and left.  So we're not alone.  A lot of other agencies are doing this  and using a small bit of revenue to offset the operational maintenance impacts  of the vehicular traffic in the area.  So with that, I'm recommending that we accept the implementation plan  and direct staff to implement in conjunction  with the Upper Park Road reconstruction project.  So again, we're not looking at implementing this right away or now.  We're looking at doing it after the project concludes  and then approve the...  $28,000 capital project during the fiscal 21-22 budget cycle.  That concludes my presentation, and we can answer any questions.  Any questions?  Mr. Morgan.  Eric, great presentation, and we've been talking about this for a long time,  and I know years and years ago,  one of the things that was talked about was a free day.  Did that come up at all?  Yes, that's included.  Multiple free days is included in the recommendation.  I was like, once a week.  It was like Wednesdays were free.  I know it didn't come up with this.  Years ago, it was like, give everybody a break on Wednesday or Tuesday, Thursday.  It never made it to the consideration.  It may have been discussed.  It was not recommended by the commission at any point,  but what was recommended was free days for some of the recognized local events,  like the Dunn Fishing National Parks Day and so on and so forth.  Great question, then.  All right.  Further questions?  I had one or two.  Okay.  I know some of the places like Irvine Finch Boat Launch on the Sacramento River,  a lot of people pull in there, drop off their people,  and drive out without paying the fee.  Is there anything that precludes people from a mother bringing a family full of teenagers  to Horseshoe Lake, dropping them off and not paying the fee?  No, not at all.  Great question.  This is not an entrance fee.  It's a parking impact fee.  So if you choose to park a vehicle  and utilize one of the available...  one of the available spaces, that's when you'll be charged the fee.  And I think we recognize there are going to be some impacts,  and we're going to have to work through those.  I think there may be a lot of folks that decide to just drop off the patrons  and then traverse out and find alternative parking areas.  And so Wildwood comes to mind.  We've had discussions with CARD on some ideas on how to prevent that from getting overloaded.  But they're faced with a similar situation, especially on weekends with all the events there,  that parking is completely impacted in Wildwood parking lots.  So there will be some minor impacts that we'll have to adjust.  Another question.  Your options one and two for the kiosk setup.  It looks to me, and maybe you can explain it in a way that I can understand it better,  but if it looks like a bunch of people are having to pull over and park to walk over to the kiosks,  that seems like that would create more of a sort of more congestion,  and people just driving through and sticking their card in and moving on.  Yes.  Yeah.  Understood.  And we think that this transaction process will be quick.  We're able to add 22 spaces in this turnout area.  But again, we're really going to promote and advertise that folks use the mobile app.  I think a lot of park users today will probably use the mobile app  and not get out of their cars at all until they've parked.  The other option, if this does become completely impacted,  would be to put that third kiosk in Horseshoe Lake just to keep people traversing through  and maneuvering through so we don't congest Upper Park Road.  And that was, you know, my big...  My big fear with the multiple driving lane options  is if one or two little things goes wrong with, you know,  somebody's trying to figure out their license plate number or whatever the case may be,  it's really going to start to stack and back up traffic pretty quickly,  especially on a Saturday or Sunday.  So that's why we've really looked at this option  and landed on this option as the recommended option.  I do have a question here, too.  So if you have an annual pass,  so you'll have...  The person have to still stop there,  and so that way,  if they have an annual pass, they can just go.  They don't have to stop at that car.  Correct. Great question.  If you have an annual pass, you'll just traverse right through and park.  And I think, you know, there's an online convenience survey that we conducted,  and a lot of people, you know, it was, I think, 80% were favorable  for some sort of nominal fee to park up there.  I think people recognized the need,  as long as it goes to maintaining and repairing infrastructure up there.  But I think most people, a lot of the feedback that we got,  will just pay the annual pass, $25,  get the annual pass through our office each year.  All right. Any other questions?  Yeah, I have one.  Council Member Dunham.  I was just curious,  and maybe this was in a previous discussion a long time ago,  but is there a reason that the kiosks are in the paved section  and not up past Horseshoe to use the dirt road?  What's the rationale for that?  The rationale was to capture as you first enter the park.  So from that gate forward, as you go past Wildwood  and make that kind of that hard right past the gate,  that's where...  The parking fee will be enforced.  So we want to capture anybody that...  Because we still have a lot of people that park, you know,  kind of on the road here in lower areas.  And so we want to make sure they have the opportunity to pay first.  Also, a cellular connection.  As we get further up east into the park,  there's less of connection opportunities.  So really, we're kind of bound to this first area in the Horseshoe Lake area.  Okay. That makes sense.  Mr. Bell, I have a quick question.  Go ahead, Alex.  Thanks so much.  Thanks so much for another fantastic presentation on this.  Do we have any plans for public engagement on this?  I know that we've been doing a lot of different types of meetings,  but as we're implementing and all the other species,  are we going to educate the community in different ways about the new case?  Absolutely, yeah.  There'll have to be a big public engagement deployment,  especially in the coming months,  ramping up to the, you know, reconstruction project.  I think that really gives us a good opportunity,  to, you know, don't, please mind the,  don't mind the dust type of thing,  that we're going to be in this pretty significant  and intrusive reconstruction project during the summer months,  and there'll be a great opportunity to really start signage  and educating the public.  We could hold, you know, education engagement opportunities at the city.  We could push it out on our social media outlets,  press releases, so on and so forth.  So we'll do everything we can to educate the public  long before this goes into implementation.  Thank you.  Thanks, Bruce.  I do have one more question on that.  So I know you mentioned that it would be by the license plate.  So if a family has two vehicles, do, would they,  and they have a pass, like an annual pass,  and for some reason they take the other vehicle,  they would still have to pay $2.  Is that correct?  Correct.  Okay.  All right.  Vice Mayor Adams.  So one of the questions was the 22 spaces of additional,  the parking that is included in this proposal.  Okay.  And then the selling of the annual passes and the distribution of those,  you said there's a semi-easy.  Is this going to incur a lot of staff time for selling those?  We were excluding a lot of different, you know,  seniors and low income and stuff.  So I was just curious on the actual distribution and purchasing of annual  passes.  Yeah.  Great question.  It will all be automated.  You know,  it'll be linked on our website and the automated system,  we'll do all of that.  Most of that for us,  the mobile app will do most of that for us.  The exemptions may be a little bit of a process for staff and we'll have  to work through that.  That might be an impact or workload for sure to,  especially some of the,  you know,  the low income validation and so on and so forth that we'll have to do  will impact staff.  But I don't think it's,  I don't see it being a significant impact and we should be able to adapt  to it.  Great.  Thank you.  All right.  Madam clerk,  how many speakers do we have?  I believe we have two.  All right.  Let's go ahead.  First speaker is Michael Sharp.  Go ahead.  All right.  You might be heard.  Yes.  Oh,  okay.  So,  Mayor Gould,  City Council,  and the Sousa.  Thank you.  I'm not going to speak.  I'm Michael Sharp.  I represent the Vindal Park Palsa.  And,  as you know,  we've sent in a couple letters.  We've been active in this,  in this initiative,  in the last several years,  all the time,  I've represented the meetings.  And,  it was,  it was nice to hear from city staff tonight,  that the golf course users would be exempt from this.  We feel strongly that the golfers are,  you know,  already paying the fee to equalize the facility.  So it was nice to hear that we have,  we have had productive meetings with city staff.  It's been,  it's been a great partnership,  a great collaboration.  But I just want to say,  tonight,  on behalf of the Vindal Park Golf Club,  and the users of the facility,  and,  and like I said,  it's nice to hear,  the golf course will be exempt.  And I look forward to working with city staff,  to figure out a way through science,  education,  and joint enforcement,  how we can come up with a beneficial solution for the golfers and the users of the golf course.  And,  with that,  those are my comments at this time.  I think there's,  no,  I think we should work out a suggestion,  and how we're going to manage it.  And of course,  I'm confident that we will come up with some solutions for the city staff.  I look forward to doing that over the next several months.  So thank you.  Thank you.  And our last speaker is Jessica Giannola.  Hi, Council.  I remember speaking on this in 2019,  and I,  I initially agreed,  and,  and proved that having a golf fee,  although I did have concerns for people who may not be able to afford it.  And it sounds like some accommodations may be made for people who can apply for a fee waiver.  I still,  still have concerns here with,  with paying for our parks.  Even like post-COVID,  so many people have been impacted post-COVID in their lives,  and,  and they really focused on what's available for free at this point.  Nature is a huge mental health relief,  and we have most beautiful parks in the area around here.  And it's just sad,  I feel sadness that we're looking at spending $108,000  to charge citizens to use their own park.  And all of this focuses on enforcing who can't afford it.  And we have these people who are privileged,  and people can afford to go in and pay this fee,  or get their annual pass.  Or who's excluded?  The golf members are excluded,  because they pay for it already.  Well, I think everybody in the city pays for it already.  We're already living in the city.  We're contributing in various ways,  different taxes,  unions.  And this is just something that the city should find a different way of funding the maintenance of our roads.  It's like any other budgeting plan that we have as individuals.  The city does too.  What's important,  and I've heard many people say the roads are important,  we should be focusing on those too,  and that is the parks.  And having people,  a portion of the population here,  pay for additional fees just doesn't seem right,  because you're excluding people,  and people can't just go to the park.  They're the wrong people to pay marble with.  They don't have the money.  They don't have the money in their pockets to go pay marble.  They don't have the bank to go pay marble.  So they can't even go to the park.  They have to hike in.  But they can't hike in.  What if they're disabled?  What if there's little children?  We're not thinking of everybody who's access,  who doesn't have access to a smartphone,  and can't use an app.  So I think the city's being very selfish in their own mind,  thinking only certain people can use the parks.  And if you don't fit into that bubble,  we don't get to use our parks.  So I think that your responsibility  is making sure that the roads are safe to drive on.  Let's not go into charging these parking fees  where our regular parks get filled up with parking spots,  and kids can't play at Wildwood.  That's exactly what's going to happen.  So I really don't support it anymore.  I don't at all.  I don't think you should be charging this,  whether you pay $4 somewhere else or not.  It's time. It's time, Jessica, thank you. Thank you.  That is the last speaker.  The council.  Well, I would make a motion to,  let me see how this is worded here,  accept the implementation plan and direct staff  to implement the plan in conjunction with the  the Upper Park Road Reconstruction Project,  and two, to approve allocating $108,000  during FY21-22 capital project budget cycle  for necessary technology and equipment  to implement managed parking in Upper Bidwell Park.  I'll take that question.  Mr. Huber, would you consider a friendly amendment?  Well, I hate to do this to Eric,  but it would involve, as they move forward with your motion,  finding a way to offer one free day a week  to get to Jessica's point,  not because it was Jessica that said it.  I don't know, well, if you're using technology, it'd be easy.  It'd be a little harder on the signs,  but we have all these rules, all this parking,  I get all of it.  I hate the idea of a parking fee in Upper Park.  I hate it, but I also know that we won't eventually  be able to keep,  we'll be able to keep the road up there.  But for all the other reasons,  could Thursdays be free or Tuesdays be free?  So everybody knows, right?  Thursday is your day.  If I may, so San Francisco museums have a free day  every one day a month.  Okay, you just lost me.  If San Francisco is doing it, I'm not interested.  No, but they have a free day.  A lot of cities have free days for their museums  one day a month.  I thought San Francisco was like a different country.  I thought San Francisco was like a different country.  So before I address that,  I'd ask Mr. Gustafson to come back up,  if you would please.  And at some point, did you assess a weekly free day  or a monthly free day?  Or you said you did look into some free days.  Can you tell us what you've looked into  and what you determined?  Yeah, there is,  I believe there's some initial discussion  on potentially one free day.  I can't recall if it was weekly or monthly,  but the discussion is on that.  But the discussion is turned to  really focused on the exemptions  that were listed for handicapped.  Those are the disabled, low-income seniors,  and then the leasee.  So that's where the free day landed.  But we're here to enforce the will of the council.  We will do so accordingly.  And I do think if that was the council's will,  that it would be easily achieved  due to the automation that we intend to put in place.  Thank you.  Are you specifying a day?  I am not, sir.  We would leave the day up to...  I would leave the day up to Mr. Gustafson's good graces.  And I mean, it doesn't have to be once a week.  It could be every other Monday.  I just like, Cape Breakers is closed every other,  I forget what it is.  I haven't been there in a long time.  But just something like that.  So people knew that if it really was that big a deal  or they really were that impacted, you know what?  On Tuesdays, everybody.  So if your amendment was to accept this,  subject to the Public Works Director coming back  with a recommendation for a,  what would that be, semi-weekly?  If it was every other week?  I'm not even going, I trust Eric.  For the Public Works Director to come up  with a plan for a series of free days.  I would accept that amendment.  Thank you.  Council Member Brown, are you?  Yes.  Accepting of that amendment?  Absolutely.  All right, further discussion?  Madam Clerk.  Council Member Brown?  Aye.  Council Member Dinley?  No.  Council Member Huber?  Yes.  Council Member Morgan?  Yes.  Council Member Tandon?  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds?  Yes.  Mayor Coolidge?  No.  Excuse me, carries 5-2.  All right, we're going to take a 10 minute recess.  We will be back in a minute.  We'll be back then, thank you.  Did you hear all that?  Oh my goodness, it's not for a whole lot.  Hey, Mark.  Did you get the second?  No.  Oh.  Okay, I can't remember what I did yesterday.  Don't tell us.  Oh well.  You went away?  I said that one.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay. All right, and basically what I wanted to do is reevaluate this and maybe re-look at it. is reevaluate this and maybe re-look at it. Some of those items in there  in there I'm not necessarily crazy about. I know originally Vice Mayor Reynolds was the one who  brought this forward, but having voted against it, couldn't do that. So I decided to bring this  forward, but I'd like to see us flesh it out a little more and maybe rediscuss. So any questions?  I have a question. Can you specify exactly what we're wanting here?  Well, ideally I'd like to send it maybe back to Internal Affairs to review it  and make changes as needed.  So, all right. Speakers? One speaker? Yes, Jessica Giannola. All right, let's go.  Well, I don't have too much to say. It's just interesting to see what you guys are going to  say tonight on the committee and how I get taking over.  I think it's important to note that we're not going to be taking over the group kind of community thing that we talked about on  last City Council and how the city should not be involved. I think you guys are back and forth on being involved in some way to no way to completely taking it over.  So I still support my original comments from a couple weeks ago in allowing the committee to continue as is.  So, I'm going to take it over.  Thank you.  Thank you. So that's just where I stand on that still. Thank you. That's actually, I do have one more and that's Addison Winslow. and that's Addison Winslow. Hi, yeah, thanks. It's just the nature of this thing, like a big report and that kind of item in there.  there. I would like to hear a little bit, if you have a discussion out of what particular items  to look at here. I know the report, the bulk of it was this whole sort of important reporting.  And it's definitely good to have a conversation with the benefits of that. I know there's this  case that sort of this whole, bring up like all housing prices anyway. But I think that really  neglects the fact that we have certain housing types and one bedroom apartments and studios  that just aren't being built whatsoever. And so when you have to include affordable housing  or lower income housing, developers tend to produce those types of housing. We're not getting  it all. So the design changes, they don't have that absolute rise in prices to sort of balance  either. Other interesting things.  It's all really vague. And so I like looking back into it because I thought it was sort of  lackluster in the first place. But there's an item on like telling staff to look into community land  trusts or something like that. And that's something that I think has a whole lot of value,  just absolutely given the fact that so much of our land is in private hands and that's sort of  pushing up the ante and what it takes to get land. And look at the struggle that Jack has just to  just acquire some sort of land.  And that's something that the city could help a whole lot. It hasn't in the past in this direction  just back in the years. So yeah, I hope you could discuss some of that particular time.  Thank you.  All right. So with that, I'd make a motion to send it to IA for review.  I second that motion.  Comments?  Can you repeat that again for me?  Just to send it to Internal Affairs for review.  Okay. Thank you.  I think I can just give a little context to this. I think at the time when this was discussed,  there was a lot of information on inclusionary zoning and a lot of things. But there was  a lot of things on the report that came back that we didn't hear some on. And I know the builders  and there was some public private partnerships on possibly getting some low income housing going. I  know we have around, I think, about a hundred or so people that are in the community that are in the  community that live in this area that live in this area that live in this area that live in this area that live in this area that live in this area that live in this area that live in this area that live in this area that live in this area that live in this area that live in this area that live in this area that live in this area that live in this area that live in this area that live in this area that live in this area that live in this area that live in this area that live in this area that live in this area that live in this area that live in this area that live in this area that live in this area that live in this area that live in this area that live in this area that live in this area that live in this area that live in this area that live in this area that live in this area that live in this area that live in this area that live in this area that live in this area that live in this area that live in this area that live in this area that live in this area that live in this area that live in this area  so we can just talk about it more and get more information.  All right.  We have a motion and a second.  Madam Clerk?  Council Member Brown?  Aye.  Council Member Denley?  Aye.  Council Member Huber?  Aye.  Council Member Morgan?  Yes.  Council Member Tandon?  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds?  Aye.  Mayor Coolidge?  Aye.  Carries 7-0.  All right.  Item 5.4, Vice Mayor Reynolds' request to discuss code enforcement policies,  citizens wishing to speak on this item should now raise their hands and zoom.  Thank you.  I'm just simply asking for council to allow our code enforcement to give a review to probably  internal affairs would be the best as to how things are going for them out there and what's  happening.  And I don't think we've really done a comprehensive review of the Chico Municipal Code at least  in the last probably 20 or 30 years.  And so I think it's just good.  I think it's good at times to review what we have on the books, what's working, what's  not working, what do we need, what do we have on there that we don't need to be able to  take care of blight and tenant issues and whatever it is that's happening in the community  to make sure that we have what we need to be able to continue to uphold and uplift the  codes in our community.  All right.  Any questions?  Vice Mayor Reynolds, I have a quick question.  This is Alex.  Yes.  I appreciate the summary.  Are there any specific codes that you're interested in reviewing or changing?  I think I just want a little bit more context of this.  I don't have specific codes.  Some of the specific items that come off at the top of my head are buildings and or properties  around the community that are blighted and continue to stay that way for a long period  of time.  And I'm not sure why.  So I'd like to hear from code enforcement.  Where the difficulty in enforcing on those things are.  And, you know, I've heard of various issues with landlords and college student issues.  There's animal issues.  There's storage of property issues.  So it was more, but blighted properties are my main reason for bringing it forward.  Okay.  I'll support the review.  I'm curious what comes back.  Thank you.  All right.  Anyone else?  Okay.  Public comment on this item?  I believe we have one.  Jessica Giannullo.  Hi again.  Gosh.  I would like to think or not have to think that when I hear Casey Reynolds asking for  a code enforcement review, that she's not looking for potentially something more than  giving you two blights.  The blight seems to be like a code word for a house, honestly.  I mean.  We're looking at code words and codes to move people and their belongings who have nowhere  to go, mind you, out of public sight.  It's just we are spending more money looking into this instead of spending money for its  resolutions.  Just another example of wasting our tax dollars instead of working together to find the resolution.  It's not arresting people.  We're looking for more ways to arrest people.  So I'm just really.  I was really disappointed in seeing this on the agenda.  I don't know.  I just wish that you guys could do better.  So now, the stuff arresting people for being poor and having nowhere to put their stuff  or their bodies and working towards providing somewhere for them to be.  That's what we should do as a city.  As city leaders, you guys are in charge of that.  You should do that.  Thank you.  Thank you, Jessica.  She was our only speaker.  All right.  And I would.  I would say that I was actually very happy to see this.  I think we have a lot of plywood in our downtown that's affecting our businesses.  I think we have some landlords, particularly of some corporate interests, that aren't taking  care of their properties the right way.  What code enforcement faces on cleaning up those properties and revisiting those properties  is difficult.  You know, I never thought I'd utter these words, but the city of Davis does a really  good job of this and complimenting them on it.  I've seen it down in that community in terms of how they, you know, adhere businesses to  this type of these type of principles.  And it just betters the entire community and the businesses ultimately benefit because  of it.  So I completely support this.  So.  So with that, I'll make a recommendation that we are a motion that we send it to IA to review  and discuss further.  I'll second that.  Okay.  Motion for myself.  Second from Council Member Tandon.  Madam Clerk.  Council Member Brown.  Sure.  Council Member Denley.  Aye.  Council Member Huber.  Yes.  Council Member Morgan.  Yes.  Council Member Tandon.  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds.  Yes.  And Mayor Coolidge.  Aye.  Carries 7-0.  All right.  Moving on to Item 5.5, Board and Commission Appointments.  Citizens wishing to speak on this item should now raise their hands in the Zoom program.  And I will turn this over to City Clerk, Debbie Pressel.  Thank you, Mayor Coolidge and Council.  At a special meeting that you held last week, you conducted the interviews of those citizens  interested in the Arts Commission, Bidwell Park and Playground Commission, and Planning  Commission.  We compiled the nominations that we asked Council to provide and for the four-year positions,  they are as follows.  Arts Commission, Danella Ferguson.  Louis Nava.  Kimberly Ranalla.  And Monica McDaniel.  For the Bidwell Park and Playground Commission, for the four-year positions, Anna Jeanette  Shadley.  Jeff Glatz.  Jesse Alexander.  And Megan Thomas Petty.  For the Planning Commission, it's Lindsey Pullen.  Tony Scott.  Paul Cooper.  And Larry Wall.  In addition, there's a fifth position on the Bidwell Park and Playground Commission with  a remaining term of two years that needs to update.  The Council can choose to nominate a candidate from the list of applicants that were provided.  In regards to the fifth seat needing to be filled, the Council can choose to use a balloting  process for voting on the three citizens who were nominated to move forward.  Those three citizens were Garrett Lyles, who received two nominations, Joshua Pierce, who  received one nomination, and Nancy Wolf, receiving four.  Since she did receive four nominations, the Council could choose, instead of voting for  one of the three, you could vote to actually confirm since there were four.  So, in addition, the individual nominations that I talked about a little bit earlier,  those all have to be confirmed by a majority vote of the full Council.  Likewise, with this final nomination.  So, I'm open to questions or for public input.  I don't see anyone with their hands up, so.  All right.  So, should we just...  Go for the balloting and you'll collect that and then we'll...  Well, I guess we can decide to do if that's how you want to do it.  Actually, what I would ask, if Council could make two different motions, the first motion  being to confirm the individual appointments that were made and that I read.  That will take care of the bulk of it and then you can decide how you want to handle  the one seat that has two years remaining.  Okay.  Sounds good.  So, I would move to approve the recommendation on 5.5 Board and Commissions.  Okay.  Second.  Okay.  There was a motion by Vice Mayor Reynolds and a second by Mayor Coolidge to confirm  the appointment of the four individuals for the Arts Commission, Bidwell Park and Playground  Commission, and Planning Commission, as noted earlier.  And I'm just waiting for it to come up.  Council Member Brown?  I'm sorry.  Well, I respect my colleague's nominations.  If I'm going to abstain from this one, I have some issues with the process itself.  So, hang on a little bit.  Okay.  Council Member Denley?  Aye.  Council Member Huber?  Well, since it's clear my vote doesn't really carry any weight here, there's no use alienating  the commissioners that were voting for this one.  So, I'll just say yes.  Okay.  Council Member Morgan?  Yes.  Council Member Tandon?  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds?  Yes.  Mayor Coolidge?  Aye.  Carries 6-0 with one abstention.  All right.  And on the second item, what's the will of the council?  I would make a motion we just accept the person that has four nominations already.  Okay.  We have a motion.  Do we have a second?  I can second that.  Council Member Tandon?  I can second that motion.  Okay.  Madam Clerk, if you could take the roll.  Council Member Brown?  Aye.  Council Member Denley?  Aye.  Council Member Huber?  Yes.  Council Member Morgan?  Yes.  Council Member Tandon?  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds?  Yes.  And Mayor Coolidge?  Aye.  Carries 7-0.  Thank you, council.  And just to let you know that the recruitment is open.  So if you could encourage anyone interested in applying for the climate action commission,  the ARHPB, as well as the airport commission, those applications can be found online.  All right.  Thank you very much.  Moving on to item 5.6, certification of public safety management employees as the Chico police  management employees.  Citizens wishing to speak on this item should now raise their hands in the Zoom program.  City Manager Mark Orme.  Are we turning over to Jamie?  Yes.  Director Cannon will take this.  Director Cannon.  It's Mark Orme.  It's all yours.  Good evening, Mayor, Vice Mayor, council.  What you have in front of you is a request to ratify by the council via resolution.  This group was prior referred to as our public safety management group.  They included both fire admin and police admin.  With the departure of division chiefs in fire, they formed a Chico Battalion Chiefs Association,  which left a much smaller unit mostly made up of police employees.  So they submitted the ratification to City Manager Orme pursuant to our policies.  The clerk's office held a meeting with the chief of battalion chiefs association, which  is the chief of fire.  They have been working with the council to get this bill to secret ballot.  And then this is the next step in the process for council to ratify.  There is one existing member in the unit, our deputy chief of fire, who will most likely  be moved out of the unit as he's not police safety management.  And with that, I'm happy to answer any questions.  Questions?  All right.  No questions.  Any public comment on this item?  No.  All right.  Well, the council.  Second.  Second.  Motion and a second.  Madam Clerk, could you take the roll, please?  Council Member Brown.  Aye.  Council Member Denley.  Aye.  Council Member Huber.  Yes.  Council Member Morgan.  Yes.  Council Member Tandon.  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds.  Yes.  Mayor Coolidge.  Aye.  Carries 7-0.  Thank you very much.  All right.  Moving on to item 5.7, amendment of Local 39, Stationary Engineers Calipers Contribution.  Once again, I'm going to pass it over to the council.  Director Camm.  Good evening again.  This is the first step in amending our contract with CalPERS.  It's been a while since we've done one of these.  It's a bit of a lengthy process.  The first step is this intent that the council will take action on this evening if approved.  The next step is a secret ballot with our Local 39 bargaining unit.  These are our wastewater treatment plant employees.  Following that, it will come back to council on the 20th to actually have the ordinance  be read for the first time, and then it will be official 30 days later with this taking  effect.  This is the first step in the mid-May payroll.  Happy to answer any questions.  Oh, excuse me.  One more thing.  This is the 3% CalPERS cost sharing that their bargaining unit agreed to about a year and  a half ago.  However, they had a stepped approach to get there.  All unit members are finally there, so now we can actually ratify our agreement with  CalPERS.  All right.  Thank you very much.  Any questions?  Seeing no questions, public comment?  No.  No public comment on this issue?  Will the council?  My question is, I think the council has a lot of questions.  I'll start with this. Made by Mr. Huber, seconded by Vice Mayor Reynolds. And that was for the adoption of the resolution in the introduction of an ordinance of the City Council of the City of Chico authorizing an amendment to the contract between the City Council of the City of Chico and the Board of Administration and the Board of Administration of the California Public Employees Retirement System. Council Member Brown? Aye. Council Member Denley? Aye. Council Member Huber? Yes. Council Member Morgan?  Morgan? Yes. Council Member Tandon? Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds? Aye. Mayor Coolidge? Aye.  Carry 7-0. All right. Thank you very much. Item 5.8, additional shelter beds. Citizens wishing  to speak on this item should now raise their hands and zoom. And I believe we're just accepting  the report or are we getting a report as well? Homeless Solutions Coordinator Cockhams is here  to answer any questions, but it's a receive and file. If there's any questions of the council,  she's here to answer those for you. All right. Thank you. Any questions at this time?  All right. Moving on to public comment. We have one speaker, Charles Withoon.  Mr. Withoon, do you hear us? Can you hear me now? We can. Go ahead.  I have walked the four...  All right. Thank you. All right. Thank you.  All right. Thank you.  All right. Thank you.  All right. Thank you.  All right. Thank you.  All right. Thank you.  All right. We don't have any action on this item because we're just accepting the report,  so thank you very much. All right. We'll move on to 5.9. We don't have any items posting  after the agenda, correct? So item 6, reports and communications, city manager report. And  the following community reports and communications are provided for council members or for council's  information.  City Manager  I have a comment that I have to make that I have to make that I have to make that I have to make that I have to make that I have to make that I have to make that I have to make that I have to make that I have to make that I have to make that I have to make that I have to make that I have to make that I have to make that I have to make that I have to make that I have to make that I have to make that I have to make that I have to make that I have to make that I have to make that I have to make that I have to make that I have to make that I have to make that I have to make that I have to make that I have to make that I have to make that I have to make that I have to make that I have to make that I have to make that I have to make that I have to make that I have to make that I have to make that I have to make that I have to make that I have to make that I have to make that I  evaluate that and so I am open to receiving any and all further comments offline from any council  members with that regard but I know that now that we're in the red it's looking more hopeful  that that'll happen sooner than later so with that I wanted to make sure you're aware of that.  All right thank you very much. So at this point in time we'll move on to item 6.2 which is council  member request pursuant to AP and P 1010. Council members may verbally request an item to be  agendized at a future meeting. After stating what the item would be a majority of council is needed  in order for staff to agendize. Council members must also submit may also submit  requests in writing and I believe we have one in writing from Mr. Hueber.  Actually the the one the first one is council member Denley. That's the one. Oh correct.  We had council member Denley's. My apologies. No worries. It's on the next page so.  So your first. Scott's second. Okay so I did have the clerk's office attach my request as well as a  little background information. You'll see a kind of like a press release from James Gallagher's  office. I basically am looking to request that we have a discussion about filing some sort of  opposition to DPH 18 015 and I'm asking that we waive our rules and act on my request immediately  tonight because any opposition is not required. So I'm going to ask that we waive our rules and act on my request immediately tonight because any opposition is not required.  opposition. If we wanted to take it, it's due by April 5th, which is before we meet  again. So I guess I'm starting by making a request that we hear it immediately.  I would second that motion.  All right. So we have a motion and a second.  Madam Clerk, when you're ready.  Okay. And because this item was  agendized, we do have one speaker on that.  And let me just see if you're going to... And that's on the  intent to bring it to the... On this item to  whether or not to support the request.  Council Member Brown?  No. Council Member Denley? Aye. Council Member Huber?  No. Council Member Morgan? Yes. Council Member Tandon?  Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds? Yes. Mayor Coolidge? Aye.  Carries 5-2. All right. Moving forward at this time,  is there anything further you'd like to add, Council?  Council Member Denley? Yeah. Just a little bit of background. So this is in regards to  the state resolution that's being proposed. Like I said, it's  DPH 18015, the Syringe Exchange Program Regulatory  Consistency Resolution. Basically, the state  attempting to take away our local authority over whether or not we decide  we want to allow syringe programs in our community. And regardless  of how current council feels about syringe access or future councils  feel, I think it's important that we  retain our ability to make those decisions. So that's why I'm bringing  this forward, that we would hopefully all like to file some opposition  to it. I couldn't personally agree more.  You know, especially since we're a charter city.  I think we should have control over on a local level. This issue  has come forward on a local level. Obviously, it affects us locally. So  I'd like us to see us be able to remain in control of this.  And unfortunately, our state doesn't always see eye to eye with us.  Do we have any further comment or questions of Council Member Denley?  All right. With that, we'll take public speakers on this item.  We have one, and it's Rob Berry. All right. Mr. Berry.  Go ahead, Rob.  Good evening. So it would be called that  there was a lawsuit initially, and there were two grounds  for the lawsuit.  One of them was the land use,  which is the basis for the local ban on PPP kits.  The other was CEQA. And so I'd just like to  point out a couple things. I strongly agree  with Council Member Denley's request to  send a letter in opposition to the changes  in the regulation. Also, there is an assembly  bill, 8B11B,  that I have worked on that I have worked on this  item prior to this event that I have worked on this  item prior to this event that I have worked on this that both municipalities have to challenge the Department of Public Health in trying to remove both. The last piece of information is that they are, there's a public comment period that closes April 5th, but there's also an opportunity to request a public hearing,  hearing and that is due 15 days before April 5th and so we will be requesting  the public hearing that it occurs the council to join along with the county  and other municipalities to join that public hearing as well and send a delegate  for a two-man model. We should take advantage of all the opportunities that we have to  oppose these two moves. Thank you so much. Thank you. That is it. All right.  So oh excuse me I guess Jessica Giannola. Okay. Typically we do not take them once a speaker has  started. So I think because of the way we're doing this process it makes sense.  Okay. Sorry. I just I think pretty much all the council know where I stand on the legal program  and the public health aspects behind it. It's for community health. That's all of our health  in reducing communicable disease like HIV and Hep C and Hep B and I know it's largely misunderstood  and it  kind of me having a public health background to hear my city council and my mayor say  that they don't see eye to eye with the state and they don't agree with public health and that just  it's like it bothers me and I wonder if you just realize how that sounds.  Like public health is they're health-based for the public at large and even if some of the  communities are not they're not going to be able to do that. So I think it's a good idea to  exercise that responsibility that I really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really  so that you can make your own decisions  and make your own city rules.  Well, it's like, sure, you're making your own city rules,  but at what cost?  You're still putting the rest of the community  at risk of these communicable diseases  that don't go away.  We have higher rates of accounting.  We have higher rates of addiction.  We have higher rates of retention  or foster containment.  We have higher rates of everything.  And when we keep taking away these benefits  and including barriers,  we're not getting any help here as a community.  And our state should be hand-in-hand with us.  We should be partnering with them,  not fighting against them.  So I oppose sending this letter opposing the state.  I think that we should just reevaluate  what role they play and what role we play  and find out how to work together,  understanding what we need to do.  That's all.  Thank you for taking my call.  Thank you.  I believe we have one more.  One more.  Nicole Nava.  Go ahead, Nicole.  There we go.  Sorry.  That's okay.  Okay, we can hear you.  Thank you.  So I wholeheartedly support sending a letter to the state  to basically let them know,  to let the municipalities have their own  decision-making process.  For things such as this.  I myself wrote letters to both the assembly committee  and to California Department of Public Health  to reiterate that our community already implemented a ban,  that Dune County recently implemented the ban,  and that I don't believe it's in the best interest  of this community for them to decide what's best for us.  And I would like to speak also to the members  that I think people around the country,  People have the misunderstanding about what levels people really have that have Hep C or HIV.  And so they were three and eight in 2019.  I wasn't able to obtain the numbers for 2020 yet, but that probably constitutes a crisis  and a need to have harm reduction that benefits the few over the negative impacts to the many  that we experienced with the thousands upon thousands of needles being disposed in the  area that carry blood-borne pathogens.  We had several innocent community members, one even a child, get stuck.  We have to look to reducing harm for the public at large as well.  And to me, public health really failed all of us in not looking at harm reduction for  all the population.  Instead, they narrowed their focus on this group.  And again, the numbers three and eight across all of Butte County, not just the city of  Chico, really don't indicate a driving need to have this kind of service.  And so I really hope that you all can pull together and listen to what your community  wanted and get that letter sent over to the city.  And I really like to see it go to Department of Public Health and to the Assembly Committee  to ensure that we button this up and protect this community.  Thank you for your time.  Thank you.  All right.  Thank you very much.  Will the council...  I'm happy to make the motion.  I'll make a motion.  Okay.  That we would direct staff to file a letter of opposition to DPH-18015 prior to the April  5th deadline.  And that we would direct staff to file a letter of opposition to DPH-18015 prior to the April  5th deadline.  And as well as have staff look into the possibility of the city joining in on the public hearing  for that same state recommendation.  All right.  So second.  Madam Clerk, if you'd take the roll.  Okay.  And the mayor would be authorized to sign that letter on behalf of the council with  this vote?  Okay.  Of course, there's a delay.  We have a motion.  The screen keeps freezing.  Council Member Brown.  No.  Council Member Dinley.  Aye.  Council Member Huber.  No.  Council Member Morgan.  Yes.  Council Member Tandon.  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds.  Yes.  Mayor Coolidge.  Aye.  Carries 5-2.  All right.  Mr. Huber.  Thank you.  A couple of weeks ago, I was in a meeting with the council and I was talking to the  council.  And I was talking to the council about the !  The recommendation of the grant funds that council had dedicated to that project towards  the purchase or lease of an alternate facility by CHAT.  And that CHAT provide a brief 5-10 minute presentation on their plan for that alternative  alternate use at an upcoming council meeting.  All right.  Questions?  All right.  One second.  I'll hand that to the council.  I will make it a motion to that point.  I'll go ahead and second that.  I think that's absolutely worth having that discussion.  I want to make that money to use to this project regardless of this one or that alternative.  Thank you.  I have a comment.  Just that we understand that I'm having this having this having this having this having  discussion at some point is I personally don't think it's a necessary discussion  being we already have 732 beds according to information from the  county that serve the city of Chico plus the 390 beds  that were in Ms. Kokum's report. That's 1,122  beds servicing Chico which is 154 beds  more than the number of individuals experiencing homelessness in Chico  almost immediately following the campfire crisis. So I personally don't see  the point. So I have a question for Mr. Schubert.  You want to discuss what to do with the CDBG funds not necessarily  what CHAT should do with the CDBG funds.  No I want to stick with your original motion that CHAT  be the recipient of those funds and have a presentation by them  to discuss how they, what other  way they would propose to use them.  Okay.  Thank you.  So I have another question.  Skipper.  So we allocated to them for a specific purpose without the discussion  they just get reallocated back to the city or they just get to do whatever they want with them?  No it was specifically the townhouse motel project  and so what staff is anticipating on doing is coming back at the meeting of April  20th with potential options on what to redo  with that funding. Anywhere.  Yeah.  So and so that I was hoping to bring that back on April 6th.  It's likely going to be coming back on April 20th.  Thank you.  So.  Thank you.  Scott for the presentation.  Yeah.  I would normally I would support something along these lines but I believe it would be  important to get that information on April 20th.  So I think it's best to wait at that point in time.  So.  All right.  This is Alex.  I have a quick question before we take the vote.  This may be a question for Mr. Rapp.  As we go through this form.  Will an alternate proposal by CHAT be on that report that's coming back to us?  It's my understanding that our Homeless Solutions Coordinator is working with CHAT on potential  other options.  So I would presume that she would be bringing back one of those potential options where  it would go with them and stay with them on maybe another project.  But at this time I can't tell you because she's still working through there's so many  different projects.  She's working on.  She's working on potentially but that's definitely a consideration that I know is in the hopper  that she's working with.  Okay.  Thank you.  Just another comment.  So I made that motion which surprised a lot of people.  It's just I was interested in getting to you know a certain amount of beds although no  one seems to know what that number is.  As quickly as possible they seem like they could do it faster than anybody.  That has turned out not to be true.  The number of beds available has gone up.  The county has granted us for lack of a better word or said that work with us they're giving  us half a million dollars for different things.  A number of us are working inside a lot of different meetings to come up with different  solutions.  So the reason Scott I support what you're trying to support but I don't support necessarily  keeping the money there because a lot has changed since then.  A lot changed literally a week after we made that allotment.  And so I think we need that and Suzy's position is more important than it's ever been as we're  moving forward with solutions.  Beds are becoming available.  Outreach is starting to happen.  For those people in the community that are upset that we haven't built a Taj Mahal for  those people we've done more than any council has since I've been here and I've been here  a long time.  And there's more coming and it's not just beds and housing.  So we have to look at everything holistically including that CDBG money.  Council or Vice Mayor Adams.  So can we split the baby per se if that's a I don't know if that's the right but I would  like to hear from chat and I would like to hear also what other proposals are coming.  So in order to get to this can we have the information come back on the 20th when we're  coming back and if chat is one of the ones presenting that is a potential we're looking  at.  Can we have them here.  As well as any other people that are presenting that way everybody gets a chance the community  gets to see what we're talking about and it's a win and we get to hear what chat wants as  well as anything else.  I think that would be the most reasonable maybe.  I think that Vice Mayor that that's exactly what staff typically would do is if they are  going to have those projects before you.  We want the people who would potentially implement them in the audience so they could answer  questions.  If that does end up being one of the options they would be here hopefully to be able to  speak to that so that's that's how it would work if staff were to present those items.  So I don't know Scott if you'd accept that as a friendly amendment that they could be  you know come present if they're one of the people that make the cut for that 20th meeting  which I'm assuming they will because they've done a ton for our community and they're you  know doing a lot of housing and I fully I know they're working a ton of different directions  as well as a lot of other people to get things done.  So well the writing is on the wall as they say and I think accepting your friendly amendment  is probably a good choice for me at this point.  I'm just curious it feels like we derailed from the request a little bit.  Yeah I was getting there.  I think we have a little bit too so why I wanted to restate your motion Scott with the  amendment and see if we can get this thing back on the rails.  Sure.  So my motion taking into account Councillor Reynolds amendment would be to request that  the council hear presentations by various entities responding to use of the CDBG funds  and that CHAT be if they have a proposal the CHAT be one of those proposals.  Okay I'll take that. Council Member Brown, are you okay with that amendment? All right, Madam Clerk. The irony being we don't need the motion, because that's what's gonna happen anyway.  Okay I'll take that.  Okay I'll take that.  Okay I'll take that.  Okay I'll take that.  Okay I'll take that.  Okay I'll take that.  Brown? Aye. Council Member Denlay? No. Council Member Huber? Yes. Council Member Morgan? Yes.  Council Member Tandon? Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds? Aye. Mayor Coolidge? I'm going to vote no because  I believe that we're already discussing the item. So thank you. It carries 5-2.  All right. And then I believe Council Member or Vice Mayor Reynolds, you have a request as well?  I do. And I absolutely hate setting aside our rules and doing this. But I literally got a call  at 4.30 today from the Cal Water regarding something to do with money that they need a  letter by Friday on. So I would like to ask that we, and the letter has been provided in front of  everyone and I can give a little bit more detail, but it has to do with the use of federal funds  in helping low-income families. And if we don't vote on this, we may not be able to  submit it. So I would like to ask that we, and the letter has been provided in front of everyone  to send a letter that would allow us to fight for Cal Water to be able to receive funds to help  our most marginalized in our community. Well, and I would just like to comment,  we actually did hear from the representative of the company during public comment that gave some  insight to this. But I don't know if the general public was able to hear at that time if they were  watching on Channel 11. But yeah, just restating it, basically the state's looking at,  you know, the state's looking at only having state agencies being reimbursed for low-income folks who  can't pay their bills. I believe that's the essence of it. And Cal Water, because they're a privately  owned company, is looking to have that request as Congress originally intended for it to be  adhered to all water companies. So, which makes sense for our community. So our, you know, poorest  individuals or people facing hardships during this time can actually have their water bills reversed  through the state. So I would like to ask that we, and the letter has been provided in front of everyone  here, that we can do that federal funding. So. So I think first we need to make a motion, or I'd make a  motion to set aside our rules and hear this tonight. Second.  So any discussion on that before we go to the vote? No? All right. Motion to set aside the rules.  Council Member Brown? Aye. Council Member Denley? Aye. Council Member Huber? Yes.  Council Member Morgan? Yes. Council Member Tandon? Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds? Yes. Mayor Coolidge? Aye.  Carry 7-0. All right. So moving on to the item at hand.  So essentially, this is federal funds that was intended to go to all low-income customers  of public water providers. What the state of California is trying to do is to make it so it  can only go to, the funds would only go to state of California type providers, not Cal Water,  who does not fall underneath that. So they would like to be able to receive these funds so they can  continue to help our low-income people that are on the lower rate, and it's a lot of money. And  Cal Water has just been amazing, and they've donated over $500,000 statewide to local  nonprofits. They've done $65,000 in Chico. They've done COVID relief. They've just been a great  company in our community, and I just want to, I think we should sign on to the letter that  needs to be written. So I think that's a great idea. I think we should sign on to the letter that needs to be written.  And by Friday, that says this should go to all water providers, not just state water providers.  Just really quickly, because I didn't get a chance to thoroughly read the letter. Can you,  Mayor Coolidge, I know that you've done a little bit of a summary of it.  Can you repeat that very quickly?  Yeah, I mean, and correct me if I'm wrong, anyone, too, but I believe it was HR 133  went through the House and was approved and signed by the President and put into action.  But it called for reimbursement to water companies or public water companies, but all water companies  are public in some respect, and I think that's where the disagreement lies with the state.  And basically to reimburse for fees not paid by lower income or people for whatever reason during  the pandemic that were not able to pay their bills. So that money was distributed out to the  state. The state of California is pushing forward to try to justify that. And I think that's a great idea.  I think that that money really does make that money go to actually state-owned water agencies  rather than all water agencies.  And so the thought is that if it only goes to state water agencies that doesn't cover  the city of Chico so people are able to get reimbursed.  Also, Cal Water is able to get reimbursed for the citizens that they've been helping through the pandemic.  Does that make sense?  Thank you.  Ya.  Ya.  Ya.  All right.  And I think the wording is actually municipal providers, not state providers,  and I think I said the wrong name on that, but I apologize.  But I think, and Mr. Orme, would you agree with my assessment of that?  Yeah, I would phrase it as governmental agencies.  It could be state or municipal because some cities run their own water department.  Yeah.  We do not.  So we have a CPUC regulated entity, Cal Water, as many other cities do too.  And so, yes, everything else is accurate.  Yes.  All right.  Thank you.  So the essence of the motion is that we're going to sign on to their letter.  To sign a letter opposing this saying that it should go to all water providers  as it was intended to from the federal government.  Yeah.  And before we make a motion, do we have any public comment, Madam Clerk?  We typically wouldn't because we didn't know.  It's not on the agenda.  Yep.  Okay.  And it's a letter.  Okay.  Do we have a motion?  We don't have a motion as of yet.  I don't have a motion.  I would make a motion that we authorize the mayor to sign for the city of Chico for this letter.  Okay.  Resolution.  Okay.  A motion and a second.  Take the roll, please.  Council Member Brown.  Aye.  Council Member Denley.  Aye.  Council Member Huber.  Yes.  Council Member Morgan.  Yes.  Council Member Tandon.  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds.  Aye.  Aye.  Mayor Coolidge.  Aye.  Carries 7-0.  All right.  All right.  Any other verbal council requests?  All right.  Seeing none, we'll move on to item 7, which is closed session.  So we will actually be doing something a little different.  When we come back, all seven of us will come back for the report out.  Yes.  It's a new way it goes.  So.  So we're there.  Until after closed session.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Thank you.
