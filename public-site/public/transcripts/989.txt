 Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, I see.  Oh, I see.  Oh, I see.  Oh, I see.  Oh, I see.  Oh, I see.  Oh, I see.  Oh, I see.  Oh, I see.  Oh, I see.  Oh, I see.  Oh, I see.  Oh, I see.  Oh, I see.  Oh, I see.  Oh, I see. And I think housing affordability is the most pressing issue to a lot of Chico. Well over half of our city lives in rented houses and rent burden in our area. Rent burden in our area is the worst in the state known for lack of affordable housing. Do you feel like you have a good grasp on policy issues around housing? I guess that's question one. Question two is what are your approaches to addressing our housing affordability crisis? Do you feel like you have a good grasp on policy issues around housing? I guess that's question one. Question two is what are your approaches to addressing our housing affordability crisis? So to the first part, do I have a good grasp on our affordability issue? I believe so. Having employed many people in town.  so having employed many people in town and is the microphone on hello is that working better  maybe a little louder can we go a little louder  the testing one two three okay yeah that's better okay um so to your first question um yes i think  i have a pretty good firm grasp of the affordability issue having been an employer in  this town before and not paid people some of them not you know getting 15 an hour 20 an hour and  their challenges and finding places to live within our community so yeah i think i have a pretty good  grasp on on those issues um and as far as the second part um i do believe however having said  that that as a community um the community still needs to grow and affordability is one component  of that growth and while we need to be very cognizant of that  it  shouldn't preclude growth in other areas and we don't want to price everybody out of our  community but at the same time if we all took a job in san francisco tomorrow we're not going  to go live in menlo park at least i can't necessarily afford to live in menlo park  so what that means to me is that we need to be looking at how can chico expand within a  a kind of more we talked about this before more of a structured program  where can we bring in that that middle income hard-working family how can we help  that person to what do we do with the lower income and i think both need to be addressed  and i do think we have the ability to do so but the general plan going forward needs to address  me but um  homelessness quite a bit in your applications as many applicants why do you believe homelessness is  on the rise in chicago that was a tough one for you to ask me but um  homelessness is on the rise in chicago that was a tough one for you to ask me but um  homelessness is on the rise in chicago that was a tough one for you to ask me but um  homelessness is on the rise in chicago that was a tough one for you to ask me but um  homelessness is on the rise in chicago that was a tough one for you to ask me but um  homelessness is on the rise in chicago that was a tough one for you to ask me but um  When you open your community to a solution to homeless from across the country, not just Chico but California in general, people do come from all over.  And I believe, I mean, talking to people in the last months, I think I met some people from Alaska.  Another kid got dropped off from his father actually dropped him off from the Bay Area.  It creates a burden on a local community to deal with these issues.  So I believe as a community, while we can try to help as much as we can, we do need to try to get our own community at a place where we can help those first from our community, second from a larger community.  If that means reaching out to county and state for help, we need to.  But the city of Chico cannot afford.  And I would argue, because we're here, that we shouldn't necessarily be trying to house the gentleman or lady from Alaska who moved here.  I mean, it's up to her to kind of now, if we can point her in the right direction toward shelter options and toward services, of course.  But living on our streets and our parks, no.  I'm always brutally honest.  Appreciate it.  Thank you.  I have one more question.  Do you think that Chico's police could be better trained or equipped to deal with mental health episodes?  Well, that's an easy answer because the answer is always yes.  Of course, additional training is always, I'm sure police would.  Basically say, of course, whatever additional training we can get would help us deal with these issues.  So, yes, absolutely.  I believe that any training that any police officer, fire, anybody who deals interacts with those living on our streets, including council members, for lack of a better word.  To understand what they're going through is definitely a step toward solving that issue.  Thank you.  All right.  Hold on a sec.  Okay.  Any other questions for Mr. Wiles?  I have a few.  No one else?  No.  Okay.  Okay.  You did run for city council at one point.  You are one of the six people who ran, correct?  Yes.  And how many forums did you do?  I think I did all the forums.  Yeah, but there were a lot.  How many?  Ballpark?  I think it was only like five forums back then or something.  Okay.  Yeah.  All right.  So, I mean, you've been out, you've talked to the community, you've gone door to door, you've done those things that people did during running for office, correct?  Yes, I did.  And my wife helped me a lot.  I think we had more signs out.  No disrespect up there, Mr. Wiles.  Almost everybody else during that election with no money.  I just did it all myself.  I did have two people donating money, but I think I did it for about $2,500.  And during those forums, you did talk about housing and homelessness and other things.  Yeah, I mean, I kind of feel the same way I did five years ago.  I still feel today.  And you could argue that some of those things that I said have come true, which is regrettable.  And you also chair the Parks Commission, I believe.  Currently, I'm the chair of the Parks Commission.  And how long have you served on that?  Five years.  All right.  Thank you very much.  All right.  Cool.  Thank you, guys.  So, no specific order.  Any questions for Bryce Goldstein?  Yes.  Okay.  Welcome.  Hi, good evening.  Good evening.  I have a couple questions.  I'm going to ask you the same question I asked Mr. Glatz first.  The City Council is going to be responsible for adopting an updated general plan element,  and housing affordability is the most pressing issue a lot of us are facing.  Well over half the city lives in rented houses, and rent burden in our area is worse than the state.  Do you feel like you have a good grasp on policy issues around housing,  and what are your approaches to addressing our housing affordability crisis?  Yes, I do believe I have a good grasp of the issues about housing policy.  My experience serving on the City of Chico Planning Commission,  for the past two and a half years, has definitely added to that.  I also, as you know, work as a planner in transportation planning,  but that means I follow statewide and local policy pretty closely.  And sometimes I'm a bit of a policy nerd.  I enjoy reading about what other cities are doing to help ease their affordability crises.  And I have a lot of ideas for what we could do here to ease our affordable housing crisis.  And I think that's a good question.  And I know you asked me about this last time, like what would be one step I would take.  And I mentioned removing parking minimums in specific areas within the community,  where we're looking at building dense transit-oriented housing.  But also upzoning certain areas where people,  where there is developer interest and homeowner interest in building duplexes, triplexes, fourplexes,  and other affordable or smaller units.  And let's see, other ways to make housing more affordable.  I believe in greater tenant protections because keeping people in their homes is one  of the best ways to keep people from being homeless and to make sure  that people can keep paying the rent that they're currently paying.  As you know, after the Camp Fire, we saw a lot of people getting price gouged  or otherwise illegally turned out of their rental housing by landlords who wanted to sell  for a lot more money.  When we liquidate these advantages, we liquidate these advantages by liquidating these advantages  by liquidating these advantages by So tenant protections, policy changes that allow for more density in certain areas and reevaluating our parking minimums are three of my top priorities. Does that answer your question?  liquidating these advantages by  liquidating these advantages by  liquidating these advantages by  liquidating these advantages by Okay, thanks. Do you think Chico's police could be better trained or equipped to deal with mental health crises and episodes? Sure. I think everybody could be better trained at their jobs, even me.  even me. And I especially think that people who are responsible for our safety could always use  more training, especially when we have seen, you know, an uprising of citizens who are frustrated  with the way that police in other cities, even in Chico, have handled crisis situations.  We really need to make sure that we have people who can handle crises of mental health.  For example, some cities have been looking into bringing social workers to situations that,  you know, say there's a person with a mental illness who their caretaker calls for help,  and they don't necessarily want to have just police show up. We need to be able to have those  trained people available.  Even if they're not just the police. And for situations where we do need the police,  I fully believe that more training is always a good thing.  Thank you.  Thanks. Any further questions?  I believe Mr. Morgan has a question.  You suggested Chico PD has acted inappropriately in a crisis situation. Can you give a specific example?  I'm sure the death of Desmond Phillips. I fully believe that we should have had mental health  specialists available for that situation.  It's not necessarily.  It's not necessarily the police's fault that they were brought into a situation they weren't trained for.  All right. I have a couple of questions if no one else has.  So you mentioned price gouging and rentals after the campfire. Do you have specific examples?  Yes. I know multiple people who were evicted from their rentals or threatened with eviction.  For example, one person I know, her landlord, she was living in a house supporting her family,  and her landlord,  said, well, we're going to raise the rent, and if you don't like it, you can leave.  She had no legal recourse there because, you know, it's really hard when you're a hard worker.  Was it over the 10% or whatever that was?  Yes, yes. I believe it was a 50% increase.  So was that reported to the DA? Because at that time, I know that  I don't know all of the specifics.  The city and the county had pretty aggressive ordinances against price gouging in an emergency situation.  Yeah. So one of the issues is,  we don't have just cause eviction protection, and AB 1482 has protected some people since then.  But at the time, if you, say, complained about your landlord raising your rent over 10%,  they could still evict you.  They could still evict you, but they'd actually be tried criminally by the district attorney for that.  Yes, that was a criminal offense.  So was it not reported to the district attorney?  I don't know the whole situation. That's a really good question.  It should have been.  Yes, definitely.  And I worked with multiple friends of mine who were getting price gouged,  and I let them know to contact legal services,  Chico Student Law Center that provides legal information,  and to contact the district attorney because this happened a lot.  Yeah, those particular instances are taken very seriously.  You mentioned parking minimums.  Is that in regards to units built within, you know, on someone else's property or something?  Can you repeat that?  You mentioned parking minimums.  Are there parking minimums when it comes to housing?  Yeah.  So in what regard?  Oh, new development.  So, for example, I think the example I gave last time was along Park Avenue.  If you had, say, like an eighth of an acre site that's really small,  you are allowed in most areas along the opportunity corridors to build dense housing up to 70 units per acre.  So say that you would be allowed to build, like, 12 housing units,  and you're building a parking space on a small parcel,  unfortunately with our current parking minimums,  you're required to build around one parking space per unit.  So then if you're required to build about 12 parking spots,  that would be pretty impossible on small sites.  And one example of getting reduction in your required parking that is available  is Deepika's project that she is working on in my neighborhood,  where she was allowed to have a reduction in the parking minimums  to make it possible to build an eighth place.  And I think that that's great,  and we should allow more of that and write it into our code.  And in terms of, like, ADUs or additional units added on to, like, the back of the house or something of that nature,  what's your thought on that for parking?  I believe that in most areas, ADUs should only – hmm.  I don't know what our current rule is, actually, for how much parking is required for them.  I feel like we –  So actually there's a law that is within –  in a quarter mile of any bus stop,  which encompasses the entire city of Chico,  it's not necessary.  And that's the state law.  Okay.  Yeah, and I support that.  So some of that is already in effect.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, pretty much everybody that I know who lives in an ADU either doesn't own a car or owns one car and is –  Yeah, but it's only been the past couple of years that that was actually wiped out.  Yeah, was that due to the statewide policy change?  Correct.  Yeah, that makes sense.  Yeah.  All right, thank you.  Thanks.  All right, we're done?  Thanks.  All right.  Mike O'Brien.  Come on.  Okay.  Question?  Good evening.  Go ahead.  Evening.  Good evening, Mr. O'Brien.  Good evening.  I want to reference something that you stated in your application.  You described Chico as a, quote, remarkably resilient – as, quote, remarkably resilient,  given the impacts to our city of multiple disasters.  I agree.  But as we touched on in a previous question, resiliency for probably most renters and anyone  trying to get a home mortgage here has meant dedicating a greater share of their income towards housing.  For others, it means living somewhere cheaper outside of Chico and commuting often hours every day,  which means greenhouse gas emissions, it's expensive for the driver and the city government.  For the city government, it puts a strain on our roadways and sales and property taxes.  Where do you think the city's responsibility lies with these issues where resiliency is  inequitable or nonexistent?  As with any resiliency, and that is certainly a compliment to our community, that does not  mean that we are not without issues.  And certainly housing in general, to include affordable housing, is one of our issues.  And we need to find ways, again, to remove barriers where we can to make affordable housing  for everyone.  And I do agree with that issue as far as finding –  Okay.  I think those things are going to make sense for our community.  That provides for balanced growth.  I think that's what we should be striving for.  But I am not insensitive to the needs of people in this community that need affordable housing.  I do understand that issue.  Again, in your application, as it relates to the issue of homelessness, you stated a preference for both  compassion and accountability.  Given the city's current complex concerns, legally and otherwise, how would you propose  balancing those two values?  So I come to this issue from a unique perspective.  I have served 32 years in law enforcement, 28 for this community, 5 as your chief of police.  I also served as the board chair for the Jesus Center for 8 years and 10 years on that board.  So I understand both of those dynamics.  And I think when this issue gets out of balance, when we forget either a piece of accountability  or a piece of compassion, I think we all suffer.  And I think people in the community suffer, to include the homeless.  So I said often times as chief, there is nothing compassionate about leaving someone under a bridge  with a mental illness or an addiction.  And so finding ways to get individuals help, but also being respectful to those that are being impacted  by homelessness in their neighborhoods, in their businesses, in our public spaces, that cannot be forgotten as well.  And so we need to look at this from a holistic standpoint, not just from one side or the other.  We really need to look at this like most things from a balanced perspective.  Thank you.  One of the issues that we've looked at is inclusionary zoning, which means new subdivisions have to include some affordable housing in their development plans.  The city overwhelmingly approved inclusionary zoning in 2009 for certain developments, and it was applied to Merriam Park,  which is why we have so many units of affordable housing on the way in that development.  Do you think inclusionary zoning should be a condition of approval on other subdivisions?  Not to include all, but some?  We do need to be careful with that.  Again, we're establishing an artificial barrier.  Now maybe in some cases, particularly for some particular projects, maybe it does make sense.  I would want to certainly listen to our experts.  We have many in this room.  And make a decision that is best for all in this community.  The last question I have is what cities do you admire and see as examples for Chico?  You mentioned Boise in the last meeting.  I'm curious if there's others.  Well, I don't know if I admire Boise or not.  I'm not sure.  I'm not saying anything against Boise.  My point in bringing up Boise is they did come to a conclusion with their lawsuit, the one that really is the one that is facing us, Boise v. Martin.  And I think it was a ruling that may be something that would be a model for us.  As far as model cities, I won't go into other cities that I admire.  I admire Chico.  And I think we can be the city we can't want to be.  Everyone wants the city to be.  But I think we need to take kind of a step back.  Take a deep breath and start looking at these issues from a more balanced perspective.  Thank you.  Anyone else?  I have a couple of questions, if you don't mind.  Mr. O'Brien, I'm transitioning to Mr. O'Brien as best I can.  So in terms of the inclusionary zoning, I actually would disagree with Councilmember Brown.  I'm sure she probably knows that already.  Just in terms of how she stated that.  I actually think inclusionary zoning means higher prices of middle income homes.  But a lot of the lower income development that we've had has been held up in this community  by environmental issues, which the city is facing illegal action on, particularly Bruce Road.  Do you see Chico as needing more area to further develop and add to housing for our lower income?  Or what do you see?  I think you can see some of the faces, I guess the problems with why, in your opinion, you think housing is so expensive here.  Or what factors have led to that?  Well, there's probably a number of different issues that have caused those prices to increase.  It's usually and always typically a supply and demand issue.  There's not enough supply for the demand.  And so if that's the case and we want to lower those prices, but we're not going to lower them, we're not going to lower them.  make housing more affordable, more accessible,  then we have to look at those barriers to affordable housing.  And affordable housing is not just one kind of housing.  It can be a single-family home.  It can be a number of different styles of housing.  But finding those barriers, those roadblocks,  to thoughtful housing in this community,  I think that's what we have to look at.  And if there's things in the state, like you mentioned, with ADUs,  that are artificial and unnecessary,  then we should be looking at finding ways to have those removed.  All right. Thank you.  I have one more question. Sorry.  Have you read the City of Chico's Climate Action Plan,  or do you otherwise have an idea of what's in it?  I have some idea, yes.  Sitting in council for five years, I have some idea, yes.  Sure. Do you think that it's enough, too much?  I'd love to hear your perspective on the Climate Action Plan.  Well, again, I think, like anything with climate,  I think determining exactly what is causing this,  what is causing our drought,  certainly I think that's a very wise thing.  With most issues, that is one that I do take, I think, a balanced perspective.  I'm not someone that is so pro-growth that I want to see our protections  of our parks, of our greenways, of the green line removed.  I'm not for that.  But we need to find ways to make that, again, appropriate for all of us.  Okay. Thank you.  All right. Any more questions?  Thank you, Mr. Brown.  All right. Next we'll call up Dale Bennett.  All right. Questions for Mr. Bennett?  Hi, Mr. Bennett.  Good evening.  I won't restate the first question that I asked.  Other.  I'll call on the other two applicants because I'm presuming you've got the context.  Do you feel like you have a good grasp on policy issues around housing?  And what are your approaches to addressing our housing affordability crisis?  For me, my opinion, my belief, there's three major factors.  The availability of land, which drives cost of land.  The availability of materials, numbers, an astronomical amount right now.  So those factors play.  into it and they don't play into it as a good thing, they play into it as the housing price  goes up.  And then there's also the availability of workers, which is a very, very major challenge  to those in the development business, those contractors that cannot find adequate people.  That drives up the labor costs.  So I think we're going through a cycle.  I'm hopeful that this cycle will balance out in time and housing prices will be more  affordable.  But there is no simple solution.  If there is one, I think we all would love to hear that.  So that's my response.  Am I correct in assuming that you don't feel that there are approaches at the city  level for addressing the housing affordability crisis?  I believe in the fair market system.  Okay.  The city may be able to influence in some ways, but I would be very cautious in the  manner in which those influences or those factors are introduced.  Mr. Bennett, why do you think homelessness is on the rise in Chico?  Our climate, those factors that have been stated before, I agree with, and the ability  for people to come.  I think these advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages  advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages  advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages  advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages  advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages  advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages  advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages  advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages  advantages  advantages  advantages  people are moving to Chico as a haven  for their minimal  survival. And they're coming from other places.  We know that Chico Police Department presented  that years ago. They had a graph or a spreadsheet on  where people were coming from. And it was outside of our community,  outside of our state. And I doubt that that has changed much.  But I don't know for sure. To be clear, that graph was not  based in legitimate research data, but we can have that conversation  another day. Last question is, are you familiar with the city's climate action  plan? Not very much, I'll be truthful.  Well, I guess it kind of makes  the other question moot, which is, do you think that our climate  action goals are enough, too much, or can you share your perspective?  I would be very cautious in the city  as a community or a city government becoming too involved  in those types of issues. There's just  a delicate balance, and I think good common sense  and a fair and reasonable approach to those  items is possible, but I would still be very, very cautious in the city government  becoming too involved. Thank you.  Thank you.  I have a couple of questions, but anyone else?  All right. So, because we can't put a little  opinion in here, because we are, I'm going to put a little in my  question. Do you think the last 50 years of poor  housing direction by the state of California compounded  with the most expensive and sometimes ludicrous  rules and regulations that have led to the highest priced homes  in the entire nation have anything to do with the housing?  Are you sure that the housing crisis we're currently facing?  And yeah, that's a completely loaded question.  Absolutely.  All right.  Yes.  And then would you support programs that are environmentally sound,  but also save the city money, such as solar programs, LED light replacement  programs, air conditioning replacement programs, energy efficiency programs,  and those kinds of things?  Absolutely.  All right. Thank you very much. Anyone else? All right. Thanks so much.  Thank you.  All right. Amber Howard Brown. Oh, okay. I can go first. So why don't we get a question out of the way? Because I'm predicting that it might be answered. Because I'm predicting that it might be answered. What are your thoughts on housing in the city of Chica and housing affordability?  I'm confused.  I'm confused. What are your thoughts on housing in the city of Chica and housing affordability? I think housing affordability is an issue in all of California. I've worked in property management throughout all of California and it's always an issue.  generally live outside of the city that they work in, vice versa. It's generally always an issue.  I think it's more of a California issue than it is just a Chico issue. All right, and then I'll  ask you the homeless question as well. So do you think Chico is experiencing a higher rate of  homelessness, or what are the reasons you believe Chico has a homeless problem? I think that it's,  again, a California issue. Homeless is on the rise everywhere in California, not just Chico.  I think some cities are probably handling it a little better than others. I don't know if this  falls directly on the city or under the city's purview. Fortunately, we have a lot of wonderful  social programs in California, and some of them are really great, but some of them tend to give  a hand out instead of a hand up, and I think that we could probably have a little bit more  accountability.  And probably follow those programs a little bit more, and they would be more beneficial to  the people that they're there for. All right, any other questions? I have a couple of questions.  Thank you. Due to a state law from 2019, a lot of Chico's renters are protected from arbitrary  evictions, so there has to be some just cause, otherwise known as just cause eviction protections,  like a lease violation for them to be evicted. But for most people in Chico renting single-family  homes or who haven't been renting for very long,  they can still be evicted for no stated cause. Would you support extending just cause eviction  protections here, and why or why not? I would not. I think that it's already a very tenuous process  to evict somebody for actual cause. I think that the system favors very heavily the resident,  and I think that that's probably some of the reasons why the cost of living goes up.  There's a huge burden on the  property owner, property manager. There's a lot of cost associated with it. I do agree that it's  better to keep people in their homes, and we should do what we can to do that. However, I don't think  that there needs to be more protection. There's quite a bit of protection in California. The laws  very much favor the resident over the, yeah. Thank you. There's just one more question.  Sure. You also said that you want to,  you know, resolve the issue of homelessness, quote, by leading with compassion on the front lines. You called it boots on the streets. I'd like to hear where you see the current council hasn't lived up to that and what you would do differently.  I'm not sure if I know if they've lived up to that. I think that it's a complicated issue, and it was hard to even write about it because I think that the situations that people are in are very different depending on who you're talking to.  I'm confused by these advantages. I'm confused by these advantages. I'm confused by these advantages. I'm confused by these advantages. I'm confused by these advantages. I'm confused by these advantages. I'm confused by these advantages. I'm confused by these advantages. I'm confused by these advantages. I'm confused by these advantages. I'm confused by these advantages. I'm confused by these advantages. I'm confused by these advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages advantages  And so I would probably really want to depend on them to inform me and then to make decisions that we can at the city level.  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right.  Any other questions?  All right.  Next candidate, Sandra Hussman.  Welcome.  Questions?  Hi.  Good evening.  Good evening.  All right.  I guess we invited you out for no reason.  Sorry.  Can you speak up?  I said I guess we invited you out for no reason.  Oh, okay.  Sorry.  That's okay.  All right.  Thanks so much.  All right.  We'll turn back over to the clerk.  I believe we have to do public comment at this time.  We do, but I'd like to ask some indulgence to take a quick break so that I can reset the audio video.  We had an encoder that actually was smoldering last Friday, and we installed it today, and we just need to reset it.  And I just want to let the...  The public know Channel 11 is working.  The audio is fine.  The recording is working.  And so I will be able to go back in and upload all the portion that hasn't been heard so far this evening on our streaming video.  Okay.  Should we hold up a sign that says that?  So if we could just take a quick 10-minute break, I would like to reset the system.  10-minute break it is.  Okay.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  get the video from this meeting and I will go and upload it instantly.  It is, the audio and video is working on channel 11, but I recognize  a lot of people have gone to streaming services.  But there isn't anything that we can do at this point right now  so that they can hear. If they can see it, they just can't hear it.  Okay. So we would literally have to hold something  up and tell them, sorry. And I do apologize.  Sorry. Go to channel 11. Technology. That's why I'm the city clerk and not IT.  Thank goodness. That's all right.  Okay. So with that, I'll move to public comment.  Yes? Yes. We do have, I think,  two speakers. All right. We'll give them three minutes each  to address the council. First speaker is Jessica Giannola,  followed by Marlon Wade-Davis.  Thank you.  Hi, council. First off, I just want to  I want to give some support to Sandy. She didn't get a chance  to speak and I would have loved to hear more. I was impressed by  her advocacy for case management, which is something that is needed  for populations that need to have more involvement for  life recovery. So I hope that you're still considering her.  As far as our council goes, our council is supposed to be a representation  of the city.  When I look at the council now, I see a lot of similarities.  There's a lot of similar concerns voiced where they are important.  I'm just hearing a lacking or not enough voice in other areas  that we do need to have up there representing us.  Housing is absolutely crucial.  You can date back. You can look. You can see since the 1980s  where public funded housing started dropping dramatically  as well as public funded housing.  already rising and there's your correlation with why are we having more people that are unhoused  if we don't have enough affordable homes for them to live in so when we're looking at someone  replacing this seat i really really hope that the city weighs heavily on picking an advocate  someone that can sit in the seat who has knowledge around housing and how to do it i see i'm hearing  a lot of people who are saying we need affordable housing we do but how do we do it so if we  have somebody who's knowledgeable in planning and zoning already who's already well equipped  to get right in there it's wise to pick that person regardless of popularity or  i just think that that's really smart right there so um that's one thing i wanted to say  and who i think stands out obviously is bryce and she absolutely stands out as an advocate  for housing affordable housing she has the knowledge she's got some great ideas  um  and therefore the betterment of our city she has that clear understanding  i i did i want to comment just a little bit i want to commend her on her comments with having  better trained police officers when someone says that that doesn't mean that we're anti-police  at all it means that we want to have our police officers better equipped to handle situations  that we're seeing happening in our in our neighborhoods in our community and that's what  we say when we say better training we don't we're not saying that we're not better trained  by these advantages we're advantages we're advantages we're advantages we're advantages  we're advantages we're advantages we're advantages we're advantages we're advantages  advantages we're advantages advantages advantages  advantages advantages advantages  advantages advantages advantages advantages  advantages advantages advantages advantages !  advantages Just last 18 seconds here. Whoever you're deciding to pick to fill these seats, they are, that's going to determine  advantages  advantages  advantages  advantages  advantages  change and we do need change. So I support race.  Marlon Wade-Davis.  I've never attended anything like this before, but I have to.  I think that whoever you put in the seat, in the seats available, that they do a better  job than history has it. Things that I would do different is I would not defraud an elderly  man that's 84 years old into buying a mansion, a Bidwell mansion, out of $400,000 while his  wife's away in Costa Rica.  Fill the Bidwell mansion with a homeless people to ensure that Ed and Yolanda never take possession  of the property they got swindled into buying and receive a COVID fund from a city council.  I'm not sure exactly who. I do.  And then charge the homeless rent.  Oh, and wait.  Collect.  The people who collect this are all supporters' rights at the mansion.  Now,  under Ed and Yolanda's name.  They're under squatters' rights there, but yet they're collecting the rent from the homeless, even though the COVID fund provided for the homeless.  It doesn't make any sense.  So $400,000 from Ed and Yolanda, and then between $100,000 to $300,000 that they charge these homeless people rent, all went into their pocket.  And then a fund.  We're not talking about this.  This is a current Superior Court case, case number 20CN.  000905.  But it's not mentioned about this happening at Ed and Yolanda's property.  And I'm one of the victims of this.  And I ask that the city council members and that the representatives, everybody in this building look into this because many of the victims are either disabled or they are homeless.  And they aren't doing no better than whenever they were put in that mansion.  No better.  They're all doing worse.  And some of them are in real danger.  That's all.  Thank you.  Can I leave my phone here?  I'd like to talk.  Okay.  Madam Clerk.  Okay.  So, Council, at this time, I've provided everyone with a small ballot listing out the three applicants at large and the three applicants for District 3.  Okay.  And if you can complete those, circling one person that you would like to see fill those vacant seats, that would be great.  If I come up with a tied vote or there's no majority, then we'll have round two and I have more cards printed.  I thought that I should have them just in case.  So, at this time, if you would complete your cards and Deputy City Clerk Rogers will come up and get those.  And then we'll tab you in.  Okay.  Thank you.  I would like to note that the at-large position, the term was ending anyway in 2022.  And District 3's term of office was actually until 2024.  However, because of the election law written the way it is, this person who is appointed tonight will only serve until 2022, at which time the actual voters will put in.  Okay.  So, I'm going to ask the Board of Trustees to complete their candidate of choice to complete that vacant term.  All right.  Mr. Mayor, while she's counting, can I make a comment?  I'm not going to.  I'm going to tune in like a...  Oh.  So, interesting evening with some loaded questions.  Questions that Chico has little or no control over.  I'm surprised no one was actually asked how they planned on curing COVID.  But it is what it is.  Thank you.  I want to thank everybody that's here, including the other.  The other applicants.  I have said from the very beginning, I would look for experience on a policy board.  Civility, stability, someone non-polarizing, probably cautious, lack of a political agenda, preferably not politically ambitious, and someone that could help give the city a soft landing for the next 16 to 17 months.  I think everybody here tonight actually demonstrated that pretty well.  It has did some of the other candidates.  I think it was a harder choice than most people know.  I'm excited for wherever it ends up.  But I thought...  Tonight was a little unfair to some of you.  But I just want...  You know, I'm sticking with what I've said from the get-go.  And thanks for being here.  Nicely said.  Thank you, Ms. Barr. !  Thank you.  Thank you. Okay, Council. That was actually probably the quickest tabulation that we've had for our boards and commissions and council appointments. So, just to let you know that a majority vote was three votes or more, and they would be  Thank you.  Thank you. So, just to let you know that a majority vote was three votes or more, and they would be deemed, anyone receiving three or more votes would be deemed appointed. So, for the at-large finalist, Mike O'Brien received four votes, and he would be appointed.  Brian received four votes and he would be appointed and then in district three  the finalist there was Dale Bennett with four votes so we I would like to welcome  Michael Bryan and Dale Bennett to the council the they will both get sworn in  at the beginning of the August 3rd meeting they will be receiving an agenda  packet I'll be meeting with them to go over an extensive orientation HR will  work with them to get them processed and so I think the council I know this is a  very quick turnaround because a law require the Charter requires us to do it  within 30 days I want to thank all the candidates who actually applied and were  willing to throw their hat in the arena and actually participate and and answer  some tough questions so if you have any additional questions again I will get  everything  you need to know about the agenda and I will be happy to answer any questions  that you have and I will be happy to answer any questions that you have and  I do want to make a note and I'd like to thank administrative services director  Dow for his IT staff because it wasn't our IT staff that installed that encoder  I just want everyone to know that it was we actually had an outside vendor as  well and great and very very grateful for that but that was a new encoder from  Granicus and our IT staff we couldn't have done it without him and we'll get  it online tonight and we'll be okay so I just wanted  to turn it back over to the mayor all right well welcome to mr. O'Brien and mr.  Bennett we look forward to having you up here and moving through our next  meetings and we'll look forward to their swearing in ceremony at the next formal  council meeting at this point in time we're gonna break for closed session and  do we have any public comments or council disqualifications all right we  will see you back thanks so much  you
