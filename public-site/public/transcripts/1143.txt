Just ask that you would give them that ability to make those choices that will benefit our community, and we thank you for them. We ask your blessing upon each and every employee of this city and your hand of protection on them, that you guide and direct them in their work as well. And we ask this in your name. Amen.

Anybody wishing to address the council on any item listed on the agenda must first complete a speaker card. They're located in the back of the room. We've started speakers. We will not take any additional cards on whatever that item may be. So, and then we will start with the item 1.5, the closed session announcement. City Attorney John Linden. Thank you, Mayor. City Council. Earlier this evening, the City Council recessed in closed session. All council members were present in closed session. The first item was conference with legal counsel, existing litigation in connection with the fire victims trust claim. The City Council was briefed by, by staff and council. The City Council voted 7-0 to approve a final claim determination from the victims, fire victims trust in the amount of $43 million. A formal and final claim determination will be forthcoming, but the council has voted to approve and accept the offer of $43 million in connection with the campfire damage with respect to street fatigue and related accidents. The City Council will exercise its consent, was briefed no final action was taken 2.5 conference with legal counsel anticipated litigation two cases the city council was brief on both cases no final action was taken the additional subsequent item that was brought forward tonight conference with legal counsel anticipated potential litigation the city council was brief and discussed this issue no final action was taken that concludes my report all right thank you very much appreciate that uh and there's also a arbor day proclamation that's in the packet as well so we'd like to acknowledge arbor day um we'll move on to the consent agenda all matters listed on the consent agenda are considered to be routine in nature and to be enacted in one motion do we have any council disqualifications or no votes all right any speakers um i have one but let me check i think i might have two all right okay i have two speakers the first speaker and if you can go ahead and come to the middle aisle jamie hutchinson followed by greg scott oh for coming to this meeting i was challenged about how often i speak in front of the council a reminder i speak in front of you because my district i have not been able yet to vote for representative for the last four years when i got in front of you, I told you I would be speaking for myself on these issues because there's nobody there that I elected to speak for me or has approached me about my views on the issue. So I speak on these issues. If you look at the issues, Merriam Park is right next to District 6 in District 7. I'm speaking on this because I'm concerned still about one little item. I love overall Merriam Park. I think Mr. Gonzalez did a brilliant job in keeping it alive. I can't knock that. I'm not going to. I was concerned that we didn't get our baseball park. My wife loves baseball the way it's presented here. She loves seeing the samurai. She loved the outlaws. She loved that whole thing. We thought we were going to have a baseball park. What we hate is the bridge going across the Luchico Creek and where it's going apart across by two schools. It's still on here, but it's being done. If we look back through that, the only reason the alternative site was turned down was environmental reasons, but that area has been destroyed if you've been out along that area of Luchico Creek. I'm sorry. I really think that that is still a poor decision. I know it's not going to change your minds. It's too late to do the big remake that would be neat to be made. I don't like the idea of putting a major traffic thoroughfare straight through to El Monte out to Middell Park, which is what that would do. You've got two schools there where you're going to have to go. The increased traffic flow, Luchico Creek Elementary, most often ignored school around here who's done some brilliant things, is one of them affected on one side. On the other side, you have Marsh Junior High, and you have a major traffic that you're going to put through there. A lot of that will be school traffic, but a lot of that will be other. You know once Merion Park gets established to get to Bidwell Park, they're going to be going through that district to get to the other side of town. Why it does help emergency vehicles to some degree, the discussion was to put it further east rather than through two school areas. The park that you're talking about on Merion Creek, the A and B, will be right next to that bridge. We haven't had a bridge in this town that hasn't had people end up living under it. That you're going to be able to do that, more power to you. I haven't seen it happen. It didn't happen on 99. It hasn't happened. It hasn't happened under Forest Avenue where there's a pile of garbage being built because we can't get police help. Thank you. Thank you. Our last speaker is Greg Scott. Good evening, Council. Mr. Mayor. I'd like to talk to you a little bit about parking. Favorite subject. I know I know you do the free parking Fridays, and what I'm going to ask you to do is to think about an amendment which would be the first hour free for every day until the end of the year. I've been talking with some of the city staff. I think it will work. It would go a long ways, in my opinion, to ease some of the concerns from citizens and downtown business owners on the parking issue. Although it's getting better, it's still an issue that I hear about daily. And I think if you give a first hour free every day between from Black Friday until the end of the year, it would give us a chance to use that as a demonstration. Maybe an hour is not the right one. Maybe 30 minutes is the right number. But it would give us the data we need to look and see if it actually works and helps alleviate some of the on-street parking issues. That's all I have. Thank you. Thank you. Mr. Scott, I want to congratulate you and DCBA on a Christmas preview. It was fabulous. Really excellent. Thank you. Thank you. All right. Public comments, members of the public may address the council at this time on any matter not already listed on the agenda and within the jurisdiction's authority. Mayor Kulich, we need you to approve the consent agenda, if you so choose. Sorry. Thank you. Move to approve. Second. Okay. There was a motion and a second to approve the consent agenda as read, which included ordinance of the City Council of the City of Chico approving Amendment No. 6 to Development Agreement 0502 between the City of Chico and Marion Park LLC, Gonzales Development Company. This is the final reading and adoption with the reading of the title only. Council Member Bennett? Yes. Council Member Morgan? Yes. Council Member Tandon? Yes. Council Member Van Overbeck? Yes. Council Member Winslow? Yes. Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds? Aye. Mayor Kulich? Aye. Carrie 7-0. All right. Now, public comments. Members of the public and you will note some changes in terms of exactly how I'm going to say this because we've added some additional verbiage here. So members of the public may address the council at this time on any matter not already listed on the agenda and within the jurisdiction's authority. Comments should be limited to three minutes or as determined based upon the number of speakers the council cannot take any action at this meeting on request made under this section of the agenda. How many speakers? We have 11. All right. Three minutes. Okay. And I would ask that when I call your names, if you, the first two speakers would go ahead and join us in the middle aisle. Dave Donnan followed by Ed Teets. Thank you, Council, for seeing me. I want to thank you all for standing up for seniors. And the legacy and the negotiation with the City Manager and the Mayor and the Vice Mayor, we really appreciate you stepping up for seniors and getting them to reduce their 30% down to 10%. The other thing that I would like to say is I'm also appreciative of you agendizing this so there can be further discussion on this. We're not the only mobile home park that's in Chico. There's 18 other ones. But I would like to say thank you to all of you for taking this opportunity to be here today. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Ed Teets followed by James Hedgenson. Good evening, City Council. Hey, Dale. Thank you so much again. Just like Dave said, thank you kindly for listening, hearing, and doing something about it. Just kind of the tip of the iceberg here. But we're getting some results. Do not get grandpa and grandma or mom and dad mad. We're going to do something about it. We have to take care of our senior citizens and this is one way to do it. We have to take care of our senior citizens and this is one way that we can accomplish things like this through your efforts and the efforts of our residences. And this, like I said, is the tip of the iceberg. We got a lot of long ways to go. Reduce to 10%, but what's next you're going to bring, who knows. But we are going to be diligent and hopefully you will be also. And again, thank you and happy Thanksgiving to you. Thank you. Thank you. James Hedgenson followed by Kathy Block. I had a brief chat with the police chief on the way in here today in which he decided that I spoke on too many issues for him to hear what I was specifically asking the police. I told you about being attacked after getting off a bus where I greeted my wife who was getting on the same bus that I was getting off. getting off by a person who came up to me and said, hit me, hit me. I tried to avoid him, tried to walk away from him, going down to a bike path that just took me just across the street, half a block away, all I needed to go. He comes at me again, says, I told you, hit me, and he takes a cup that he had down in his hand that I didn't see, and he throws it on me. It's a big gold cup, this big. That's two cups, half a cup, and a big gold. It's two cups. It's a liquid. I have no idea what the liquid is. It appears to be a dark liquid. My first guess whenever I see a dark liquid is coffee, but there was no smell or anything particular that told me that. Why did the guy come up to me and say, hit me? Most of you know that we live in a fentanyl culture that's out there. The key element of fentanyl is it blocks pain. Fentanyl users, and first-time users, want to know how well it blocks pain. It is one of the things they do. Police may not know this. They're not very aware of the street out here. They're not very aware of what's going on under these bridges or where I live. They haven't done a thing where I live. I called the police on this immediately. I got less than half a block. I walked to my place. Ignoring this guy, two friends and a couple of dogs were with him. The other thing I was thinking about was sometimes they use that to attack. If I had thrown a catch at him, his friends would have testified I attacked him and they could beat me. But I got away and got right to my apartment and called the police immediately. 9-1-1. Anyone show up? No. No. Two hours later, I get a phone call. Well, what happened out there? What do you mean what happened out there? I talked to your operator, told her what happened. I was like, I don't know. I could look out my window and see where this guy was. He was still in the area. They didn't show. Police think this is acceptable. Got a big laugh out of a cop that was standing over here last meeting. Thought it was funny. I didn't think it was funny when I turned red-faced at him and stuck my face in his face. He wouldn't have been funny if I'd stuck what I could have stuck in him. But this isn't funny anymore. It's not funny that our police is not responding. You've heard my testimony on the kids before and the other things. I ask you to do something about it. Correct the police department. Thank you. Kathy Vlach, and I apologize if I mispronounced your name, and followed by Tammy Donaldson. Hi, I'm Kathy Vlach, and I've spoken here before, but I want to thank you, City Council members, for championing our request to control outrageous mobile home space increases by Legacy LLC. We appreciate you and your support. We appreciate your effort and your time, all of you. I'd like to thank Legacy LLC and CEO Patrick O'Malley, the mayor and vice mayor, for negotiating a temporary rent reduction for our 96 residents out of 119. However, as Legacy LLC chooses to communicate via the media and not with the residents, not one of our letters or emails have been responded to, which we have started sending back in September. I'll address some comments from CEO O'Malley's letter in this public forum. CEO O'Malley, regarding your temporary rent reprieve from the most recent rent increase, you have thrown us a small bone, offered a Trojan horse to placate us, floated a pool noodle in the middle of an L5 hurricane, which you created, and now pretend to be our savior. What will happen a few months from now? City Council members, thank you for the motion to consider remedies at a future meeting. We need a rent stabilization ordinance for senior mobile parks to protect us from predatory, out-of-state landowners. has already enacted RSOs in nine counties and 83 plus cities that provide residents with tenant protection against unexpected and substantial rent increases. It's the right thing to do for our vulnerable seniors. Thank you. Thank you. Tammy Donaldson followed by Nicholas Carter. And again, if you could please line up in the middle aisle, it's greatly appreciated. Thank you. So Tammy. Hi. It's easy to know when the camps of our unhoused people are being swept, we all see the obvious migration of people and their belongings. The idea that if the city spent enough resources and time chasing people around town, they would leave is all panned out. People are not leaving and it should be expected that they remain. In fact, as camp locations become fewer and fewer, people are setting up in parking lots and on sidewalks. While the existing camps are being swept, the camps are being swept in the city. The existing remedies may comply with court order. They are obviously insufficient. Our few former shelter, formal shelter options, and even the Eaton camp have undeniably proven to be not appropriate for many of our unhoused citizens. We still have no accessible inpatient mental health care locally or detox services and inadequate shelter options. What we do have are very competent organizations of people who have over the last many years become experts on supporting our unhoused. We will continue to be able to help people in the community, and will continue to be able to help people in the community, and will continue to be able to help people in safe and sanctioned camps. Instead of ignoring the well-researched, viable, and evidence-based proposals from these groups, it's time for the city to start working with the community. The evidence of our local housing crisis is before our eyes every day. It is a fact that our nation's elderly are the largest growing demographic to face homelessness. This is a terrible time for the city to ignore such an issue when laid before them. A few minutes online will educate you to the fact That what just happened at one of our several retirement mobile home communities in town has been happening all over the country. It has not always ended well. Not every group of people has the capacity to organize or has a community with any mechanism to protect them. And it's bad when that happens. And thank you for, I'm happy these people were able to organize. And thank you for taking them seriously. But just as our already unhoused people are not going to just go away, neither will the predatory corporations, which endanger the existing housing of our elders and other vulnerable low-income people. I ask that the city research what other municipalities have done, and there's quite a bit all over the country, in the face of this very real problem to protect our elders and other low-income residents from predatory development corporations and prevent them from joining. And I'm asking the city to implement sensible solutions to our crisis and take measures to not allow it to become worse. Thank you. Thank you. Nicholas Carter, followed by Katie McCutcheon. She definitely covered up on the elderly and the uprising on the homeless youth is definitely going on. I'm addressing the lack of the truth of resources and guidance for tourists in the PAL shelters. I myself am ADA compliant and clean from hardships and have spoken with multiple individuals who are homeless who are as well concluded that are denied long-term, and I'm asking the city to address the issues of the homeless shelter and the lack of the support systems. I understand we are overpopulated, but I feel we still blame the matter on many issues, natural disasters, never focusing on the programs and the lack of responsibilities on informing availability of open beds and resources to get people employed and back on their feet. It only provides temporary assistance with no focus on being able to continue to look presentable at work, and the check-in times within the homeless shelter are between 2 and 5, which makes it definitely difficult with going, cleaning, and doing all that. I also look at the fact that the homeless shelter is a place where people can be treated with care and care for themselves. I also like to stress that it only provides temporary assistance. I have been in the mission for well over six months. Now I'm still waiting to get a phone call back. It states in the human resources forms that I have given today that it has to be cleaned from drugs. To beg the question, I noticed that people who are in the need and it seems to be that in the community just doesn't want those kinds of homeless people on the streets, but also that the people that are doing drugs are in the PAL shelters. And so I'm asking the city to address the issues of the homeless shelter and so as I feel that, the people who are clean and trying to get on their feet are not getting the resources they need because of how many people are in the shelters. Sorry. We have a really high population of homeless youth, and a lot of the homeless youth are going to the Sixth Street program. So a lot of the homeless goes from 18 to 25. So those people from 18 to 25 are having a lack of resources in the tourist shelter and never getting the access to the public health center. So I'm asking the city to address the issues from the Sixth Street programs. And they're so overbooked. And I feel like that it's been coming an uprising issue and it's all sides and all four corners. And I hope that we figure out a solution and we can talk to the shelters and talk to what's going on and why are they taking shelters down and they're not doing what they say they're needing to do and they're not taking and addressing the problems. Thank you. Thank you. I'm visiting your nice town of Chico from Star Valley, Arizona. And Addison Winslow is my grandson in all fair disclosure. So we had discussed at home about what was going on with your mobile home situation and them coming in and trying to be raising the prices and all. And the very same thing is happening to me in the senior park where I live in Arizona. And I'm going to be there. And it's always been local ownership and has been just a wonderful place to live like a family. But now this corporation from Florida has come in and what they said was they don't care when we say this is not the way. So they tried to raise our rates also extremely high and also try to say that although I've lived there 20 years and paid the same I mean I've had increases on the same lot but all the increases have been across the board for all the lots. And now they said well this one is a little bigger and this one has a double on it so they're going to increase that price. And we're like yeah that doesn't seem right. And they're like well we can do whatever you want and if you don't like it you can move which I think is their plan because then they can really raise the prices but all of us seniors and I'm one of the younger seniors a lot of them are in their 80s 90s and they've lived there over 50 years. They have nowhere to go. There are no apartments to rent in our town. There is no affordable housing to be had. So that would leave some of us in a shelter or on the street and I don't think that's what we want to do. So I would commend you on what you're doing to help your seniors here and I'll be talking with Addison and take his ideas back to share with my city council because I think they need to hear what a great job you're doing supporting your seniors. Thank you. Thank you. Julie Threat followed by Eli Sabi. Hi council. Julie Threat, District 6. So yeah I'm here to speak on the rent stabilization issue. I listened to the meeting last time and I heard a couple of my friends here with this issue and Casey thank you very much for taking an interest in it. I wanted to bring a couple items to the table for you to think about. I've been at the county supervisors meeting for 18 months and there's been two times when they actually had it on the agenda. So October of 2022 Brad Stevens actually went through a whole huge agenda item talking about all the other counties that have programs and going through the legal options that the county did have. They didn't take action and they then asked for Shelby Boston to do a survey. So Shelby Boston went out and surveyed all of the mobile home park residents and six months later this year came back with a whole huge agenda item speaking about every single one of these citizens their age, their demographics, were they renters, were they homeowners, what were their situation, what were their issues. She did a fantastic job as you can imagine with Shelby. That meeting I think I heard about a dozen citizens just shocked me. And I've been there listening to campfire survivors. I'm talking about people describing slumlord owners here that live in the Bay Area. I'm talking about one woman that went up there and said she was almost murdered by one of the property managers. Literally almost ran over. I'm hearing things about, I mean just horrific stories. So I really urge you to go talk to Shelby, talk to Brad Stevens, talk to Sal Landano. They kicked it to him because he's now the homeowners association president I guess. So I think that they would be good sources of information. Thank you. Thank you. Eli Sabi followed by Katie Posey. Just going to ask that the Holy Spirit be with me as I speak as I say the things that he wants me to and not my own will. Yes. I'm going to start with Matthew 513. You are the salt of the earth, but if the salt has lost its savor, what shall it be salted? It is thenceforth good for nothing. I live in a brand spanking new Mercedes Sprinter van. It's salty, right? Except the water doesn't often work and the electricity often doesn't work. It's salty. It has lost its savor. I'm on the streets. It's 40 degrees last night, but not long ago, a week ago, it was 38 degrees in my van. And I live in a van, ladies and gentlemen. A sparkling Mercedes. Salty van. 38 degrees. I don't know if you know this when you're at home, but just yards away from me, three yards away, cough, cough, sniffle, sniffle, wailing, I think, Lord, please don't make me go out there. I remember in the Bible it says if a neighbor comes to you in the middle of the street, you don't turn them away. I said, okay, Lord, I see them. So I get out at 3 o'clock in the morning. I give this woman, no, first I think I have three, I own three blankets. One's pink and soft and fuzzy. I might need it. I haven't used it in 18 months. One's blue. My Chihuahua likes that one. And one is just so velvet. Ooh, it feels good. I'm like, I'm not giving this woman my blanket. The Lord says, yes, you are. So I give her that pink blanket. I'm upset. I got it at Victoria's Secret. No, I got it at Dick's Sporting Goods. But again, I haven't used it in 18 months. What if I need it? Damn it. I take that blanket. I give it to the woman. I make her some tea because I know she had 102 fever the night before. And I give her a hot water bottle with the little electricity I have and the little water that I had available. Oh, what is it? Good and faithful servant. Thank you, Lord. So, um, last night it was 40 degrees. Um, let me tell you, I rolled into town about two months ago. I haven't been anywhere that long. I've been traveling in America for 18 months when the good Lord found me. And I'll tell you, when I rolled into town, I met a man. And that man, uh, he's, um, he needs some help. And no one's there to help him. He, um, his things get stolen. He lives on the streets. He's homeless. I took him myself. Girl with no money, no job, no diesel, no electricity, no water. And I took him to get his EBT card. I took him to get a phone. I took him to get his medical insurance because he has seizures. And I just found out today across from your sparkling, beautiful ice rink and not far from your million dollar basketball court, my friend died on that corner yesterday. So if you are some salty city council and you're supposed to be preserving this town and savoring us, check to see if you've lost your savor. That's time, ma'am. Thank you. And check your closets for blankets. Katie Posey followed by Will Kennard. Good evening. I'd like to bring up something that was on the radar here a while ago. And I'd like to bring it up again because it's about none other than the library. And I bring up the library again because this past week I was tutoring a student and I needed to meet, it was a fourth grader, I needed to meet with her three times. I wanted to meet all three times at the library but I couldn't because the library's closed on Wednesday. So I just want to again remind you the library here in Chico is only open four days a week. That means it's closed three days a week. So I bring this up, I realize and I understand the county, you know, they've got to put prioritize public safety. I understand that. I also know at one point, as you all know, that the city, the city of Chico, was a part of supporting the library. My opinion is that I think the city should be a part of that again long term. I do think that cities should set aside funds because their constituents use the library. Now another thing I notice and I observe that you may or may not be aware of is the library is very busy all the time. And there's lots of people in there of all ages. So if you need to see that demonstrated then I'd encourage you to visit the library between opening hours. Especially the children's section. But I noticed when I was there that all the tables were filled with people. People are using the computers. It's not just about going and checking out print books. Obviously you can check out e-books. But there is some wonderful programming that the library does and provides to the community. And so I do recall that at one point you had looked into finding out from the county how much it costs to keep the library running for one day for a whole year. And I was curious to know more about those numbers. Another thing to think about is so you may know that the library in Redding is open seven days a week. And I don't know what the hours are on Sundays now. But it might be the same. I'm not sure. But it used to be Sundays they were open from maybe 1 to 5, 1 to 6. So another idea is how much would it cost to fund the library for half a day. I'm just throwing these ideas out here but I definitely just want to encourage you not to forget about the library and the library is a place where you can Even if there's nothing that you can do or that you want to do, I think it's important that you know that there are people out there that still think that it's important. So thank you and have a wonderful Thanksgiving. Thank you. Will Kennard is our last speaker. In March there was an ordinance passed to allow for military equipment to be used by the city on the civilians. That ordinance should be revisited. Actually that ordinance should be considered by the council, voted on and removed. So the ordinance for military equipment to be used by the police on the civilians should be removed. We should not be using the military equipment by police on the citizens. So that's And it's just a simple ordinance vote. We can bring it upon the council and vote it out. Make that use of that hardware illegal and people using it will have to stop. Thank you. Thank you. That was our last speaker. Alright, thank you very much, everybody. Item 5.1, City Council Member Conversation. Oh, sorry. Senate Bill 329. And we have a report from our esteemed City Clerk and Election Specialist, Deborah Preston. Thank you, Mayor Coolidge and Council. I have to say, in all the time I've been here, 23 years, this is the first and only time I've ever had an item, and the only item, under regular business. So I'll try to expedite that. So I'll try to expedite that. This is really an opportunity to update the council on the passage of Senate Bill 329, which raises council compensation to $1,900 based on population numbers for the City of Chico, effective January 1st, 2024. While I was originally seeking direction from the council regarding implementation, as noted in my staff report, upon further review of the charter, as well as consultation with the city manager and city attorney, no council action is actually needed this evening to implement the changes. However, having this matter on this agenda allows for the opportunity for transparency and to explain how we got here. As some may recall, in 2004, the voters voted or approved a ballot measure that amended our city charter, Section 601, titled Remuneration, sorry, I was saying that earlier, to authorize the city to use the compensation levels established in Government Code Section 3651,2, which is based on population numbers. We basically, the voters moved from the charter requirements and they said we will go by general law. And that was based on population. So, based on that vote, our charter was then amended to state, and I think it's important to read this because it really does explain the process and why no council action is needed tonight. And that section indicates in A, each council member shall receive the maximum monthly salary allowed for council members and general law cities on the salary schedule set forth in the California Government Code Section 36516A, as that schedule now exists or may hereafter be amended. This salary shall be adjusted pursuant to that schedule whenever the official population of the city increases or decreases as determined by the latest decennial federal census, a subsequent census, or the State Department of Finance. The mayor shall receive in addition to this the monthly salary of the council member. So, in 2004, based on the population of the city at that time, the monthly compensation for council, I believe, went from $200 to $600 per month, with the mayor's position obviously receiving that additional 20%. Please note that the compensation levels have not been increased for over 19 years, although the council could have adopted pursuant to the administration's decision to change the existing law prior to SB 329. They could have adopted an ordinance at any time, giving them an additional increase. So now you fast forward to June of this year. Senate Bill 329 was introduced and passed with an effective date of January 1st, 2024. And I want to read the first section of that Senate Bill. Section 1 of Senate Bill 329 states, the legislature finds and declares all of the following. A. The compensation schedule for general law cities has not been adjusted since 1984, meaning that city council compensation has not kept pace with inflation. B. Allowing cities to adjust their compensation for inflation since 1984 may help city councils become more diverse because increased compensation can help individuals from across different income levels receive sufficient income from their service to help ensure that they can continue to serve the public and support their families. So based on Section 601 that says shall, that any time there's an adjustment it shall happen of our charter and the passage of SB 329, the increased compensation will go into effect on January 1st, 2024 according to the changes instituted by the Senate Bill. Are there any questions? I have a question. Is the state required to adopt this? Well, the voters voted in this amendment. It wasn't driven by a council ordinance. This was an actual vote by the people. And when the if you note that verbiage, it says that each council member shall receive the maximum monthly salary allowed for council members in general law cities. Now the state is adjusting that amount and pursuant to our charter, and the voters who put that in, because it wasn't council driven, it was approved by the voters, I believe that it does indicate that it needs to move forward. We can ask our city attorney to weigh in on that, but I believe it's really clear based on the charter and the Senate Bill. Well then, can I ask the same question to the city attorney? Yes, Council Member Van Overbeek. So your question is whether we're required, right? So yes, I mean at least in the sense of the fact that your charter states that staff shall implement this, we are required to adjust your compensation based on this charter provision. The city council does not need to take any action, so there's no opportunity at this point to reject that adjustment. The council individually can, you know, decline to accept raises or increases if that's your decision to do so. However, city staff have the requirement to implement your charter as imposed and amended in 2004 by the voters. If the city did not do it, in theory, the city could be liable to a council member for not implementing the charter as required under the city's code. My concern is that this is yet another mandate from the state that's going to cost the city $100,000. If we adjust the $600 for the inflation system, since 2004, when it was last, when it was set at $600, we'd end up with something like $1,000 through the end of 23, adjusted for the inflation during that period of time. But this is almost twice that. And, you know, the city's scrapping for every dollar to fix the roads and hire cops. This is, if you have to depend on your city council's stipend to serve on the council, you probably shouldn't be making land use decisions. That's my opinion. Okay, just a point of order. No action can be taken. This is already going to happen. Any discussion we have is pointless. Do you have speakers? We have three speakers. We have three speakers. All right. I'm sorry, what? I'm sorry, the mayor asked me to come up. He wasn't finished. No, it was, he said on a non-action item. Yeah. No, this is a regular item and it was agendized to actually provide me with direction. Okay. So our first two speakers is James Hutchinson followed by Julie Three. Living in a gerrymandered district, we haven't been able to vote for a district representative. As a number of people in District 5 have not been able to vote for a district representative. We have to be concerned about whether or not we increase this amount. We had no representation. We had nobody that we selected that represented our point of view. Nobody that's reached out to us. And said, hey, I want to meet with you people, discuss what you're interested in since you didn't have a chance to vote for me, I'm going to tell you where I am. It's not happening. And I'm asking for that to happen. Second thing I think needs serious consideration, I brought it up a number of months ago, that the idea of electing a mayor, not a strong mayor, not a mayor that has the power to have veto and override registration, but a separate office of the mayor, somebody who can act as the coordinator between the city manager, since you have a city manager form of government, and the council. And he can represent, he, she, whoever gets this office, can represent the city at various meetings, various foreign things, to reach out. And it would be specifically paid an amount compensated for that time taken. And it would be available to anybody. We'd have to change the charter, I understand that. Please, I'm not that naive yet. I'm working on it. But we need to have a mayor that is selected by the whole city. Not just by a council that doesn't even represent all of us. Right now this council does not represent all the people of Chico, because we couldn't vote. We couldn't vote for these people. I couldn't vote for District 7. People in District 5 weren't able to vote. Some people were able to vote for two districts the last time they had a vote. So we need to look at that. We need to take a serious consideration if we're not going to have times every time a redistricting comes about, that people are going to be left out of the process and not have representation. This would guarantee representation. The mayor would run citywide. And recalls, as it is now, and they attempted to recall the mayor. I wasn't in favor of the recall, Mr. Mayor, just so you know. But in order to recall, only his district or the city council could recall. The people of Chico could not recall the mayor. We couldn't. Even though we disagreed with him. We think he's doing a horrible job. We could only go to the council and say, do something. And since we don't have anybody reelected in the council, we can't do that. So essentially I'm saying, we need a mayor that is responsible to all the people of Chico, not just to the city council. And that's what I'm asking you to do. Think about this in broader aspects. Thank you. Julie Threatt, followed by Bruce McLean. Thank you, Ms. Preston. It was good to hear the detail of that. I kind of add some context. Compensation was my career, so I felt compelled to come down here and speak to this. There was a Facebook survey going around. You may have seen it, if you guys should get the raise yes or no. I think there was a lot of no's. But mine was no, just based on the hotel debacle in Cal Park. But, you know, I did take a step back and say, look, 2004, my gosh, seriously, you guys need a raise. In my ten years here, people have asked me, Julie, do you want to run for office? And I'm like, school board, yeah. I could see me doing school board. County supervisor job, yeah, I just put my hat in the ring for that. Your jobs, hell no, hard pass. City of Chico, you guys have the hardest jobs I've ever seen. I came from the Bay Area. You guys deserve a raise. I wish there was a way, Council Member Van Overbeek, that you could maybe, you know, somewhere in the middle lies the truth. I mean, Casey, Sean, you guys are warriors. I mean, you've gone through hell and back. I think you should be at the top of the tier, and I think the newbies are at the bottom. I think the vice mayor should get an additional 10%. I think the city should get extra money. So if there was a way to kind of do it more like, you know, private sector does based on your own individual records, great. But I think, you know, based on what we just heard from Debbie Presson and what you guys deliver, I mean, I'm serious. I think you do deserve a raise. Thank you. Thank you. Bruce McLean is our last speaker. Yeah, I want to support the last speaker. City Council members do their job. They do their job. And I think that conscientiously requires a lot of time and energy. And that should be compensated. I mean, I don't know what the average hourly rate would be with this raise, but it's not going to be much over minimum wage, so we're not talking about overindulging our city council members. But people have different economic statuses, and because they have to work, shouldn't preclude them from serving on the council, nor should owning property. So I encourage you not to be concerned about the raise. Thank heaven that the state makes smart mandates for our city councils. Thanks. Thank you. All right. So, no items posted after the agenda. Reports and communications. The following reports and communications are provided for the council's information. No actions can be taken on items under this section unless the council agrees to include it on subsequent agenda. City Manager's report. No report. Nothing about turkey or anything? No. All right. Item 6.2. Council member requests pursuant to AP and P1010. Council members may verbally request an item to be agendized at a future meeting. In setting what the item should be, would be a majority of the vote if the council is needed an order for staff to agendize. Do we have any council member requests? I have one. All right. Mr. Randolph. I would like to request that the city attorney come back to us with what our options are to implement a rent stabilization measure related to trailer parks. Mobile home parks. We did that at the last meeting. But I'm asking that was an agenda item, but I'm asking for the city attorney to come back with specifically what our options are. And that's different. So the item is coming back. It was already voted on at the last meeting to bring the discussion back to council at the December 5th meeting, which is the 30 days in between. It sounds like and I don't want to put words in your mouth Council member Van Overbeck, but I believe you're asking for an analysis by the city attorney, which that wasn't part of the motion before. Exactly. Just so we're clear on what the definition, what our options are when we have that discussion. We have to have the discussion to vote. We're putting the cart in front of the horse. That has to come out of the discussion. You can't preempt the discussion with a motion. So I think part of the discussion is understanding what we're now discussing what's on a later agenda. Yeah. I think that staff will be prepared to answer questions. That's fine. If the city attorney is prepared to answer questions, I think that's great. Okay. I'm happy. For once. Okay. So there is no motion. Any further requests from council members? All right. Seeing none, we'll move to adjourn. See you December 5th. Thank you.
