So we will start with a proclamation.  So Mr. Dino Corbin, if you'd join me down below at the podium.  How are you?  Good to see you.  I'm like, that's what I need.  All right.  Otherwise, I've got to talk into this thing.  That just doesn't work.  All right.  William.  I didn't know that.  Dino Corbin, Jr. didn't know the junior part either.  I do.  All right.  Whereas in 1974, William Dino Corbin, Jr. earned his Bachelor of Arts in Information  and Communications and went on to earn his NAB at Harvard Management School and an RAB  from the Sterling Institute of Sales training and over 400 hours of peace officer training.  And whereas his broadcasting career as an announcer, production, and radio host, he's  been a television technician in 1972.  Since that time, he has worked in the North State in the publishing and broadcasting field  working with KHSL, radio and television, KNVN, Clear Channel Communications, Catamaran Broadcasting,  Deer Creek Broadcasting, and also served as a Butte County Sheriff, just to name a few.  And certainly doing this, and I have to pontificate a little bit here, putting your life history  on a single piece of paper is certainly not easy.  But it's not easy.  And that's one of the reasons why we really wanted to have you here, to recognize you.  And whereas Dino is a published author and has appeared on various radio and television  programs, such as The Ken Hamlin Show, Roger Friedenberg Show, Phil Donahue, that's going  back a few years, CBS News, ABC Evening News, PBS Freedom Speaks, and ABC News.  And whereas he has not only lived and worked in the North State, but he believes in giving  back to the community.  And that is a very big reason why we're having you here today.  Serving on the Chamber of Commerce Board, the United Way, Chico Noon Exchange Club,  Chico Rotary, Stansberry House, which you've done amazing work with, and we really appreciate  that, the Preservation Society there, Butte Glen Heart Association, and various other  ones too.

Thank you.  Thank you very much.  You're welcome to say a few words here.  Thank you.  Wow.  Wow.  Greg Scott said, no tears.  That might be on its way.  This is most unbelievable and amazing.  Thank you.  50 years ago, I started literally across the street as a DJ.  And you went over all the great stuff that I've done.  I appreciate that.  I just want to say I love Chico, my family, people I get to work with,  the volunteers, the professionals in our industry that are here.  And Chico is a slice of heaven.  This is heaven.  If I don't know what it is, this is it.  And I'm glad to be here with all of you.  Thank you so much.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you. All right. Do we have another presentation as well?  Amber, you're all right. I think we'll get you set up here.  I'm going to start it off if that's all right.  Yeah, absolutely.  Bear with me just a sec.  Perfect. Good evening, Council. Thank you for the opportunity to speak to you tonight.  I'm going to start the presentation off very quickly.  I just have a handful of slides kind of giving really a pallet shelter year in review for 2022,  and then we'll quickly hand it off to the Executive Director of the Jesus Center  to really give the bulk of the presentation and really what you want to hear here tonight.  So quick overview. I'm just going to touch on the litigation timeline that we're all aware of,  pallet shelter construction that took place late 2021, early into 2022,  cleaning of public spaces, outreach engagement,  and then we will hand it off to the pallet shelter site operator.  So as we all know,  we started enforcing our anti-camping ordinances in early 2021,  and a group called Legal Services of Northern California filed suit against the city in early April of 2021.  And then on April 11th of 2021,  there was a restraining order put in place prohibiting us from enforcing our park in public space rules.  And so as everybody knows, we're working under the auspice in the Ninth Circuit Court,  some freeing.  And the joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint  We entered into a settlement agreement that really defines the infrastructure process and policies to continue our enforcement efforts in our public spaces.  And then in end of April of 2022, we opened the Pallet Shelter Facility.  As you know, it's off of the Silver Dollar, or excuse me, the Martin Luther King Jr. Parkway.  And it was previously leased to the Silver Dollar BMX Association.  They leased it for a number of years for a dollar a year to provide their activities there.  They were also starting to outgrow the parcel, so we kind of worked with them and collaborated and facilitated a move from that facility up to the north end of town by the airport off of Marauder Street.  And a facility that the city owned and established a new lease agreement with a lot more room for their expansion as well.  So a little bit of short-term pain will benefit a long-term gain for the BMX Association.  They really want to start having national events, and they needed the space to expand a track to be able to do so.  So they're working hard to make that happen.  And we appreciate their collaboration.  But with the existing BMX facility there, there's quite a bit of construction that needed to take place.  And we're in a feverish construction activity due to the winter months that we were deploying this project.  So we had to remove about 4,000 cubic yards of dirt and then bring in almost 7,000 tons of aggregate base to really prep the site for the Pallet Shelter Facility.  And then make sure the drainage for stormwater.  runoff was appropriate to the existing facilities on either side of the lot.  So there's just a few construction slides I wanted to share.  As we ordered the Pallet Shelters, they started to come in and we weren't complete even with the site grading at the time.  So we started putting them together even when the grading wasn't complete.  So lots of overlap and a pretty aggressive construction schedule and project.  That's the finished product.  Excuse me.  It's our Pallet Shelter site as we know it today with 177 units has the capacity for 354 beds.  Per the settlement agreement parameters, we aren't able to force folks to double up.  But we do have a lot of folks that do double up in their Pallet Shelter.  Whether in some sort of relationship, boyfriend, girlfriend, married status, that type of scenario.  And then some prefer a roommate as well.  So we do have instances where they are doubled up.  But otherwise, 177 units there.  Restrooms, hospitality tent.  Administrator.  Building.  Brick and mortar restrooms.  And then a mobile shower and laundry unit access the facility during the daytime.  Costs.  I wanted to touch on the costs.  I know a lot of you are aware of this.  But just want to reiterate the obligation that the city has put forth to prop this up.  The site design and construction management costs are there.  Site grading cost was over half a million dollars.  Again, we constructed this facility in the middle of winter.  And believe it or not, in late 2021.  We did have some rain events.  So we had to lime treat the facility too to deal with the water.  So that was quite a costly endeavor on the site grading component too.  The Pallet Shelter purchase themselves was a little over $1.6 million.  I want to thank our friends at Butte County and the County Board of Supervisors for helping us with that.  They funded the Pallet Shelter purchase.  The electrical installation is a staggering cost.  And a lot of people ask why that was so expensive.  And basically we had to upgrade the service.  The PG&E service there at the site.  We had to upgrade the service at the facility.  And when you think about it, we had to establish electrical service for 177 residential homes basically.  So that's a pretty big task.  And a pretty heavy duty electrical service that meets the requirements of the Pallet Shelter.  Then annual operating costs.  These are staggering too.  But I want to let folks know that these are just up to.  This is worst case scenario what we budgeted to or budgeted for based on full occupancy.  So we have.  Outreach and engagement staff that are in my department, public works, operations and maintenance.  We have three positions budgeted for.  We've been able to work through this with two positions and it's worked quite well.  Again, this is unchartered territory for us.  So we really wanted to see how things went.  And that would help us determine what type of resources we were going to continue to dispatch to this effort.  So, so far we've been able to be very effective with two outreach engagement staff members.  We have two maintenance, senior maintenance workers.  That support the Pallet Shelter.  And again, those rates are fully burdened rates, you know, salary and benefits.  Then we go to contractual services, which is the second category there.  Security is a big component.  Daily food service is a pretty large component.  Laundry, showers.  And again, the site operator is budgeted at full capacity.  So it's up to that amount.  And so far we're tracking very well.  A lot less than what you see there.  But at least wanted to show the amount that we have budgeted for this fiscal year.  But what has it allowed us to do?  It's allowed us to really clean up our public spaces for the enjoyment of all.  And bring them back to a certain standard.  And that's a couple before and after pics just outside of City Hall here.  A couple at Comanche Creek before and after.  Another at Comanche Creek.  That's under the Cohasset Bridge.  And we try to use mechanized equipment during the year.  We do a cleanup operation as much as possible to try to prevent the amount of times public works staff have to touch debris.  A lot of it can be hazardous.  But of course, under a bridge scenario like this, you can't get mechanized equipment in there or in the creek for that matter.  So we have to touch every single piece of debris by hand.  And these are just a couple of examples of what your public works crew are capable of.  That's a typical scenario.  Pitcher on the left.  And within a couple hours, it looks like the pitcher on the right.  So we're very happy with the opportunity.  We're very happy with the opportunity.  And we're very happy with the opportunity to see the operation results and being able to clear and clean the majority of our public spaces.  That's another view of Windshine Park before and after.  So our 2022 cleanup totals, we've removed 3,618 cubic yards of debris.  Removed 539 tons, which is equivalent to 1,078,000 pounds of debris from our public spaces.  And that's not capturing everything.  That's about 95% of what we removed.  And that's a lot of debris that has gone through the weight, the scale house at Neal Road Landfill.  We have a large 40-yard debris box in the back of our municipal yard that's used quite a bit.  And this also doesn't count.  And that's not counted.  And then this also doesn't count the recyclables that we try to sort during these cleanup activities that those weights are not included in this number either.  So this is just about 95% of what we've cleaned and cleared calendar year 2022.  One slide on our outreach and engagement staff.  So our community members have done a fantastic job outreaching and providing resources to those in our community that are experiencing homelessness.  They not only talk to them about resources that are available or try to facilitate them going into a shelter bed.  They store their personal property, log it for the requirements of the settlement agreement.  They transport them to the shelter spaces that are available.  So they do a lot of work.  And in calendar year 2022, we performed assessments to 331 people in our community.  And we've done a lot of work to make sure that we're able to provide resources to those in our community that are experiencing homelessness.  So that's all I have.  And it's now time to introduce our site operator, which has just done a fantastic, admirable job.  Really pleased with the relationship that we have with the Jesus Center that's been our site operator.  They've done a fantastic job.  Their executive director, Amber Bass, who will present the remaining portion of the presentation, is just fantastic.  Works hard.  Cares about Chico.  Cares about the community.  And cares about those that are experiencing homelessness, too.  And really brings the right amount of compassion and accountability to the table here.  So we really appreciate those efforts.  And without further ado, I will introduce Ms. Amber Hattie Bass.  Thank you.  Good evening.  Thank you for having me, Mayor, Vice Mayor, and the rest of the Council.  I think that...  I think that everyone probably in this room and who's listening and watching has really just been anticipating learning more about what's going on at the site.  I think that there's a variety of thoughts and concerns that went into developing this site.  And I, for one, am actually very excited about what we're seeing out there, what we have achieved in its first calendar year of operation.  So I'm just going to dive into that and share with you a little bit about the site, what went on there, our partners at the site.  As Eric mentioned, we did open the pallet shelter site on April the 25th of 2022.  So the data that you're about to see represents 251 days of operations out at the site.  Again, we have 177 units that are serving adults that are experiencing homelessness in Chico.  It is a low barrier model.  It is also a behavior-based program, which means that all of the occupants have a code of conduct and that there are shelter expectations for their time during their stay there.  It is a very, very important program.  We also have a 24-hour staff site.  We do currently have 22 employees, which includes three case managers.  Two of those case managers are full-time.  We have case management at the site seven days a week.  And then also we have a part-time case manager that comes in in the evening.  So the goal is to be able to capture as many folks as possible and give them an opportunity to meet.  Other key partners at the site, of course, are Butte County Department of Behavioral Health.  These are some of the teams that are represented out there.  We have Butte County Department of Employment.  We have the Haven of Hope on Wheels.  That's our shower and laundry service program.  Ampla Health, which shows up at the site with the mobile medical unit.  The Manger Clinic that is providing care to pets on site.  And then we've also recently added Narcotics Anonymous meetings at the site based on requests from our occupants.  So what do each of those partners do?  Just to dive in a little bit deeper in there, a lot of people don't understand some of the groups and programs that Butte County Department of Behavioral Health has.  So the PATH team comes out.  They're there several times a week to visit with folks.  This is just a description of what they're doing.  They're engaging.  They're outreaching.  They'll go out.  They'll spend time in some of the common spaces following up with people.  They have an opportunity for folks to sign up for those services.  So when they do arrive, they already sort of have an idea if there are people who are interested in meeting.  But aside from that, they're out at the site just trying to create an opportunity for people to see that they're there and to be able to meet.  And they're able to get them engaged in conversations so they can talk about their resources.  The search team, the connect team, or mobile crisis, those folks come out less frequently.  And they're really based on need.  A lot of the folks that rely on those three teams are folks who are currently in services with Butte County Behavioral Health.  So they're already engaged in services.  This is just a way in which for some of those teams to follow them out there to the site.  So in 2022, the Butte County Behavioral Health Center will be able to meet with folks.  And that's going to be a lot of people.  So the Butte County Behavioral Health teams had 246 encounters with folks at the site.  108 resources were provided.  And that represents over 80 unique individuals who had access or received a referral or services from Butte County Behavioral Health.  The second part of that team is with DES, Department of Employment and Social Services.  They actually have two teams out there, the housing and homeless team.  This, again, just describes what their housing navigator does.  They come out and they meet on the site.  They have a lot of opportunities to meet on the site with folks.  Giving them opportunity to get them enrolled in things like coordinated entry, to talk to them about housing opportunities.  They saw 102 clients at the site.  They attempted to contact 162 people.  And 13 of those folks were housing assessed.  The second portion of the Department of Employment Social Service team is their eligibility team.  And these are the folks that work with people to be able to get access into public benefits.  This is a little bit of a trickier one because keep in mind that some folks come to the site.  They already have access to some of these services.  They may already be enrolled in these programs.  And so you're not going to see the number of folks, the engagements, if you will, really grow with this team.  Because once they connect the first time with them, typically unless there's a problem, you're not going to see them reengage after that.  So they have seen 82 clients at the site.  Those clients enrolled in CalFresh, Medi-Cal.  And then also, they have a lot of other clients.  And so they have completed general assistance applications.  Haven of Hope on Wheels, they provided 5,212 showers.  We did 2,332 loads of laundry this year.  AMPLAS Mobile Medical Unit came out.  They were out at the site alternating Thursdays and Fridays.  They didn't join us until I believe May.  So they were a little bit later after opening.  But they provided a wide range of medical services to 29 unique occupants out at the site.  The major clinic we brought in, again, at the request of occupants out there.  We have a lot of animals.  We'll talk a little bit about that in a bit.  But over the course of 2022, they offered four clinics out there.  And they provided care for 80 animals.  And then you can just see some of the general things that they provided.  They also had the opportunity to refer out in case that they had a pet out at the site that needed more advanced care.  So this is probably the slide that I really, you know, I think that this provides a level of transparency.  For some of the questions that we hear.  Perhaps some of the fear-based concerns that we had when we were anticipating opening the site.  But in full transparency, this is a slide that will show you all of the calls for services.  And our use of first responders time out at the site.  A couple of things just to clarify on this.  Is that these are for all calls that were reported at or near our address in Martin Luther King, Jr. Parkway.  So just keep in mind that this may or may not be directly related to pallet shelter operations.  For instance, there was a traffic collision that's included in this.  I did not pull one number or one piece of data out of here.  I wanted you guys to see the whole story.  But what this will show you is that since our opening on April 25th and through December 31st of 2022, there were 114 calls for service at the site.  Which means we averaged about 14 calls for first responders in those first 18 months per month.  Of those calls, there's just a breakdown.  So if you look down across this slide that shows you exactly when we need some sort of outside assistance, what are they coming there for?  Keep in mind that calls can originate either from staff.  It can be from occupants.  But it can also be from just general community members.  We had some calls of people driving by in the area.  Seeing somebody down on the sidewalk or those sorts of things.  Everybody has an opportunity to call and their data will show up in this slide.  Overwhelmingly, you will see that medical calls were working.  They are one of the primary use of first responder services out there.  There are 27 calls for medical service.  Three of those are known to be associated with overdose activities at the site during the 2022 calendar year.  And then the other column, which are complaints, can be a variety of things.  But essentially the way in which we describe complaints is that there was something that occurred that made the police come out there.  So it was associated with a specific action or activity.  For instance, a bike theft or an assault.  A disturbance.  Somebody refusing to leave.  Those sorts of things.  That all falls under the complaints.  And then the other category I just want to mention because I want to be very clear that the police department, the sheriff's department, they are, for the most part, they are out there doing official business.  We don't have a scenario where the police are rolling up out there without, you know, intent.  Right?  There's a reason for them to be there.  But sometimes that happens.  And that could look like they're there doing a welfare check.  They could be following up on something.  We've had missing person reports that they're following up on.  So I just wanted to just make sure, you know, again, in the name of transparency, that's my desire here.  Just to see exactly when people are coming onto the site, what's bringing them there, and what do those calls for service look like.  Overall, I think that averaging 14 calls per month for services, considering that we have 11% of those calls are for 911 calls, we're not seeing that.  So I think that that's something that is just a good reflection of what's going on out there.  So I want to talk a little bit more now about who used our site.  This is a breakdown.  This is all self-reported data.  So when people come in and they do their intake, they share this information with us.  But it gives you an idea of who is out there in shelter, who has been in shelter during that first year of operations.  You will notice that we have a significant senior population.  22% of the folks out there are 55% 55 years or older.  And then also a very common question is, did we serve any veterans?  And we did serve 10 veterans in its first year out at the pallet shelter.  So what happened out there?  So that data that you just saw represents 248 unique occupants that spent at least one night in shelter from April to the end of December.  So that represents 32,912 shelter nights.  We ended the year on December 31st.  We had 179 people in shelter and 79 pets.  30 of the units were double occupied, and we ended the year having 27 available units.  To the right of the slide, you're going to learn a little bit about how long people are staying out there, which I think, you know, retention is a very revealing factor of these kinds of programs.  Our average length of stay in those first eight months was 148 days.  Our minimum stay was 148 days.  Our median length of stay is 180.  71, which is the equivalent to 40% of our occupants, have been staying for a minimum of six months at the site in 2022.  So people are coming in and they're staying, which is good news, right?  Our goal has always been to get people in shelter and then to be able to keep them there.  The other thing that happened on site as a result of the case management team, as I mentioned earlier, is, again, case management in a low barrier model.  You cannot mandate that.  Case management is important, though, because this helps people address either their root causes of homelessness often or some of the things that are keeping them in their homelessness.  So this is a really important thing.  But I want to mention again that people are opting into this because it is not required.  So our case management team had 828 case management sessions, which means 225 of those occupants engaged in at least one case.  So that's very encouraging.  In those case management appointments, we made 382 referrals out.  So perhaps there was another partner that some of those occupants were in need of a program or service that they offered that the Jesus Center is not currently, you know, directly offering.  So that, again, that collaborative component is very important with this population.  Oftentimes they come in with relationships with other organizations.  And we certainly don't want to interrupt them.  We don't want to interrupt those relationships.  We do want to continue to support them.  So this is also another interesting slide.  Again, self-reported data.  But when people came in, so we've heard a little bit about how many people there were.  We've heard, you know, about, you know, sort of the demographics.  But this is really about their condition or how they presented at intake.  37% of the folks that came in reported having a chronic health condition.  We have 43% with a mental health disorder.  45% with a substance use disorder.  77% of those occupants had no reportable income at intake.  65% are experiencing chronic homelessness.  And I mention this because there is a lot of focus on how quickly people move out of emergency shelter and into the next phase of their housing.  The issue here is that the longer a person is homeless, the longer it will take for them to unwind that.  We are seeing right now.  Classifications are still the case.  Classifications are still the case.  Classifications are still the case.  Classifications are still the case.  Classifications are still the case.  Classifications are still the case.  Classifications are still the case.  Classifications are still the case.  Classifications are still the case.  Classifications are still the case.  Classifications are still the case.  Classifications are still the case.  Classifications are still the case.  Classifications are still the case.  unique because I think it takes pieces from each one of those two programs, but we're starting to  see now, I would say again, in that about six to seven month window, people for the first time,  they're really just sort of exhaling. We're seeing color coming back. We're seeing them  engaging socially. We're seeing less and less isolation in their units. We saw a lot of that  in the very beginning, but just to fully understand what chronically homeless, the definition of that,  I have added that to the bottom of this slide, but it just lets you know that this means that  people have been continually homeless for one year or more, or who have had at least four  separate occasion of homelessness within the last three years. So I say that just to illustrate  the complexity of these folks. The other piece of this is that 83% of those out there reported  that their current experience with homelessness has been in excess of one year. 83%.  So it's a huge number of that population. And then there's just a breakdown. Was it their first time,  their second time? You can see fourth or more. That's what's really driving those chronically  homeless numbers. So it just means that it's working out there, but the idea that I was getting  questioned in the first two months or the first four months, hey, who's gotten sober? Who's gotten  a job? And who's moving out? Those are the right questions, but not yet the right time to be asking  those. We're just now starting to see that. And I think that's a huge number of those. And I think  the immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate  immediate immediate  immediate immediate  immediate immediate  immediate immediate  immediate immediate  immediate immediate  immediate immediate  immediate immediate lining up in the right time but I just want to really caution us about feeling too pressured to move people through quickly I say this also and we've all had somebody who goes on like this fast  through quickly. I say this also and we've all had somebody who goes on like  this fast diet right six months from now you see them and all of a sudden it's  not that they've gotten that just added the weight that they had but they've  added even more on. So the time in which we navigate people through these  programs and services is critical to that recidivism risk. So just just ask  for everybody's patience I guess in that. This is about the program experience so  we mentioned how many people have come into the site who have spent at least  one night and now we're going to talk about the people who didn't stay and why  they didn't stay. I think our retention is incredibly encouraging. This says that  69 people through that first year came in spent at least one night and then  left and people always say why do they leave? Well this is a really important  thing for us to look at right because it informs our program it helps us be able  to understand as an operator what are we providing out there what are we missing  and how can we do things better and it's important that we get that feedback from  the folks that are there.  accessing services. I want to say that almost half of the people that exited  those were folks who chose to not return and I don't want to minimize what it is  like to transition from a public space into a place like the pallet shelter  into a program design location right. People are talking about a complete and  total modification of all of the things that they're used to and so that takes  some practice. People will come in naturally we see it  in our  own shelter people come in they stay for a bit they leave but the good news is  most people do come back at some point so the way in which we depart people is  very important we want people to understand that that opportunity is  still there for them. The other reason I wanted to share this slide is I think  that there's a lot of folks that thought you know this place is going to be home  to a lot of naughty behaviors and I am pleased to see that for the most part  people are completely aligned with the program.  They still have the full control over the state and the state still has the  full control over the state and the state still has the full control over the state  and the state still has the full control over the state still has the full control  over the state still has the full control over the state still has the full control  over the state still has the full control over the state still has the full control  over the state still has the full control over the state still has the full control  over the state still has the full control over the state still has the full control  over the state still has the full control over the state still has the full control  over the state still has the full control over the state still has the full control  over the state still has the full control over the state still has the full control  over the state still has the full control over the state still has the full control  slurs or egregious disrespect to staff. Our staff is very well trained in being trauma-informed,  interacting with folks that are in crisis. It takes a lot for us to ask somebody to leave  under the circumstances that I'm mentioning. So it's either egregious, it's either dangerous,  or it's just not improving. So those are the times where we get to invite people to take a walk  and then come see us again when some of those things have changed. We also have to take  failures of unit inspections or unsafe conditions seriously. You know, we have to make sure in the  event of an emergency, people have safe ways to get in and out of their units and of the site.  And also out of respect for all of the resources that Eric mentioned that have gone into this  project, we also take vandalism or damage to the shelter site or the shelter property seriously.  So those are the common reasons that folks have come in and have left. I also do want to mention  that when we move people, if we bring people in through outreach, we also bring people in  through outreach and engagement into the site. And it does not end up being compatible with a mental health condition.  It's really important for us to make a handoff for those folks. So you're going to see on there that we have four of those folks  that came into the pallet shelter, ultimately were reassessed and sent out to the alternate site.  That is done in collaboration with Butte County Behavioral Health's team. We know how close they are to that site.  But there is an email thread and an alert that goes out to let them know  that the immediate immediate immediate immediate  health condition are now closer to them so they have the opportunity to continue to attempt  engaging with them. And anytime you have 79 pets, you're also going to have some things,  you know, about animal treatment or behaviors on the site. People leaving the site with animals  in their units has been an issue. I think that we are seeing less now than we were before,  before, excuse me. But these are three calls that resulted in us having to  actually contact animal services and having a pet that had been abandoned at the site  removed. So we have that as well. I mentioned that there's a lot of folks out there who  are, their names are starting to come up on housing. We have many people out there who  have attained employment since they've been out at the site. There are people out there  who are working very hard to get the pet that they need. And so we have a lot of people  hard and using this time, I think, to their advantage. I would say that most people out there  are not counting down and thinking, I have five years to be there. That is not the behavior we're  seeing. We are seeing a lot of intention and just personal incentives. Some of that comes from,  as it turns out, 64 square feet is actually not as luxurious as some people may think it is.  But people are out there starting to imagine. And I just wanted to share,  there was a person who was actually out here in the municipal building lawn out here. And  they have come into the site. They have been here since nearly the beginning.  And that is one of the people that I spoke with last week that is walking around now with a  housing list in their hand. And they're applying for housing. And I will tell you guys that when  we met this person, what was said to us was, I'm good. I'm good. I'm good.  I don't, you know, I'm good, I'm fine.  But today what they're actually saying is,  I didn't know that I could do this.  I didn't know that I could do something different.  So that's really what this site has done for people.  It's not perfect, but I think that it's doing a lot of great things,  not only for our community at large,  but also for the people who are accessing services.  So I thank you for your support and for the support of our partners.  And then, of course, also for the county  who initially made an investment to be able to make this happen.  And so thank you for your time, and I'm available for questions.  All right, do we have any questions?  I have a comment.  Amber, you've just done a fabulous job with this,  and it was so critical to this town that the appellate shelter was successful.  And you've made the difference.  Thank you.  Thank you so much.  Thank you.  I have an incredible staff.  I don't do this work alone, and a wonderful board that made this possible.  So thank you.  All right.  And I think we can all agree and are thankful for you and your staff and everything you do.  So thank you so much.  And this is great information, too.  Mr. Moore?  Yes.  I would have said the same thing.  I'll make it a little bit more personal.  There's a lot of people that did not want the settlement agreement to work.  They didn't want the appellate shelter to work.  I think there's a lot of people that could have not made it work.  I appreciate you saying what you did about your staff  and how you've worked with the staff of the city.  They did a great job.  It is amazing what you've done to the homeless situation in this city in just a year.  It looks like a completely different town.  I know there's lots of people.  I hope they're listening that are unhappy. a completely different town I know there's lots of people I hope they're listening that are unhappy what about what about the bike lane what about here what about here what about here what about  That's all being handled by a judge.  We don't get to make any of those decisions.  But, Amber, you are doing a terrific job, and you've made as big a difference as anybody ever in this entire city.  You should be getting your proclamation tonight.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Okay, next.  All right.  Thank you so much.  Fantastic.  Well done, guys.  Thank you.  All right.  With that, we will move on to the consent agenda.  All matters listed on the consent agenda are going to be considered routine and can be acted in one motion.  I'd like to pull this item 2.1.  All right.  So we will pull item 2.1.  How many speakers do we have?  My screen just went black.  We have nine.  Okay.  So let's do three minutes.  Do we have any council disqualifications or no votes on any of the items?  Mr. Mayor, I need to recuse myself on 2.1.  Okay.  Because of my house court.  Yeah.  So how should we address that?  I'll note it for, are we going to pull item 2.1?  Okay.  So when that discussion comes up, if you could go ahead and step outside.  Okay.  And then on that.  But we are going to go ahead and take all public comments.  Yeah, let's take our speakers.  Okay.  You can stay for speakers because it's on the entire agenda.  Good job.  So there goes my screen again.  I apologize.  So for the speakers that I'm going to call, James Hutchinson is our first speaker.  And then I'll call the next name, Nancy Park.  And if you could go ahead and line up in the middle aisle, that would be great.  So James Hutchinson, followed by Nancy Park.  And that's three minutes each.  Is that correct?  Correct.  Okay.  Okay.  I'm very much concerned about...  That these items were considered on a night that things were rather busy.  Where there wasn't time to consider some of the real issues that were out there.  I wasn't here, but I sat down on the video and reviewed them.  Here's what I'm concerned about.  We've got some things going on here, such as this idea of storing things on the creek.  Most of you aren't realizing that there's people out there besides homeless storing them on the creek.  They're developmentally disabled.  They're mentally disturbed people.  There's a whole classes of people that you're not acknowledging.  We have them out in our area where we live.  I've cleaned up after a number of them year after year since 2011.  Are you going to arrest these people?  Are you going to cite them for misdemeanors?  Are you going to what?  The reality is you've created a law here.  Is that law absolute?  Or is it only going to apply?  To some people, but not others?  These people will tell you they're just doing what the other people out here do.  I've had them tell me directly, I just want to camp.  So I spread all my stuff around to claim my space to camp.  These are developmentally disabled people who have no place to go camp because they don't have cars.  Most of them, some of them can take the buses way out, but a lot of them can't.  They have no way to go.  They don't have people to take them camping.  A lot of those programs have been suspended.  And they're out there camping.  And I run into them.  What are you going to do about it?  You have a law here that just blatantly puts everybody in the same package.  But you have people in a different package.  And you didn't consider it.  It's bothersome.  I'm also considering, as Tolick can speak on the second issue on here too, is procedural.  You have a thing here on the barber first.  He didn't consider the digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive  So why is that missing?  Why is that kind of data?  You know, the Merriam project is beautiful.  It started out wonderful.  I couldn't have asked for more.  But what it's ended up being is disturbing because it changed the rules.  And that's a problem.  We're seeing the rules changed in the middle of the game  because things have changed economically.  So now we're not going to do this.  We're not going to do that.  We're not going to do this.  And the council makes the changes.  What do we do?  Thank you.  Nancy Park, followed by Nicole Nava.  And if you'd like to state these are the items on consent agenda,  if you want to address which one you're talking about, that would be great.  Yeah, I'm talking about Valley's Edge.  I came here with my family as a three-year-old in 1957.  My parents say that the population sign said 19,000.  But that was a long time ago.  And Chico.  And Chico grew.  And it's not surprising that it grew.  California grew.  That's the way it is.  Regarding Valley's Edge and the general plan,  the general plan has it right in that the east side would be the area where development would take place.  It makes sense because we have a green line to protect the excellent agricultural land to the west.  However, already on the east side, we have Merion Park.  Doe Mill.  The Stone Gate subdivision will happen soon.  And other developments.  So we have been growing on the east side.  The question is how much?  And how much at once?  And in what areas on the east side?  Valley's Edge is a development, as has been said many times, the size of Gridley.  Much of it is in a sensitive water aquifer recharge area.  Not to mention the fire danger, traffic, etc.  It's so much bigger than anything we've ever had before.  I wonder what at least some of the people who worked on the general plan would think of it.  I certainly wasn't here talking against Merion Park or other things, but I just think this is a step too far.  It's much too big.  Fire and water.  It's a big deal.  There are such huge issues in California.  And this development goes against common sense around those issues and how we need to deal with them.  So again, the scope of Valley's Edge is just too huge.  And I think your approval of it is a very major mistake for Chico.  Thank you.  Mike Bird, followed by Pam Macon.  I'm sorry.  I was on the wrong list.  Nicole Nava, followed by Grace Marvin.  Sorry.  That's okay.  You can hear me now.  Good evening.  So I did a lot of thinking about this project and some of the objections and some of the support.  And I think sometimes people lose sight of the big picture of some of these things.  Some of the same detractors of the Valley's Edge project were also the detractors of the Stonegate, whatever it's called, project.  And it's a big deal.  It's been years and years and years.  And I want you to think about something, the people who object, that do you understand how much less affordable projects like this get when you obstruct for this many years?  How much the price of supplies have gone up and all the other things because we've had the campfire in the interim that drove up costs and other things.  We have lots of bodies that are looking for housing.  Those bodies may not necessarily fit your vision of who deserves a home or not and at what price.  So now all of a sudden we're assigning who deserves to have housing out in a place like Valley's Edge or affordable housing that looks like what we have at the, I believe it's the Jamboree project on Park Avenue that's coming on, which, by the way, is very low housing, has vouchers and is a great plan.  There is room and there are projects submitted.  You can't force developers to build it, but there was intent and it is part of the housing element.  And those types of housing units will become available.  And there's examples of that at Cohasset and Burnout.  I drove all around identifying all of these projects.  And again, this takes time.  But the more you choose to obstruct and only lift up a certain portion of the population and say they deserve a house, you are literally causing these housing prices to rise.  So maybe flip it a little bit.  And think about that.  The other thing is people are commenting upon this project's scale and where it is.  And again, yeah, it isn't on the green line, a good thing.  And, yeah, the scale is large.  It's going to take likely decades.  And I will tell you, coming from a web home experience out at Amber Grove, very well done.  Nice streets.  Beautiful plan.  A park got integrated.  Families love it.  Admit it.  Y'all truck your kids in there to go trick-or-treating.  It's fantastic.  It's safe.  It feels good.  It's a nice experience.  At these affordable housing things, the Jamboree one looks like it's going to be fantastic.  I believe that the Burnout one, I've seen early, you know, ideas of what they want to float there.  It will be good for multigenerational housing as well.  Let's play nice in the sandbox together.  Let's see what we can do to lift this project and the other ones up.  I don't think they're mutually exclusive.  And by the way, this project shouldn't have to solve all the housing problems.  Thank you for your time this evening.  Thank you.  Grace Marvin, followed by Peg Howard.  Yes, thank you.  I'm conservation chair of the local Sierra Club.  And I've talked to you before, but this is my last opportunity, it looks like, to talk about Valley's Edge, perhaps.  The goals of the Butte County housing element update of 2022 include several that Valley's Edge does not meet.  Its goals and our money should go to, one,  providing for the county's regional share of new housing for all income groups and future residents as identified in the housing needs assessment.  Two, encouraging the provision of affordable housing in the unincorporated area.  Three, partnering with property owners to preserve and rehabilitate the existing supply of housing.  Valley's Edge has little affordable housing while not identifying what affordable actually means.  Most of the houses would be quite expensive, requiring wealthier outsiders to move to Chico.  And all but one part would be controlled by private homeowners associations.  So much for meeting the needs reported in the Chico housing element that there is a, quote,  demand for.  Nearly 7,000 subsidized units for low-income households that have been unmet, unquote.  What Chico really needs is high-density, mixed-use, urban infill projects that promote walkable neighborhoods,  easy access to work, schools, stores, and affordable homes.  This would lower highly dangerous GHG emissions,  and it would not reduce the risk of a global pandemic.  And it would not require nearly the traffic infrastructure and maintenance costs for Chico citizens as would Valley's Edge.  And we don't want the fire and flooding dangers of such a sprawl development.  That is why I'm calling on you and the citizens of Chico to not allow this project to advance.  Please, City Council and citizens, save us from having an environment where we can't afford to live in.  We need to have a more environmentally, economically, and socially costly urban sprawl project.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Peg Howard, followed by Patrick Newman.  Hello.  I'd like to speak regarding the Valley's Edge development.  And I was reading through the plans, the Valley's Edge plans.  And the more I read, the more I became concerned.  There is the part, of course, about I would really love to see more low- and middle-income housing offered here.  But when I read on about the water supply assessment and the water supply verification document from EKI,  and I was reading along, and there's a section there on water features.  And I hadn't heard this put out there very much.  And I was reading on, and it talks about how there would be two lakes, Frontier Lake, upper and lower, about six acres.  And then there would be ponds in the Pioneer Park.  There would be another approximately two acres.  And so what really concerns me about this when I was reading that, yes, there would be some runoff.  They would be supplied in the winter months.  When there is rain.  But for several months through the year, they would be pumping groundwater to keep the lakes and ponds full.  And so why this bothers me so much is because we have residential wells in Butte County.  I just checked online.  There were 123 wells that went dry as of August 2022 this year.  And then in Glendale.  County, there were 190 residential wells that were declared dry in November 2022.  And we are all in the same Tuscan aquifer.  So this valley's edge, to me, for them to build these private recreational lakes at this point in time in California is very deeply disturbing to me.  Because we have been declared.  And, you know, a drought.  And anyway, I hope I made my point.  Thank you for listening.  Thank you.  Patrick Newman, followed by Nancy McCune.  Thank you.  Speaking on 2.1 and 2.2 Valley's Edge and another criminalization law.  Backing up a little bit.  When you hear a report about the pallet shelters or anything like that.  And this applies to what I'm about to say.  About the other two.  There's a lot of information in listening to the person who's suffering the most.  Rather than not hearing from them at all.  And making decisions based on who's suffering the least.  So you want to know more about anything?  Go to the people that are being served by it.  Have conversations with them.  This applies to this whole question of whether you build more McMansions up on the lava cap.  4,000.  Square foot houses.  I've seen them.  I've been to Canyon Oaks.  I know that lifestyle.  And as I've said before, you take that, draw that line all the way down to the plaza.  To the brain injured guy who's got nothing but a tarp.  Ask yourself who you're listening to.  When you make the decision about what proportion of that housing is actually going to be delivered to the people in the bottom 50%.  The bottom 20%.  The bottom 1%.  Because that's where most of the suffering is.  And that's where most of the information is.  Even if they're not.  Even if that sounds upside down.  To 2.2.  Here again.  When you criminalize people.  When you make a certain kind of poverty a criminal issue.  What you're doing is you're building this labyrinth of laws that make homelessness criminal by definition.  Chico's been working at that since 2015 especially.  It'll never work.  And the last thing you're doing when you do that is to talk to the people who suffer the most and ask them what kind of impact does that have on them.  When the rain's pouring down and we read in our newspaper, oh, they're doing more sweeps at Tigard Ponds or whatever.  I don't know how many of us think, yeah, that's a good idea.  Let's kick somebody out from under his tarp in the pouring rain right now.  You think, well, that's not a good idea.  Let's use another tool so that we can take a...  a misdemeanor and arrest that person on the spot and take them to Butte County Jail as a way to threaten them to come out from underneath that tarp.  In that pouring rainstorm, I bet most of us think that's probably kind of ridiculous.  But we don't follow from there and think, okay, what about the suffering of the person who has nothing but that tarp when it's not raining on the other 364 days of the year?  Why don't we put these pieces together?  Because we listen to the people who are suffering the most last instead of listening to them first.  Anyway, thank you.  Thank you.  Nancy McCune, followed by Jessica Giannola.  Good evening.  I'm speaking about Valley's Edge.  And personally, I was here at the last city council meeting and I was gobsmacked that the largest development to hit Chico in its history and only one of you had any substantive questions about it.  Moving on.  We hear that there's going to be a...  school.  But not until there's enough houses that have children in them to build a school.  We hear there's going to be senior housing, but not until there's enough...  not until the...  the mall is built, the mini mall is built.  And the mini mall can't be built until there's enough people that are living there in single family houses that cost $600,000 to $800,000.  And Chico needs...  very low, low and medium income housing.  This doesn't...  So we wait 10 years to get senior housing or the low income housing that's going to be built in Valley's Edge.  But the biggest elephant in the room is water.  And you guys know it.  And we have pretty little lakes, two of them, for the enjoyment of the rich 1%.  Come on.  We have three parks and all this landscaping drilling through the Tuscan aquifer that's already in deficit.  Come on.  Everything's connected.  You have homelessness downtown.  You try to make it a crime like this guy says.  And then we hear from the Jesus Center, it's a great idea.  But then, you know, it's all connected.  There's no place for the...  The campfire exacerbated all this homelessness.  And, you know, these people are just supposed to do something.  They need affordable housing.  And you aren't providing that.  The general plan.  You aren't even dealing with the housing element and the general plan.  Come on.  It's all connected.  Homelessness...  You build a skating rink downtown.  For...  And that loses money.  How much did it lose this year?  Lost money last year.  To draw people downtown.  And then you...  And then you want to do urban sprawl out here?  How are you going to keep your downtown vitalized if you're building urban sprawl?  Come on!  Thank you.  Jessica Giannola followed by Blake Ellis.  There's a lot of passion here because we need housing in Chico for the quarter of a mile.  And we're a part of a population that still has trouble accessing it because we don't have it.  It seems...  I just want to comment.  It just seems like with anyone with a financial interest or in the project or maybe have close friends tied to the development or business associates,  I can see how those people could be recusing themselves, not just anyone who lives nearby.  It's a fairly large development and a lot of us live nearby.  Many of us will keep objecting to this development.  The majority of Chico voices have spoken against this development for many valid reasons.  It's not planned well for our reality here in Chico today.  The small percentage of multi-housing units identified as to be built are a fraction of what will be developed at that site.  And there are no guarantees at all that they will be truly affordable to the people of Chico.  The Valley's Edge Division was created decades ago when these types of housing developments were standard.  And sadly, what also contributed to the lack of affordable housing opportunities that we have today.  It was those types of developments that became norm and multi-family housing units did not.  Increasing expensive home supply would not lead to truly affordable housing.  It only increases more homes that are still out of reach.  We have a duty to approve housing development that will fit the needs of our residents, especially those living in unstable housing currently and will soon be so.  Thank you.  Previous high-end developments have created an imbalance in moderate high-income properties to the high need for affordable low-income developments that we need today.  Valley's Edge development should not be moving forward at this time.  Aside from real fire threats, flooding, water depletion, there are also sewer concerns, road concerns, greenhouse gas emissions that cannot be mitigated.  And there's an assumption that people will have electric cars running around the development.  That's just purely an assumption.  That's not going to happen.  Efforts today should go instead towards other housing development opportunities.  That's what we should be doing.  We need housing.  We really do.  Increasing other housing in existing neighborhoods, increasing units within existing buildings, etc.  Inclusionary zoning.  We don't have that here.  We really need to have that.  So when there is a development, a higher percentage of those houses and units developed are meant to be affordable housing.  Chico needs to do a better job at doing that.  We need to be able to keep up the people of Chico.  That's all within your hands.  Thank you.  Blake Ellis followed by Richard Harriman.  Hi there.  I am coming to you as a social worker, as a mental health professional, and as someone who has worked as a disaster case manager with folks impacted by the 2018 Camp Fire.  And as someone who has worked doing ecological restoration in the area.  I am here to speak on 2.1 to resist Valley's Edge development.  We need different housing solutions in this community.  I have engaged in the housing element discussions.  I have tried numerous things as has so many of our community members to shout at the top of our lungs that we need different housing solutions.  You all have resisted opportunities to build up and instead continue to build out.  I don't know what we need to do to have that.  I want to have you listen to our voices.  So I come here ill prepared and nervous as all hell to ask you to please give us a chance to listen to these voices to postpone the development of Valley's Edge.  And consider other solutions that are going to be better for our community in the long run.  And don't give us more work like disaster case management when another wildfire impacts our communities in this zone.  In this high risk zone.  So I know Sean Morgan is probably watching sports game on his tablet like he usually does.  But hopefully the rest of you are listening.  Our final speaker is Richard Harriman.  Those kind of comments.  Good evening.  Mayor Coolidge.  Honorable members of the council.  My name is Richard Harriman.  I'm a Chico resident, property owner and taxpayer.  I'm a licensed attorney.  I practiced environmental and land use planning law and development for 45 years.  I've represented clients on large projects as large as this and larger.  I forgot to say good evening Mr. Broward.  Respectfully I'm going to be very brief and to the point.  I support the opposition of Valley's Edge by the Sierra Club.  But I want to focus on a very important point.  And that is the development of the development agreement.  And I think that's a very narrow procedural issue.  Since on your agenda tonight is a consideration of the development agreement.  And having reviewed many of those I was very startled to find.  And my eye was brought to page 5 of attachment C.  Lines 16 to 17.  Which references a demand, transportation demand management plan.  Per air quality EIR mitigation.  I support the idea of a transportation management plan.  I asked Mr. Broward early on and put records in evidence in the record.  To request a jobs housing balance.  So I would like to object to the approval of the development plan.  Unless until it is clarified and specified as to which EIR mitigation measure.  We're referring to here.  When it is going to be performed.  And what the legal standards will be for that performance.  There's no mention of the municipal code here in this development agreement.  It needs to be more specific.  Toward the end that the legal standards are identified.  When it's going to be proposed.  Prepared by whom.  And more importantly pursuant to CEQA.  And the EIR management plan.  Classifications. to sq guidelines 15201 which provides for public participation and makes it important that there be public participation my concern and criticism and objection to this is that it constitutes  Classifications.  Classifications.  Classifications.  Classifications.  Classifications.  Classifications.  for the opportunity to address you I want to say I know how to count from one  to four I'd like to see three more of you come along and support something  that will make a real difference in the air quality the transportation and the  housing and this is the point at which you should focus thank you for the  opportunity to come in speaker thank you all right so we will take the items  with the exception of 2.1 as it was removed and move forward with that entertain a motion  second motion from council member Morgan on the second from vice mayor Reynolds  the reason I pulled this off the agenda are you talking about the consent agenda minus 2.1 correct thank you  yeah thank you yeah so we'll go to that next right this is the the full consent  agenda minus 2.1 council member Bennett  yes  yes council member Morgan council member Tandon yes council member Van Overbeck yes  council member Winslow no vice mayor Reynolds yes mayor Coolidge aye okay it  carries 6-1  we have been then item 2.1 three ordinances and we'll send that over one  second council member Winslow the reason I asked all this from the consent agenda is  not to rehash discussions that were had in the last meeting but because on the  dais there were some references to state laws specifically SB 35 and how it  impacted the city's obligation to approve the project these were repeated in the Chico Enterprise record  and an opinion piece and i thought that in order to have clarity on the council and for the public  i'd like to ask the city attorney to clarify how sb 35 impacts this project and if any other  state laws obligate the city to approve the specific plan and the other items  all right  thank you mayor coolidge council member winslow i can take a look at that uh  you're at the law you referenced and get back to you  all right anything for  i've just mentioned my understanding sb 35 that has very specific requirements for when  projects are required to be approved in the case of a major shortfall of low-income housing that  we have 50  percent of the project has to be affordable housing theoretically if we denied the project  it could come back with a proposal that could meet those requirements but it certainly does  not meet those qualifications and we would be approving this fully of our own accord  all right entertain motion moved to approve  second motion from uh from councilman morgan vice mayor rounds second  madam clerk when you're ready okay then that was a motion and a second  to approve item 2.1 which includes ordinance of the city council of the city of chico amending the  pre-zoning of the property within the valley's edge specific plan area ordinance of the city council of  the city of chico amending title 19 of the chico municipal code to add the valley's edge specific  plan zoning overlay district council member bennett yes council member morgan council member tandon  yes council member van overbeck is recused council member winslow no vice mayor reynolds yes mayor coolan  all right carries five with one no and one recusal all right we'll move on to business from the floor  members of the public may address the council at this time on any matter not listed already on the  agenda the council cannot take any action at this meeting on request made under this section of the  agenda how many speakers we have seven all right three minutes okay so again if you could line up  james hutchinson followed by paula hare  if you can wait mr hutchinson until mr van overbeck returns we appreciate it  hi floor is yours  i'm really concerned about the process of how the city council  is handling  hearings where it is known that there's our mega issues issues that are going to be out there  and pull in large numbers of groups people legal possibilities referendums  and then you have speakers getting only one minute to address the issue true they can write  true you accepted written comments and see it but the rest of the public isn't seeing all of that  the summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit

summit  divide it, the rest of the organization agrees to sit back on it and let those two speakers speak.  That way, you have enough time to at least discuss the issues involved.  One minute isn't enough.  We've had lawyers getting up here trying to talk.  There's no way you're going to go through a whole entire legal thing in one minute.  We had people representing people, people who can't be here.  They're in a bad position.  They don't know exactly what's going on here at this moment.  What could we say to the person all the time?  So I'm asking you to change your procedures, to agendize it, to put it on as a discussion  about allocating time in exchange for eliminating other speakers.  Groups would select one to two speakers with a certain amount of time.  It would cut this prolonged talking period for one minute where people can't really say anything.  They can only address it.  It's like, me too.  It doesn't work.  We've seen it.  We've watched what happened with the rest of the agenda.  When I first spoke up here, I was talking about the idea that, hey, these other items didn't get much time.  They didn't get much speaker.  People have left the room, most of the ones, the two that I was talking about, by the time it got to that.  Because they were tired of listening to what was going on.  They weren't participating.  You got no feedback.  You didn't get the whole story.  And yet you made decisions on it.  Give yourselves a break, too.  Set this up where organizations can agree to have speakers.  In exchange, you give them a set amount of time.  Young enough to actually talk about the issue.  That's what I'm asking you to do.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Paula Hare, followed by Nancy Park.  It's been a while.  I've been staying out of the dark, you know, and being up here.  But, you know, every time we get a city council and we get another one and we get another one,  it always looks like the same people, no matter who's really up here.  I don't think it's changed.  I think the setting's the same as it was before and the same as it was at the council meetings before.  I think the setting's the same as it was before and the same as it was at the council meetings before.  It's out here on the pond for three years now.  And the pond's still a filthy mess.  The pond itself is so polluted now.  I really congratulate every one of you.  You've done nothing but destroy it.  It's a simple thing.  You could have had these people at the airport.  You could have had them someplace else.  Someplace designated where Mother Nature wouldn't have been destroyed.  Or the fish population for the only place we got the fish for the elderly here in this town wouldn't be destroyed.  So, I didn't even eat the damn things now.  If we did get in there, there was some.  Yeah.  I mean, wow.  Now you're talking about housing for the rich.  But yet, you don't want to take care of what you've got.  Yeah.  Year after year after year.  You've done nothing.  Oh, another college shelter.  Yeah, how many people did that take off the street in the last three years?  Huh?  Oh, wow.  Still got the same problems.  They haven't changed.  So, what have you done?  Spent what?  $14 million on the homeless?  $15 million.  $15 million.  $15 million. and how much garbage do we still got wow just just go by and go by there and look some garbage on the right hand side of the pond is actually the same garbage who was there three  $15 million. some garbage on the right hand side of the pond is actually the same garbage who was there three years ago and so now you can see it because well there's no leaves blocking those trees right  blocking those trees right there in the thickets so you can see in.  And you can see it floating out into the pond.  I've taken videos of it.  Put it up on Facebook.  Would you like me to put the videos down here so you can see them?  I'd gladly bring them in.  I picked up needles down there last week.  I'd like to have gone farther in to get more than that, but it's not safe enough.  That's fine. Thank you.  Thank you.  Nancy Park, followed by Nicole Nava.  Hi.  I just wanted to say a few words about the city-designated camping area at Eaton Road  and Cohasset.  I've had occasion to drive past there a few times during the stormy weather.  And the lack of city maintenance of that area for people who are unhoused is really sad,  and it's kind of a disgrace.  Flooding, no place to shower, inadequate number of porta-potties, overflowing dumpsters.  It's so miserable that no wonder people continue to camp.  And the parks and the greenways.  I would really like to see the city, and the city can't do everything, but the city can  partner with North State Shelter Team and perhaps some other non-profits for a carefully  managed designated campground that would include more amenities including social services.  I mention the North State Shelter Team because they do have a plan of over 40 pages that's  still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still still  Nicole Nava followed by Dave Broadburn. Good evening again. So I want to speak to the  encampment situation and a little bit more related to that. So I wrote a letter on Monday  to legal services that I did publish publicly and I wanted to have them have to own a little bit  of the obstructive behavior that I and others in this community perceive as going on in regards to  the ability to clear encampments. Yes, there's a settlement agreement. Yes, there are elements  within that settlement agreement that have to be followed. There are some elements that are also  in that settlement agreement that are not being followed that could be followed. So some of that  is what I want to speak to. So I am still left wondering why we are not  citing and or pursuing community service when someone's cited and can't afford a fine to do  swap type activity to clean up the vast amounts of litter that's happening. Regardless of status,  I don't care if it's students, housed older people, whomever, if we're littering, if we're  setting fires where we're not supposed to, I would fully expect that we would all be equally cited  and have to deal with that situation, have to pay a fine or have to have that fine convert  over to the legal system. So I'm not sure if that's the right way to do it. I'm not sure if  that's the right way to do it. I'm not sure if that's the right way to do it. I think it would  set a great example that we're paying for something that we should be accountable for or that we're  sweating it off to clean up our city. I would really like to have an answer to why it doesn't  appear anyway that that is occurring. For the part about legal services, to me, yes, in the  settlement agreement at states you need to have enough beds at one of the two identified places  to be able to clean up the litter. But I don't think that's the right way to do it. I think it's enough beds at one of the two identified places to be able to force clearing the space i would posit to you that if they would look at it the harm reduction model that is smart is to allow the area to be posted and the people to be evaluated for placement fill the places to capacity to the extent that those people agree to go and then once that's capped off we have a choice we  the legalistic way to go.  the legalistic way to go.  the legalistic way to go.  the legalistic way to go.  the legalistic way to go.  the legalistic way to go.  the legalistic way to go.  keep their personal belongings, but we've been able to massively clean up the rest of it.  I see no harm in that. Or even better, maybe the city could go, oh, we could pop up a commercial  size tent and have the bare minimum of have the cots and have it be weather safe or put them in  a motel. The state would probably fund stuff again and who knows. But at the worst, like I said,  it would be you just don't move them for where they are. You're within the parameters. I don't  understand why we keep going to the bottom denominator for these humans that are now in  extreme elements. A lot have physical ailments and other things that go untreated. It's wrong.  It's bad. Legal services do better for this community. Anyone who wants to join me in an  email, contact me. I have the info. Thank you. Thank you, Dave Broadburn, followed by Patrick Newman.  I just want to address the city here. I've never been here before. I got some paperwork here a  couple of days ago about how much money the city is going to be spending on the city. I'm not sure  what the city just got from the infrastructure bill. Mainly what my beef is right now, I work for  DoorDash in this city and I drive all over the place all the time working for them. It's coming  down to the potholes that are big enough to swallow Volkswagen's in this town. And these roads  are a joke. They're an absolute disgrace. I've never seen anything like it anywhere I've ever  lived. So it's time for you guys to start looking at some solutions. And I'm not talking about  patching roads. I'm talking about grinding them up. I'm talking about getting them done. I'm not  talking about making them all up and repaving them. That's what needs to be done here. ASAP. The  longer you wait, the more it's going to cost you. So wherever the money is coming from, tomorrow I'll  be over here, I want to get some paperwork on this city, how much money is coming in and how much  money is going out, where it's going. Because it's a joke as far as I'm concerned. Anyway, Saturday  morning at about 515 in the morning, I almost ran over a Caltrans worker that was working by himself  in his truck on the Highway 20 bridge. Yeah, that is a joke. I have to have a good view of it. I have  I got off there and I was delivering some food over there.  He almost got ran over by me and a couple other rigs.  He was filling potholes there on the bridge by himself.  I thought that was a pretty good move on his part.  Anyway, you know, maybe the city could just grind up some of the really worst spots  and then repave those instead of doing the whole thing,  because it is literally everywhere you go around here is an absolute disaster.  So, Mayor Andrew, it might be time to start looking at some solutions  instead of kicking the can down the road.  The other thing I'm going to notice real quick,  we just got 27 billion gallons of water or whatever it was out of this deal.  I work in the solar industry every day.  And the water situation all over around here,  right now we might be in really great shape.  Give it six months or a year,  with all the new building and all the new commercial buildings going in in this city,  you're going to run out of water, period.  And it's not very far down the road.  I'll give you that, my two cents.  I've been a builder for 45 years.  All these commercial buildings, regular domestic water and irrigation water for all of them.  Come on.  We grew 50% of the rice last year over here.  I'm an avid duck hunter.  They're feeding the birds right now because we didn't have any food for them.  And you guys want to keep running all this stuff?  It's a joke.  So get in the real world.  Have a good night.  Thank you.  Patrick Newman,  followed by,  Jessica Giannola.  Yeah, we're $400 million in the pothole.  Experts have come and told us that a couple times.  Anyway, so,  again,  if you want to know what's going on in the Pala shelter,  anywhere having to do with what happens on a day-to-day basis with people on streets,  talk to them.  Build relationships with them.  Get their trust and hear their version of it all.  Because that's really where the information,  at least it's an important part of it.  So I don't usually read my letters to the editor,  but I want this in the record,  and it has to do with seven years on the plaza every Sunday.  The reason I'm paying attention to this is because I'm there,  and I hear that suffering there by talking to those people,  some of whom have lived at the Pala shelter.  Okay.  In preparation for the installation of an ice rink,  Chico Public Works fenced City Plaza on November 11th.  Because the enclosure barricaded access to restrooms and drinking water  and recalibration,  because this was the first time a fence was erected  since the Warren v. Chico settlement became the law of the land,  I was keen to observe what would follow.  That is, as a test of Warren,  given that when blocking access to toilets and drinking water,  Warren requires the city to install temporary facilities  in the same quantity as those removed from service.  For over a month, November 2nd through December 8th,  the city provided no substitute facilities.  From December 8th,  onward, following scrutiny by the enterprise record,  the city provided one periodically padlocked toilet  and one hand-washing station.  That is, in contrast to Warren,  which requires two toilets, two hand-washing stations,  and of critical importance,  access to the only drinking water within a half a mile.  January 8th was the last day of skating.  Disassembly of the rink follows.  If the past is prelude,  the process may drag on for months  as the city continues to block access to restrooms and water.  In this test of Warren,  our aprophobic city,  which means hatred of the poor,  government,  our aprophobic city government,  did what we'd expect,  limit access to the extent possible.  The unexpected,  those representing the unsheltered in Warren v. Chico,  legal services of Northern California,  apparently failed in securing compliance  with clearly stated,  humane, and easily verified  viable elements of the law.  Substantial  when Warren was very clear. Go read  Section 12 and you'll see what I mean. I just want  this in the record for the future. Thank you.  Thank you. Jessica Giannola  is our last speaker.  Council, I'm going to ask again that  we change the policy with public speaking  to allow late cards and  work towards resolutions of  inviting the entire public into  our meetings. People at home, people with  transportation issues, we really need to do  that. We live in 2023 now.  So another  issue that I'm, it's  really sad, actually.  Driving along 99 and  I'm heading north, looking over to the right, there's  tiger ponds. There's tiger ponds  and there's flooding and there is just  evidence of people  living without a home everywhere.  It is heartbreaking. It's heartbreaking for the people  that I know that are really cold  and wet and they're barely  surviving. And I'm really sad  for the environment and the  fact that I haven't really seen  any true, like  dedicated problem solving  efforts. Like, let's get  people activated and help solve this together.  I just haven't seen it yet  to this date. It's become a partisan  issue and this housing issue is  not partisan. It is people.  We all are impacted by this.  We're all at risk of being in the same position.  It's just a matter of chance  really. It's not all about good choices.  So,  it just reminds me of a disaster zone.  Our housing situation  is a disaster zone.  You could be providing  more trash services. If people don't  have anywhere to go, at least the  trash services so the trash isn't on the ground.  Who's going to pick it up?  Who's going to pick that stuff up? There's been volunteers  doing it. I've done it. Lots of people have done it.  But we really need to do better. Where's the  bathrooms? People need access to bathrooms.  We're not providing it. We should provide that  as a city. That's a public safety hazard.  People aren't going to disappear. It's the  same in every single city.  We have millions of dollars  in federal funding that is being  slashed right now for housing.  That means we as a city  need to pick up the pall even  more because we're not having those federal  funds coming at us. Where's those  HUD dollars at? They're all getting cut.  So, we keep saying, oh, the  state needs to do their job or the federal  government needs to do their job. This isn't a city  issue. We don't provide housing.  Well, the city, with their hands-off  approach, this is where we want to be. We want to be  the state.  They still need the state. our efforts going to pushing people around the city from one neighborhood to another to a park to the creek and that's what we do around and around it never ends it will never ever end we have to as a city put efforts into how do we fix our housing problem we have to make those efforts  They still need the state. have to as a city put efforts into how do we fix our housing problem we have to make those efforts we have to make those changes we have to change policy we have to or this is our forever thank you  Forever.  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right.  And with that, we'll take a short break.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you, Mayor Coolidge.  Council members, appreciate the opportunity to speak to you again tonight.  We'll pull up the presentation.  Bear with me.  There we go.  All right.  Excited to present the final presentation on the cost of services analysis,  otherwise known as a sewer rate analysis that we've been talking about in length for several years.  So excited to bring this forward to you and hope it moves forward with adopting the new sewer rates after the public hearing.  So quick overview.  I know we have some new council members, too.  We'll talk about a little bit on the background, go through a few slides on that.  Land on the staff recommendation and then, of course, hold the required public hearing.  So current background, as most of you know, the current residential rate is a fixed rate.  It's flat rate regardless of water usage.  It's $22.98 per month.  There's no annual cost index inflator or CPI adjustment included.  That is, you know, many municipalities have those built into their rates.  The last rate change was our update increase was done in 2011.  It was a very modest increase back then.  Industry standard is every five years.  Our current rate has only collected enough revenue to conduct just one pipeline replacement in the last 20 years.  And really that's unacceptable.  As you know, we have significant capital project needs at the wastewater treatment plant and then also in the sewer collection system,  which is the piping underground, the collection system network, where we know 30% of that has reached its useful life.  So we have 300 miles of underground sewer piping.  And 30% of that has reached its useful life.  The current rate is not enough to set aside any capital or operating reserves, which is very nerve-wracking operating the utility.  Without many reserves, there's, you know, certain catastrophes or certain things we need to plan for.  And, you know, acts of God, you know, things of that nature that can happen.  And without any operating reserves, it's very tough to operate in that fashion.  And, of course, the sewer utility has been understaffed for many years.  There's our current residential rate.  Inclusion.  In comparison to a lot of our neighboring agencies, you can see Oroville is at 41.  Gridley, 41.  Yuba City, 57.  Redding, 61.  Davis, 69.  And then on the higher end, Biggs, Auburn, and Colusa is topping out at close to $85 per month.  And we're down in the far end at $22.98 per month.  You can see we're extremely low compared to our neighboring agencies.  And we're half of the...  State average.  We're half of the Northern California state average and then half of the statewide average.  And this is stale data.  This is from the Regional Water Quality Control Board.  Last time they did a sewer survey that's posted on their website.  A sewer rate survey was fiscal year 16-17.  They're completing one now.  We participate in it, but that data isn't posted yet.  So we were half the state rate, the state average rate in 16-17.  So obviously that has changed significantly in those state averages.  And the numbers have only risen.  So this item has been discussed at length over the last several years.  Really starting at the Finance Committee level.  In May of 2021, the Finance Committee heard the methodology change.  Again, the residential connections are a flat rate.  We're going to move to a more modern volumetric rate.  So in each volumetric rate, there's still a flat rate component.  There's a fixed charge component, but then a volumetric component on top of that based on what we're doing.  And then there's the cost of water usage.  And that's industry standard for most modern sewer utilities today.  The Finance Committee really did the heavy lifting in January of 2022,  where they reviewed all the technical studies.  So that was the facility analysis, the strategic plan, the appraising, the valuation of the sewer utility,  and then the financial analysis that showed the costs justifying the proposed rate increase.  So the bulk of the work was really done at that January 2021 level.  And then the final part was the budget.  which was the budget for the 2022 meeting.  In April of 2022, the Finance Committee heard the alternatives.  Based on the amount of capital project need, we have $75 million worth of capital projects that we need to do over the next 20 years at the wastewater treatment plant.  And then, of course, our collection system, where 30% has reached its useful life.  To start to get caught up, there's a $12 million need for the collection system.  So if we were going to satisfy all of those capital project needs, our sewer rates would dramatically increase.  And so we knew that that's not palatable, so we really started to get strategic and talk about options in the best interest of the Chicoan or the rate payer that is connected to sewer.  In my position, in my professional opinion, I'm not willing to waiver on the capital project needs at the wastewater treatment plant.  Those are capacity driven, regulatory driven, and condition driven.  We have to do those projects.  I'm not happy with that.  So the immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate  100% of meeting the collection system needs.  So we honed those options at the Finance Committee last April of 2022  and then presented to the City Council September 6th,  where City Council gave direction on one of those options  and initiated the Proposition 218 process.  There's those alternatives that City Council and the Finance Committee considered,  and the City Council voted to approve option, which is the light blue,  which is satisfying 50% of the collection system needs,  so about $6 million a year is what we hope to invest in the collection system,  which would bring your average residential connection from $22.98 per month  to $38.34 per month.  And that's assuming, again, we're moving to a volumetric methodology,  that's assuming that Chico Home is using 9.4 hundred cubic feet per month  during the winter month average.  So some people use more.  Some people...  Some people use less.  I personally, my house uses less.  I'm about 600 cubic feet per month, so I will pay less than the $38.30.  So it's based on water usage, which gives a lot of equity.  So the more wastewater you discharge into the sanitary sewer system,  the more it costs us to treat, so the more you'll pay.  That's more probably than we need to know.  Moving forward, so that shows the rate of post.  All rate increases.  There is another option that Council considered.  If you...  Recall of...  Of maybe kind of stepping the increase is kind of having a gradual increase,  which is appealing in year one because it's less of an increase,  but you have to collect the same amount over the next five years or so.  So by year five, you'd be paying a lot more.  So Council moved to approve the all rate increases in year one with the 50% option.  So after the September 6th Council direction,  we initiated the Proposition 218 process,  which requires a mailer be sent out to all sewer connections.  The first mailer...  went out in November, on November 30th of 2022. And then we sent up, sent a second mailer to  clarify commercial accounts on December 30th. And this is really, you know, we're changing the  methodology on the commercial side as well. And we just wanted to be as transparent as possible  because there's a little confusion on the first mailer. Historically, commercial accounts have  been, there's a fixed portion plus a volumetric portion. Well, we're changing the methodology on  that fixed portion and going to what's called an EDU, an equivalent dwelling unit. So we're  able to measure the strength of commercial accounts, wastewater, and assign them an EDU.  What's the equivalency to a single family home? And so the second mailer sent out, we'll just  find the pointer options. Here we go. Clarified that the fixed charge for commercial accounts is  per EDU. Some were assuming that it was just one fixed charge,  it's not. It's per your EDU assignment that you'll see in the next slide. And we just want to be as  clear as possible on that. So again, a second mailer was sent out. So effluent or discharge  strength is a major cost of wastewater treatment, and we're able to measure that. Two methods,  really. It's, we look at the biochemical oxygen demand, BOD, it's how much oxygen that's needed  to treat that wastewater in the biological process. The second way is analyzing the total  suspended solids, how many solids are in that wastewater.  Which of course costs more to treat. On average, the city's wastewater costs are really broken up  into three categories. 60% is flow related, how much the quantity, hence the volumetric approach.  And then 20% is BOD related, and 20% is TSS related. So what we're doing, we'll take a car  wash, for example. In Chico, car washes can be equivalent to one single family home, one EDU,  all the way up to the city. And then we'll take a car wash, for example, one EDU, all the way up to the city.  And then we'll take a car wash, for example, one EDU, all the way up to the city. And then we'll take a car wash, for example,  50 EDUs, single family homes. The average is 10.2. So what that means is, we'll go back to this slide,  that car wash will be assessed $26.84, $26.84 per EDU, plus a volumetric charge based on their  water usage. This is industry standard. Most modern sewer utilities are moving to this model,  and we're excited to do so as well. We think it brings the most value to the customer. It's the  most equitable. The higher strength, the more pollutant your wastewater is, and the more  wastewater you produce, the more you'll pay. The less that you produce and the less strength that  it is, the less you'll pay. So it's the most modern approach that gives the most equity to the  account. This slide just shows kind of a snapshot of a typical commercial account. Commercial  accounts are going up similarly to residential accounts. So a bar without  dining, assuming they use 57.1 hundred cubic feet per month during the winter months,  100 cubic foot is equivalent to 748 gallons. So this particular bar uses 57.1 HCF per month.  Their current bill is $177 per month. With a new rate model, they'll likely go up to about 220  based on water usage. Here's a restaurant. Current bill is $261. Their bill will go up  to about $365 assuming that they use on average 40.7 HCF.  Restaurants' effluent is actually pretty strong. We have a very aggressive pre-treatment  program where we force restaurant owners to install grease traps and things like that.  But still there's a lot of organic material that's discharged in their  effluent through restaurant normal operations. So their effluent is pretty strong and it  takes a lot of chemicals and oxygen and labor to treat. So back to the residential side.  That's what our race is. They produce the worst digestive digestive digestive digestive  our new rates again assuming the average of a single-family home using 9.4 that's  where it places us compared to our neighboring agencies you could see 30 34  still below the old state average from fiscal year 16 17 still highly  competitive with some of our neighbors Auroville Gridley Roseville Yuba City  Napa of course Davis Auburn and Colusa that are on the high end of the 85 per  month this is the new rate table with both residential and commercial rates  it shows the fixed portion of the monthly rate plus the volumetric portion  based on water usage of the monthly rate and that will be implemented if approved  into the city's fee schedule I wanted to summarize and I'll get rid of my pointer  here  I wanted to summarize the proposition  table that was presented to the board in the first half of the year and the  2018 process we've reviewed several of the protests and some had accused of  this is our own policy this process and we're making up our own rules and that's  just that's not the case a proposition to 18 was excuse me was passed in law in  1996 and it's embedded in the California Constitution so we're following state  law on what's the requirement for a utility to go through a rate analysis or  cost of service analysis to proposed increased rates so the process requires  a public mailer  notification which was sent out we sent out to just to be as transparent as  possible it requires a public hearing at least 45 days later that's what we're  here tonight and there is a way to protest we to stop the rate  implementation we have to receive at least 10,000 705 protests to reach 50%  plus one a simple majority of our 21,000 408 connections so if we receive 10,000  705 protests are more we have to stop the rate implementation and we have to receive at least 10,000 705 protests are more  it will stop the rate implementation there's some there's some rules and  requirements around the protests they have to be written can't be emailed it  can't be electronic or call it in they have to be written protests shall  include the charge being protested the customer name parcel or address number  and a signature once that's satisfied then the governing body can move forward  with passing a resolution to adopt the proposed race and that lands on the  recommendation the joint joint joint  I recommend that the council hold a public hearing.  If no majority protest exists, adopt the resolution amending to Exhibit 4,  the city's fee schedule 50.050, sewer service fees,  and this will be Amendment No. 348.  And I can answer any questions at this time.  All right, questions.  Mr. Gustafson, how do we get in this situation where the maintenance was deferred?  I mean, some of the remains in downtown are 120 years old, right?  Yeah, 100-year-olds.  Yep, yep.  You know, Chicoans have enjoyed extremely low sewer rates for decades,  and nobody wants to pay more, and I understand that,  and governing bodies don't want to increase rates, and I understand that.  And we've gotten away with it for a long time,  but now we're at a point where we have significant infrastructure  and capital needs at our wastewater treatment plant,  and now we've let our collection system age to the point where 30% has reached its useful life.  That's frightening for a public works director.  So we want to really start to catch up and really implement some collection system repairs,  plus all of our capital obligations at the wastewater treatment plant as well.  All right, Vice Mayor Roberts.  Yeah, can you speak to the Paradise tie-in?  There's a lot of misinformation and understanding that we are putting this on the backs of all of the Chico homeowners  so we can build to support Paradise, and so can you explain exactly how that's being taken care of?  That's a great question.  This rate analysis doesn't have anything to do with the Paradise connection.  If anything, the Paradise connection will benefit it to a sense where it kind of broadens the customer base.  But this is a Chico problem.  This is something that, again, as Council Member Bendover-Beck has stated,  that our rates, how do we get in this situation?  Our rates have been so low for many decades,  and now it's time to really start infrastructure repairs, and that's what we're doing.  We have a very proactive staff, very proactive governing body,  and we're doing what we can to really set Chico up well.  Thank you.  And we're going to continue to do that in the future and make sure we make these repairs  and bring our infrastructure up to standard, and this is what this is about.  So this is a Chico problem.  It has nothing to do with the Paradise connection, and again, if anything,  the Paradise connection long-term will likely help it just because it broadens the customer base.  All right.  Council Member Winslet.  Thanks for that very detailed presentation.  You went over the commercial rates and explained how we're going  to a more equitable system based on how intensive the treatment is.  Are any businesses going to see a decline?  Are they going to see a decline in their rates?  Some may, yes.  There's some that may see a slight decline based on a couple of things.  Their EDU assignment, their effluent is a little less than others,  and then based on their volumetric portion too, based on their water usage.  So if they use less water, their rates could slightly reduce.  But on average, it will be an increase for most, but there might be some that will.  So it's just connected to the efficiency of their use of water and how intensive it is  to treat their effluent.  Correct.  It's the most equitable rate structure that we could do, thinking about the customer  and doing everything we can to make sure we keep costs low,  but maintain a high level of infrastructure as well.  Thanks.  All right.  Any other questions?  All right.  I have a few.  Sorry, Eric.  Stay right there.  All right.  And most of these are questions just for clarification on the public,  and I'd like to thank Vice Mayor Reynolds for asking them.  Why? Because of the .  I think the Paradise question was something that her and I are very familiar with,  serving on the Paradise Sewer Advisory Board and going through that process and serving  on finance and seeing all this happen, that that is in no way affecting, you know,  what is coming through in the City of Chico, but actually will add benefit  for possibly the rate payers in Chico as we add additional, you know,  folks who have to pay for the sewer treatment plant here.  You mentioned 30% of the collection system is, and maybe,  if you could restate that fact, 30% of the collection system is older than or what?  Has reached its useful life, which is basically about 75 years old.  So we have 30% that is, you know, 75 years old or older.  And that's pipes into the ground, right?  Absolutely.  Yeah.  So that is not actually the sewer treatment plant itself.  That's the pipes running through the City of Chico.  Correct.  So that's what's going to happen in, you know, and has happened in the past  in Chico neighborhoods when one of these pipes burst.  Right.  Yeah.  And then, you know, the City obviously has to make the repair,  which is costly and replacement is obviously cheaper.  Correct.  Yeah.  Those could be catastrophic scenarios, closed down a street.  The pollutants is high basically for a specific period of time.  Those houses that are affected are connected to that particular line.  No showers, can't flush the toilet.  It's very impactful.  So we want to avoid that situation as much as possible.  And that's why we're here tonight.  Yeah.  And I think that's the majority of the concern when we look at doing this.  I mean, certainly no one up here wants to do this.  But, you know, as you look at that and go, you know, we could be facing some serious  crises here in the City of Chico because this has been pushed down, you know, the way so  much.  Also, if you can mention the timing, because I know a lot of people are going, well, hey,  you know, during the summer I use a lot of water.  I've had a few constituents reach out and say, hey, you know, I use a ton of water during  the summer.  Am I going to get charged by that rate?  You know, commercial businesses too.  So if you could just explain how that's done.  And the timing of that.  Right.  That's a great question.  So we don't we're only trying to capture the amount of water that comes into a household  or a commercial business and is used for a commercial site, either production that goes  down the drains of their sinks or in a home, toilet flushes, showers, drains in their sinks.  We're not trying to catch irrigation.  So we're only taking the winter months, December through March and averaging usage through  those months, assuming that's the least amount of time when any sort of irrigation is being  performed.  All right.  Yeah.  I just want to clarify that for the record.  Thank you very much.  All right.  Any further questions?  All right.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  All right.  And with that, we will open the public hearing.  How many speakers do we have on this item?  Madam Clerk?  We have six.  All right.  So three minutes.  Okay.  Pam Macon, followed by June Carhart.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I got my sewer notice of changes on December 2nd, but the rates are going back 11 months  now to February of 2022.  Why is that?  The volumetric rate that he talked about.  Not most.  Okay.  So the communities in the NBS survey are not doing volumetric pricing.  Why did the protests have to be written and delivered?  Why is a nonresponse counted as a yes vote?  You say that goes back to 2018.  We didn't have to send in a yes or no written to you guys when you were elected, so why  did we have to do it for this?  Chico has a Mediterranean-type weather.  Okay.  So we have a long-growing season.  The winter season is three months.  Why is Chico paying volumetric rates for four months, one-third of a year, instead of for  three months in the winter months?  Are these for one year or two years?  The 2684 per-year leaflet is for years 20 to 20, 2022 to 2027 on your graph.  It does have a little asterisk, but the asterisk does not explain that.  Or is it just a little asterisk?  Rosemary Rosman Rosman Rosman Rosman Rosman Rosman Rosman Rosman Rosman Rosman Rosman Rosman Rosman Rosman  Rosman Rosman Rosman Rosman Rosman Rosman Rosman Rosman Rosman Rosman Rosman Rosman Rosman Rosman Rosman  Rosman Rosman Rosman Rosman Rosman Rosman Rosman Rosman Rosman Rosman Rosman Rosman Rosman Rosman Rosman  Rosman Rosman Rosman Rosman Rosman Rosman Rosman Rosman Rosman Rosman Rosman Rosman Rosman Rosman Rosman  Rosman Rosman Rosman Rosman Rosman Rosman Rosman Rosman Rosman Rosman Rosman Rosman Rosman Rosman Rosman  Rosman Rosman Rosman Rosman Rosman Rosman Rosman Rosman Rosman Rosman Rosman Rosman Rosman Rosman Rosman Rosman  $100,000 a year extra will the bills go from the first of the month to the last of the month or will they be prorated?  That's all I got Cheers. Thank you, June Carhart followed by Sylvia Brock I  Am a homeowner but not a public speaker, so I hope you'll bear with me I  Appreciate all the information that we got tonight  I'm not happy about the fact that for one-third of the year  I will be double billed for every drop of water that comes into my property both by Cal water and then by the sewer rates  That's a third of the year. I  have read both the rate study that you commissioned and  The staff recommendations and the notice that was sent to my house  There are significant differences between the rate study and what the notice says the rate study  says that in fiscal year  2026 to 2027  the flat rate charge will go up to $40 and 46 cents a month and  The volumetric charge will be increased to a dollar 85 for HCF  Bringing a total bill to $58 and 22 cents the notice however says that we will be billed flat rate of  26 84 volumetric charge of a dollar 22  A total bill of 38 30, which is it?  That is not explained. It says that there can be increases you use terms like  Stable only  for the consumer price index  But I that's not written into the proposal or the staff recommendations  I was curious what I can expect my bill to be in five years  I'm also not in favor of and I know it may be current state policy  It is not assumed when you vote in an election  that  Just because a registered voter didn't vote that his vote would be assumed to be a yes on any bond issue  That's what you're doing here, and it will assume and obviously  ensure that you will have more yes votes than no votes because not everybody will send you in a written protest  That's a well-known fact in every election. So thank you for listening  I would hope that you have a good day and have a wonderful day  that some of those questions of mine will be addressed before you vote on this proposal.  Thank you.  Sylvia Brock, followed by Clinton Nicker.  Hi.  I'm okay with the sewer rate.  I oppose the volumetric rate.  The reason being is a lot of us that have been in the same home for years, we have a  huge lot.  I have a third of an acre all the way down my street.  Third of an acre.  We have swimming pools.  And you say that the average thing is nine a month.  I call cow water.  December was 12.  January 8.  February 13.  March, when it gets hotter, was 22.  So if I multiply that by 30 or divide it by 30%, it's 16.5 times 122.  My sewer bill.  My sewer bill just doubled.  Just doubled.  I agree with the other lady.  It should be three months.  Because Chico, you know as well as we do, that starting in March, it gets hot again.  So that I disagree with.  We've got conflicting reports on the TV.  Nobody is explaining the volumetric charge.  The TV last night and the Enterprise.  Right.  The Enterprise record said our new bill is going to be $36.  That's it.  This came out, which is fine.  It was sent to the ones that are still on septic also.  Well, guess what?  So sewer changes, it goes in the garbage.  There's nothing that says anybody that's on septic has to do the volumetric charge.  So therefore, you didn't get anybody on septic on the new bills.  So that's all we have.  We have a new bill that we have to have.  writing since we're in a digital age I would think that a email would have been  fine because you would had all the information on an email as you do on a  written one we're a digital age you guys come on this is ridiculous I had a lot  of stuff I wanted to say but I'm just kind of good but like I say it's not  fair those of us with swimming pools and larger lots we're going to be paying a  whole lot more and those does not go into the septic I don't mind paying my  fair share but I shouldn't have to pay for my swimming pool or my yard I will  pay my fair share but that's ridiculous so I think you guys need to take that  into consideration the bigger yards  swimming pools compared to the little dinky one-tenth lot now that's a big  difference and I think that should be good consideration I'll pay my fair share  but that's stupidity sorry thank you thank you Clint Denicker followed by  Robert Greenway and I apologize if I got your name wrong thank you for giving me  the opportunity to speak with you today I'm probably not gonna make any friends  here  I think Chico's a great town the solutions are a whole lot easier on this  side of the podium that it is on that side so I appreciate what you people are  doing and your service to the city of Chico I'm sorry I wrote a little thing  here I'll just read it to you and then we'll kind of go from there hello my  name is Clint Denicker I am here to speak on the sewer rate adjustment let  me say that I do not live in Chico however I do own rental property here I  pay the Chico utility bill to ensure that the land  the state still has the full full  the state still has the full full  full full  full full  full  full !  full  portion of the 100 cubic foot reading is irrigation. Here's the problem with the sewer rate study.  It has been done in Davis, where I live. And I'm a retired City of Davis employee. I worked  in water conservation, water leak checks, meter reading, maintenance, and testing. I  own a rental there, as well as in Sacramento. The rental in Davis is 900 square feet, two  and two, two bedroom, two bath, in a PUD, planned unit development. There is no water  that passes through that meter that is used for irrigation. To emphasize my objection  to the method used, the rental had a water meter reading of six units. That's 600 cubic  feet.  As you do here in Chico. And a sanitary sewer charge of $25.79, which is more than $22.98.  While at my home in Davis, a 2,922 square foot, five bedroom, three bath home had the  same meter reading, 600 cubic feet, with a sanitary sewer charge of $47.24 a month.  We have the same 100 cubic feet consumption, vastly different changes. My Sacramento rental,  1,625 square feet, three bedroom, two bath, where I absorb the city utility bill, has  a flat fee of $37 a month. I believe they were charging 26-something back in 2004, which  is still over the 22. If I may have some extended time, I'd appreciate it. Okay. Well, I think  you need the increase.  Thank you.  To cover your infrastructure and your cost, you're going to need a digester and different  things that you're going to have to replace.  Thank you.  Next speaker, please.  So, Robert Greenway, followed by Bob Mulholland.  Hello. I'm going to approach this a lot different. I agree that the price needs to go up. I agree  with Mr. Van Overbrecht when he asked what the hell happened. Bad management, okay? I  can say that.  When you have to wait that long to find out that things are going awry. My problem with the city and the  collusion with Cal Water is how you're getting my information. This is a privacy issue. Evidently the city is  is getting from Cal Water, my personal information  on how much water I'm using.  It's none of your damn business how much water I use.  I pay Cal Water for it, okay?  I don't know where you think this stuff's coming from.  And evidently, this is some new law that Mr. Markey,  who I've talked to personally and talked to Skyler  from the city public works department,  I don't know exactly what's going on with that stuff.  He says that the Cal Water has been given the city of Chico,  my information and every person in here's personal  information for who knows how long, which they didn't need.  They think they need it now because you want to meter  my water, which is metered,  but you want to do it the other way.  Well, if you want to meter my water,  that's going into your sewer,  then put your own meter on it and don't count on them  to do it and don't expect them to give you the information  that you're not entitled to.  Mr. Markey says there's some kind of new law that came out  where they said a municipality can request them.  I don't know if it's a law or request  or how you get the information,  but I'm not going to stand by that you keep doing this bunch  of BS.  Do you understand me as a city council people?  It's ridiculous.  Nobody's ever thought about that.  Even Mr. Markey said the first person asked that,  where that information comes from.  How would you like it if they ask you,  that the city people ask you for your PG&E bill?  How much do you use for your PG&E?  Your Comcast?  It's not fair and it's ridiculous.  Find some other way to do it.  Just because you screwed up over the thing  and didn't adjust your meter rates or your rates  that you charge for the past 10 or 15 years,  where you could have added 5%, 5% and keep going,  you wouldn't have to do this BS.  So right now, I'm looking into a lawsuit  to either them or you, whoever is responsible  for taking my information and them giving it.  So you should have, Mr. Markey.  Come up there and say how,  and you should tell me how you're allowed to do it.  Thank you, sir.  Yes, you get a certain amount of time.  Everybody gets that same amount of time.  In order to be fair to everybody here,  everybody gets the same amount of time.  Thank you very much.  Mr. Mulholland.  So Bob Mulholland.  I may have missed.  If you could.  Thank you.  Go ahead, sorry.  Bob Mulholland of Chico.  Another Democrat again is raising our taxes again.  I may have misheard the public director,  but I think he said Prop 218 was 86, 96.  I have all the records.  Since Republicans have taken over the city council,  your main agenda is raising taxes.  But yet all the Republicans who run for office here  tell the voters, I will not raise taxes.  Even the latest city manager said that in his campaigns.  But as typical of some politicians,  once in office, they tell the voters, we need more money.  Recently the state sales tax, measure eight states  right in here, $24 million a year.  That's a quarter billion dollars every 10 years.  And it says right here, four members,  Republicans on the council can decide where the money goes.  Republican caucus,  council members over the years have filed lawsuits  against citizens on the junkyard,  farmer's market, you fire city managers,  or maybe you take them in the back room  and then tell them to resign.  You fire city attorneys and you rehire them.  You mishandled Martin versus Boise,  costing taxpayers millions and millions of dollars.  You have a recent deal with the city manager,  $10 million package.  Including $5,000 to drive to work.  14 years of pension for free.  I don't know if they're writing or the-  Mr. Hahn, if you could keep on topic on the water.  Yeah, the water, taxes, taxes, taxes.  The reason you're raising our taxes  is you got unending spending here.  You're like a bunch of drunken juveniles  with stolen credit cards.  There is no cutting of the fat here.  It's always raise taxes, raise taxes.  How come all of you, when you ran for office,  they said you were against taxes?  You're like, I'm not gonna raise taxes.  Now, when you raise taxes like this,  you know the landlord's gonna raise rents.  That's guaranteed.  Now, September 1st, 19, 2022,  ER headline was, dough.  When I get this thing in the mail,  I couldn't find it anywhere.  It's so buried here.  Deliberate politics of people that,  raising taxes everywhere they can,  despite their promises,  with all this money coming in,  make the ice skating rink for free.  City used to be known as city of trees.  Now it's known as city of taxes.  He was our last speaker.  All right.  Okay, so at this point,  the city clerk will announce how many protests  were received today.  We received 115.  All right.  And then at this point,  do we just need to have a,  obviously council discussion,  but then move forward with the resolution, correct?  All right.  All right, so entertain a motion.  Just quickly, Mayor, if I may.  What Eric didn't talk about,  I think we've all been reached out by members of the public  that thought that this like happened behind, like,  closed doors and it was really shady.  Eric, can you, I don't know if you can help me remember,  and maybe Andrew can,  how many finance meetings did we talk about this?  Like six?  And then we shelved it for a while and brought it back.  The Finance Committee just shooting it,  bring the number down, bring the number down,  bring the number down.  And to Mr. Van Overbeek's point,  how did we get here?  A little different,  but one of the other not really kind of public utilities  that we had to deal with at one point,  was waste removal, the amount of trucks  and how low those rates and bid  and how they were different for everybody.  And there was a lot of gnashing of teeth  because some people were getting their rates raised  and some of them were going down  and it was an imperfect system.  So to answer the public's question,  the Finance Committee has dealt with this with a long time  and we gave staff a very, very hard time  because we didn't want to deal with it.  And it's either now or it's an emergency  and then we ended up cutting public funding  to police officers or fire or something else.  And then to Mr. Van Overbeek,  Mr. Van Overbeek's question and the skipper,  Mr. Sorenson could, I'm not asking you to,  but he could do chapter and verse  on how long city finances were ignored  and swept under the rug.  And it took councils of various persuasions to get that fixed.  And then we had a period of time  when a lot of staff recommendations were ignored  and council didn't hear about things.  And it takes good management and courage for people  to stand up and say,  we can't let this keep happening until we have a,  we can't let this catastrophe.  And that's where we're headed.  So as unfortunate as it is  that we end up having to make the decision,  here we are.  But it didn't happen overnight.  It had been addressed by staff  and sent back to staff on at least four occasions.  I just wanted to throw that in there.  All right, Vice Mayor.  I just had a couple of things.  I was hoping that Mr. Gustafson,  maybe you could address a few of them.  I know one thing that we have talked about  is the building could and will probably,  probably change once this happens.  I've got four or five,  do you want to do them one at a time?  Or,  because it was brought up  that this is gonna be an expense for the city to take on.  Cause right now that is a partnership with Cal Water.  Yeah, currently we have a partnership  and agreement with Cal Water to perform our billing.  And that agreement is gonna terminate in June of this year.  So we will do, we will be performing our own billing.  We put an RFP out to have a outside contractor do that.  It was a very old agreement, long-term agreement, low cost.  And it's not just Chico.  Cal Water provides that service  in many other parts of their service territory.  And they're kind of changing their business model  and getting out of doing that  where they're providing billing services  for other utilities and other agencies.  So it's not just Chico.  But that agreement terminates in end of June.  And then we will do it ourselves.  They're at a cost,  but those costs are factored into the proposed rates  and we'll be able to absorb them.  Okay, great.  It doesn't terminate.  Sir, you're out of order.  Sir, you're out of order.  Cal Water is still working.  We're still paying you to get my information.  We're disrupting the meeting.  Sergeant at Arms, could you please?  You're paying Cal Water to get my information.  That's illegal.  Sir, you're out of order.  You're out of order.  Thank you.  Have a good night.  So back to, a couple of people mentioned the three  to four month measurement time  and when the measurement is happening.  Can you answer that?  Why four months instead of three?  And why not November through February versus, you know,  December through March or whatever it is?  That's a good question.  And we tried to find the months that were the lowest usage  and that was the recommendation of our consultant  to add to have four months.  It really gives a good snapshot and a good average  to have a four month, fourth month in there versus three.  So that was on the recommendation  by the rate consultant.  And could it be November through February instead?  Because March can be pretty .  It could be.  It would change the modeling.  We would have to go back and change all of that  and propose new rates.  Those rates were based on the averages for December through March.  Okay. And the septic versus sewer?  Yeah. Out of abundance of caution,  the rate consultant sent the mailer to all parcels  within Chico City limits.  So those that aren't connected or on sewer got the mailer  as well.  And it was out of abundance of caution just  to show them what the rates are and what they will be  in the thought that they may connect in the future.  So we can't include those if they were protest ballots from,  you know, from those parcels that aren't connected  to the septic.  So we can't include them in the sewer  and only have septic systems.  We can't include them in the protest.  But they were sent out of abundance of caution.  Perfect.  And then the last one, and I don't know if it's,  if you could maybe briefly explain the relationship  between Cal Water and,  and we're not getting personally identifiable information,  but we are getting rate and usage information.  We're getting usage data per parcel.  And I don't know the exact government code,  our law that allows us to do that, but it's very common.  It's a modern practice to use volumetric rates  when providing sewer service.  I think there's kind of an assumption when you sign  up for service from Cal Water, you're agreeing to their terms.  And those terms including, you know, giving a fellow agency  or another municipality usage data.  It matters because, you know, that usage is the water  that goes through, you know, the, the, the, the, the, the,  the sinks and the toilets and the showers and whatnot, we treat.  And it's really impractical to think that we're going to dig  up everybody's street and put a flow meter  on the sanitary sewer system.  At every single house.  Pardon?  At every single house.  Yeah, it's, it's, that's not feasible.  So this is an easy way to, to capture what water is going  into the sewer and, and again, used widely across the board.  So the last thing I want to, and we don't, I didn't see  that slide on today's, but just to kind  of refresh everybody how we got here.  One of our options was, like, the first one,  the first year going up $3 or $4, and then the next year, $5  or $6, and then it exponentially ended up to where,  I think the highest number was going to be $50 or $60 a month.  Correct.  And that's why we ended up doing the 20 to 38.  So we were trying to, while, yes, it's a big jump  in the first year, overall, the lifetime,  that rate's never going to go down.  So I just want to kind of remind everybody where we got  to where we are at.  That's a great point, Vice Mayor Reynolds.  And I think one of the speakers mentioned  that there was some rates proposed  in the analysis of the financial analysis that were different  from what was proposed or is being approved here.  And that's true.  There were multiple options shown and specified.  If you want to meet 100%  of the capital improvement project need,  rates will be this.  If you want to meet a certain percentage that's less,  rates will be that.  They looked at different methodologies.  So we just threw everything out there,  and that's why there is some different numbers.  And then we landed on options that both the Finance Committee  and the City Council approved to move forward with.  And that's what we're seeking approval for tonight.  All right.  Council Member Wentzel.  Not only do I support sewers, but I support sewers being public  and look fondly back over 100 years ago  when sewer socialists popularized the idea  of having city-run sanitation services.  And with the luxury of not paying dividends to a sewer lord  like we do for power and water, it does come the responsibility  to maintain our infrastructure in the voice  of the community.  that would have catastrophic consequences.  So I support Council Member Morgan  and the Finance Committee having gone through all this process  and making sure that we can avert catastrophe  by doing what we need to do, even though it doesn't look,  it's not fun to approve rate hikes by any means.  I, you know, the Finance Committee meetings are not the  most transparent meetings.  They're not on video.  I was probably one of the few people that did pay attention  to these talks going on.  I was talking about this talk going on a year ago,  and I saw that Cal Water had made an offer  to purchase our wastewater system,  wastewater treatment plant and all.  I was concerned about that, and I wrote about it,  and I spoke about it, and I realized  that very few people were aware of what was going on.  Notwithstanding, this is the alternative to looking  into privatization of our sewer where we don't have to be far  down the line looking, not even having the option  to hold a public hearing on whether we increase rates  or be able to hear the input from the public  on how these rates should be raised.  I hear this about many, many times.  I'm not sure if I'm right.  I think it's about March being a month  that people use irrigation, and it makes a lot of sense to me.  I think that's something the city should look into,  but we're at the stage and we do need  to responsibly maintain our public infrastructure.  So I would support the rate hikes.  All right.  Council Member Jahn.  Just wanted to double-check  that the water usage data would be collected annually  to adjust the bills?  Correct. Yep.  Okay.  So the water usage data is going to be collected  in the next five years, and then, you know,  a family member might leave so the water usage could go down.  So that's a good thing that we'll revise it.  And there was also some concern about from 22 to 27.  Does that mean that we could not raise the rates before  that time if the need arises?  Or is it, how does that go?  Could you please clarify that?  Sure. Yeah.  Proposition 218 defines that you could only raise rates  for the next five years.  You can't continue to raise.  So the rate hikes that we're seeing outside  of inflation are a CPI increase.  So these are being established for five years.  It's a five-year look ahead.  But that doesn't mean we can't come back in years two or three.  You know, if costs continue to go up and we need  to bring another rate case due to the cost of services  that we're experiencing, we could bring that back and go  through this again in a couple of years if that's deemed necessary.  So follow the whole process  that you mentioned, Proposition 218, and have a public hearing.  Correct.  The whole process again.  Yep.  Thank you.  All right.  I just have a quick follow-up, Mr. Kefson.  So how many houses in the city are on septic?  About?  A couple, 150 I think that are on septic.  Total?  Oh, I'm sorry.  I didn't hear it correctly.  Yeah.  That are on septic?  Yeah, that are on septic.  Oh, I'm sorry, 7,000.  7,000.  Yes.  Okay.  So yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Sorry.  That's it.  So.  And I mean, I did get.  I heard it wrong.  I'm sorry.  No, I did get questions from people actually saying,  well, I'm on septic and now I'm going to have to pay fees too.  And obviously we know that's not true.  But, you know, I'd just rather hear that from the horse's mouth.  So correct now.  Yeah. All right.  And then do we have any further information, questions,  discussions, entertain a motion?  Looks like we almost have one.  Mayor Coolidge?  Mayor Coolidge?  If I may?  Yes.  Councilmember Reynolds had a question to which I have the answer.  Okay.  And that's California Government Code Section 6254.16 .  And that allows an officer or an employee  of another governmental agency when necessary  to collect the data regarding water usage or other utility usage.  Okay. Perfect.  Motion to approve staff's recommendation.  Second.  All right.  And that's a resolution of the City Council of the City  of Chico amending exhibit for the City Fees Schedule 50.050,  Sewer Service Rates Amendment Number 348 with a motion  by Councilmember Winslow and a second  by Councilmember Van Overbeck.  Sorry. Councilmember Bennett?  Yes.  Councilmember Morgan?  Yes.  Councilmember Tandon?  Yes.  Councilmember Van Overbeck?  Yes.  Councilmember Winslow?  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds?  Yes.  Mayor Coolidge?  Aye.  Carries 7-0.  All right.  And now we will move on to the regular agenda,  item 5.1, Finance Committee Recommendation Downtown Chico  Business Association Funding Request.  And we will turn this one over to Councilmember Morgan,  who's the chair of the Finance Committee.  Thank you.  The non-transparent Finance Committee.  Thank you for nothing, Mr. Winslow.  You saw it.  You said it.  You said it.  You said it.  What are we talking about?  Oh.  DCBA.  So the DCBA came in the city and basically said...  I'm going to paraphrase and hopefully Greg's not...  He's going to leave him recusing the...  Oh.  Sorry.  Who wants to talk about case...  So the DCBA came to the Finance Committee, I think,  on two different occasions.  And basically the...  said we've had some challenges. Some of them have been managerial. Some of them have been  leadership-wise. Some of them have been COVID-related. We need  some help getting over the hump so we can continue to do  great things for the city of Chico, which I know they're about to talk about.  And in the first meeting, when they came to the finance committee,  I would say that it did not go over extremely well  because at least one member of the finance committee was opposed  to giving city money to a nonprofit  and afraid of how that would look to all the other nonprofits.  And there was not really a plan, just kind of a request for dollars.  And that was shared. And then there was, I would say,  a shake-up maybe a little bit in the board and some leadership. And they came back with a better  plan. And the finance committee, I think it was 3-0, elected  to ask the DCBA to come to the council meeting, make a  proposal on what they might do.  With the funding, where the funding would come from, which I think Jen will talk about.  I hope so. And how they would move forward with that.  And I wouldn't say that the finance committee was in full support of giving the money  yet, but wanted to see what the DCBA would come up with as far  as a plan. And instead of coming back to finance committee, we said just come back to council  because eventually it would be here anyway. And with that, I think we have a presentation  from Esther Scott or Jen.  We'll start with Jen.  Was I supposed to let you say all that?  No, you did it perfect. I'm just helping him get all set up for you.  Well, thank you. And I think we'll kind of tone it down a little bit here.  As Sean said, I'm Greg Scott. I was just elected president of DCBA. And thank you guys for your time.  I'm going to be as short as I can.  Because it's been a pretty full night.  But we certainly appreciate what you guys are letting us present this.  Downtown Chico is a unique place. It's special.  And I don't need to stand here and tell you about the longstanding legacy of businesses  or the new emerging entrepreneurs in retail dining and entertainment.  The city's 2030 general plan says it all.  Distinguished by its historic value, social and cultural gathering space, residential opportunities,  and as an economic center.  We're also anchored by Chico State University.  In fact, downtown is at the doorstep of Chico State University.  And that path runs in both directions.  The vitality of downtown Chico directly impacts CSU.  And as you all know, the whole Cal State system is running into enrollment issues.  And in a conversation I had with President Gail Hutchinson just the other day,  she asked me to, or gave me permission to, basically paraphrase her statement that  the vitality of downtown Chico directly impacts their enrollment.  Because the enrollment issues are going to be so delicate that parents are going to look at  the safety, the cleanliness, the vitality of downtown almost as a deciding factor  whether they're going to send their kids to the campus.  And in fact, I would think without Chico State University,  we would be in jeopardy of just having another aging Northern California downtown.  I think we can all agree that the downtown Chico is a special place.  Sean mentioned, or Councilmember Morgan mentioned, a nonprofit organization.  I want to point out that the DCBA is not just another nonprofit organization.  We basically were informed in 1975 with an agreement entered into with the city  to basically put a  program in place to produce and manage public events, maintain and enhance the downtown's physical environment,  and increase the city's annual revenue through sales tax, parking meters, and filling vacant spaces.  The DCBA over the last few years, several years, had been successful primarily on the backs of a few volunteers  and one or two paid employees.  And so, I think that's a great way to put it.  The events basically have become the mechanism for the survivorship  and the sustainability of the organization.  So what we're requesting was funding from a part of the American Rescue Act  for funds that were earmarked for other projects that could not be completed.  I believe it specifically was a sidewalk project or something affiliated with sidewalks  that couldn't be completed within the timeframe.  So the money would come out of that.  And we broke it down into a three-year period, hoping that if it is approved,  that we would, one, either, or you, would either, one, if we aren't successful,  you would basically say, okay, it's not working and we're going to pull the funding.  Two, if we are successful and we do become sustainable,  then we would like to be able to come back to you on the more hopeful side  and say, you know, we really don't need that money in years two or three or however long it takes.  Our commitment is basically outlined in a three-year plan that I think you all received a copy of.  It's delivering value to the city and our businesses and to the community.  We're going to change the perceptions of downtown, deliver on our agreement with the city,  deliver an economic value.  And with key partners, such as I mentioned with Chico State and other partners,  embrace the historical cultural remarks and re-implementing the revitalization tactics.  We're restructuring the DCVA.  We've got seven new board members.  They're all energized.  We added a vice president, a second vice president position with an effort to move people through chairs  so the same people aren't sitting in the same spot doing the same thing,  trying to redefine the definition of insanity.  We've instituted a committee system.  Committees that will have chairs, committees in the marketing and promotion, events,  place development, space and business, recruitment, restaurants, and finance.  And those committees will have goals and objectives.  And make reports with responsibilities to focus on those key areas with board members  who have stepped up and volunteered to do that.  The economic impact from the 10 downtown Chico events,  and bear with me for a minute, I've got my glasses on.  This slide was prepared using a model.  By applied economics, the model measures direct inputs of the 10 downtown Chico events  managed by the DCVA during 2022.  The model measures the direct impacts, the supplier impacts, and the consumer impacts  by measuring purchases by various audiences.  I'd like to just point out the third or fourth bullet down,  the local tax revenue generated because of the events was around 144,000 bucks.  Um.  It's a big deal.  And the guys that were, the people that were running it,  the volunteers that were running it and managing it did a great job.  It's a never ending job.  And I think by monetizing some of the traditional events,  we will have the ability to improve what we're doing,  improve our performance with the businesses, the local businesses,  and be self-sustaining.  We're redefining, when I say we,  the executive committee is redefining areas to diversify the funding and development.  Key parking facility maintenance and parking management,  we're reviewing events to seek ways to monetize them.  I'll use an example of the, this 2022 art and wine walk.  We did that with, in collaboration with Chico Wildcat Weekend.  President Hutchinson said she thought that was the best Wildcat Weekend they ever had.  And I know for a fact it was the best art and wine walk we ever had.  Unfortunately, we didn't take any opportunities to monetize that.  But there were, in my place of business,  there were about 350 to 400 attendees, which was incredible.  I think years past, it may have reached 50 to 60.  Oh.  I think I did something wrong.  May I ask a question?  Yeah, I guess that's about it.  I kind of messed up there, but go ahead.  Go ahead.  Mr. Scott, first of all, thank you for taking this on.  DCBA is vital to the future of our downtown,  and I think the ice rink, seeing all the people that came down for the ice rink  and how excited they were, especially the little kids,  is an example of the kind of thing you can do.  So I think DCBA has done a great job of getting through this COVID period  with living on roots and berries.  And I'm very thankful for you for stepping into this role.  Thanks, I think.  Obviously, I'm not a public speaker.  Do we have any more questions?  Council Member Mellon.  So thank you for all the work that you do.  I was on the board for about eight years a while back.  And I know how hard it is.  I know how challenging it is.  I know how difficult it is to rely upon events to fund the operation.  That was happening years ago.  So I think that you have done a great job.  And I think we'll have a bright future.  There's a lot of work that needs to be done.  And I have every confidence that you will be able to achieve those challenges  which lay ahead of you.  So I just want to thank you for the presentation.  Thank you for putting all the work into downtown Chico.  And that also spreads out to the entire community  as well as our outlying neighbors.  So thank you.  Council Member Winslow.  Thanks, Mr. Scott.  Thank you for the presentation.  I see in the staff report or from the Finance Committee report  that there is a mention of Chair Morgan requesting the DCBA move forward  becoming a 501 , which as I understand is to help solicit more donations.  So if you can't be reliant on events to fund the organization  and if there's not a plan long-term to be funded by the city,  that the DCBA should find another way to fund itself.  Is that underway?  We're currently, excuse me, we are currently working toward developing  or creating a 501 , 501 organization.  We're a 501 organization now.  So yes, to answer your question, we are.  We are also in discussions with the city.  We talked about parking, structure parking lot maintenance, revenue generation.  We're talking about monetizing some of the events.  Adding different events, kind of changes.  About two-thirds of the events that Chico has are traditional events  and won't be changed, but there could be,  and we're looking at other methods to do that.  Could you elaborate a little bit on monetizing traditional events  and what specific events you're referring to?  Sure. For example, buying tickets to do something, charging sponsorships,  things that we didn't normally do with the art and wine walk.  And I'm saying I'm way out of my league here on art and wine walk,  because the people that did it are right here.  But holding concert venues, holding festival-type concerts,  utilizing the plaza downtown, bringing people in, getting corporate sponsors,  those types of things for the events, corporate sponsors for the events.  Okay.  I have a couple of funding, financial-related questions,  maybe better targeted towards staff.  And one is that we're looking at use of American Rescue Fund dollars.  These were originally targeted towards the sidewalk program,  which is not going to happen.  There's no way that can happen. Is that where we're at?  That's correct, Councilmember Winslow.  There's two pots of monies right now that could be reallocated.  One, as you know, is the $265,000 that's remaining from the parklet project.  That is an economic development project that is up for reallocation.  And the second is, as you heard,  on December 20th there is a downtown sidewalk project.  It was a $1.2 million project that was approved through the American Rescue Plan funding  that, given the timeframes, is not going to be able to move forward.  So those funds would be available as well.  One further question is, Kit, what are the timeframes for the use of those funds?  Sure. Thank you for that.  The funds need to be committed by the end of 2024 and fully expended by the end of 2026.  Okay.  And how wide is the purview for the funds?  What are the uses of those funds?  Could we use it for a variety of infrastructure projects,  streetscape redesigns, street lights, or anything like that?  I think I might turn that one over to Director Martin to answer.  Yes, those funds specifically, we have an allocation of ARPA funds  that is kind of more for general use.  So it's not as specified.  There are some categories, economic development, COVID-related kind of things.  But this specific piece of money could be part of that kind of more general.  It's kind of like a revenue loss category.  Okay.  I really respect the work that the Downtown Business Association does.  And when I hear a lot about it, I do hear a lot of criticisms,  and it seems like there's a restructuring going on that is in response to some of these criticisms.  But when you speak about this, you're referring to it being underway right now.  And I understand that with these funds, we have a certain timeframe.  So it's while we're waiting for the DCBA to make these changes  and hoping to support them making these changes,  we're looking at using these funds sort of as if we're a little bit rushed on them.  I noticed that there's multiple references to the Downtown Chico Business Association's role  in managing and maintaining parking facilities.  And I know we have a parking enterprise fund and the revenue from the meters.  And I'm wondering if those funds also could be used for this funding request.  Okay.  No, they cannot.  They can only be used for maintenance and operations of parking.  Not funding an organization that oversees that?  No.  Okay.  Well, maybe if they were doing something directly associated with,  but I haven't heard any suggestion that they're going to be managing parking places  or meter collections or any of those things.  Okay.  Thank you.  All right.  Council Member Chan.  Could you let me know what were the revenue sources pre-COVID for the DCBA?  Could you elaborate on that?  The revenue sources pre-COVID were the same as they have been,  as Council Member Bennett said, for the last many years.  The revenue sources were the 12, 10 to 14 events,  that were held and managed annually.  Thursday night market being the primary one.  Thursday night market in 2022 brought in around $2.9 million of,  or had about $2.9 million of economic impact to the City of Chico in 22,  just the Thursday night market.  Friday night concerts, all of those things happened.  And I'm not including the ice rink because I don't have enough information to talk about it.  I don't even think they've done the final accounting on that yet.  So I think it's something that's been happening for the last at least 10 years that I know of,  probably longer, and it's just not a model, business model that is sustainable.  One or two people putting on those types of events just without all the volunteers just doesn't work.  Thank you.  All right.  Council Member Morgan, do you have any more questions?  I will refrain until...  Okay.  Comments from the public, I would like to maybe ask Mr. Scott more questions when they come up.  All right.  I've got a few.  Okay.  So the 1975 agreement, so apparently, I know the fees that the businesses in downtown are charged,  for some of those businesses are completely ridiculous.  Why can't they?  Why can't that be remedied?  That's one of the things we're looking at.  But this is kind of cart before the horse.  The fees you're referencing in 1975 were based on headcount of the business and gross revenue.  Well, 1975 headcount and gross revenue versus 2023, obviously, are going to be different.  But as Council Member Winslow said, there's also been a lot of criticism on the DCBA.  We don't have a lot of credibility with a lot of businesses.  We haven't...  I don't think a lot of businesses, and myself included, when I first started, did not really  think DCBA was doing me any favors.  So, until I got involved with them and found out what we could do, that's kind of where  I sit.  Now we have to...  It's incumbent upon us to go out and rebuild that relationship, to prove the value, to  show the economic impact that we can have with the city.  And I think that's what we're going to have to do.  And certainly the state has the full control over the state. the Chico shop local, all of those things to build that. And then we can start working about, because we have the ability right now, as my understanding, to increase those assessments.  They still have the full control over the state.  They still have the full control over the state.  They still have the full control over the state.  They still have the full control over the state.  They still have the full control over the state.  They still have the full control over the state.  They still have the full control over the state.  150 events in Northern California, ranging from Davis to Reading,  that events in downtowns are not a way to generate revenue for downtown business.  I have seen multitudes of downtowns try to make that model work, and it never does.  The only thing that makes the model work is, honestly, is fees from the businesses that support it.  I agree with that.  And I'd also encourage that through that you put in an election system within your own property owners  to elect a board rather than to appoint a board from amongst yourselves.  I'm not sure even how the board is appointed, but I've seen also downtowns fall into that trap  where they're continually, because they can't find volunteers,  they just self-appoint people to positions without any kinds of elections,  and they hold no value to the people who are actually spending money and putting it towards it.  So.  I think long-term, that's important.  And I agree with you.  And I think one of the things, as I mentioned, we have seven new board members.  And I say just new board.  I don't mean we went out and selected seven new people.  We have seven new board members that weren't involved in it.  Sure.  Two or three of them have expressed the exact same thing I just expressed to you.  I didn't know what the value was when I got on the board.  And I think it's one of those either kind of shut up or stand up kind of thing.  And I think that's what we're finding in that they're already buying.  They're volunteering to chair committees.  They're already doing things that I think lead me to believe that over the next year or so,  we should be in pretty good shape.  Okay.  I think, you know, as we discuss this and move on to the discussion phase after public hearing,  I'd like to just put some, you know, stipulation in there for moving forward with some kind of review on that.  And then also that, you know, obviously the fees, you know, from the downtown businesses are,  are really,  really end up the long-term support of your organization because that makes all the sense in the world.  You can become a 501c3 or c4.  You can move through events that have, you know, gates and have fees,  but you're never long-term going to survive without those fees.  We have to have a support of the businesses.  You're right.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  All right.  With that, we'll do public comment.  Thank you very much.  We have one speaker, Will Brady.  All right.  Come on down.  Give you one minute.  No, just three minutes.  Counterpoint.  The DCBA has almost no credibility with the shop owners of downtown presently.  I'll just start with that.  I'll go to bullet points so I don't wander too much.  In the pamphlet from these guys, the staff, the presentation,  they say they want to market the real estate.  To decrease the vacancy in downtown, this is a gift to the landlords only.  The landlords have a market-based solution for decreasing vacancy.  You can lower the rents to make it affordable to own a business in downtown, first of all.  So that shouldn't be the goal of the Downtown Business Association,  to make it a marketability issue for vacancy,  to find a sucker to take a high-cost lease that they're not going to be able to maintain.  That is not a long-term solution.  Marketing downtown also as a clean and improved location.  What we can do, instead of taking the ARPA funds,  which I believe we graciously offered to give back for real improvements to downtown,  such as improved lighting and sidewalks, there was the $300,000.  We didn't raise a stink about this.  We said, take it all.  We want to see real things from that money.  That money is a concrete solution.  You improve the lighting in downtown, more people will see it as clean.  A nebulous solution is to give it to these guys.  This is unnecessary.  To give them ARPA funds.  Let's use the ARPA funds for actual things, concrete things.  As far as 501c3, I was going to say that.  I'm glad they're doing that.  They should be.  They should be able to fund themselves and ask for help.  Because as of right now, none of us would give any.  There's about maybe 10 places in downtown, and they're all represented by these guys.  If you want to lose everybody in downtown,  fund them with stuff that we had all agreed would be better funded  to improve the downtown through trash cans, which we still don't have.  I've been talking about that for five years and now three months.  I'm not upset.  I don't want to lose it.  Because I know how it looks.  People get upset.  I'm not upset.  I just want you to know you're going to lose the support of the downtown businesses writ large  by supporting giving them what was meant to be for us  and now is going to be reslated for people who don't have the support.  Just give it to them yourself.  Use city funds, not stuff that was slated for business.  If you believe so much of these guys, use city funds.  That would be all I would suggest.  Thank you.  All right.  Thank you.  And maybe Mr. Gufferson, you can provide an update on the garbage cans.  Late, late, late.  Not right now.  They're moving along from what I hear.  So all right.  Further discussion from council.  I would say I'm sensing there is a movement in the city council,  in a particular direction, which I'm fine with,  but I would like that direction to have some teeth to it.  So I'd like it to come back at least maybe, let's say,  within a year for review in terms of see kind of where the progress is before we renew that.  So when you ask for further comments from council,  it means you want to be qualifier comments?  No.  No.  I'm just, you know, that would be my happy amendment to anyone's emotion or emotion.  I'll make a motion.  But, you know,  I'm politely waiting for the mayor to give me the floor.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Mr. Scott, could you come back to the podium, please?  So on a very, very rare occasions, I agree with Will Brady.  And it hurts.  But everything that you said about the downtown is true.  And I think that's what I'm going to do.  There's no question Chico State's enrollment was hurt by what the downtown looked like,  which had nothing to do with the DCBA.  Prior to the settlement agreement and the issues with downtown,  somebody bringing their 17- or 18-year-old would-be freshman through downtown,  thinking what a great place to send my child to college.  No way.  There's no question that hurt enrollment.  Lots of other things did.  There is no question the DCBA has a lot of work to do to prove their worth  to the city council.  The members of downtown are people that own downtown businesses,  property owners, business owners.  But one of the things that the DCBA can do and has done,  with representation from this board,  has been an effective lobbying organization to the council  about things that needed to happen, whether it was lighting, trash cans,  all these different things.  You talked about partnerships.  When I ran the internship program for the Department of Management at Chico State,  every single semester, four or five different interns went in to work for DCBA.  They got a lot of different experience.  And that is absolutely a program that should be looked at,  because whether it's the fraternities or any of the different organizations at Chico State,  that is a great partnership and a great way to be involved, because the students,  a lot of the students pick Chico because of the whole downtown,  not just Riley's, but other places, too.  And, anyway, the Banshee, all the rest of them.  So here's my question, and as you know, because you attended all the meetings,  I am with all of you, but I have a question.  it's city money or ARPA funds or I don't care where it comes from, I'm hugely uncomfortable  given the background of what's happened. I appreciate  your execution and how you've written this down and where you're  headed on your commitment and stewardship. I think  we need you. Here's what I would like and then to  piggyback onto the mayor's comments a little bit. I would  be willing to make the motion to set aside the money for a three-year period  with the understanding that you or someone from your organization  come back in six months, in nine  months, and in one year. Starting with  outlining your goals, objectives, and initiatives and then the metrics  and how well they'll be hitting. I appreciate people are signing up for committee assignments.  I don't  like committees. Especially the finance committee because we're so  non-transparent.  I shouldn't say it this way, but I'm looking at John Scott's something about  gambling. I'm willing to roll the dice on the first year  and say here's enough to help get you over that hump, but we need to  see an executive director and we need to see real plans, not just committee assignments.  These are the things we'd like to do. If you are willing, that  would be my motion is to set aside those monies.  Just by way of qualifying the money, I did talk to  Ms. McCarthy.  I asked where else could those funds be spent? Are there other places they could go?  Does that keep something else on the agenda from happening? I had a lengthy discussion with her  so I don't have to have it now because we all trust that she knows what she's talking about, at least I do.  With that caveat, would the DCBA  be okay coming back in six months, nine months, and a year and reporting  back to the council on how that money is being spent and the progress you've been  making on your initiatives, goals, and objectives?  I'm just wondering if this body doesn't think that you're making any progress and winning over  the organizations, the businesses that you're supposed to support  that the rest of the money may not be forthcoming.  Excuse me. My background is in business.  I'm very used to reporting quarterly reports to boards.  If you want to give me six months, give us six months  to prove what we're doing, I'll take that.  I don't mean by that. I want you to come back and have us.  I'll tell you how to run the DCBA.  No, no. Not asking for that.  I just want to point out on the restructuring piece,  it's always been pushed. We have to have an executive director.  We have to have this. We've kind of rearranged our structure.  We're going to have an offense director. We're going to have a development  and engagement director. Those two positions will be first.  We've got one. We're going to work on the other.  We've got some really exciting potential candidates.  I'm really looking forward to it.  Then once those two are underway and we're starting to move and show things,  then we're going to find somebody to be the executive director.  Right now, we're going to basically just be doing this with a lot of business people  spending extra time doing it.  Because you believe it. That would be my motion.  Madam Clerk, I'll try to do this the right way.  I'll second that.  Can I ask a question?  I haven't made the motion yet. Can you guys post on?  I have a good excuse.  I'll take it back.  Here is my motion.  To approve, where's the dollar amount?  Thank you, Asim.  The 70th side of the $422,400.  Over the course of three years.  So $140,800.  To start with year one, with the caveat that the DCBA returns in six months, nine months, and a year  to give a report back to Council on how their initiatives are coming, what changes have been made,  and knowing that there are, who we appreciate, the Will Brady's of the world,  that don't see the value and haven't seen the value.  And part of your job is going to have to go back and get those businesses to understand,  hey, we are giving you value. This makes a difference.  And then if...  the public, the business owners in the downtown area, and the Council don't see that,  then the rest of the funding will not be forthcoming.  That's my motion.  Now you guys can go ahead.  Can I make a amendment to that?  6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months?  So we know that the third year funding, second year funding?  6, 9, 12, 14.  And then 18th month and then 24th month as well.  You don't need to do the 18th if we cut the funding off of the year, but...  Sure.  The reason I mentioned that, maybe there might be certain plans for the second year,  which we see might not be helping them.  Maybe we can stop the third year's funding.  That's fine.  I'll accept your friendly amendment.  Thank you.  We have a motion with a friendly amendment.  Looking for a second.  Also, there was a second from Council Member Van Overbaek.  Okay.  I would like to say that up until...  the...  the...  information on the...  I'd just really like to see an executive director position that could lead the organization  forward knowing that volunteers, that would be a wonderful, you know, take in my business,  you know, one...  one employee over 50 volunteers any day of the week.  Because you get a lot further with...  with people who are actually employed by you.  We'll have the employees.  We're going to have a director of events and a director of...  of...  of engagement and development.  I just don't think we need a figurehead.  And I'm pointing out that I understand that.  I just...  They will be paid employees.  I mean...  Okay.  All right.  So we have a motion, an amendment, and a second.  Council Member Winslow, additional comment?  I appreciate the feeling of solidarity we all have here that we want to see the  Downtown Business Association succeed.  I probably am more aligned with Mayor Kulich's head about...  I forget exactly how you phrase it.  And in my mind, I was thinking that given there's fresh board members,  fresh committees, and a lot that's in progress, and the...  and the perception that there's improvement going on responding to the criticisms that  we're all aware exist, that we would table the discussion and pick it up as opposed to  giving the funding and then review whether we continue to give the funding.  That being said, I do hope that DCBA succeeds.  So, Mr.  Scott is a highly experienced executive who's managed, you know, huge pipeline facilities  for Gulf Oil, among other accomplishments in his career.  I think we need to trust him.  And he's demonstrated a huge commitment to this.  He has the ability and the motivation to do this, and I think we need to trust him to  do it, and not second-guess it.  I can appreciate that.  I do see that we're looking at many potential benefits, but I think we're going to have to  look at the potential benefits coming out of this proposal over some guaranteed improvements  that we could be making with this funding.  And we are reviewing a lot of little proposals for uses of these funds, and I think we're  not exploring all of our options, but respect for me.  All right.  Is that clear?  Council Member Bennett?  Yes.  Council Member Morgan?  Yes.  Council Member Tandon?  Yes.  Council Member Van Overbeck?  Yes.  Council Member Winslow?  No.  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds recused herself.  Mayor Coolidge?  I'll say aye, and thank you for taking my suggestion into consideration.  Okay.  So it carries 5-1 with one recusal.  All right.  And with that, we will take short break.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  We will reconvene.  Item 5.2, ratification memo under standing Chico Fire Management Employees.  And we have Chelsea.  Good evening, Mayor.  Director of Human Resources and Risk Management.  Sorry, I didn't do the title.  Go ahead.  Good evening.  Before you tonight, for approval, is a resolution that modifies the Chico Fire Management Employees MOU.  It's as a result of successful negotiations.  Highlights to the contract include a 5% pay increase that's retroactive to September 2022,  as well as a 1% cap.  CalPERS pickup on the employee side.  And then another 5% increase that is due in July 2023 with another 1% CalPERS employee pickup.  There are some other modifications to the contract that include battalion shift,  battalion chief shift coverage and changes to the 40-hour week vacation schedule.  And staff recommends adoption of the ratification.  Ratification.  I'm happy to answer any questions you might have.  All right.  Questions?  Ms. Phoebus, did I pronounce your name correctly?  Yes.  Okay.  Good.  Who exactly are the fire management employees in addition to the chief, of course?  So chief is actually a separate contract.  Okay.  So we have our three battalion chiefs and our one deputy chief.  Thank you.  All right.  Further questions?  I have one.  Speaker, thank you very much.  Sorry.  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  Entertain the motion.  Motion to approve.  Motion.  Second.  Motion from Council Member Tandon, second from Vice Mayor Reynolds.  Madam Clerk.  Okay.  Council Member Bennett.  Yes.  Council Member Morgan.  Yes.  Council Member Tandon.  Yes.  Council Member Van Overbeck.  Yes.  Council Member Winslow.  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds.  Yes.  Mayor Coolidge.  Aye.  Carries 7-0.  Thank you.  Item 5.3, Carried 7-0.  We have a motion to approve the consideration of a shop local program.  This is actually something that I brought forward and Deputy City Manager, Dr. McCarthy,  has a report, but before we get into that, I'd just like to say, you know, the idea  behind this is to use some of the funds that we have to put forward a program that encourages  folks to shop local and does that in a way that's inclusive of all the businesses in  our community.  So not just downtown specific or chamber specific, but reaching out beyond that to all the small and large businesses, whether that be car dealers, whether that be, you know, local stores of any size, shape, or color.  So, Ms. McCarthy.  Perfect.  Good evening, Mayor Coolidge, Vice Mayor Reynolds, Council Members, Jennifer McCarthy, Deputy City Manager.  Excellent introduction.  You stole some of my words, so I'm just going to go right through this presentation.  Tonight, we're going to talk through the general outline of a shop local campaign with the proposed scope, and then talk about the allocation of $200,000 in American Rescue Plan funds to help support this campaign.  As the Mayor pointed out, he brought this item forward for the Council's consideration on December 20th, where the Council unanimously agreed that such a program would make sense in our community and create great benefit.  And during that discussion, you pointed out, as a Council member, that you were going to be doing a lot of work on the campaign.  So the joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint  well and include good producers and not just those with a storefront. And then finally make  sure that we have opportunities for multiple vendors to participate in this program. So as  staff works towards developing a request for proposal for the Shop Local campaign, all six  of these elements will be considered. Shop Local campaign will really have two main components.  One is a business awareness campaign. We've got such great businesses here in town. It's an  opportunity to shout them out and make sure that people know that the things that perhaps they're  buying elsewhere, either in other communities or online, are really available right here in our  community and really highlight those. And then the second part of this is a consumer awareness  campaign because in addition to highlighting the businesses, we need to help educate people on why  it's really important to shop local and what their dollars do when they're spending those dollars at  these local shops, how that multiplies throughout our community and creates economic employment  and benefit to our community.  So as thinking through various elements that could be included in a Shop Local campaign, staff has  taken the approach of really the wide breadth. What are all of the major areas of media and  community outreach that could be utilized to tell the Shop Local story? And that's what you see  before you today. Using everything from video to social media to radio to print and including  outdoor advertising as well. And to the Mayor's point, really looking at the  community partnerships as well. There may be opportunities for, let's say I own a bank and I want to  highlight my, I want to highlight some of my clients. Through this program, the goal would be to have  a media kit that would be available that even if we're not paying to promote X business, it would still  be available so that someone else could pay for that business to participate. And we could really create  a program that creates a lot of activity really citywide.  So as we look at providing a request for proposal, these are the elements that could be included  in that. And again it would be focused on both the business awareness and the consumer awareness campaign.  We would be looking at an RFP that would allow a bidder to perhaps they have the expertise  in all of these areas and they want to respond to all the areas with their proposal.  Or perhaps they only are in expertise have the expertise in one of those areas that they  want to respond to. So we'd have the ability for them to bid on one of the areas that they would be the digestive  or all of the elements of a project, whatever fits what their expertise is.  And finally, we feel that we'd be able to get this program done over a year period of  time with a cost of approximately $200,000.  When you consider timing for this, again, we want to do a year's project.  We want to make sure we do a good job of putting together a request for proposals so we can  get some great bidders and get this project rolling.  We can most likely beat all of these timelines, but I always want to put something out there  that isn't going to crunch us too much just on the options that something happens.  But I really feel that we can really be starting work at the latest in May and, again, for  a year's completion.  So today, again, I'm asking for your consideration of a general scope of work that we just talked  about and then the reallocation of $200,000 in American Rescue Plan Act funds to fund  the program.  So as we talked about...  During the Downtown Chico Business Association agenda item, there is ARPA funds that have  been allocated to a downtown sidewalk project.  It's $1.2 million in funding.  That project will not be able to move forward within the timeframes given for the American  Rescue Plan funds, and that makes those funds available for reallocation.  So we would look for the council's consideration of reallocating $200,000 from the downtown  sidewalk project into a shop local campaign.  Finally, I'm happy to answer any questions you might have.  Ms. McCarthy, is it envisioned that the money be leveraged by a cooperative advertising  strategy so that you would go to a merchant or they would come to you and you'd split  the cost in some way?  Or is it envisioned that this money would just all be spent by the city?  Well, they'd have the ability to put that proposal together.  So let's say, for instance, that I own a media outlet.  And I want to respond to this proposal.  And my proposal is that the city pay 50% and I pay 50%.  But I want to add to that, Councilman Van Overbeck, that we want to make sure that we  provide the tools for anybody that we're not paying directly for, that they would have  the ability to participate as well on their own money or through the sponsorship of somebody  else.  Yeah, I just have found that cooperative advertising leverages the money because you get, first  of all, it's a lot of money.  It's a filtering mechanism.  So you get the people that are serious and focused and that are going to have some skin  in the game.  So I would just ask you to consider that.  Yeah, thank you.  And that was one of the, actually, three of the local businesses that I talked to about  this program.  They were interested in putting in money into the program, starting it on their own.  So there was a conversation in the community already.  And they were just going to do it on their own.  So there's definitely a thought process behind that.  And I can give you those names.  Obviously.  Right.  Thank you.  And they'd be very interested in participating.  So I'd just like to see when we have the RFP, obviously, we're spreading some of that money  around, too, and making sure it is up in Chico.  So obviously, I don't want a big, giant outside advertising firm coming in and swallowing  all this up.  Doing a shop local campaign doesn't really make a lot of sense.  But I think that's a good idea.  Well, I was a little disappointed.  I thought.  I thought you would be in charge, since you're such a famous, notorious promoter and marketer.  I don't know what to say.  I just want to follow up and make sure that I understood that this could be one entity  that brings a team together and brings all the, or it could be a radio, ER, you know,  everybody can say, I can do this part, this part, this part.  Correct?  Correct.  All right.  And then part of this says.  For implementation of a program in the amount of 200 to 400, but the fiscal impact we're  asking for only the 200, I'm wondering if it might be just to save coming back later  to give there a little bit of room to say up to 300, because what if you get some amazing,  you know, proposal that comes in, but it's 250 or 275?  I don't know that we need to 400.  That just seems like a lot.  But knowing some of the things that are.  That need to be put together for this, maybe the motion would be up to a certain amount.  That's just a suggestion.  Certainly, that's up to council, the amount.  Further questions?  Do you have any public comment on this?  No.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  All right.  I'm happy to make a motion to program up to $250,000 with community funds to be leveraged.  As possible, following the guidelines.  Second.  All right.  We have a motion and a second.  Further comment?  Questions?  All right.  Madam Clerk?  Okay.  Council Member Bennett?  Yes.  Council Member Morgan?  Yes.  Council Member Tandon?  Yes.  Council Member Van Overbeck?  Yes.  Council Member Winslow?  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds?  Yes.  Mayor Coolidge?  Aye.  Carries 7-0.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  All right.  Moving on.  What time do we have?  9.44.  Okay.  Moving on to item 5.4.  Council Member Van Overbeck requests pedestrian zones in the downtown.  Mr. Van Overbeck?  I will make this quick.  So, I think all of us know that our downtown has had some challenges.  The university is the major economic driver for this town.  It's the largest employer.  And the, as has been pointed out earlier, the downtown is the largest employer in the  entire city.  And, uh, the, uh, attractiveness of the university is directly linked to whether or not we have  a vibrant and attractive downtown.  So, downtowns around the country have, uh, in the last 10 or 20 years, re-imagined themselves,  and the central concept is making themselves more pedestrian-friendly.  Pedestrian zones are one of the ideas that have worked in dozens, literally dozens of  cities across the country.  And the idea is that you block off a street from a pedestrian zone, and you block off  some portion of a street. It could be a block. It could be a number of blocks.  To car traffic, sometimes it's all week, sometimes it's certain times of the day,  and sometimes it's for weekends. So what I would like to do is to ask the council to dedicate  some staff, and I think one person probably does it, to work with the DCBA to come up with a  proposal for a prototype pedestrian zone if they deem it feasible and report to Internal Affairs.  All right, questions?  The only thing I would bring up on this, I'm welcome. I opened the conversation to it,  and I think it's great. I think there's a lot more information we need to have,  and I would think that I would just request that whatever  staff member, I don't know if it's one or ten that it's going to take, because I'm not a city  manager, so I have no idea, and I don't know if it's going to take an outside consultant.  That's, you know, I'm sure Mark can figure that out. I don't think we do. I know, I saw that in your thing.  I'm just saying I don't know that we can. Yeah, I mean, there are books written on this,  on this, but it's pretty straightforward. It works in some places. It doesn't work in other  places. It tends to work in towns our size. It tends to work in towns where there are universities  that are close by because you already have some pedestrian traffic. Just making my comments on my  recommendation. So my recommendation would be that whatever we do to move forward on this,  and whatever staff member or consultant is talking about this, I would like to have a high amount of  engagement with the stakeholders, i.e. the downtown business owners. So that's all that I'm asking. So  when the report comes back to Internal Affairs or to City Council, that we have a good amount of  data from the downtown businesses on how they feel about it, and where they would like it to be, and  sure.  Should it be second? Should it be third? Should it be fourth? Should it be seventh? Should it be, you know, wherever? So just like the input from the community.  So the board, the DCBA, are you going to speak, Greg? So the DCBA board has voted to recommend that we consider this.  So I totally agree with Vice Mayor Reynolds here, because if we are blocking off a street, then it's a DCBA or somebody would need to either organize some events or something on those streets.  the full  the full  the full  the full  the full  the full  the full  the full  the full in those plans that  the full  the full  the full  the full  the full  because the events that will be planned in there  probably would be done by the executive director anyways.  If that is something that could be included  in their job description, I was not sure,  but that is something I believe  because certain businesses who are on whichever street it is,  right, we need to take their opinion about it too,  what they feel about if it's closed or not closed,  how does it affect their businesses as well.  So I believe DCVA will play an important role in that.  Well, DCVA is central to this.  And one of the elements, to your point,  one of the success elements in this  is that the businesses on the street  need to activate their storefronts.  So if you just shut the street down  and don't do anything else, nothing good's gonna happen.  So that's part of it.  So inherently,  the parent in this is not only  do the businesses on the street have to agree,  they have to participate.  So Council Member Vanden Heuvel and Overbeck,  do you see this possibly becoming a long-term thing too?  I mean, like where, you know,  our permanent closing, I guess?  Well, I think so.  One of the beauties of this is that you can test it.  You can close the street for a weekend  and you need to do it long enough  to see if it gets traction and it works.  And if it doesn't work, you don't do it anymore.  And if it does work, then you consider other locations.  So I have a point of order question.  Can I have one more last point?  Actually, not if I call point of order, you don't.  Thank you.  What we're doing is debating the finer points  of what you'd like staff to do.  So I'm not sure why we're doing it twice.  Yeah.  All right.  The recommendation is, you know, we're gonna do it twice.  The recommendation is to have staff work with the DCVA  to come back with what you are all talking about.  And then we can do it.  But right now we're building what you're asking us  to make a motion for, which is inappropriate.  Thank you, Mr. Warren.  I have one quick comment.  Yeah, go ahead.  I think there are so many ways that this could go so well.  This is something we've done before in the 1976 general plan  we had, we called for like some street closures where you turn the road,  you go right away over to property owners.  And we did the Boys Girls Club,  first street going through campus has done it.  I feel like there's another one too.  If there were to be some like really negative effects,  we will definitely hear about it.  So I think that this is a great direction to go in.  All right.  Do we have any speakers on the side?  Madam Clerk?  No.  Yes, we do.  Sorry.  Okay.  Yeah.  Greg Scott followed by Nicole Nava.  All right.  You want three minutes each?  He's back.  First off, I want to tell you,  Councilman Van Overbeck did come and make a presentation to the DCPA Board.  We did vote on it.  We did vote that yes, we all agreed that we would be supportive of it and  we would be more than willing to go in and we have to get engagement to Councilwoman's point.  Engage all the businesses, determine, obviously determine which streets make sense.  And it's not just restaurants, it's not just, I mean, it's retail, it's, but the business owners have to engage if you're going to stop a street.  We handed out or furnished a copy of the National League of Cities handbook, spells out a lot of information about pedestrian zones.  They can be really, really great things.  And I think we've seen that in a couple of instances back pre-COVID, back on Third Street during Thursday Night Market when it was on little 30th Street, when we had a lot of people on the streets, we have seen that happen.  street arena.  I'm not suggesting  we do it on Thursday night market, but  I think  finding the location,  the duration,  and the participation  from the  businesses is crucial  to what we're going to do. And I think  we'll obligate  some of our time  with staff and come  up with some kind of plan that says, hey,  this will work. We think it'll work.  And bring that back.  So we're in favor.  Thank you.  Nicole  Nava, followed by Josh Marks.  So  there's quite a few items here  that have to do with downtown tonight.  And so I thought I'd kind of try  to talk about this in a global manner.  What  to me is like a project manager  type person.  I like to see the vision  of where  are you going. So when I see  some of these incremental pieces, I  just think it would be beneficial, just  thinking about this out loud for  the good of you council,  to put out stuff  when you have the report come back and things like that  that can help the community  understand where you're trying to go.  Because if we put in some of these incremental  pieces and you don't have the final vision,  is some of  that work going to get undone?  Because I see the next  topics, diagonal parking, and there's other things.  So I'm not  saying I'm opposed to any of this.  I'm saying what's the bigger, grander  plan for downtown? Because it sounds like  there's some visionary things happening here.  So I see that there's an  opportunity. I also have seen  some walkable downtowns that I really like.  I like going up. Grass Valley has a really  cool thing where they block off and it's very vibrant.  The bookstores play a vital part.  Musicians. So this could be a really  great thing.  Just maybe help people see the vision.  Maybe there could be a mock-up of a drawing  of what you're talking about.  Because there's been back-end parking  in other places. So on that next item,  like, okay, if it's not back-end, it's diagonal.  Great. Make it clear.  Make the pedestrian zone really clear  to what that means. When you look it up technically,  it can look like severe, like  does that mean you have to expend  money to pave everything?  Or are you just leaving it black top and doing  like Grass Valley does? So help us  to help you to get where you need to be.  And it would be super great  to be polled as a community.  What is the vision they also,  like to see for downtown?  And in a greater thing,  we all know there's a reason why a lot of people  aren't necessarily having foot traffic  downtown. And I hear  Councilman Winslow  like to talk about making things bikeable  and things like that. I'm not opposed. I have a  super cute bike. I'd love to be able to ride  it. But guess what? I don't feel  okay about locking it up and heading indoors  to any of these downtown spots,  nor Mangrove or anywhere really in town.  It'd be great if we could figure out  ways to make that work better for people.  Because I 100% will get on my cute bike  and come down here and other places  if I felt like I could have lunch  and it'll still be there when I get out.  So to me, this is part of like a project  planning process that I'm hearing.  I'm hearing piecemeal things, but I just  want to feel like we don't throw money  away also on these opportunities  and that it makes sense in the  big picture. So thank you for your time.  Josh Marks, followed by  John Scott.  I am a business owner downtown and I'm a huge fan of this idea.  I think anything that's going to make it where you're walkable,  the participation from all of the stores is super important.  But anything that's going to make more people come downtown or walkable,  you're going to create a safer environment with more eyes on everything.  And it's going to just, I just really believe that this could be awesome.  I've been to multiple places where you walk.  It's just so much nicer. You don't worry about traffic.  Kids are playing, you have bands going.  I mean, whether it's on 3rd Street, 2nd, wherever, all of them.  I just, I'm a huge supporter of it as a downtown business owner.  That's all I have to say.  Thank you. John Scott is our last speaker.  I'm assuming I heard my name.  My hearing is getting a little bad.  Hello, Council.  Wonderful service of the city.  In general, I like this city.  I like the idea.  I am not currently a stakeholder in downtown, but with a little bit of luck,  I'm going to have a pretty huge stake in downtown later this year.  You know, as you drive through downtown, what you see these days, day or night,  is a lot of boarded up empty buildings.  And that's not attractive to what the solution is.  The solution to fixing downtown is having people from the community wanting to be downtown,  and not just showing up to one restaurant and then jumping in their car and driving away.  So, you know, if you close a street or two and we do that with farmers market and that kind of thing.  And you have a lot of people loitering around.  And I mean in a good way.  The one problem is that a lot of the businesses don't seem to have their storefronts open at the same time.  So this would really take an engagement of the businesses that are downtown.  It's got to feel safe.  It's got to be well lit.  In short, we've got to change the perception that downtown is not a place that you drive through quickly as possible  and change that perception to a place where you can stop, get out, have a good time, have a meal,  go do something entertaining, run into other neighbors and citizens that are doing the same thing.  I think that's a real positive outcome, and I think this is kind of a good proposal along that line.  The nice thing is closing a street is pretty easy to do.  I mean, during the farmer's market, they seem to successfully close it for three hours every day  and return the street to as it was before.  So it would be a pretty...  It would be a pretty easy experiment to figure out what streets to experiment on.  And you go through these various experiments and find what works.  I mean, I know right now we need to find something different than what we're doing  because the results are obvious.  Right now we have boarded up buildings and way too many of them.  So I'm not the expert.  I think you guys are.  I see what you have to listen to.  I listen to every night, so I really commend you for that.  I'm not sure I could handle it with the grace and poise that you do.  So thank you.  That's it.  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  Further discussion from the council?  Entertain a motion.  I'll move to a motion.  Council Member Tandon.  The motion is to bring in...  to Internal Affairs and work with DCBA and bring the proposal back.  Staff and DCBA to work together.  Yeah.  And then bring it to Internal Affairs.  Yes.  Yes.  Thank you for correcting me.  All right.  I'll second the motion.  All right.  We have a motion by Council Member Tandon, seconded by Council Member Winslow.  Did that get everything that you wrote?  It was your item, so I just want to make sure.  No, it's good.  Okay.  All right.  Okay.  Council Member Bittner.  Yes.  Yes.  Council Member Morgan.  Yes.  Council Member Tandon.  Yes.  Council Member Van Overbeck.  Yes.  Council Member Winslow.  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds.  Aye.  Mayor Coolidge.  Aye.  Carries 7-0.  All right.  We are at the witching hour.  Okay.  So that meeting is item 5.5 without.  We'll be moved to the next meeting without further...  It's not after 10.  It's 10.  It is.  So what is it?  Is it 10?  10.  Is it 10 or after 10?  It's 10.  It's 10.  Yeah, I thought it was 10.  It's up to you, then.  Unless we add a motion to continue the meeting for the one item, which inevitably Council Member Morgan will be against.  All right.  So seeing no motion, we will move forward with item 5.6, items after the item that's posted in the agenda, which are none.  Item 6, reports and communications.  Following reports and communications.  Items are provided for the Council's information.  No action can be taken on items under this section unless the Council agrees to include it on subsequent agenda.  Item 6.1, City Manager's report.  Mr. Schoensel.  All right.  Item 6.2, Council Member's request pursuant to AP and P 1010.  Council Members may verbally request an item to be agendized at a future meeting.  After stating what the item would be, a majority vote of the Council is needed for staff to agendize.  Council Members may also submit requests in writing.  And we do have a request from Council Member Tandon for funding.  Butte County Library, Chico Branch.  Council Member Tandon.  As we are all aware that due to the lack of funding, Butte County is going to take two days away from the library.  And they'll be closing three days a week now.  So I believe that some of the funds we could see if we can work out.  With the county and keep the library open for at least one day more.  So we have it open for five days a week.  It's a valuable resource for a lot of the community members.  And I would like to explore that option.  All right.  I will second that.  You want to make that a motion?  So he's second?  All right.  So that's for a discussion to come back about.  Discussion to come back about.  Potential.  Extending possible library.  Through you.  Yes.  Okay.  I have a quick question.  This has been talked about several times before I was here.  Is there any way we could get a brief summary on what was talked about and where we came to so we have that before us maybe?  I can pull that from the minutes.  Right.  I mean, it was this big.  It's the county.  It's the city.  Yes.  I'm happy to provide that.  I had the conversation.  Yes.  That was a huge discussion in the early 2000s, which I'm sure Ms. Preston remembers very well.  I do.  I don't need a verbatim, but just maybe a brief.  Okay.  Thank you.  Happy to do that.  All right.  Council Member Bennett?  Yes.  Council Member Morgan?  No.  Council Member Tandon?  Yes.  Council Member Van Overbeck?  Yes.  Council Member Tandon?  Yes.  Council Member Winslow?  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds?  Yes.  Mayor Coolidge?  I'll certainly be open to the discussion.  Aye.  Okay.  Carries 6-1.  All right.  Any further requests from Council Members?  Seeing none, we will adjourn.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.
