 Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. We will call the regular meeting of Thursday, July 17th to order. And we'll start with the pledge. So salute and pledge. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. And roll call, please. Here. Commissioner Wall. Here. Commissioner Sharp. Present. Commissioner Laffins. Here. Commissioner Biker-Kaufman. Here. Vice Chair Scarpa. Here. Chair Scott. Present. Really quick for anybody in the audience, if you do want to speak on any matter on the agenda, we do have speaker cards at the back. So if you could just turn those in up here, that would be great. And we will take those when we get to that matter on the agenda. Okay. Thank you. And then Principal Planner Mike Sully. We have a lot of people here today. Thank you, Madam Chair. The purpose of this announcement is just to introduce our new Principal Planner, Garrett Finnamore Norman. He'll be taking over some of the duties of Bruce Ambo, who has left the city, as you know, over the coming months. So you'll be seeing more of him. And then we have all of our engineers for the item that you're looking at tonight here. Thank you. Dream team. All right. We will move to the next item. The consent agenda. Nicole, are there any speakers for the consent agenda? No, ma'am. Okay. So I'll accept a motion on that. We have the approval of the minutes for June 5th. I move to the consent agenda. All right. Is there a second? Second. We have a motion and a second. And Nicole, can you do the roll call vote for us, please? Remember this time. Bear with me. Commissioner Wolff? Aye. Commissioner Wall? Yes. Commissioner Sharp? Aye. Commissioner Latham? Yes. Commissioner Byker-Kaufman? Yes. Vice Chair Scarpa? Yes. Chair Scott? Aye. So that motion passes 7-0. Item 3, public comments. Members of the public may address the commission at this time on any matter not already listed on the agenda. Do we have any public comments? We do. We have one speaker. Okay. And that will be Matthew Willey. Welcome. Thank you. So I apologize. I may have jumped the gun. I'm actually addressing something related to the engineering updates. But I can make my comments now. Let's wait actually until the public hearing. So we get to the public hearing. And then we can get it documented in the right spot for us. Thank you. Okay. Thank you. So any other speaker cards on that? No, ma'am. No? Okay. So we will move to item 4.1, Chico Municipal Code Engineering Updates, Title X, XIV, XVI, XVI-R, and XVIII-R. And I will turn it over to city staff. All right. Give me a second while I get this going. Okay. So we have item 4.1, Chico Municipal Code Engineering Updates, Title X, XIV, XVI, XVI-R, All right. Good evening, commissioners, Chair Scott, Vice Chair Scarpa. My name is David Keene with the Public Works Engineering Department. And tonight I will be presenting some Chico Municipal Code Engineering Updates. So we'll go ahead and get started. So what we'll go over, we'll go over the background, the outreach that was performed. We'll summarize the updates. We'll talk about the environmental review. And then we'll finish with the findings. So first, for the background, it's been a long time since we've updated the Chico Municipal Code with regards to engineering design. We've had a lot of updates on design details and design updates. And so there's been a long list of updates that need to occur. And those are related to regulatory changes, council directives, process enhancements, and long-term sustainability of city infrastructure. This input comes from inspectors, lessons learned, design staff, and things that we've learned in the past seven years. And the reason we're bringing it to you, while some of the titles may not be under your direct purview, it is important because these will impact development around the city. And it will impact design standards and requirements for development. So as we move forward, we figured it would be better to bring a complete packet for transparency. And so what we're asking is that you look at the staff report, the attachments, talk about, or you'll review, or you'll hear the presentation tonight. But we have really three levels of review. So if you really want to get into the nitty-gritty, you look at the red line version. Those are the direct edits to the municipal code. If you want to look a little bit higher than that, you look at the staff report. And then lastly tonight, I'll be presenting a very high level. If you're interested in the stakeholder feedback that we received, there's an attachment to that. And then at the back, all the comments itemized and the city responses to those. So tonight, we'll hold a public hearing. And then at the end, we'll ask you to adopt a resolution recommending the adoption of these changes to the Chico Municipal Code. Point of privilege. Mr. King? Yes. Can you please speak a little bit louder into the mic so all commissioners can hear you properly? Thank you. Thank you. So what did we do for outreach? It's been a long time since we updated the municipal code. So the outreach began in February of 2025 where we sent the draft updates to all of the utilities and stakeholders within Chico. That includes the Chico Builders Association, local engineering firms and developers and utilities, a list of over 80 recipients including city staff and people within the community, stakeholders that we regularly interact with with regards to development. As a result of that, we received over 70 comments from stakeholders. And that is included as an attachment so you can see the city's comments. I'm sorry. The stakeholder comments. The city's comments and the city's responses to those. It should be noted that we did directly incorporate about 20 of those right off the bat where the others were considered and did impact our decisions. In May, we presented these updates to the Chico Utility Coordination Meeting, which is a quarterly meeting that occurs between Chico engineering staff and the utilities of the area so that we're on the same page for projects and updates to policies and requirements just like these. And then, of course, we did the required public hearing notice on July 5th in the Chico ER. So, here's all the titles we'll go through. We'll talk about them. As I said, this is very high level so I'm going to focus on the items that we received the most input from stakeholders on. I'm not going to get into each individual detail. The staff report does a better job of including those, but here we'll just talk about the items that we received the most feedback from the stakeholders from. Title 10, this one's fairly straightforward. This was a council directive where the council provided a directive to change the authority of specific traffic regulations for street intersections to allow for traffic to be made on the street. From the Internal Affairs Committee to the Director of Public Works Engineering. This was fairly straightforward. Not many comments was received on this one, but I wanted to point out that this was indeed a council directive. So now we're into Title 14 which was our Streets and Sidewalks Title. And there was quite a few changes to this title. We did remove several exceptions for encroachment for permits. And the reason for this was to have a better understanding of what was happening in the city. So exceptions allow things to happen out in the public right away that we might not have the ability to track and or have specific requirements for. for restoration. We included a material submittal requirement for encroachment permits and this is very important that we understand exactly what is going into place and we understand what is going into the ground. If there's failure in the future we can look at the submittal and say well the product that went in the ground met the specifications so maybe it was something else but then we have a way of understanding what was put in the ground and this is important for the engineering department. We also included language that allows the city to issue administrative citations for failure to comply and this is just what it seems it's some teeth in case there is action that is not permitted. But the major change to Title 14 is a pavement cut moratorium and this gets directly at the long-term sustainability of city infrastructure. This is a common practice of other agencies and what it is is it's a restriction on cutting into newly paved roads that I'll go over here and so if you apply for an encroachment permit and you meet one of these thresholds the city will not allow the encroachment permit unless there's an exception or waiver. So as you can see after we fully reconstruct the street or similar maintenance it's five-year moratorium that you're not allowed to cut into that street. Slightly less treatment would be a slurry seal coating and it would be three years after that type of treatment. And then of course we want to protect our roads still while they're new and so it would also apply to any road that has a pavement condition index rating of 80 or above which I'll talk about a little bit more in the next slide. And of course there are exceptions and waivers. Water mains break when they need to, things happen like that so there are exceptions but it has to be justified and it has to be approved. And I'll go into the requirements if that happens and the exception is approved there are stricter requirements for restoration to ensure the long-term sustainability of city infrastructure. So first this is a map of our pavement management program and the categories aren't exactly split as 80 and above but more or less the green and blue streets are the streets that would be affected and you can see the pie chart there it's roughly a quarter of the streets. So if we continue to replace streets and continue to maintain these streets and continue to maintain them it'll always be around that 25, 20, 25 percent of streets that will be restricted. Obviously they deteriorate each year but then we'll replace a new one so that percentage will remain somewhat consistent. So say you do get an exception and you do get a waiver you will now be required to replace pavement per a new standard detail and there's four different scenarios in here and so I'll go over one so that you get the the general idea of what the requirement is. So currently that black line that goes see it there's a dashed line that says utility and then a black line that goes up through the sidewalk that would be an example of a new water service a new sewer lateral or some type of perpendicular cut into the street. Currently we require what's called a T cut or a T section and that's one foot of paving back on each side of the trench. We are now requiring 10 feet on each side of the trench and the reason for that is that the cuts in the pavement allow water to get down below the pavement and into the subsurface thus compromising the surface. You might notice when it's raining that's when the potholes form because the water gets down below the asphalt the cars run on top of it and the asphalt comes up so by having the distance between those cuts in the pavement increased it reduces the chance of the water connecting underneath and that piece of pavement popping up. So that's the intent and as you can see the other ones are just different depictions of a diagonal connection and a longitudinal connection and potholes which are investigatory potholes for utilities. Title 16 is our building and instruction title and title 16R is our building standards. This is a regulatory update so the state has moved forward with new regulations with regards to urban level of flood protection. We had to add in new definitions. We included grading as an activity in which the floodplain standards apply and one that will apply for this group is there has to be flood hazard information included on subdivision mapping information. And now we get into title 18R and we boiled it down to these three as the primary concerns of the stakeholders and so it's related to the traffic impact study requirement for developments generating 50 or more net new peak hour trips. A requirement for non-gravity utilities that's conduit, calm, gas, anything that's a non-gravity line to be in water to be installed with a minimum depth of three feet from surface grade to top of pipe and then we updated all of our standard plans which of course has a significant impact. So the first one, traffic impact studies required for developments generating 50 or more net new peak hour trips which is roughly a 50 unit housing subdivision. That's a fairly substantial housing subdivision which may or may not create an impact in traffic which is why we're moving forward with this. As you can see there are similar agencies with similar requirements. Another important note for this is that one of the biggest things we hear about subdivisions obviously is impact to traffic. So when a developer performs this study, it's not just the city, it's the city itself. It not only helps the city in responding to those complaints but it can help the developer in saying we did the study, we did the requirements, we have no impacts or here are the impacts, here are the mitigations that we perform. So it does help both parties. This is a big one, a requirement for the non-gravity utilities to be installed with a minimum depth of three feet and the reason for this is the way the city performs paving projects. Full depth reclamation is a type of pavement treatment and what I'll go through here is this diagram. So what you're looking at is there's a big machine, a big tractor with a grinding mill and a drum and that thing seeps down 18 to 24 inches deep. It grinds up the existing asphalt, whatever is beneath it, hopefully it's aggregate base but it could be native, it can be a variety of things, grinds it up, mixes it with cement and water and replaces it down for a steady or a solid base with the cement makes it very stable and very solid. We then come back and apply pavement on top of that. So that is the driver for this project. So what we're looking at is the distance requirement because as this grinding mill, it's going around, it's an extremely expensive device and there's safety requirements for the distance between the utilities and the device. If we get too close to the utilities, obviously we don't want to hit it directly but there can be cobble, there can be voids, there can be a variety of things that that 12 inches because we're going down 24 inches, they're 36 inches, that's a foot clearance. But there can be a variety of things that if we're less than that, that could impact that utility, damage the utility, cause service interruptions. Right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, and that will likely be the area of failure in the future. So to have a consistent treatment for this FDR is key, and by ensuring that the utilities are deep enough helps the city ensure the long-term sustainability of our infrastructure. The big one, we updated our standard plans, including updates to all of our standard plans. We adopted brand-new standard landscape plans and additional streetlight plans. There's been some discussion about the bicycle gates, which we'll get into later, and including the landscape plans, which help our O&M team make sure that once something is installed, we are able to maintain that. We performed an environmental review. These amendments are exempt because they do not propose any construction, demolition, or other activity for the potential for causing a significant effect on the environment. And, of course, future development will be required to be reviewed on an individual basis. Another requirement of the amendments is that we adhere to Section 19.06.050, where we make the following findings, in which the proposed amendments, are consistent with the general plan, in addition that the proposed amendments are consistent with other applicable provisions of the regulations. So, basically, they comply. There's no conflicting information within the Chico Municipal Code. And with that, that's my presentation. I've kept it brief. I know you have questions, but we ask that the Council move to adopt Resolution 2510, recommending City Council adopt these engineering updates to the Chico Municipal Code. Thank you very much. Thank you. Are there questions of city? Staff, and I'll start with Commissioner Wolf. He usually has questions. Actually, I don't at this time. Anybody on my left? I have a few. Okay. I want to start with Section... Is this the time to address specific questions? Any for staff, yes. First off, I noticed the changes to 10.05.040 to move some power to the city. And I noticed from the... Sorry. From the Internal Affairs Committee to the Planning Director, this Council direction was only for the traffic and the yield and stop signs. I noticed there was a lot more that was included with that. Do you have an investigation for those inclusions? Is there a specific one that you're referring to? I'm curious about all of them, really. You know, prohibiting parking areas, abolishing or designated or abolishing angle parking areas, police parking zones, bicycle parking zones. There were a lot of things in Section B that were moved wholesale. I want to make sure that we have clarity on why that was done. Well, to be clear, the directive from the Council was specific in the minutes, which is why I wrote it that way. But in the Council meeting, there was additional direction given. And so I'm not quite clear exactly. We'd have to go through each one and look back at the specific Council directive. This was over a year ago. So that's the best I can say, is that the language I contained in the presentation was the direct motion in the minutes. Okay. The City Council, I looked over the minutes and reviewed the video myself. They said specifically B6 and B7. So I want to make sure that we're on solid ground here if we do approve B1 through 5 and B8 through 12. Thank you. Other questions? I have a few more. Yeah, keep going. Yeah. Next up, Section 14.10.050, Section B. And also, this affects, I think, 18R12010. I want to make sure that I know the City is contemplating increasing the use of a permeable pavement. I want to make sure that we have the ability to include those as replacements if utilities use it. For permeable pavement? Yeah. Right now, I think it only discusses using the aggregate base or the asphalt that was there before. If we do end up using permeable pavement, are we going to have a chance to require utilities to reuse that later on? I'm sorry, I'm not quite sure. Do we allow permeable pavement to be placed? Is that the question? Well, I think I know some of the plans, for example, for a self-park drive include using permeable pavement. I want to make sure that if we do start using permeable pavement as a City and utility comes along and cuts that up, that we can require them to replace it with permeable pavement rather than using what is in the code, which seems to suggest only asphalt. I can help with that. Typically, what we do is we—sorry, my name is Brendan Adoboni, Director of Public Works. Typically, it's a replacing kind in those situations. So we're not going to—if it's a permeable pavement and there's a trench cut through that, we're not going to put in asphalt there and have a differing— pavement surface. So in those circumstances, it's usually a replacing kind. Okay. Thank you. Next up, Section 16R37060C1. I think I'm unclear whether a licensed land surveyor is someone who should be approving exterior designs against flood forces. It looks like they included licensed land surveyors for a lot of grading work. I think this might have been just an accidental inclusion as well. Licensed land surveyors can perform grading. And they can do the calculations. Absolutely. All right. Is that sufficient to withstand flood forces on exterior walls? A licensed land surveyor would likely work with a structural engineer on that. But which is—you spoke on the section too quickly. Sorry. That was 16R37060C1. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, yes, I see what you're saying there, the similar argument could be made for a licensed architect. The requirements for specific calculations are going to be based on the exact project. Okay, thank you. next up section 18 R 08 20 A1 this is regarding the 50 trips. I want to make clear we have is there some guidance the sub-divider would have to be able to know if they' re at the 50 trip threshold or do we just assume 50 units 50 trips? I would like to know if there can you repeat the question? I' m sorry I' m speaking really fast today. We are requiring sub-divider to bring down the threshold from 100 trips to 50 trips before the traffic impact study is triggered. I want to know what mechanisms do developers have to know they would be at or near that 50 trip threshold to trigger a I' go to the next question. Currently there is no threshold to require. This is a new requirement we' re adding in. It' s a best practice. It' s common in pretty much every agency. We' re trying to memorialize the practice we' ve been looking to implement. By not having it in the code we can' t require it. Based on our would be. Again as David mentioned during the presentation. Pretty much every single project that comes through traffic is the biggest concern. This seems like a reasonable number. Again it' s roughly approximately one to one. Of units to peak our trips. And so a 50 lot subdivision is substantial enough we feel that' s a reasonable request. To We're not doing full-blown traffic studies. They're just traffic impact analysis To identify if there's direct mitigations required associated with those additional peak hour trips Can I ask a quick follow-up yeah, Brendan what triggers a traffic study on something that's not Household use if we had like a commercial Traditionally here in Chico. That's when it's a project that gets elevated to like an environmental impact report EIR level of project that's when we're doing full-blown traffic studies that require all sorts of other requirements to meet the Mitigation requirements of an EIR So is the intention that the 50 new trips would be for any use that a traffic study would be required? Yeah, yeah, so it would also apply not just to residential it apply to commercial industrial and so on because that's a Kind of generally accepted I guess Threshold for identifying if there's like a nearby intersection that fails it's about levels of service So current standards we have in our general plan for levels of service at intersections gives us an ability to evaluate that A couple more so plan s 13 sorry s 18 e I noticed that a lot of bike paths in the city are near trees like I think about the one north of Lindo Channel But a few others throughout the city as well Is the two inch base sufficient to protect against tree root incursion on the? So you're talking about s 18 e so if you read there it's two inches of asphalt on top of two inches of base including Treated with approved weed control and so that combination of activities we do feel would protect against weed and weed intrusion Tree root Oh tree roots no no nothing we can do about tree roots including I mean a deep structural check deep structural section will still be impacted by tree roots typically bike paths are Right next to trees because we don't want to relocate relocate trees. So that's one of the issues Yeah, I just add that our standard also, you know, there's mature trees that You start getting into cutting roots and we have a arborist on-site whenever we have to do that For existing conditions whenever we're planting new trees our city standards to install root barrier To prevent the roots from going underneath the pass it forces the roots to go down and not impact That so in those circumstances. Yeah, you know with those combination of things it's gonna withhold that but again, even a full structural section you see being heaved by existing trees and and so there's Minimal we can do to address those other than simply removing the tree. Okay. Thank you. I think that's everything I have for now That's your wall Yeah, just one question What became of roundabouts no place in 14 or any of the rest of the report speaks of roundabouts? those are You know evaluate on a case-by-case basis on there's certain good applications around abouts and certain not good applications And and so whenever we look at intersection controls and the level of control You know, we evaluate all those elements and determine what the best Engineering solution to that intersection is to provide safety Efficient circulation of vehicles and so sometimes traffic signals are better sometimes stop signs You know get the job done. And so that's just part of our engineering analysis of those intersections. So it's not necessarily a standard But we do that in every roundabouts unique based on its geometrics and elevations and there's a lot of different variables to it What's the minimum diameter for a roundabout in Chico? I Don't know that off the top of my head actually, I don't I don't know what the going minimum standard is Okay any questions to my rate I Have a lot of questions as you already know Okay, so first I Don't have all the numbers written down but It looks like you're proposing to stop installing bicycle barrier posts Or bollards on bicycle paths and instead start installing bicycle path gates Is this correct? So yeah, we've had a lot of comments on those Over the last this is memorializing about seven to eight years of practice I've been at the city now about ten years We've had a lot of issues with the101010101010 the! swing gate applications as a means to slow down bicyclists at certain locations where essentially a bike path comes into play with a roadway. The prevention of high-speed bicyclists shooting into a roadway with the advent of e- bikes and the proliferation of those we' ve heard a lot of those. We've heard a lot of concerns over speeding e-bikes and so it' s a safety means. There' s not really a great application with the bollards. We' ve tried different things over the years, a lot of different bollard types on that same comanche creek phase one project at the ivy street connection between myers and I think it' s 22nd over there. We tried one of those padded spring loaded bollards and we found that it was a little bit too big for the bollards. We tried a lot of different things over the years and this is memorializing the standard that we look at. It' s not a one size fits all so we evaluate that on a case by case basis. Just to reiterate the fact that standards are standards and they' re not applied to every single situation. When we do projects we evaluate what the best feature is for that given situation and every situation tends to be unique. What we' re trying to do is provide a safe functional access point so we prevent vehicles from entering those which we' ve had that as well. It slows down that conflict point between bicyclists and vehicles to prevent injuries and accidents. Then also just for kind of a again access points to certain vehicles and then also just for! Pathways so it' s a way to kind of memorialize what path they' re on. We had instances where we tried to remove bollards and have striping and signage. For example the series pedestrian bridge that' s over lindo channel that connects series and manzanita. Years ago the decking was a wood that had dilapidated so we removed probably probably probably probably probably probably probably probably probably probably probably probably probably probably ve achieved all the objectives sometimes it can be inconvenient but we want to make sure it' s safe for all users of all types whether it' s vehicles bikes pedestrians and so we' re putting in standard as when we apply these this is the standard that will be applied so we don' t get bike gates that overlap significantly it' s a standard that would be applied in those circumstances. you' re not saying that you would put these on every single place where a bike path meets a street? correct. what are your criteria for deciding where to put them and where not to put them? it' s based on engineering judgment site conditions site constraints site distance for example we don' t have swing gates at every single intersection on the want to put it on our esplanade project. these are also design guidelines for when development happens. this is not a guideline that says we now go out into the community and change everything. if there' s a development that triggers the need to make an improvement on a bike path that standard would be followed. okay. are there other cities that use these things extensively? and what' s the effect been? extensively would be a subjective term. how much do you plan to use them? i' ve seen other communities use them yes. can you name some? city of mountain view. i know for personal specific circumstances where pedestrian bridges and interactions between vehicles and bicyclists those are used and effective and they' ve been in place for over a decade. that' s the only place? i don' t know every single circumstance and location. but through our evaluation and our see that there is a lot of engineering practices and evaluating safe practices for access and circulation of all modes of transportation. since we' ve been applying them in the last seven years i' ve never heard of a concern issue, safety issue or legal claim against the city with these applications up until about a month ago when the south park drive item came forward. to my knowledge they' ve been effective. i do know someone who was seriously injured on one of those. we have gotten a lot of letters about this. i think it' s the only topic we' ve gotten letters about we got five of them. saying they' re very difficult to navigate for older people for people on non public transportation. especially people with disabilities that don' t allow them to dismount. also the national association of transportation officials says do not use maze gates. their only mention of maze gates is do not use them. it seems like the standard is to not use them. i' m wondering why are you proposing to use them anyway? we' re aware of the design guidelines. i think over the years again a practice we' ve evaluated and looked at the best means to again consider all variables of all users of all types. it seems to have been effective. it provides adequate ada compliant means of access and safety. it' s something that' s been applied and i think it' s been a best practice for us. i think we' ve been applying them before the nacta design guidelines even came out. it' s again a standard detail that is a tool in a tool box as we evaluate site specific conditions and when and where those apply. okay. so you said this is a i think this is for safety reasons but it seems like this is putting things backwards. so putting the onus on the bicyclists to slow down. i do really understand where you' re going with the questions. i want to make sure we get the really direct questions that we have from staff so we' re not interjecting our opinions before we hear from the public. so we can move along with other commissioner questions too. m going to is what i don' t see in the standards is treatments on the street that the bike path intersects or meets. so treatments that would calm the traffic on the street. so i' m just wondering about whether you considered setting a standard to institute traffic calming for the cars on the street and not just for the bikes. i would say we' ve deployed those throughout the city in many circumstances again when we look at a project we evaluate the site specific conditions variables we' ve deployed all sorts of traffic calming measures whether it' s bulb to corners it' s a lot of like this rapid rectangular rapid flashing beacons. pedestrian signals there' s a host of different tools for those types of applications that aren' t necessarily always reflected here and again it' s kind of site specific and i would say our track record is that we' ve deployed those throughout the entire city when appropriate. thank you. another question is for the bike path standards so it shows 8 feet of traveled way is that a minimum is that the recommended the noctow standards are 11 feet recommended and 8 feet minimum? so just wondering is that 8 feet? that' s a minimum standard typically so it typically includes a minimum of a one foot shoulder again standards we look at and evaluate every single situation plenty of circumstances and examples where we' ve exceeded that for example right now the concrete bike path multimodal path on bruce road is 12 foot wide so there' s a minimum of a one foot shoulder and then we look at threshold and then we assess again site specific conditions constraints that might warrant or be an opportunity to go larger than that. so is there a possibility to put in some kind of a table i know you have those for other situations where you have a certain amount of traffic and a certain width recommended could that be added? those are related to different roadway classifications that carry that serve different purposes so a bike path doesn' t have different requirements for the roadway and the roadway has different structural loading requirements typically again those roadways have different design parameters for different classifications whether it' s an arterial collector or local road based on traffic indexes engineering pavement design for the loading of vehicles on that pavement surface and so it wouldn' t be warranted for a bike path. i guess i was referring to the number of bicycles how much traffic there is you don' t do that for streets? how many vehicles per hour come through? vehicles we do vehicle counts. so i' m just suggesting there be a table like that for bicycle paths? wider if there are more. we don' t take bicycle counts again there' s typically not a threshold that would warrant different applications of back path widths or structural sections based on more bikes because i think you' re talking about the structural. noctow has a table that does that. thank you for your comment. putting a table like that in there. my last questions are about sidewalks. so the exhibit eight which is the curb ramp standards and i' m sorry i don' t have the s oh wait i do sorry. i' m sorry about the curb ramp and the s five c. it says a 30 foot radius for the curb the curb radius is 30 feet. this is for a driveway a major driveway and i couldn' t find a similar standard for an intersection of two streets so i' I'm assuming that it's the same. But anyway, that's really large. That's huge. So again, NACTO says you should almost never do above 15. And so I'm just wondering why the standard is such a high radius. Why 30, not 15? I'm not familiar. I think maybe there's a misunderstanding of the application of it. That's typically related to that. Okay. The turning radius of the trucks or vehicles entering those driveways, and so it allows for proper access of a vehicle so that it doesn't cut that tight corner and run over the curb and potentially put pedestrians or bicyclists in harm's way. And so I think we're usually in that. That's a pretty standard application for those types of turning radiuses for big trucks and stuff like that. So is this the same standard you use at intersections of streets? Do you also have a 30-foot? Turning radius? So I tried to find it, and I couldn't find it. Is it 30 foot? 30 foot. Yes, that's the standard applied everywhere else. Okay. That is huge. Okay. And then the last one is the ramps. So on the drawings, it always has a ramp on the apex of the turn. And again, recommendations. or to do two ramps, one facing each direction rather than an apex? And just wondering, is that just like an example, or is that what you're holding as the standard? What is the detail number that you're referring to? S-27. S-27. Shows a ramp going from the street. To the sidewalk. To the sidewalk. And actually, S-5C also just shows one ramp right at the apex. I'm just wondering, is that your standard to only put one in? Yes, that's what that standard shows. Okay. In that case. Okay. Last question. Thank you. Commissioner Laffens? Vice Chair Skarpa? Nope. All of my questions have been answered. Okay. Any follow-up questions over here? Okay. Just two quick questions. One on the telecommunications conduit with the open trench work. I was a little bit confused in the staff report number four. It says request for installations of telecommunications conduit when performing open trench work. And then below it, it's installation of the conduit while performing other underground work needs that master plan. So I just wanted to understand, is this, you know, anytime a trench is open, would we be requiring a telecommunications plan? Or? Is it something like we have an open trench, we're doing a project, Comcast wants to come in and lay conduit? Do we require a plan from Comcast? Do we require a plan from the city? I was just uncertain who that burden falls on. So this is really driven by our North Fiber telecommunications group. And the intent there is a lot of conduit and telecommunications companies. They see an opportunity when the trench is open to put in conduit and perhaps save money with economy of scale. And you already have the trench open. You're already doing pavement on the street. And we're not opposed to that. But the issue becomes what size? Where do we tie into the sidewalk? And there needs to be specific understanding of what pipe goes in the ground. Because the last thing we want to do is put in pipe that's undersized and it wastes the opportunity. Or we put in pipe that's oversized. And we're spending too much money and not getting the benefit for that. So the utility would pay for that differential in cost. They would pay for that. But the idea would be it would be cheaper for them because we, the city, or some other utility is already doing the work. So that's the intent behind it. But the issue is we need those specifics before we just start putting in conduit in the ground. Okay. So I think you got me almost there. So is the intent that the utility is creating the master plan or the developer is creating the master plan? This would be a utility who wants telecommunication. This would not apply to a developer. They wouldn't want conduit in the ground. I would just add too that it's also to create consolidation where we can. So there's so many different by CPUC regulation if you're a CPUC regulated utility they have a right to go into our rights of way. And so we don't have a spaghetti limit. We have a list of different conduits from different providers. Most recently we have had race communications going throughout the entire city. And so it's an opportunity to also evaluate making sure they're putting it in a place that's not going to prohibit or impact other utility services as well. So it's kind of trying to consolidate it. Many times if pg&e has a joint trench they engage with those other providers to join their trench so it's in a consolidated joint trench. So it's a great way to get people to get involved in the road and to get them to get involved in the road that impact others. Thanks. And then Mike I might be putting you on the spot here. But I think in my years up here which is over a decade we've maybe had one project maybe two that involved a bike path or any sort of upgrades. Can you think of any significant that come to the planning commission that would not be the city's own projects? Yes. I think the commission would be the one that would be the one that would be the one that would be the one that would be the one that we don't see. That you don't see? Well we don't see. Brendan is not filing for an application with us to do his work. Right. I guess I don't understand the question. We definitely had the commission require bike path connections like at the end of a cul-de-sac to get through the back of them to maybe a commercial area or arterial or something like that. A handful? A dozen? I think it's kind of hard now because subdivisions live for a very long time and they may get built a decade after they were approved. So we see them getting built and they were approved by former staff and stuff. But it's common that we have little short connections like that and it gives the ability for somebody to go down the street, leave the street, be on a bike path and then spit right out onto an arterial and having some control device at the end of that interface is probably a good idea. Yeah. I'm just trying to get maybe from your professional opinion. Economy of scale. Of if we change something like this. Are we expecting 100 maze gates in the city of Chico or are we expecting 6 over the next ten years? The bulk of them would be probably by public works projects. And they would be on case-by-case basis depending on what other uses that road might be used for. The bike path might dual purpose for other things as well. Brendan what do you have in the pipeline? Well we've got lots. in the pipeline. I mean, I was driving around Chico. When you have money to build. Yeah. So again, we apply it selectively. Again, I can name off a number of locations where we haven't applied them. And so right now in terms of in the pipeline, I don't know any specific projects actually that would have those implemented. I think the South Park Drive consideration that's going to be implemented in the next couple of years. I think it's going back to council but that might change and be a moot point anyways based on the council direction there. So yeah, in many instances I think what we experience in public works, many of those subdivisions that have those little connections, many times when they' re in operation we get requests to have them closed because of the proximity of bad actors and stuff like that. So there' s a lot of different considerations that we try to deploy and make it safe and effective. Okay. I have a couple more. Sure. So you mentioned you tried one kind of flexible baller. Have you tried more than one? Have you tried the magnetic ones that fade to block down? We have not tried those. Yeah. I think we have a couple more. do we have any of the maze gates up now? I think I saw one at rio lendo. we' ve got about a dozen of them or so right now. Again, comanche creek phase one and phase two projects I can think of. I think they' re at the meyer street and the access point. Then also where the path comes out at the intersection of hagen and midway. I think we installed some as part of our rio lendo project that we' ve just paved at the airport bike path. Bike way 99 has some I believe at sky way. The path terminates at sky way. And again traditionally the city. that would be like a tubular railing at the back of curb to prevent shooting out into a high-speed roadway. We have offset that by using the swing gates. There is about I would say 10 to 12 applications throughout the city. we will open our public hearing. Nicole will announce the first speaker and then once that speaker comes up we will announce the second speaker so you are ready to go. Everybody will get three minutes and then if you hit your three-minute mark I will ask you to please wrap up your comments and sit down. For the commission just a reminder if you have questions of the speaker please ask them when they are at the podium because once I close the public hearing we will not be reopening the public hearing. If you have ask them while they are at the podium. All right Nicole. first speaker is Katie Toma and then Julian Zener. good evening commissioners my name is Katie Toma and I am the executive director of the Chico builders association. I apologize for getting our responses to this agenda item to you so late. I am going to read our response to you. Good evening commissioners, So, there are specific concerns. The first one, and these aren't in particular order, is the traffic study threshold. And I believe the current practice, it's not a policy, the current practice now threshold is 100. So lowering the peak threshold from 100 to 50 will trigger significantly more traffic studies. These studies can cost between $10,000 and $30,000, increasing project expenses. Material submittals. Staff recommends a 10-day approval cycle for material submittals, even when the same materials are used repeatedly. We recommend allowing an annual approval if materials remain unchanged to reduce unnecessary delays. Pavement standards. The proposed standard of 3-inch asphalt over 8 feet. And the proposed standard of 8-inch aggregate base is more stringent than necessary. Current standards allow for 1.5 inches of asphalt concrete over 4 inches of aggregate base, depending on road classification. We urge the city to accept alternative design supported by calculations, especially for local roads, rather than imposing a one-size-fits-all approach. And then street lighting requirements. Adopting Caltrans standards. And revised. The reduction in spacing requirements for street lighting is excessive for local streets. We feel the reduction in spacing requirements for street lighting is unwarranted. These changes will drive up costs unnecessarily. CBA respectfully requests the Planning Commission amend Resolution 25-10 to incorporate the above concerns. We believe these adjustments will help control housing costs and support the City's goal of increasing housing availability. Thank you for your attention.

It's very impressive. I'm here because of a concern about South Park Drive and so-called maze gates. I first ran across them, I don't know, two, three years ago on the bike path to the airport. And for a senior citizen, you approach them and then there's an abrupt right ankle you take and then in a narrow space you make another right-hand turn with a bicycle and then you come out. And it's problematic for some of us. And I would like to ask... In the intersections where the cars come into the park, in the one-mile area from Woodland, why the emphasis is on giving cars the right-of-way and not the bicycles? It seems much easier to have a stop sign for the cars than to have a stop sign for the cars. And I'm curious, what is the emphasis on giving cars the right-of-way and not the bicycles? When they cross the walking bike path, than to have maze gates. And having that as a general plan for all path car intersections, I think would be very problematic. I have seen designs where there are gates, chicane gates, where you make more of a gentle... S-curve. And you wouldn't have to dismount doing that because there's not an abrupt series of right-hand turns in a narrow space. So that's something to consider. I think that some bicyclists, particularly with electric aid, battery aids, go too fast. Yes. But I don't... I don't think that the maze gates at an intersection are going to stop that, you know, a mile or two down the road. So I think the bicyclists and pedestrians should be given priority for safety rather than cars. Thanks very much. Thank you. Kirk Monfort, followed by Matthew Willey. Thank you. I want to support a lot of Julian's comments. I too am past 80. And I find it very hard to negotiate some of those paths, particularly the ones at Rio Lindo and the ones out at... that access Myers. For one thing, the gates are too close together. You have to really make a... You know, you have to... And my ankles won't take it anymore. So I didn't buy a bike to walk it, you know. And I... Currently, it really hurts to dismount. And it's better if I can just keep going. Okay. And I don't understand how you can get through those gates without... If you had groceries on the bike, if you had baskets. I just don't... You'd be hanging up all the time on those things. Or if you've got a non-standard bike, if you've got, you know, a cargo bike, or if you've got a bike with a trailer, like if you're a mom and a kid with, you know... There's people that do trailers. And anyway, so I was wondering... And the South Park Drive, I wonder why we can't use rumble strips or why we couldn't do breakaway bollards of some sort. I remember Russ Mills was pretty big on... After Ed got hurt, who was the former executive director of Chico Bello. I wonder why we couldn't... He was pushing breakaway bollards, I think was he called them. I mean, I heard Brian say that they... You had one down at Cheyenne or Comanche Creek, and it got trashed. Oh, well. Okay. That's all I had to say. I just don't find bollards... I mean, I don't find maze gates useful at all. And I wonder why we couldn't do rumble strips. Or something like that. To let people know that if they just blast through this intersection, they're going to get killed. Matthew Willey, followed by Richard Roth. Good evening. I had a statement prepared, but I wanted to address some of the things that came up in discussion. So I'm a daily cyclist in Chico. First of all, I wanted to say thank you to the commission and all the city staff. Thank you. I see changes happening in the city every day that improve things for cyclists. So I appreciate your work. I do want to address maze gates, though. I ride a variety of non-standard bicycles, which includes a cargo bike that I haul my five-year-old around on. I have had every combination of bicycle trailer that I've carried him in, in the park and elsewhere in the city. And as well as I ride a tandem bike, behind which the rear passenger is one of my parents, who both can no longer ride an individual bike due to their health concerns. So I ride a lot of big bikes, and I can tell you maze gates are just absolutely terrible full stop for any kind of non-standard bike. You know, there are, especially the tandem, if I come up to a maze gate, I have to physically lift it over the gate because I can't fit it in the turning radius of the maze gate. I haven't addressed this with anybody because I didn't know there was any way to address this in the past. So now that it has come up, I would like to give specific examples around town where there are maze gates that do cause me a problem. So, for example, on the 99 bikeway behind the mall, near Trikert Ponds, there's maze gates that are just gates from bicycle path to bicycle path. There's no intersection of even another bicycle path coming in. And I specifically avoid that one to the point where I will ride on Forest Avenue with my son and a trailer behind me because I can't navigate the maze gate on the bike path. Another one would be the connection between the bike path and the bicycle path. So, I have a lot of experience with the bike path along Lindo Channel that crosses Lindo over to Manzanita. I've personally had a crash at those maze gates from fallen leaves in the fall being wet and trying to make a sharp turn in the leaves. So, you know, these do cause problems. Again, riding a variety of non-standard bikes, I see that happening. I've spoken with other people. There's a gentleman who rides a side-by-side with his son in Bidwell Park. And we were discussing just the other day how maze gates are not navigable for him as well. So, anybody who's riding a hand bike, anybody who's riding a tandem bike, anyone who's riding a cargo bike, or any other kind of non-standard, non-just-one-person riding a bike, these maze gates are very difficult. Yeah, the last example I'll bring up is the new bridge that crosses into Community Park from Humboldt Road, where Humboldt goes under the 99. There's a maze gate there, which luckily, we have somebody came along and made a little asphalt path that bypasses the maze gate. And that frequently happens. When you see a maze gate, you'll either see a social path on one side of it because people hate them so much and they will bypass them, or somebody has come along and realized that we need to have an alternate route of travel. So, thank you very much. I appreciate it. Could I ask you a quick question? What would you see as a better alternative? Yeah. I think the best alternative is no bicycle is going to be wider than around four feet wide. And no car is going to fit in between four feet of distance. The difficulty with maze gates is that you have to make these sharp radius turns. And so, if we can put, if not bollards, then gates. Gates are fine, but the difficulty is the fact that you have to weave around the gates. So bringing in whatever kind of barrier system, whether it's a road, whether that be curbs or a gate, that narrows the path of travel down to something that a car can't fit through, but a bike can. You know, again, because I ride very long bikes, my tandem is a tandem recumbent, again, for accessibility reasons. And, you know, a 10-foot bike just doesn't fit through that turning radius. So. Thank you. Thanks very much. Our last speaker is Richard Roth. First of all, I love the bike path along the Esplanade, with the exception of Third Avenue. I use that regularly. I didn't think it was going to be as good as it is. And I like it. I think I hated maze gates before it became popular. One of the, a couple of the special ones, I mean, the one along Tiger, I think it was the one where the pond is ridiculous. It's just like, it's a straight bike path and there's maze gates. The other one is 20th Street, access to Myers. If you go to the maze gates, you'll often see the maze gates and then the path that goes off the path to get around them. So, you're forcing, basically, they get people to take the easier route, which is around them, onto the gravel or side or narrow area to get around the gates. Often these are obviously somewhat hazardous to do that. Really particular, the one across Comanche Creek, that is an awful gate. And that path itself has been treated in the past very poorly because they built the bridge, installed the maze gates, and then closed off that path completely to bikes for several months. The same happened when they were doing construction at the airport. No bike path at all out there, forcing bikes to go into single lane traffic with heavier equipment. So I wanted to talk about that. The other thing I wanted to talk about is sidewalks. And the safest way for me to get from where I live in Chapman Town to downtown is to come up 8th Street against traffic on the sidewalk. It is away from traffic. I've got protection from the street traffic. I can see the traffic coming. I can also have the barriers of the cars parked on the street and the problem is that it's very narrow and it works for one person going one way through there. When I was coming here, I got an electric bike. They were accused of going too fast. But I was passed by a woman on a pedal bike who went and swung out into the street. It was a bike lane on 9th and I was driving down the street. I had to pass. Passed me. Anyway, those are two. I just don't think that people are aware of how much alternative electric traffic is going to grow. When I got my bike, there were three electric bikes in Chico. That was eight years ago. And I think the explosion of one wheels, skateboards, all of these. I've seen a three year old and I think that's what I'm seeing. what I'm seeing. Thank you. That is our last speaker. Anybody else wish to speak? Okay. Then we will close the public hearing and bring it back to the commission. Any further questions or comments? Yes. I have some questions for staff actually that I'm seeing here shows the two gates not overlapping each other. And they are separated by at least I'm sorry. Eight feet. And I'm wondering are the existing gates in town to that standard or is it something else that is being commented on here? I believe for the most part that' s the case. t know about exactly if the spacing of eight foot minimum is in every single situation. I know sometimes we' ve exceeded that to ten feet. But the intent has always been you don' t overlap the gates to create a real jagged turn. Okay. Is there in terms of the functionality of these devices can that distance be increased significantly? Certainly beyond ten feet so as to provide the protection but still allow people to get through more easily. Is that possible? The concern with increasing substantially would be then vehicles entering. Those are again considerations we can look at. Okay. And then I thought your comments about the bollards in response to a commissioner questions earlier was interesting. It seems like it' there are trade offs here. With both approaches. The bollards provide the protection of the bicycle paths from cars driving on them. And they provide a lot of ease as far as bicycle traffic is concerned. But your concern is that the bollards are more dangerous in the long run. Is that what it comes down to? I think that' s been my experience. I think I' m the most senior one here now. At the time again seven or eight years ago when we did our first application of these swing gates that was in coordination with Chico Velo at the time. And the folks involved there. We had heard just a lot of issues. I' ve been around the city again long enough where I' ve had legal claims. But I' issues come across for different applications. Trip and fall hazards. People don' t see them when they' re coming up fast. Near misses. Shooting out into public. Into traffic. It' s kind of all those different factors where they seem to be unsafe applications. Again sometimes there' e an application for them. I was going to ask if this is adopted does that mean we' re going to have to No maybe not. What I might recommend is you can include a recommendation to include a bollard design in the standard details. Again these are standards that are tools in the toolbox to apply in the right circumstances. As it stands right now the recommendation going forward it would be a set of standards that would not include bollards. Is that right? Correct. If we wanted to leave that open as an option we would need to make that change in the motion. Yeah. s a really simple add. Thank you. Then I was wondering about the staff' response to the comments we' ve received from the builders group in town about some of their concerns with costs and the standard designs there. Do you have any response to those comments and concerns? Yeah. I' ll just jump in I guess. The lower impact ones I' ve seen them $5,000 for a smaller one. Cost wise. Talking about the traffic studies? Traffic study wise. Again it' s kind of a threshold that we feel is reasonable. We understand we work very closely with the developer groups. I think we' re a pretty reasonable agency to work with. In the end again it provides protection for the developer, for the city, to show the community that these developments are not causing net new impacts. I think it' s a really good I think it' really good solution. I think it' s a really good solution. Again every situation is a little different. If it' s not necessary if it' s in a circumstance where it' s not required we have that flexibility to evaluate that case by case. That I think is an important point. There are some cases if I understand correctly then where you could have a project that might be generating more than 50 trips if you use the ITE manual and you calc it out. But if you look around and look at the and there' s obviously nothing going on to be concerned about you don' t need to do a traffic study necessarily. correct. Absolutely. I would also add. Conversely you could find a situation where it might be oh my gosh we have a real issue here it' s clear with any additional traffic we need to take a look at it even if it doesn' t meet the standard we need that information to properly evaluate it. correct. And without it in our muni code we don' t have the ability to require it. I think that' On the street lights I' m not sure what specifically the question is again we' ve been coordinating for months this question didn' t come up. Looking at and comparing the table of spacing for our street light standards there' s no changes in the spacing from what is currently in the muni code and what we' re proposing. The changes to the street lights were the types. So we have consistency again from a long-term maintenance perspective that we don' t have a hundred different types of street lights so our maintenance crews have to have in our yard a hundred different types of street lights standards. So your response to that would be that there is no change in the spacing so you wouldn' t end up with a subdivision that would today need 50 street lights and with this new standard it would need 70. Correct. 50 wouldn' t change that. Correct. Thank you. What about the materials submittals and pavement standards? It' s an interesting one. It' s technically been in our code because our code refers to caltran standards and that' s a very standard industry thing. For pavement standards? Yeah for any material that is going to be included in the development that ultimately the developer is building to the city standards so that we are accepting it and taking ownership we want to make sure it' s the right standard. We want to make sure that we are accepting the right material of the right quality and standards so that when we take ownership as stewards of taxpayer dollars we' re not accepting something less standard. We' ve been working with the developers over the last year on that. Material submittals it' s a new practice I think for them. But it' s a pretty widely accepted industry standard and we have in many instances for materials we don' t require new mixed design to be created for every single project. Those typically go on one year cycles because we have a lot of materials that are not going to be used for the development of the new project. For example, probably10101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010 going to clarify the pavement standards we' re looking at. I don' t know any development has ever been built since I' ve been here with a 1 1⁄2-inch roadway section it' s always been a practice every subdivision in the ten years I' ve been here has been built with a 3 inches of asphalt and 8 inches to me that' s just memorializing the practice we do have the caveat that' s a minimum. to have certain r values traffic indexes that ultimately go into an engineered structural section depending on the underlying soil conditions and so on so we can ensure again that whatever' s built and taken on by the city and expected for us to maintain is built to the standard to last. thank you very much. okay. Any other questions? yes. I want to thank the staff for changes and I think we had less than a dozen questions about it so I want you guys to take a round of applause for yourselves too because this is amazing. I do want to echo some of the comments we heard from the public though. I also ride a nonstandard bike a large cargo bike and I basically cannot ride on the airport trail to get around in these maze gates. I think it' s pretty clear that these cannot be a city standard. They did not serve enough of the bicycling public and by and they actually may counter the effects we want to have getting people bicycling by making some routes that should be safe obvious routes unavailable or unsafe or impassable for them. My cargo bike can get through those which is fine but my cargo bike cannot and that' s a strong incentive for me to get around the city with anything unless my kids are on their own bikes or I' m not taking anything with me of value. I don' t think this is necessarily the answer but I think it' s not a workable solution to include maze gates now as a city standard. anything else? I actually had a question about katie thomas' request that developers can submit the same materials list for multiple projects. Is that precluded in the standards? no we' ve been doing that as a practice. another question is have you tried rumble strips instead of maze gates to slow bicycles down? I' m not aware of any but again every situation calls for different evaluation and evaluation. we' implementing different practices. any further discussion? I guess I' ve maybe motion at least the beginning of one to adopt these but to strike the maze gates. to reduce the number of! down bicyclists such as have been suggested by some of the speakers gentler turns defined by chicanes, rumble strips, putting in the maze gates but 12 feet apart instead of 8 feet apart. I' m not sure exactly how we would word that. I have something I dropped it. I move that the planning commission adopt resolution 2510 recommending the city council adoption of the engineering updates to the chico municipal code contained therein with the modification to remove the proposed inclusion of maze gates S35 and instead recommend the use of flexible ballage or other ADA compliant bike friendly alternatives to manage cyclist speed and improve safety at path intersections. we have a second. at what point can we add amendments before a second or after a second? I would like to get a second. you want the second first before? let' s see if anybody else wants to second it. I will second. I vote for friendly amendments I thought that could be a good starting. we can still add things. I wanted to also add that for the bicycle paths that it not say 8 feet but that it recommend 11 feet but have a minimum of 8 feet. these are for two way bicycle paths. and third that the curb radius requirements be set with a lower minimum of say 15 feet. and to go by I don' t know quite how to word this but to adhere more to the non-conventional the standards. commissioner laffens and vice chair scarper are you amenable to those? I think I' m confused about the 15 foot and I understand the bike path amendment however I guess I' m doing discussion on this. I just think you make it wider than you have more reason for cars to go through. I think it is a good point. I think it is a good point. I think it is a good point. I was talking about the 15 foot thing had to do with the turning radius. the radius on a corner. it is set to 30 feet right now anywhere there' s an intersection of two streets or a major driveway going to a street the turning radius is set to 30. whereas noctow says 30 should be under only very unusual situations and I think that' s what city staff said. I thought it was. was it? I think they said that it was 30 was standard around in our area. I' m so I don' t know we' d have to I think I' d have to talk to the experts on that. that was s5c and it was for big trucks and other trucks to be able to get around. I' m not sure if that' s the application of the design guidelines for driveway entrances for trucks and vehicles because that would be like this is a vehicular turning radius standard. it' s not necessarily where a bike path is or anything like that. I' m just cautioning on that. I' m thinking about pedestrians. it' s really dangerous for pedestrians. let me see if we have because I I think vice chair scarper would have to accept both of those for the amendment. for the motion that we have. just a yes or no? no. all right. we have a motion that is the adoption with the modification the removal of maze gates and then flexible bollards or other alternatives to be considered. are there questions or comments on that motion as it stands? we have a motion and a second on that. I have a question. when you rejected those amendments you rejected also the 11 foot recommended for? they said no to both. I just wanted to be clear. I didn' t want to recommend 11 foot wide. okay. I' where did the maze gates end up? in or out? the maze gates are out. on this motion maze gates are out. alternative would you repeat that for us? yeah. recommended use of either flexible bollards or other ADA compliant alternative so it leaves it a little bit more open to manage cyclist speed and improve safety at path intersections. okay. let' s get a roll. for a friendly amendment to include the building associations for points? no. because it seems like for at least our engineering staff that drafted all of this not all of this like the building associations. I think the materials submittals street lighting and other things aren' t don' t need to be included because they' re already done or it was talking about something different. okay. nicole would you please do a roll call vote for us? yes. commissioner wolf? no. commissioner wall? no. commissioner sharp? yes. commissioner laffens? yes. commissioner kirk-koffman? yes. vice chair scarpa? yes. chair scott? no. we will move on to the regular agenda. there is none. reports and communications? i have nothing at this time. thank you. will we have our thursday august 7th meeting? i don' t think so but we' ll follow up if that changes. i don' t think so at this time. we won' t have a meeting then. thank you very much. this is fun. this is one of the best parts of being on the planning commission. thank you.
