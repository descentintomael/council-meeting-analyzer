 Good evening. I'll call to order the adjourned regular Chico City Council meeting of October 20th and welcome you all here as we discuss policy related to the city. We start with an invocation from Chaplain Bud Chauvin. Thank you Mayor Schwab. Let's pray. Almighty God we come before you today and Lord I ask that you would give wisdom and understanding and direction to the members of this council. Lord I thank you for them. Pray that you'd help them to make those decisions that need to be made or to bless the city to protect and provide for each and every person who lives here. And we thank you Lord. And we pray for all of the employees, Lord, the city employees that work for our great city and pray your protection upon them as well. And we ask these things in your name. Amen. Thank you. Please join me in the Pledge of Allegiance to the flag. I stand, salute, and pledge. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands. One nation, one nation. One republic. Invisible. With liberty and justice for all. Can we have the roll call Madam Clerk? Council Member Huber? Here. Council Member Morgan? Here. Council Member Horry? Here. Council Member Reynolds? Here. Council Member Stone? Here. Vice Mayor Brown? Here. Mayor Schwab? Here. Um. I have an item added. 1.6 of request to add something to closed session. Um. Mr. Jarrett? Yes. An item came up after the posting of the agenda to requires Council to here in closed session. The case of Herrera versus City of Chico. We'd recommend that this be added at this time. It'll require a vote of the Council. Motion and a vote. So moved. Second. And a vote. And a vote. Yes. I'm waiting for the. I was trying to get there. Uh. Council Member Huber? Here. Council Member Morgan? Here. Council Member Horry? Here. Council Member Reynolds? Here. Council Member Stone? Here. Vice Mayor Brown? Here. Mayor Schwab? Here. Carries 7-0. And before we go on, um, had several people say this is quite an ambitious agenda. So I thought maybe we would start to look at the agenda. Just to, I wanted to share with you what the plan was for the agenda. And if there is anything that Council would like to move to a following agenda, we can do that now or rearrange in the order of anything. Um, I sat down with City Manager and we reviewed the agenda and thought that we could get through these items in four hours. Um, and that's I suppose thinking that every year we have a new agenda. Everything goes as planned. The items that are on the agenda are for the most part continued from our last meeting. There's just one item, 5.5, excuse me, 5.6 that is new. And Council voted to have the, uh, Housing Ad Hoc Committee report and recommendations be placed as the first item on the agenda. So that is the, the, um, the logic behind the order of this agenda. I thought that, uh, we would take about, these are my estimates, um, 30 minutes on the Housing and Ad Hoc Committee. We'd hear from the public and then give some recommendations to staff over what our priorities would be. Uh, quality of life plan, probably take about 90 minutes, an hour and a half. Um, and then, um, we would, we would, we would, we would, we would, we would, we would, we would take some of these to the door to door to door to door to door to door to door to door to door to door to door to door to door to door to door to door to door to door to door to door to door to door to door to door to door to door to door to door to door to door to door to door to door to door to door to door to door to door to door to door to door to door to door to door to door to door to door to door to door to door to door to door to door to door door to door to door to door to door to door to door to door to door to door to door to door to door to was the airport commission, which would be about 30 minutes. So I just wanted to put that out there to council and get any feedback that you might have. Well, with all due respect, other than the 90-minute one, which I think is the homeless optimistic plan, I think that all of your numbers are wrong by half. Okay. Not because of yourself, but because we can't control the, nor do we want to control public comment. Just on the cannabis thing, I'd be surprised if there weren't 20 speakers, 10 speakers. It could be, I just don't know. But I don't know what the solution is, other than to cut this thing in half and continue it on again, which is what we did last week. We did it last time. But I doubt very highly we're going to get through it all. Well, I will make the motion to continue item 5.3, which is the policing review and ad hoc committee interim report to be continued to the following meeting. The entire report will be given. I'll second that. We have a motion and a second on that. Can we just take a vote? Okay. And that was the police. It was item 5.3, consideration of policing review and ad hoc committee interim report to be continued to the next meeting. Okay. Councilmember Huber? Yes. Councilmember Morgan? Yes. Councilmember Orry? No. Councilmember Reynolds? Yes. Councilmember Stone? Nay. Vice Mayor Brown? Aye. Mayor Schwab? Aye. Carries 5-2. Okay. So is council good with the rest of the agenda? Well, I'm sorry, but I didn't get a note. How important, how time sensitive is 5.6? The reason I'm asking is it's the airport commission recommendation to the lease policy, number one. Number two, it's the last item on the agenda anyway. Yeah. We can kind of vote to move it, or we can wait until 10 o'clock and find out we're not going to do it anyway. Yeah. It's not preeminently important other than the fact that it's been ready for a while, and we're just trying to get it on there. But if council desires to push it, no harm, no foul. We're just trying to get it done. It'll come back on a future agenda. So. Well, I would move that we delay that one then. Second. Any discussion? No. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. So can we have a vote on continuing item 5.6 to the following meeting? Councilmember Huber? Yes. Councilmember Morgan? Yes. Councilmember Orry? No. Councilmember Reynolds? Yes. Councilmember Stone? Nay. Vice Mayor Brown? Aye. Mayor Schwab? Aye. Carries 5-2. Mayor, if I could just ask. I know that we're starting to push these to the next meeting, which is the third, and we're trying to keep that agenda light. So just a heads up there. So just. I thought it said a future meeting. I didn't. A future meeting? Okay. For me, if that was the intention of council. Okay. I think our intention was still to try to have next week's, or two weeks. Okay. Yes. As quick as possible. Okay. So public participation. This meeting is conducted in accordance with the executive order in 2920. Attendance to the meeting. The public may attend the meeting in person at 421 Main Street. Speakers must sign up to speak by checking in at one of the speaker card tables located inside city hall. All speakers will be given instructions to queue in the speaker line. Please follow instructions accordingly. A notation that everyone coming into the chambers needs to be wearing a mask that covers both, or a face covering that covers both the nose and the mouth. Remote public participation during the meeting. The public may view the meeting on Comcast Channel 11, or on the city's website with remote public participation allowed in the following ways. The Engaged Chico Civic Engagement program will be available for citizen input on individual agenda items prior to the meeting. And that program can be accessed through the city's website at the link listed at chico-ca.granicasideas.com slash meetings. Engaged. comments will be closed at 4.30. Public comment will also be accepted by email with the subject line public comment item and then you fill in the blank and can be sent to public comments at chicoca.gov during the meeting prior to the close of the public comment on an item. The public is encouraged not to send more than one email per item and not to comment on numerous items in one email. We'll begin with the consent agenda. The consent agenda is for items that are routine in nature and can be enacted in one motion. Let's start with public comments. Did we receive any comments through the engaged Chico? I do not believe we did not receive any on consent from engaged. We did not. We have not yet received any via the public comments through the email but we do have two speakers. It would be Tom DiGiovanni and Patrick Newman who are here in person. Okay. Okay. So I'll have the public come in. Tom, please join us. Thank you, Council. Members and Mayor. I'm simply here to express my appreciation for the item 2.4 regarding the general benefit quotient for the PBID in downtown. As you know, the PBID has done a lot of work over the last almost three years, 10,000, 12,000 hours a year of service to the downtown. And since this is on the agenda, I'm going to be able to address it. So thank you to the committee for your input to address the questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão questão other than to possibly provide surplus land that's truly surplus at this point, given the housing crisis and the fact that we desperately need camping places for tiny house villages, etc. I don't know that we have surplus land. So a dozen or so people have asked me, like, what's the deal with BMX? You know, $600,000, this ongoing relationship with it, and I understand that there's these financial incentives, but on that basis you could justify doing a hockey rink or, I don't know, you could expand Horseshoe Lake and have boat races. I mean, you could do all kinds of things with city participation, none of which would really make any sense. But you're talking about a recreational pursuit. You're talking about a recreational pursuit against people's lives who need to get out of the rain, and it makes no sense to prioritize one over the other. Also, we keep talking about our carbon footprint, and I noticed the sketch of the income that's supposedly going to be generated for the city because of this program. Has anybody done a back-of-the-envelope calculation on the carbon footprint, or the footprint of a program like that? Talking about people driving from all over the state or country or wherever they come from to participate in this thing. We're talking about hundreds of thousands of pounds, you know, or tons of CO2, just to do that one thing. And ironically, this is about bikes, which in my childhood, in my experience, going back, you know, to even the first Earth Day or whatever, were always a symbol of, you know, a kind of activity that doesn't involve producing greenhouse gases. So the whole thing makes no sense. I think the city ought to back out of it. Thanks a lot. Thank you. Are there any council disqualifications or no votes? I need to make note that I need to, I'm disqualified from item 2.4 because I have a leasehold. I'm disqualified from the leasehold in the downtown area. Anybody like any items pulled from the consent agenda? So I'm looking, I'll entertain a motion to approve the consent agenda. Is there a second? A second. Mr. Jarrod, since I pay into the PBID, was it probably error on the side of safety just that I don't, I recuse myself from that as well? That would be appropriate, yes. So noted that. So noted. So there is a motion from Councilmember Huber and a second from Councilmember Reynolds to approve the consent agenda with the notation of the two disqualifications on 2.4. Correct. Okay, Councilmember Huber? Yes. Councilmember Morgan? Yes. Councilmember Orry? Aye. Councilmember Reynolds? Aye. Councilmember Stone? Aye. Vice Mayor Brown? Aye. Mayor Schwab? Aye. Carries 7-0. Move to item 3, business from the floor. Members of the public may address the Council at this time on any matter not already listed on the agenda with comments being limited to three minutes or as determined by the Mayor based on the number of speakers. The Council cannot take any action at this meeting on which the press may introduce section of the agenda. Did we receive any comments on the, on the Engage Chico platform? We did. We received four comments on Engage Chico. We have not received any public comments via email. And then I believe we have eight speakers in person. Okay. So there's eight speakers. Each one will be allowed to speak for three minutes. If you can get them queued up as we review. The comments that were sent in and Engage Chico. Okay. So the first few speakers for business from the floor will be Rob Berry followed by George Deeds, Damon Fidel, Cami Smith, Rhonda Magnuson, Patrick Newman, and Sasha Sarnoff. Followed by Ruth Sarnoff as well. And the comments received from Engage Chico were from Jamie Damon, Susan Smead, Jackie Smith, and Jessica McKenzie. Now if I had enough time to review the comments. Let's bring in our first speaker then. Okay. Rob Berry followed by George Deeds. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Good evening. Last meeting I spoke on every item for which I could think of anything to say. I won't be doing that tonight. I have been addressing this council now for two years. And I don't think tonight is the magic night when you will actually take notice of anything I say. So I'll soon be retiring to my own comfortable chair. and watching the proceedings from home. I'll be taking notes. The sound is better, and I can actually follow your moves. As you know, even the camera doesn't catch everything. This is the last meeting before Election Day. Not much can actually happen between now and then, but that won't stop you from trying. Go ahead. When we next meet on election night, your fates will be settled, though we may not know the details until later. Nothing personal, but at least three of you may not be back. That's good. I think you have enjoyed this COVID fiasco a little bit too much. There is no longer any reason to keep the public from the chambers. You are now entitled to free speech. You can fill the chambers to 50% capacity. Why don't you? I think we know. So you enjoy your evening. I will. Thank you. George Deeds, followed by Damon Fidel, and then Cammie Smith. Hello, councillors. I couldn't run out of here fast enough. Last time I was here. But, you know, I'm on the streets. My thing is, you know, I go out there because I think everybody should go to the parks. Because they can help. You know, there's this running narrative in this town. All I have to do is wear my hair down and try to catch a bus. And I have to hear about the house list and what scum they are. And it's just running narrative, you know. Meanwhile, I'm out on the streets because, you know, I've got to eat. I do stuff. I love playing my guitar. So I'm out here. And a few times, you know, I've started to deal with the women out here. You know, and, you know, I can only do what I can. But, you know, they're messed up. You know, and, you know, thanks to so many people working on the laws these last 10, 12 years, as long as it's been, and everybody getting that done, you know, this community getting together and saying, hey, let's get this done. Everybody called Sarah Nielsen. That was great. It's a good start. But here I was watching, you know, encountering this one woman. And don't even want to get into details. Another one, don't want to get into details. And then another one over here in the park. When it's shut down. And so each time, you know, you're calling dispatch. And the last time I called, they got this roped off. The woman's taking off her clothes, putting them back on. I don't want my mom. I don't want that to be my mom. So I called dispatch. He tells me this. I don't even know completely what dispatch says anymore. You know, he says that the district attorney says it's okay to bury the press. Okay, I don't know if he's lying or not. I mean, this is Chico. But like I said, I wouldn't want that to be my mom. And then she ends up walking down Main Street, shuffling, because she's messed up. Okay, I get it. So anyway, I end up watching the news. And there's an account over in Nevada County that started another program. That's where the Lord's Law started. So they started this thing with the sheriff's therapist thing. I've been busy, like I said. I'm going home to help my parents. Going through college and working, getting all kinds of stuff. I caught it. I said, well, you know what? I'll see. And I'll shoot a line of the board of supervisors. And then they shoot Steven. Oh, my God. I don't even know what to say. Nobody does. Man. Man. I was here when I first started doing this stuff. I was here right alongside. We heard all this stuff. Heck, I bought a shirt. Look how faded it is. So there is solutions. You know, I don't know this big thing about San Francisco and all that. But Chico, right now, needs help. You know, if we can get dispatch, whatever the heck they're doing over there, to get dispatch to do something, well, maybe we can beat it. Maybe we cannot have somebody shot. Maybe it won't be somebody I know, like I knew this kid. You know, because that's what happens. I play and I clap a lot. I catch him. And that's good. But it gives him a little bit of comfort. You know? So I shot Bill. I shot the board of supervisors' email. I think the day before I shot it to you. And Bill said he'll look into it. I don't know how much I want to get into it, really, because I'm still running from the last time. But seriously, I think we're all on the same page about this. Let's just get something done. And thank you for all the work you guys have been doing. Thank you. Damon Fidel, followed by Cammie Smith. And then Rhonda Magnuson. Hi. Good evening. First of all, I just wanted to thank all of you for public service, for what you do, whether it's liberal, Republican, Democrat. You guys all truly believe that you want what's best for the city of Chico. And I appreciate everything that you guys are doing up here. Whether I agree with it or not. So a little bit about myself. I grew up here in Chico. I'm an Army veteran. I'm a father of three. Local businessman. I coached a little league. I was chair of the board. A local charter school. So I feel like I'm invested in Chico, definitely. Often when I'm engaged with youth in this town, I'm not a local. I'm not a local. I preach things like duty, civic responsibilities, accountability, respect, empathy, hard work. All those good things that we want our children to learn. Correct? And I find as I drive around town, often these messages that I'm trying to convey are being undermined by the state of our town. So it's difficult for me to be preaching these messages when folks can look around and see that, hey, these things don't apply to everybody. That there's some free passes around here. Another message I always like to preach is if you have a problem, that's your problem. And you need to go out and solve your own problems. You can't rely on other people to solve problems for you. Well, I have a problem. And I have a problem with the failed policies, whether intended or not, over the last several years, directly relating to the homeless issue in Chico. Now, I understand being a leader isn't always easy. Sometimes we have to make decisions that aren't always going to be making people happy. Some people are going to be arrested, and they're going to be sad. They're going to have bad days. Being homeless is not a crime. I totally agree. I totally agree with that. But stealing bikes is a crime. Urinating in the park is a crime. Doing illegal drugs are crimes. And if I think we can just focus on those issues alone and uphold the current laws, then I believe a lot of these problems will go away. I don't envy your guys' position. This is not something you've wanted, and this is a problem that you have to solve. This is a problem that you have to deal with. And I wish you all the luck in your efforts to do so. Thank you. Thank you. Cammie Smith, followed by Rhonda Magnuson, and then Patrick Newman. Hi. Hopefully you can hear me. This is my first time ever speaking at a city council meeting, so I appreciate you guys listening to me, and my glasses are going to fog up, and I'm going to be able to read anything. I am. I am thankful for you guys too for the job you guys do. I know it can be thankless at times. I volunteer, and I've been on committees and councils, and I know what it's like to make tough decisions and have to deal with people who don't always agree with what you guys are doing. And that's why I'm here, because I've been sitting at home, watching and following the city council meetings, and I feel like if I'm going to complain, I've got to actually come and complain to you in person instead of just at my TV. Or at the newspaper. A little background about me. I'm a mother of two. I grew up in Chico. Also, I graduated Chico State. I'm a teacher in town, and I'm here tonight because I am concerned about the homeless situation. I volunteered at the Toro Shelter, so I've dealt with the population up front. My son works at a local grocery store. He's had to deal with, or, theft continuously. I've been there and watched homeless walk in and just walk out, they can't do anything about it. And it's scary to be in town and know that these things are happening. So, I don't know what my time is. You guys didn't even start the time. Gosh. I've got all the time. You guys have been here all night. I'm sorry. I probably only have like a minute left. Anyways, so what I'm concerned about is kind of what I'm concerned about is kind of what my friend just explained to is that this accountability for the homeless. I just feel like why is it our responsibility as city members to take care of them all the time? I know when I get panhandlers coming to me, I'll say, the Toro Shelter has food. I make food for them. Why don't you go eat there? And they'll yell at me or curse and say they have rules, and there's no way they would go there. And it is discouraging that we're creating all of these beds and places for them. And it just, this doesn't seem to be working. We're just creating more and more. And it's just the population just seems to be growing because we're bringing them food. And it's not really solving the problem. So I would like more accountability. I think I agree with the who just spoke. children. I wouldn't let them be homeless. So thank you. Rhonda Magnuson, followed by Patrick Newman, and then excuse me, Sasha Sarnoff. Hello, all. Thank you for letting me speak to you again. I just kind of wanted to address on that. Once again, I have told you repeatedly and repeatedly, your problem is not the homeless. Your problem is the services for the homeless. Yesterday, I turned 52. Fifteen minutes after I woke up, I was in a cop car. Why? Just to put everything out to the door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door to where I was legally camped. She threatens me, tells me I got 15 minutes to vacate. I try to explain to her, and as she knows, I am still very ill. I can't run. I can't go that two blocks, wherever it is that you want me to go. Besides that, I am kind of a safety net with the homeless in the area that I am in. And they take care of me. They keep me fed. They keep me clothed. They keep a hand of safety upon me. And these are the people that you say need to be held accountable. For the last two and a half solid years, I have been banned from every service in this city, and down in Oroville as well, Butte County. Because, number one, a person in the community cannot, cannot call down the road to anybody and tell them, hey, look, this person is a homeless. I don't want to see them. That does for me, it puts me in jail. Okay? And then, they are allowed to take my basic needs. Does anybody know what my basic needs are? Food, water, shelter. You know who gives that to me out here? Me. I am homeless. The ones that you are condemning. If you had the proper services, instead of paying them to chase people down the road $60,000 a year, pay them to provide that service. Can you please put your mask up? Oh, I'm sorry. And stay behind the plexiglass. These are services that are donated. They are funded. They are for the homeless. With the homeless. Not with somebody's pockets. There is no getting any clothes. Yesterday, I was trying to defend a 77-year-old man in a wheelchair. Thank you very much. Thank you. So, think. You know, it's better than anything. Before you leap and think before you speak. Patrick Newman, followed by Sasha Sarnoff. Thank you. And then Ruth Sarnoff. I wish that some of the speakers could understand that since the beginning of the Reagan era, we've embarked on a 40-year failure to address the needs of the poorest people. And many, many, many of those are disabled. And many, many, many of those have either brain injuries or mental illnesses. And we've dumped them on our streets. And that's the place to begin the discussion, not with demonizing people who are out there. And this goes on here all the time. This latest shooting is a type of violence that gets a lot of attention. I always, when I talk to Scott Rushing and other people about this, what always comes to mind for me is that the violence of homelessness is constant. And continuous. And the way that we impact the unsheltered homeless on the streets involves a kind of violence that's also continuous. And Scott would say, well, no one's died in the last, you know, since his son, since July of 2017 when his son shot. That's not really quite true. We've killed a lot of people since then. It happens all the time. It happens every couple of weeks. So, you know, homeless people die 20 years younger than the rest of us. What I wanted to do in one minute and 32 seconds is to just say quickly that this is the end of the first two years of the Liberal Council. And however it's happened, for the record, we have a street crimes unit we didn't have before and don't need. SIT-Y is still in place. Which is a symbolic law. Basically just a stick it to the homeless law. Meaningless, essentially. Criminalization in all its glory is still in place. Every aspect of it. And this is from 2019. The arrest law. 400 arrests. Mostly petty violations. Our soup kitchen is closing. This will lead to more destitution on the streets and more deprivation on the streets. So simple things like food and clothing will be harder for the unsheltered homeless to get. This happened in the last two years. So at least the continuation of it. On the plus side, we've got six portable toilets before COVID started. Now we have more, of course. But that was done with a lot of controversy, a lot of resistance, and a lot of foot dragging. So it wasn't exactly a credit to our community. But I think we can celebrate that one thing. We have more liberalized right to rest laws right now. Those were pushed by COVID. They weren't really liberalized. They were liberalized on behalf of the homeless. And they created a lot of community opposition. So the report card isn't very good. Anyway, I'm out of time. Sasha Sarnoff, followed by Ruth Sarnoff, and then Larry Halstead. Sasha will be joining us. My microphone is off. Okay. Okay. Have a good morning, everyone. Wow, it's bigger. So I'm here today. Okay. Science. I'm here because I'm worried about science not getting through to the people. We have a big problem when science is not followed. And when science is not followed by our public health officials and by the city itself. I sent an email to the city. It said, in response to resolution 720, declaration of local emergency, adopted March 25, 2020, the false, I have a huge rebound here going. This is terrible. I came out here. I've got a rebound that's just terrible. What are we going to do about this? She needs to move out of. I have a huge rebound effect. That's terrible. that the tests cannot provide a confirmation of infection or past infection. Consumers and others are not aware of this. Let me repeat. PCR test product inserts, those are the swab tests you get up your nose, nasal swab tests, cannot determine infection. And yet that's what we're using in Butte County to tell people how many cases we have of infected people. This is unconscionable. It's not scientific. And it's a lie. And the fact that you have people taking these tests who believe that that test is meaningful and accurate is very reckless. And I've said this to the city before. I said this information. And I've heard nobody speak about it. I've heard no mention in the paper. I've heard nothing. Butte County Public Health continues to promote this fake testing as a guidance of where we are in the tier when they know full well themselves that the PCR test cannot detect infection. Why are they using this? It's a scam. And it's a scandal. Please read the documents I left for you. Every one of you got a copy of it. Thank you. Ruth Sarnoff, followed by Larry Halstead. Okay. Okay. I'm reading this today because I want what I'm reading to be in the public record. And I want to be available for people in the community. I think she stepped away to get her glasses. Okay. I think she stepped away to get her glasses. Today, cities don't own fire trucks, ambulances, or hospitals. Global giants own them. These global giants also control our national parks and pollute them. Essential businesses, as described in documents in California, hazardous waste sites in reuse, have received billions, millions in revenue dollars for their polluting businesses. Congress has been pre-funding through acts of Congress, such as the Farm Bill, for decades. Even an activity on these sites has continued all the way through the shutdown. Now thousands in Chico and other cities and towns in northern California, are in dire need. Drinking water, shelter, and survival necessities are not being met. Chico had sweltering heat for 33 days this year that were over 100 degrees Fahrenheit. And that's as the end of August. Thank you, Mrs. Sarnoff. I would like to finish with one last thing. One sentence. One sentence. Thank you. I want to show my support to the work of the Tiny Houses Project of CHAT. Thank you. And for a five-year use of use lease with an option to renew. And also, Thank you. I think that's enough. It would help with extreme heat, cold, and rain. Thank you. And for people. Thank you. Okay, our last speaker is Larry Halstead. Good evening, Madam Mayor, City Council, staff, and the good people of Chico. This will be my second time coming down here, and last time I came down to introduce myself and didn't get a chance to address the other items on the agenda that were very near and dear to me. I'd use this time to introduce myself, and I don't want to go into everything I did before, but there's certain groundwork that I want to lay so my comments later on have some more meaning to you. Starting with the fact that my educational background is as a political scientist. I'm a lifelong activist. I'm also someone who lost their house in the Paradise Valley. I lost my wife's campfire. We have a family of seven. It was a heroic thing. We lost a vehicle, lost animals. And what I'm, as a lifelong activist, I've been a delegate to our Democratic State Party for 20 years or something of the Democratic clubs. And I mention all that because when the fire happened and PG&E did this absolutely atrocious thing that they're absolutely getting away with, it compelled me to want to start my own project on homelessness, especially as it related to PG&E, but homelessness in general. Because of my background in the Democratic Party, I've had the privilege of being able to get to know our governor a little bit, had some personal conversations with him. It turns out we're related through my sister-in-law. But, you know, the issue of the homelessness and police brutality, that's something that's been sitting around for quite some time, and that's something that's been sitting around for quite some time, and that's something that's been sitting around for quite some time, and that's something that's been sitting around for quite some time, and that's something that's been sitting around for quite some time, and that's something that's been sitting around for quite some time, and that's something that's been sitting around for quite some time, and that's something that's been sitting around for quite some time, and that's something that's been sitting around for quite some time, and that's something that's been sitting around for quite some time, our elected officials. And when you're down here, you should be addressed as such and shown the respect you deserve. But what I brought up to our mayor down at the farmer's market is that it's the wrong voices that will be listening to. The people that are coming down here and yelling and screaming about you doing something on the homeless, they don't understand city budgets and what funds come from where. They don't understand actually anything about the homeless. They don't understand their needs. They don't understand their challenges. And what they're calling for is simply one thing and one thing alone, law and order. And I'll remind you that these voices have always been on the wrong side of history, starting all the way back to the Civil War and all the civil rights battles. These are the ones that are always yelling and screaming. So I do appreciate the opportunity to come down here, and I appreciate you guys' time. Thank you. Thank you. That is all that we have. Okay. I did get... A message from someone saying they had sent us an email, Lisa Currier. And in looking at my email, I see that she did submit one. She did not put the title or the item that she wanted to address, but please make notation that Lisa Currier did. I did in my notes, and I didn't know which one she was wanting to speak on, so... Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. So we will move to our regular agenda. Item 5.1 is consideration of housing ad hoc committee report and recommendation. And Mr. Stone, you're going to be making the report. It was my thought when I looked at this that we would do an overview and give direction to staff on which items we may want to prioritize, because... I'm okay with that. I'm okay with that. The Housing Committee itself was a collaborative group, so this is certainly something that I would encourage my colleagues to open up and comment as we go through it. But fine, if you want to go through an overview, how do you want me to address it? The report is yours. Okay. I was just trying to frame our conversation and clarify that with my understanding, that we would look at these items and prioritize the items that we wanted to have staff bring back. Okay. Okay. Well, thank you very much, and good evening. It's a long time coming. The three of us, Councilmember Huber, Councilmember Orrie, and myself served on the ad hoc housing committee. We did a number of things, including meeting with developers and affordable housing groups and advocacy groups, as well as having some public hearings to receive feedback from the public about what you're doing. And we did a number of things, including meeting with the Council to discuss what should be done about housing, and we came up with some recommendations for Council to provide to staff for further review. This is actually Councilmember Orrie wrote this report. I would like to defer to him unless he wants to yield back. Thank you. I think that we shouldn't look at it as a! I think that we should focus on the, I think the overall conclusion of this study, this report, these meetings, is that we have a current pipeline of housing that at a historic level of development will meet our needs over the next ten years. This is housing that's in our general plan, and even more importantly, these are housing applications and projects that are in front of our public works and planning. Chico is going, is doing some amazing things. Our developers, our individual homeowners, and I think one of the conclusions we came to is that we need to be a little skeptical about the special planning areas. That we need to be very conscious of what this will look like. When there's some 6,000 units are built, how many of them will be affordable to people that live in Chico today? I will be making a recommendation separate from this report from comments from Councilmembers and requests for agendizing that we at the next meeting take a hard look at our special planning areas to see whether or not these are just speculative plans. I think that the projects that will lead to greater inequities in our housing market. So having said that, I think that most of the recommendations in this report, some of them have already been, I mean it took a year to get here, some of these things have already been accomplished. Brendan will recognize that it was his draft of the I think that this report was written on, edited, and all edits are my responsibility and my apologies. But things like the funding for Bruce Road, the SB2 monies that are being used to streamline further ADUs, the focus on the North Valley and the wedge and Park Avenue opportunity sites. These are all moving forward. I think that's a great point. And so I think that what we're doing by adopting this report is giving our stamp to this blueprint that will continue to develop units. And now we need to look at how we can tweak it in such a way that we make affordability the primary goal of our housing policy. And just, Randall, if I could. Finally, we are. In the midst of, or we're beginning a housing element upgrade and we're looking at accelerating the revision of our general plan because we are now at a level of occupancy of population that we were anticipating several years from now. So I would also hope that as we go forward with this housing policy. I think that we will be able to do that. Go ahead, Randall. Go ahead, Randall. Go ahead, Randall. Go ahead, Randall. Go ahead, Randall. Go ahead, Randall. Go ahead, Randall. Go ahead, Randall. Go ahead, Randall. Go ahead, Randall. Go ahead, Randall. Go ahead, Randall. Go ahead, Randall. Go ahead, Randall. Go ahead, Randall. Go ahead, Randall. Go ahead, Randall. Go ahead, Randall. Go ahead, Randall. Go ahead, Randall. Would you like to add anything as a member of the committee? I think conditions have changed as has been mentioned. We started on this over a year ago and the meetings and conversations took place over a year and I think things have changed considerably within that time. At that time we were considering that there was a severe housing shortage in general and I think that we've seen with the number of permits and projects that have been taken out in the last year that's not so much the issue as much as affordable housing is the issue. I think really what we're... What we need to be laser focused on is with all of this growth that we now have in the pipeline assuring that we do have housing that is not only affordable for very low and low income people but affordable just for you and me. Because frankly I couldn't afford to live here at this point if I was starting out here. So I think that's the takeaway for me. I've been here for four decades. A couple of those decades the growth was what I would call at sort of a tolerable pace but there have been decades where Chico has grown really, really fast. I don't necessarily think that that's what people who live here are going to be able to live in Chico now want is a Chico that's just booming, that's just growing by leaps and bounds. I think they want growth that's controlled and sustainable and part of that is making sure that it's affordable. So that's my addition. Thank you. Thank you Council Member Ory for drafting this report as well in conjunction with staff. What the key points... I share that. I share that with my colleagues is that this is an affordable housing crisis. Our community and our housing directors have reported on the number of market rate and the number of affordable units that we need. So we're aware of this need every single year. What's different in this case was these were the items that we know could be actionable that we assessed and sussed out with community members. Now there wasn't consensus necessarily on all of these items nor was it a priority for us to peg down. So we achieved to put these together to address these needs to address these needs to address these needs to address these needs to address these needs to address these needs to address these needs to address these needs to address these needs to address these needs to address these needs to address these needs to address these needs to address these needs to address these needs to address these needs to address these needs to address these needs to address these needs to address these needs to address these needs to address these needs to address these needs to address these needs to address these needs to address these needs to address these needs to address these needs to address these needs to address these needs to address these needs to address these needs to address these needs to address these needs to address these needs to address these needs to address these needs to address these needs to address these needs to address these needs live outside of the area and commute in and neither one of those are tolerable events for our community it strains all of our infrastructure and makes it more costly to live and work in this community so we had discussed nine items the first nine items and then met again I have no sense of time anymore but it feels like October of last year maybe November of last year anyway and discussed inclusionary zoning and adding that recommendation we did have the the support of the committee to to move that item forward so in terms of priority again I don't think we have to go down these item by item Mayor Schwab but but the one that certainly on the top of my list is inclusionary zoning and having staff come back with a report that identifies how we might implement that and where it might be most effective and as a tool and I I really don't want to go down the road especially with this tight an agenda we have of explaining inclusionary zoning and and for the folks at home there's a there's a lot of research that that has been done by this council already there is a presentation and in your agenda packet that details what inclusionary zoning does and doesn't some highlights that there's no evidence that it increases the cost of market rate housing which is one of the primary primary um objections to uh to inclusionary zoning so I don't know whether this is the way that you envision this whether we want to prioritize these items or bring them forward the these 10 items were the recommendations of the of the housing committee I think perhaps what I'll do is open it up to other council members for questions open it up from members of the public and then we can give some general guidance perfect staff vice mayor brown yes thank you and thank you for the report I'm excited to see this come forward as I know all of you probably are as well by this point um there's a this feels really loud um there's an item on here that I didn't see and I had a quick question for the housing committee did you engage with the north valley northern valley housing trust in this process and can you speak to that a little bit did you engage with the northern north valley housing trust in this process and can you speak to that a little bit yes lauren kennedy was uh present at uh several of our housing committee meetings and provided input specifically I'm not I'm not sure that I can I'm recalling at this point it was a year ago but um over a year ago and she was also involved to an extent in the housing forum that we put on okay great um you know I noticed on um item eight direct staff to further assess ways to encourage community land trust as an affordable development model and identify any barriers I think that's great I also think that um I think that um I think that um I think that um I think that um I think that um I think that's great I also think that um I think that um I think that um I think that um I think that's great that's great that's great that's great that's great that's great that's great that's great that's great that's great that's great that's great that's great that's great that's great that's great that's great that's great that's great that's great that's great that's great that's great that's great that's great that's great that's great that's great that's great that's great that's great that's great that's great that's great that's great that's great that's great that's great that's great that's great this process and that we have that conversation because it literally is a funding mechanism that has matching dollars from from the state to fund affordable housing projects and that happens from a small scale all the way to a large scale and I think my understanding is that the investment on the part of the region has been very minimal and I would love to see the city of Chico step up and really look at how we can be a model for others in our region and hopefully encourage that participation as well. The city of Chico has a pretty strong tie to the North Valley Housing Trust beyond just that that administration. Their executive director, the original founding executive director, was the housing director for the city of Chico up until 2012 so we've worked very closely. This specific committee engaged in in the ways that I mentioned before but yeah there's a close tie to that organization. The one thing I just want to add is connected to the to the land trust. I know that there's already kind of research extensive research being done and a look at funding mechanisms on the part of the North Valley Housing Trust and other members of the community and so if we do direct staff to engage in this which I would I would love I would hope that they'd be included in that conversation and that their kind of work up until this point be be a part of that process. Okay other comments? I think we're all aware that of the the success so far of the low income housing tax credits that we were especially awarded in this county as a result of the campfire the if I remember right there's five projects that are going forward? Seven. Seven? Seven. In addition to the two that are already in the works. Which is quite amazing that's with the path with no redevelopment money this is the most bestest of news I've ever seen in my life. With the With the With the With the With the With the With the With the With the With the With the With the With the With the With the With the With the With the With the With the With the With the With the With the With the With the With the With the coming. And I've asked the question, and it's in the report, of whether or not we can use those DR funds for such things as incentivizing inclusionary zoning. It's the one piece that's really missing, is that we need a strong incentive for developers to write down the cost of their housing projects. And so part of the recommendation is we get more feedback on future funding streams, such as CDBGDR. So let's move to the public comment. Did we receive any comments on Engaged Chico? Yes, we received four comments on Engaged. And we received two public comments via email, as well as there was one that just dropped into the mailbox from Nicole Nava for business from the floor. I just bring that up so that they at least know that they did drop in. How many speakers do we have? We have one. We have one. OK. So would you please read the names of the people who submitted comments? We'll read those. And when we're finished, we'll bring in the one person who can speak for three minutes. OK, so the comments on Engaged were received from Angela McLaughlin, Susan Smead, Rob Berry, and Kate Lydon. The public comments were received from Grace Marvin and Nicole Nava. And then our speaker who should get queued up would be Larry Halstead. I do not see the Nicole Nava email. She's in the public comments. I would add, Ms. Presson, that Jackie Smith commented in the Engaged Chico on this item. Thank you. I missed that. OK. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Has everyone had an opportunity to read the comments? So let's hear from our in-person speaker. OK. Larry Halstead. Good evening again. The housing issue is deeply linked to the, of course, homeless issue. And here in this city, with what happened with the Camp Fire, a burden was put on this council and the city, the likes of which no city has ever really had to deal with. On the housing, though, I really think that even though the haters want to come and yell at the, quote, liberal council and all that, y'all are missing the boat in terms of the tiny house thing. And I'm well aware, even though I'm somewhat new to the city, about the battle over simplicity. The city village, and how someone with money can shut down a good project that's desperately needed. But I would say to the haters, as well as to the city council, and the planners, and the people on this committee, you need to go back and set aside your hatred towards our governor, if you have it, but go back and listen to his State of the State speech. I believe it was last February. I not only watched it a bunch of times, I've taken the transcript and read it many times, and 80% of that was about the homeless situation. And what I don't see being addressed here is the fact, and it's as strong as he could have put it, he said, I'm giving the cities and the counties a very limited time to come up with proposals. And if they don't do it, I'm going to move forward. Now, he also listed a bunch of different communities, like Clovis, and gave them praise. Has this committee gone out and seen what they're doing in Clovis? Let me tell you real quick. They came up with four plans for tiny homes. Can you stick to your mask? Yeah, I keep slipping. I'm sorry. I know. If you use any one of these four plans, you don't have to have to pay for the permits, the planning review, all the rest. They can say 10,000 or more. You know, there's cities and counties that are creating these little tiny villages in the city to immediately take people homeless off and put them there while they get services. And some of those have little clinics next to them. There's communities. You know, you're talking about zoning and exclusionary zoning. And I don't know a lot about it, but I do know a little. And what I'm saying is that you have a ripe opportunity, not only from funding that comes from the campfire to deal with this problem, but you have opportunity from a governor who has made this his number one issue. And I really urge you to go back and read those mandates, set aside your prejudices against the governor, and realize he's serious about it. And I think we're missing the boat on the small houses here. We're bouncing it around. We're not letting it go through, you know. It's time that you get back to the tiny house village and create zones that will allow it everywhere. Thank you. Thank you. Close the public hearing. And looking for just some general direction to staff. Well, there's some interesting comments from Mr. Halstead. I think that the governor was excited and has been for at least the last couple of years about addressing housing and homelessness, and he's appropriated $1.7 billion with a B statewide towards housing, specifically subsidized housing, some supportive services housing. However, that only seems to be holding for just this budget cycle. And that's the problem is that there isn't another funding mechanism. SB 5.0. SB 5.0. Whatever it is now. SB 785 or 735 proposes to fix some of those things. But we have a responsibility locally to encourage developments, even if that's mandatory, to build housing that's affordable. And I think that the revenue is there. I think the $1.7 billion that he's spending in this budget cycle is appropriate. And I think that will continue. But there's no pledge to do so. So some of the things that we're doing, some of the things that I'd like to see the council or the city look at are EFIDs that will help finance the same way that redevelopment agencies did to finance specific things with support from the tax entities to fund things like affordable housing so that we have that base. Right now we have the $1.7 billion. We seem to be getting lots of revenue from the state for subsidized housing. I think that encourages inclusionary zoning to be funded at least in the short term. But I'd also like staff to review along with that, an inclusionary zoning ordinance, the potential to permanently fund it through EFIDs. Other comments? Casey has one. I just want to make a couple of comments on 10 inclusionary zoning. I do not agree that it is a foregone conclusion that that is the best thing for our community. We have a letter from the ad hoc committee, or, I don't know, I don't know. I think it was a letter that came into email that is not in here saying they had over 20 citizens show up opposing. I think if you talk to some of the builders, we all had a builder day where we had that amazing lady from the state of California come down. And there was a presentation made that day talking about inclusionary zoning and how it is not the end, I'll say also. Just putting it out on the record that I don't necessarily agree with that. I do agree that we've made some great strides with one through nine and excited that we have 6,000 things coming on. We have a 20, 30, we've already planned for a reason. There was millions of dollars and a lot of people and a lot of thought put into that plan. So I'm not on the bandwagon to go change something that people that have a lot more education and stuff like that than us and time put into a plan to have us overturn anything like that. So that's just my two cents. Mr. Orry. I would move that we accept the recommendations of the committee. And if that is on the floor, I would like to also address inclusionary zoning. Go ahead. Is there a second? Sorry, a second, yes. Thanks, Carl. I just want to point out that what we're recommending here is the bare skeleton of inclusionary zoning policy. It'll come back and we'll have to see if we can get a lot more discussion and I think an effort to try to make it work. What we need to recognize right off the bat is that much of the housing that's currently in the pipeline would be exempted from any inclusionary zoning rule in my mind. I've asked for more legal guidance on this, but this is just based on somebody who spent a career in development. You know, you get certain rights and you don't have to go back and change those conditions. So we're really looking at a policy that will be the second 6,000 units. We're talking about a policy that may or may not be appropriate in 10 years from now as new projects are in front of us or over the next couple years where this project's in front of us that won't be developed for another 10 years or longer. And I do have hope that we can, I think, find incentives. So I would think that our first inclusionary zoning proposals would be not quite voluntary. We would put the incentives in place knowing that they're probably not strong enough to really change the current market-based strategies for development and instead would be looked at by developers and probably right now very few would on a voluntary basis. But we need that basis there. We need to walk through. I think. Everything we can, greater density, accelerating development standards, whatever we can to encourage more of the segment or part of their development plans to be more affordable. But I think we still have a chance to find subsidy. Whether it's another look at our development impact fee schedule, whether it's looking at CDBGDR, whether it's, looking at other revenue that the city has that we're talking about tonight, spending two, $3 million on housing. That as we go forward that we find ways to incentivize it. And that's all we're doing. There's nothing here today in front of you that says we shall have 10% very low income, you know, segments set aside in every future development. That's, that's, doesn't exist. So, I think that's, I think that's, I think that's, I think that's the key to this. And I don't know how we get there. I hear that the Chamber recently had a proposal on inclusionary zoning at one of their meetings. Why would you have a proposal, a presentation in front of our business community without asking city to be part of that presentation? You know, so I don't know how we get past that disconnect. But I think this is a beginning point tonight is that we bring it to the Planning Commission. We bring it to the staff. We get this. We get this skeleton of an inclusionary zoning proposal in front of us. And then we start talking about what teeth can be put in that proposal. And that's not going to happen. It's a long conversation, but it's a conversation we desperately need. Right. I agree with you there. I think there's a lot of different ways that we could have inclusionary zoning. It's not just one model. There are a lot of different ways that we can look at that, including the housing trust. In our conversation, we're going to have a lot of conversations, and I'm glad you brought up the development impact fees. When we look at houses that take smaller footprints, and the people that are living there are using smaller footprints because they're on transportation routes. They're walkable. So, but as we look at our housing element plan, it's updated every five years. It's a good place for these to be brought forward. Okay. So other comments? Yes. Yeah, I think, oh. So, yeah, I think we looked at inclusionary zoning with a very open mind to how can it be made to work? How can it be, you know, it's nothing, it's not something that we wanted to force down somebody's throat. It's something that we wanted to consider to see how, are there ways to make this work, and to address, I guess, Councillor Reynolds' concerns about various reports. You know, we see a lot of things in these council meetings where we have facts on one side, and we have facts on the other side, and we have to decide which facts we want to believe. I will say that in considering all the various presentations on inclusionary zoning, just about everything that I looked at that said inclusionary zoning is no good had been sponsored by builders groups. And the things that I saw that said inclusionary zoning can be good were for advocates for housing people. And to me, that was impactful. Mr. Martin? Mr. Martin? So I appreciate the work of the committee, and it was a lot of work. And at least two of you have far more experience with any kind of housing than I have at all. So I appreciate that. The reason I can't support the motion gets down to number 10. And Mr. Horry kind of pointed it out. It doesn't really do anything. It's kind of, you didn't use this metaphor, but it's kind of the camel's nose under the tent. To speak to the motion, I think it's important to note that, Mr. Huber's comment about the people that are for inclusionary zoning aren't the builders, it's usually the advocates. Well, the problem with doing away with the free market is that the housing providers will go elsewhere because they can. And it's doublespeak to say supply is one way to increase supply, but it's true. One of the things that we have to recognize is affordable housing in the way that we're all talking about it in the City of Chico isn't possible because the City of Chico is, in fact, California. And they keep throwing regulation after regulation after regulation after regulation. We can fight that all we want. We can spend taxpayer dollars. We can subsidize everything we want, building things that people don't necessarily move to Chico to have. We do need more workplace housing. I agree with all of those things. But it's almost like the climate change and the homeless problem. We're gonna fight pretty hard to make a difference. I don't know that we can until, a bunch of people mentioned the governor who has the power with the state legislature and their super majority to make it more affordable building the state, but they don't do that. They collect more taxes and they give it back to people to allow them to build affordable housing. So I say all that to say, I still appreciate everything you did on the first nine. I don't agree with all of it, but that's okay. And I can get behind those nine, but on inclusionary zoning, I'm not willing to let the camel's nose under the tent yet. So I just say that as a explanation of my no vote. My no vote is not against all the work of the committee. That is not at all it. Any other discussion before we take vote? Okay. And can you repeat the motion? The motion is the acceptance of the report. And I believe, and this is what I wanted to clarify, that staff is to still look for incentives and also to bring inclusionary zoning to the planning commission and staff, and then see eventually as that goes through the process, process, there can be some teeth put into that. That is what I have as the motion. Number 10 says that by accepting recommendation 10, it says that we recommend further the policy be considered by the planning committee for the recommendation. Perfect. Okay. Council Member Huber? Yes. Council Member Morgan? No. Council Member Ory? Aye. Council Member Reynolds? No. Council Member Stone? Aye. Vice Mayor Brown? Aye. Mayor Schwab? Aye. Carries 5-2. Our next item, quality of life plan, is going to be a long item. So let's take just a 10-minute break so that we can resume in at 7.30.

We'll call our meeting back to order. Item 5.2, Quality of Life Plan. This is continued from the October 6th meeting. And City Manager Orem is going to start the presentation. Yes, thank you very much, Mayor Schwab, members of the City Council. This is one of those items that, as you noted, was delayed from last meeting. And it's interesting, as time goes on, things change. And so modifications. You're going to see be made during this meeting based upon the current status of a number of objectives that Council has asked to be achieved. The City of Chico is being tested by issues that cannot be solely solved by a Homeless Opportunities Plan, a Quality of Life Plan, nor even a declaration from your Emergency Services Director. However, there is a demand that something be done to both save our public spaces and environmentally sensitive communities. And that is to help build a bridge for those experiencing life crises, to include homelessness, enabling them to gain access to necessary support systems. What basic pillars of reality is staff working within in order to progress in finding ways of helping achieve some level of success on both of these fronts? Well, the first pillar that we've really established is that societies that flourish and succeed have set rules, laws, and rules. And that is to provide the best services, standards, and standards that everyone within the community acknowledge and should abide by. The second pillar is that healing and support for those who are suffering through a difficult life experience typically have had ready support systems to help them. The first line of defense has typically been the family, the family unit. The second line of defense was the church at one point in our history. The third line of defense was the community at large. The fourth line of defense was the community at large. The fifth line of defense ended up being local government, typically, or the state, or the feds, whichever level of government was there. Interestingly enough, what we've seen is many families were unable to meet the needs for various reasons in our nation today. The second line of defense, the church, seemingly no longer is at the center of civic life. The community no longer wields the weight of peer pressure that it once did, especially in larger cities like Chico. And then finally, government. I've got a lot to say about government. But needless to say, it lacks the ability to stand up the need needed support services. And I can go down a list of those, but just in a nutshell, mental health institutions, proper jailing systems, detox centers, all those things that we know are necessary to help people get back on the right path. Due to the realities surrounding the failures and weaknesses of these traditional systems of support, really they were our safety, our social safety nets. The vast majority of the support needed is falling. And that's what we're doing directly to local government. The city, to solve and remedy. And here we are, finding ourselves with these issues before us, attempting to find a reasonable path forward with little resource availability and huge needs in these areas of basic service provision that the community expects. They still want us to fill potholes. They still want us to build new roads and bridges. Still want us to put out fires. As is known, the city provides no social services, no mental health services, no drug rehabilitation services, no spiritual guidance, no meal services. The list goes on and on and on. As it relates to the services the city does not provide that is essential to meeting the needs of the populations that are in question. Why do I highlight these basic realities? Because my duty as city manager is to execute the will of this elected body, enforce the laws as they exist, and when asked, share candid operational realities so that the community can have a better future. And that the council can make good, wise decisions. What has happened during this COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented pressuring of the issues, which has brought everything to a head. And now you've seen a homeless opportunities plan, and tonight, a quality of life plan, which candidly, they're not holistic plans. And so they probably should be termed not as such, not as a plan. For they are simply presenting various elements of potential opportunities, potential collaborations and avenues toward helping to overcome the concerns confronting this community, from homelessness to safe parks, and everything in between. The framework that's before you tonight is reliant upon continuing collaborations with the private sector, non-profits, the county, and the state. And a recognition that enforcement needs to occur throughout the city to protect our valued and precious ecosystem, and to bring about a higher level of safety to the community. Therefore, I will be putting into place an executive order to designate public land for emergency camping to help counterbalance the CDC-recommended COVID-19 actions taken by the city in creating space for individuals to camp throughout the city's parks and waterways. The consequences of the prior action heightened the risk to our community at a level that necessitates such an order. Thus, I will be putting the executive order in place in the coming days, allowing for temporary emergency camping, within a section of the city on the west side of the airport. This area will be available to those who have found it necessary, due to COVID-19, to shelter themselves in our parks, in our creeks, in our waterways, greenways, and rights-of-way, which are contributing to an unsafe condition for not only them, but to the general public as well. This site will allow for a greater ability to maintain proper social distancing between camps and provide an easier point of access for service providers to better connect and help those that are experiencing hard times. This land has been used previously for emergency sheltering, if we all recall. This is not an anti-homeless initiative. This is not a pro-homeless initiative. This is a temporary path to allow staff time to continue working with our community partners, to include the County of Butte and service providers, to find as best a model of how we can help them. This is a model that allows us to create a continuum of care for individuals desirous of getting back on their feet again, and two, for ensuring those who are taking advantage of Chico's hospitality, compassion, and community through criminal endeavors or malicious intent, that they will be confronted and held accountable. The readiest means of forging ahead in this time of COVID-19 is to create a temporary, socially distant space for them to camp upon, or to gain access. This is a way to create a safe space for them to live in, where there is a warm bed, lovingly accountable attendance, and a path forward to better health. The City team, too, will continue to work with the Jesus Center, CHAT, Catalyst, Safe Space, and others as they look for effective means of caring for those in need. I will note that some will call this a horrible idea. Trust me, I've had my own thoughts about whether it's a good idea or not. I know that some of you have had your own thoughts. I know it's going to be difficult. Some will call it brilliant. Some will say it's too far from services. Some will say it's not far enough away. Some will say it's too expensive. And others will say the City's simply not doing enough. I will note that this is the situation we're in, and you get the point from what I'm saying. It's really a no-win situation. But I have to fulfill my duty to this City Council to find the means of reducing huge risks associated with potentially catastrophic fire concerns, environmental concerns, and legal risks on all fronts. Candidly, and this is something I really had to think over, I'm very hesitant to utilize any level of authority that presses me into a political or policy-making role. As I have been stout in my apolitical stance on issues, as this is the City Council's arena and not mine. So this is very uncomfortable for me. but this council has asked me to speak truth on this matter and directed me to use such authority in these circumstances. If you find failure, if you have questions surrounding this approach, please advise me now. It's not going in tomorrow. We're still putting it together. It'll go on in the coming days ahead. I need to know where you stand because I'm utilizing the authority you granted me in order to move this forward or not. With that, I want to have Assistant City Manager Constantine and Housing Solutions Coordinator Calkins briefly share the bigger picture items on the framework before you tonight, which will include some modifications pursuant to the continuing efforts afoot to bring about other sheltering options. So with that, I'm going to hand the ball over to Chris. Can I ask a couple of questions? Yeah, that was going to be my, well, no, I'm happy to go second, but I wanted to ask some questions about that part before we moved into the bigger non-profit. Non-plan, to use your term. Yes. These are kind of questions that are non-plan specific, but I think there are bigger pictures that I think we need to, I think the council is aware of these, but I continually hear comments from the members of the public. There are concerns, and I think I would like a few questions for you to answer so that everyone is on the same page. Sure. Go ahead. Go ahead, Rosanna. The city is not the entity that provides behavioral health, mental health, these types of services. And so people are saying, well, why don't we just have the county do it? Why don't we just have the state do it? Why don't we have the federal government do it? And we have seen that we reached out to the state and asked for some accommodations at the Silver Lava Fairgrounds. That wasn't even acknowledged by the state that we had reached out. So can you elaborate a bit more on what efforts we have done to these other governmental partners? Yeah, you know, it's been a constant gong that's been hit from year to year. And I recall a number of years ago when the city council had asked me to come back with some approaches to homelessness and the situation and circumstances that the community was facing. And I said, well, why don't we just have the state do it? You know what? Our community partners stepped forward in a way that allowed us to find a path forward. And at the time, it was one of our service providers that said, you know what? It sounds like our visions are coalescing, and so let's create a consolidated services model. And a number of other folks jumped on board along the way. But there's only so much our community can do on its own. And I mentioned some of the areas where there are just insufficient abilities for community members to do that. So we have to put together some of these different facilities to put together these facilities to put together these facilities to put together these facilities to put together these facilities to put together these facilities to put together these facilities to put together these facilities to put together these facilities to put together these facilities to put together these facilities to put together these facilities to put together these facilities to put together these facilities to put together these facilities to put together these facilities to put together these facilities to put together these facilities to put together these facilities to put together these facilities to put together these facilities to put together these facilities to put together these facilities to put together these facilities to put together these facilities to put together these facilities to put together these facilities to put together these facilities to put together these facilities to put together these facilities to put together these facilities to put together these facilities to put together these facilities to put together these facilities to put together these facilities to put together these facilities to put together these facilities to put together these facilities to put together these facilities to put together these facilities to put together these facilities to put together these facilities to put together these facilities civic conversation surrounding these issues. But they've been overwhelmed by all these disasters. And so they are a key partner in this because the social service funding primarily comes through the county. And one of the things that I've been informed of is by our homeless solutions coordinator is that the conversation she's having is bearing a lot of fruit with the county right now. Now that the COC has been transitioned to a differing model and the county is taking a little bit more of a lead role in that, we're seeing potentially some fruit being born there with some projects and collaboration. But we need more. The state of California obviously doesn't have institutions like they once did years ago to help support people that currently are wandering on our streets that need the protection of the state, candidly. And so we're dealing with so many issues. And we don't employ or deploy. The people that have the skills necessary to really engage at the level that I think a lot of folks are looking for, we enforce. And I've said that before. I know others have used it. But that's what our city was designed to do. And we can always change that model. That's the council's prerogative to look at changing modeling. However, there are basic essential services that we're not providing effectively right now. And when you start to expand and conduct yourself in ways that you're not typically doing, you then risk losing. You're losing the ability to even manage the basic day-to-day stuff. So it's extremely difficult when you don't have the funding mechanisms in place necessary, the collaboration between all the varying levels of governance to enable some of these things. We've had the conversations. We've had some momentum. But it just quite hasn't gotten there. And I appreciate you and the city council moving forward that letter to the governor, seeking some level of support to help us. And I know that Council Member Orr, you've had some subsequent conversations, I believe, trying to find ways of how do you work with the one area that we can potentially to help support each other in finding a solution. So I hope that helps. So what I see us doing is really taking the lead. Depending very much on our nonprofit community, our partners, and with what help we can find with the county. But this is our destiny. And that we need, in my opinion, we need to do something. We need to take the lead on this. So there's been comments that there's 50 beds at the tourist shelter. We're just lacking the COVID tests. So why should we invest any resources when there are these beds available? What's the story there? Yeah, so I'll tell you what. True North, formerly the tourist shelter, has been a real key partner. They have beds. I don't know if there's, you know, I know I've heard that there were 50, 50, 50. And then. I think there was a swelling a little bit and went down. So it's going back and forth a little bit. But I know there's beds available. And that's frustrating. When you know that there's folks who are in our parks, our creeks, and other areas when there's potential help and support available. So as it relates to trying to find ways of helping to support that entity in getting those folks in the doors, our city team, and I want to commend Assistant City Manager Chris Constantine, has created relationships with some other entities. To where we could potentially have those quick return of results on individuals to get them in quickly. If they're willing. And that's always the thing. If they're willing to go in there. So those collaborations are still underway. And I think that we've bridged a relationship there that will be a long-term commitment. And it'll be a positive one for this community. And so that's why that's one of the options on the funding to expand the beds. To help support increasing that. And getting those folks tested. And getting them in there. And then the other thing I hear quite a bit is why don't we just arrest everyone? Why are we giving services? Just the real accountability. But there was a ruling from the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals that, correct me if I'm wrong or clarify what I'm saying. Is that if there are no places for people to go. They can't be arrested. It's a real difficult situation. I would always defer to the city attorney on questions of legality. But I know that we're put in a position where you simply can't kick people out. And so the balancing act is trying to find how do you ensure that your local folks that are here from the area can be cared for and pop back up to a point where they can get back on their feet again. And the difficulty is that. A lot of other folks aren't caring for their folks. And so we see that wandering around. But as it relates specifically to the 9th Circuit decision. Andrew, if you could give it a stab, I'd really appreciate it. Certainly in you're talking about the Martin versus City of Boise case that came out about two years ago. It was amended slightly, ever so slightly. But the ruling still stands that you're correct. One cannot use or a city cannot use. The anti camping ordinance citywide to arrest people or impose other fines unless there is an alternate place to go. And it is that is a citywide ban. So if there's a particular area that is of a sensitive nature, one can or a city can impose fines and penalties. So a limited nature that that's still allowed. So OK. And then my final point is probably rhetorical. And maybe Mr. Constantine would be better to answer this because he does have a focus on economic development. What is the cost to the city of doing nothing, of not taking a lead, of not spending some resources to to clean up our city? Yeah, I appreciate that. And it's a good question. It is rhetorical. You're right. But but I but I do want to make a comment to that because that's been one of the struggles I've had. And I know the council knows this. I know my staff knows this. But I've had many sleepless nights over the past number of months. And it's primarily due to the situation that we're dealing with and trying to help ensure that we're abiding by CDC regulations and also trying to counterbalance that with responsible stewardship of our own facilities has been extremely difficult. And so I have to weigh those costs. And when you make a directive, should that proceed if I get some feedback from council as it relates to they would like to see things more than that or what they would like to see on that front? The bottom line is, is that the detrimental impacts to our parks and waterways and the non use of our parks because of fear and because of reasons that, you know, people are concerned that I think has been the cost of that. There's no dollar amount you can put on. And and so that cost balancing act, we don't have the money to support the heightened level of a camp, a heightened level of services necessary. But the cost on the other side is huge as well. So how do you do that? And so that's why it's been a huge struggle. And there is no perfect place to have a camp. There's no perfect place that the city can go to to say, hey, let's send this resource out or that resource out because we're not built to respond to these types of issues. Right. We're an enforcement agency. We've never been a social service provider. And so it's a real, real tough juggling act. I've still debated even a minute before I started speaking tonight whether or not I wanted to even say what I said. But I'm going to be honest with the council. And if that's if that's the direction that I see folks went ahead, I'm willing to go there. But I know it's not going to be easy. Mr. Morgan. Thank you, Madam Mayor. Skipper, my questions are specifically about your executive order. And I appreciate as much as anyone how it came to pass. This council made a policy allowing camping in the parks that exploded. I'm sure that was no one's intention. And then they looked at you and said, fix this. It was a little more eloquent than that, but not much. So your executive order for temporary emergency camping to the west of the airport. And if you don't have answers to these questions, it's fine. My first question would be how long. Is temporary. What is how are you going to pay and staff that? I'm assuming you're not just opening a piece of land that's fenced in and saying it's here or nowhere. And then will that will there be some means of transportation? And then finally, I know the answer to this question. How does this allow? Does this allow? And what means would the police department use to clean up the camp? I mean, I think I've seen a lot of these encampments that have gotten completely out of hand asking people to go to this spot. Yeah. Now you get all that. Sorry. There's a lot of questions that that's that's they're all they're all valuable. Trust me. I've got draft language. We've obviously have not completed this yet because I really wanted feedback from council. I mean, I'm not going to move forward on something like this feedback from council. But I just want you to know that I'm driven to do it if it's if you feel like it's something we need to do. With regard to the order. I'm sorry. It would expire in its own terms. Either on January 31st or when this COVID declaration of emergency goes away, whatever comes first. So the latest it would go temporary nature would be July, January 31st. So that's the intention of what my declaration would be with regard to enforcement. You know, working with our team of professionals in the police department, in the fire department, and code enforcement. In all the areas, public works, everybody's willing to be hand all hands on deck. And and so what we would do is we would engage, we'd give people time to be able to have proper noticing to move on to, you know, the few options that they're going to have. There's a couple of options that I can't speak to. And I know Susie can't because they're in the works right now. And and so but the two right now that are readily visible is one potentially this encampment or two. The tourist zone. And then the two north. And how do you how do you fund that? And what does that look like? It's going to be expensive. You know, we looked at and really the only way that we can look at it is through a lens of what we've seen before. And one of the models that we looked at, which is way too cost prohibitive and we need to find a slimmer model is the fact that when we look at kind of how we put together an emergency situation where the fire department has a team come in. They put up a fire department. They put up all of the facilities that are necessary. Showers, bathrooms and such. And that was close to $8,000 a day to do that. That's without transportation. And then you add in transportation and there's some more costs there. So we've got the city team. You know, I've met numerous times with them. Most recently, a week ago where I said, you need to get these costs hammered out. Right now, we don't have them all hammered out. We don't know. That's why you see kind of that big dollar amount in there. And if you're doing it for that temporary period of time, hopefully that will be enough to cover it. But it's going to be costly. Very, very costly. And then that's where you counterbalance it with what's the cost of what we're currently experiencing. And the only way to enforce, and I think you alluded to it as well, Mayor, is to have a place for the folks to be that's safe, secure. And so we would have security there. We don't, we're not just going to let them be there. There has to be rules. As we all have rules in our own homes and our otherwise in society. And so those rules will have to be built out over the next couple of weeks. I don't envision this being properly prepared to move forward at least for a couple of weeks, candidly. Because it has to be done in a way that's logical and is understandable. And so that's, hopefully that kind of fills in some of those gaps that you're wondering about. Thank you. Yep. Any questions before? Oh, Scott. Yeah, thanks. I'll sort of recap or reiterate one of Councillor Morgan's questions, which was transportation. Was there anything envisioned for transportation and what sort of infrastructure would be envisioned for the camp? I have, probably like everybody else up here, I have a lot of questions in general. But just specific to that, this one sort of thing that you've brought up about the encampment. Those are the two questions that I have about that. Good questions. And as I've mentioned with regard to the transportation, it's going to be a part of the cost. So there's a couple of options there that we anticipate we would finish vetting. One is our partner at BCAG and see if there's an opportunity to have them support us in this. And what that would look like is potentially it would allow for, whether they do it or if we do it ourselves, if we go buy a vehicle and do that ourselves, it would be transportation. And that would be transportation to their services. It would be transportation to if they have a medical appointment or whatever that might happen to be. And so it's complex. We've never done it before. And so that's what we kind of are anticipating. There would have to be those types of scenarios where we would have to work with them on that. If it's BCAG, obviously you can't be a shuttle where you're going to appointments and stuff. If we do it internally, maybe we can try to help with that. So Safe Space used BCAG shuttles? Yeah. To get people there. Yeah. So there's models out there. It's worked. We've never done it though. So it would be a new venture for us. And then as it relates to the infrastructure, I mean, right off the bat, we've already got restrooms and wash stations out there. We're paying for them. They could be consolidated so you have enough separated where it's safe for folks to use them. And so you've got the restrooms, the wash. You've got what we're looking at is showers. And we're contemplating. Do we buy a safe? Do we buy a system with showers in it where it can be used later in other circumstances where we might need it in an emergency? Or do we just rent it? And I will tell you, renting it is very, very expensive. It may be more cost effective just to buy it. So you've got all of those things. Really separate lots where people can plot themselves down. And it's already paved. So it's been used as emergency sheltering before. So there's not a lot of... There's not a lot of infrastructure. The other piece that we were looking at is putting up a tent for cooling and warming during that time. Obviously more warming most likely, although it's supposed to be a nice warm winter. But needless to say, we're also looking at that because when you come back and that question of do we open a warming and cooling center, then we will have one there that's already up and people can get respite from the sun if they don't want to be in their tent or whatever and socially distance. So we're looking at all of those pieces. And so that's kind of what the infrastructure looks like at this point. And I've got a lot of really smart people who have done this stuff before working on the details. But generally speaking, that's where we're at right now. So in regards to if there is this site being provided out there with the intention of that encouraging people to move out of camps in our parks and public spaces. What sort of enforcement do you envision? What does that look like? What does encouraging people out of the camps look like? Yeah. So a much safer place to be, first of all. That's a huge encouragement. But what does it look like on an engagement front? We have the target team who are experts at engaging with folks that are having difficult times in their lives. And in addition to that, we would have work with our service providers. Ms. Cockums can kind of share a little bit more on that. When she comes up. But she's had some great conversations on how best to, should we proceed with this? How best to engage those populations? Because it's going to have to be very sensitively approached and professionally approached. But also we need to ensure that that's a primary aspect of this. Because if we're going to be opening up a space for them to be that's safe and clean and capable to support them. We have to also come back around with the accountability side of it as well. It doesn't work for everyone. It doesn't work without both. It's a balancing act. And so that's what we envision right now. But Ms. Cockums can speak a little bit more to what that partnership might look like on the engagement. Yeah. Any additional questions? Okay. Thank you, Mark. Okay. Mr. Constantine. Debbie, if we can get the PowerPoint. This is the one. So we're going to walk through the three-year plan to improve Chico's quality of life. But I wanted to start off a little bit with the background. And I think a little history is in order. 2013 city manager Mark Orman and I came into the city and found that we were eight months away from bankruptcy. We shouldn't have made it, but we did. The team came together. The community came together. The council came together. And we survived that. And what we faced after that was six and a half more years of positives and negatives, ups and downs. But generally we were heading in the right direction. We saw significant reductions in public safety staff. Our fire department received the largest grant ever in the history of FEMA for a medium-sized city to retain 15 firefighters. Over that time we increased 25% staffing to our police department. And then unfortunately because we didn't have a longer-term plan for our fire department, we lost 15 positions. And we're now at the lowest level for a community our size. And we don't even meet the standards that we had. We don't even have the coverage of the cover, which is an analysis that we performed to have a safe, viable fire department. We don't even have the ability to complete updated emergency planning to have emergency plan. I'm sorry. If this is okay, I would like to take this off. Thank you. We don't have the ability with staffing to be able to complete and update emergency plans and be on top of all the fire risks that we do see. And during this course in time we saw the Camp Fire, other disasters, positives, negatives. We saw temporary increases in revenue due to the Camp Fire. The COVID pandemic, which ate into our revenue and hit our economy hard. But the short-term gain from the Camp Fire helped our community meet budget targets because of our fiscal prudent leadership of the city manager and Scott Dowell, our administrative services director. And just this meeting, you approved supplemental appropriations, which fully funded the reserves. So going from the negative $5.7 million to now reaching our budget targets. For somebody like me, this is perfect timing to occur now. Yet the COVID virus has introduced a tremendous, unique difficulty to our community. The council took action to try to stem the movement of individuals that were unsheltered and at risk to try to reduce the spread of the COVID virus. But what we saw was not a reduction of the movement and not a reduction of the growth in encampments. We saw a growth and we continue to see movement. We've seen a dramatic increase in spot fires. And in fact, as city manager Mark Oren was speaking tonight, we got another alert of a fire that occurred on the 1300 block of Nord Avenue. So those are happening at an ever-increasing rate. The level of risk in our community for fire varies dramatically from extreme high fire risk on the upper side of Bidwell Park to down through the park into our waterways, close to structures. We've been very fortunate that we have one of the best fire departments around and they've been able to protect and safeguard our community. But without knowing the true fire risk of different areas, we can't tell where we should focus our efforts. And so there's a lot of ups and downs, but there's one commonality in everything that's happened in the last seven and a half years that's been somewhat of a frustration for staff internally. We don't strategically plan and we don't think long term. We had for a while five categories listed. We had a lot of categories listed on the wall of the council chambers that indicated broad areas like economic development, very broad where you could pretty much fit almost anything within one of those five categories. So therefore, everything became important. And given our limited resources, as you saw during the sales tax discussions where we were $100 and $150 per capita less in revenue than cities similar to ours with the same sales tax rate, we clearly don't have the revenue capacity to provide all the services we need. So we have to be strategic. So as we've been discussing the homeless situation of such a tremendous number of folks that are high risk and at need, and then the impacts of high levels of violence and fires and other things that are impacting our community, we really come round and round and round to one conclusion, that what we talk about is not about homelessness. It's not about violent crime. It's about the quality of life of our community. So I would say that's the first thing. And then the second thing is that as we're contemplating your direction to deal with the situation and bring forth initiatives, do we come forward to you with singular initiatives that sound good? Or do we start to formulate a framework, kind of a pseudo buildup to eventually a strategic plan to be able to give context to the items that we're bringing before you? And the answer from staff's perspective is yes, that's exactly what we need to do. And so what you see before you is a quality of life plan that is in place. It's a plan that is far larger than just a singular homeless issue, a violent crime issue, a fire issue. It's really the context that we want to put different initiatives under. A partial framework that we would hope the council would take and continue to grow upon over time so that we end up building up to eventually a larger strategic plan that is well informed by the public, by the council, and by professionals to guide us in our future decision making, so that we don't go back and forth. So that we don't go back over seven and a half years of ups and downs, but that we know the direction that we're heading. What is this plan not? It's not an end all be all solution. It's not a good plan, great plan, bad plan, the worst plan ever. It's not a one size fits all. It doesn't accomplish everything. It asks for stuff that people may completely disagree with. It may have things that will be subject to legal challenge. Who knows in the future and whatnot. But it is a partial framework of a plan that we hope gives context. Thank you. Thank you. And with the plan we have to have a vision of where we're going. In most places when you pick a city where you want to live, if it's not the city you were born and raised in, you're really looking at having a great quality of life and being able to enjoy the amenities that are provided in that city. So we're really looking to have a vision where all residents can thrive where they live. We are also looking at a place that takes advantage of what we have here in our community. Bidwell Park and fantastic outdoor public spaces to ensure that we have a beautiful clean and a very safe outdoor public space as the framework for our vision. Under that vision we have three goals. Again not all the goals not maybe even the exact goals that the council and the community we desire to put into place when we spend the time to formulate this over the long haul but we want to enhance opportunities to improve quality life for all our residents. We want to reduce risk exposures to our communities quality of life as we can identify such as fire risk and addressing that and we want to not do this in isolation we want to leverage partnerships and resources to efficiently effectively achieve that vision but with that we also have to understand this community is unlike many other communities across the state. Chico is the largest economic driver in the community and we do not have contiguous cities around us like other parts of the state that can partner with multiple cities to accomplish a goal so multiple cities and the county come together to partner. It is Chico, the county and our service providers and so our job is that much more difficult to accomplish the same goals where the Bay Area Los Angeles and San Diego can leveraging other cities. Within our first goal we wanted to identify immediate strategies. We want we absolutely have to have residents engagement in providing input into the plans and solutions in direction of the going. We need to immediately if we're going to address the situation in our parks which was the direct and waterways which is the direction of council expand capacity that is in the has the shortest timeline for expansion in this case we're looking at 50 bed expansion at the Torrey shelter and in looking at a sanctioned camp whether it be through an executive order by your ESD or by some longer term properly SIGWA type analysis that involves zoning or multiple areas of zoning identify an operator for a sanctioned camp so in this case it would be the west side of the airport and looking at risk exposures we absolutely being a community in the county that was impacted by the campfire that we were fortunate enough with a backburn to stop it from actually hitting the city but yet being at risk that the fireway would have crossed 32 and hit the northeast side of the city, have to address the fire risk in our parks and waterways. And in addressing that fire risk, it has to be at a micro level, not a generic general all of Upper Park is high risk or all of one waterway is a high risk. It has to be looking at segment by segment, conditions, humidity, the materials, the growth to assess that risk. We also need to improve our ability to quickly respond to issues of quality of life, and we have to leverage our community and technology to be able to accomplish that. We cannot ask fire department to go out and be by themselves and address fire risk. We need to look to our community to where they see that, find an easy, cost-effective means to convey that to the city to be able to properly address. The same way we would want a pothole to be reported or a sidewalk that has grown a three-inch lip that could be a tripping hazard. We also need to strengthen our ability to withstand economic challenges to our business community. Because they are the lifeblood of the economy that drives everything else that impacts quality of life. In leveraging our partnership, it's really about there's not that much money to go around, so don't spend money inefficiently. So we need to leverage to maximize that benefit. We need to strengthen those relationships, and we have very good ones now, but we need to strengthen even more, hitting areas that involve other aspects such as domestic violence abuse for those that are at risk or throughout our community. Foster youth, senior care, and the whole gamut. And we need to have data-driven plans to drive our strategies and allocate our resources and to maximize every opportunity that we take advantage of to leverage our partnerships. Within each of these strategies, we've developed action plans. And under the first two strategies really involve outreach, and we already are going to move forward in that direction as we update our housing element. We can do that. We've selected a survey that I'll turn it over now to Susie to be able to go to some of the results once I get through this that garnered over 1,000 comments to really inform our quality of life issues. So before I go further into this, I'd like Susie to come up and talk about the survey that council had asked and that we had been planning for moving forward to see what the results were. Good evening, Madam Mayor and council members. Good evening. On September 22nd, City staff brought forth the Homeless Opportunities Plan with options for the homeless population to connect each person to a bed, resources, and supportive services. At that meeting, staff discussed the need to solicit the community and garner their input on the plan and all that it entailed. I am pleased to report that we received 1,019 responses, and I'm here this evening to highlight just a few of those responses for you. You should have a copy. There's not a presentation in your packet. Yep. So I've selected just a handful of the questions and responses to share with you. The first, the question is, the city of Chico has a responsibility to improve the quality of life for all residents. Approximately 782 or 76.5% agreed that the city is responsible for the quality of life for all residents. The second point is that the city of Rosalia has a responsibility to increase the quality of life for all residents. The last point is that Rosalia's Rosalia's Rosalia's Rosalia's larger endeavor potentially state or federal money should be fixing. Second, what are other ideas that you have around solutions given that funding is limited? I don't think there's anybody that would say, gosh, I could come up with a bunch of solutions if I just had a lot of money. We know we don't have a lot of money and resources are going to be slim going forward, especially in response to what COVID has done to our economy, nation and worldwide. But the responses here, I'd like to highlight tiny house opportunities were the number one idea that folks liked as a solution. The second was transitional housing solutions, a lot of variety in that response. Third was permanent solutions or affordable housing. We've discussed affordable housing this evening. In any time I've been involved in a housing effort in any jurisdiction that I've worked in, if we end up putting homeless persons in emergency shelter or transitional housing environments, we have to come behind that on the back end with affordable housing to move them through the housing system to a place where they can live long term and hopefully self-sufficiently. The fourth item was single room occupancy, basically like dormitory living. Fifth option was sanctioned camping and safe parking. Sixth was low barrier navigation center emergency shelter beds. And seventh was the not applicable and I left out other because our responses were, gosh, all over the map, guys. There was comments that weren't even relevant to solutions in there, of course. And there was quite a few responses from individuals that thought the well of money was endless. So I left that off, but if you want to see the individual narrative responses and other, I'd be happy to share that with you. Not this evening, it's 30 pages long. Common themes in the other category, however, did range, if you see under the graph. Enforcement and accountability was mentioned more than anything else. And that was to alleviate the need for housing. And to mitigate the impacts of illegal activities, accountability must be had. Many different comments, but one of the themes was provide bus tickets to move the homeless out of our city and send them back where they came from. If you have ever participated in a point in time count in a community, that's a fallacy. We know we have some transients that are not originally from the Chico area living here, but it is not the vast majority of our chronically homeless population. As Mr. Orme was commenting earlier about things that are somewhat out of our control, mental health and substance abuse treatment facilities in the state of California are not what they should be to address the homeless population, either whether it be in Chico or Butte County, but across the state. Those are things, in my opinion, that on a federal level we need to fix if we're ever going to have a significant impact on homelessness nationwide. Fourth theme on that list is to provide assistance to Butte County residents only. There's a lot of taxpayers that want to see our funding spent on individuals that somewhere in their lifespan have probably contributed to the DAC space. And then the final theme is that persons do not believe that our chronically homeless on the streets are going to participate in whatever opportunity we provide because they've made homelessness as a way of life. Okay. Moving on. Yes, sir. So, yeah, those themes can be referred to other than the four and 20 responses? Yes. Yes. And again, there were many other options in there of narrative, but those were ones I categorized into. While we're asking questions. I'm sorry? While we're asking questions. Sure. Who did you survey? The... There were multiple links out there and whoever wanted to respond did. It wasn't... It was the greater community. So it was open to homeless. It was open to stakeholders, residents. Yep. Was it limited to Chico? If I, like, clicked on the link from Reno, could I fill it out? Probably. Great. Yeah. How would you rank the following priorities of the plan was the next question. I ranked these responses. I didn't give you the percentages, but I ranked them. The number one is ensuring safe and clean parks and waterways was obviously the biggest priority that folks would like to see addressed. Increasing shelter beds for persons experiencing homelessness ranked number two. Enforcement of illegal activities in public areas, three. Providing resources to support outreach and engagement to persons with disabilities. Providing safety and safety to persons experiencing homelessness was four. Providing sanctioned camping and safe parking, five. Providing financial support to city staff that is tasked with enforcement was ranked six. And seventh was other. Next was public health and safety. Depend on public spaces that are clean and not open to overnight camping. Do folks agree or disagree? Overwhelmingly, 70, almost 71% agreed with that statement. 17%, almost 18% actually disagreed or strongly disagreed with that statement. And then the final question and survey comments that we're going to go over this evening, have you or your family been impacted by any of the following in the season? One was the number one response in the city of Chico. And overwhelmingly, the number one response was unruly behavior or unsafe actions of others have been experienced. It was almost 64%. Number two was waste or refuse of any kind. They've experienced that in their travels in Chico. Fires at 40% ranked third. Environmental hazards ranked fourth, almost 40% itself. Other was a wide range of things, was 28%, number five. And then not applicable people commented that they had not experienced any of the items within this list. And then lowest was floods. Although this is only a brief recap and does not cover each survey response, these five questions and the responses received support the request and the response to the survey. And then last was the number one response. The city of Chico has a policy that is based on the quality of life plan that sets the initial framework for action by city staff and our partners to improve public health and safety for all residents in the city of Chico. I'll entertain questions if you have any. I have a quick question. Sure. Well, two questions actually. Just out of curiosity, who designed the survey and the question? Several of us at the city office did. Okay, thank you. Was this plan made in collaboration with service providers? The quality of life plan? Primarily staff, but yes, there were a handful of providers also consulted. And is there an outreach plan associated with these efforts? No, not yet. It's something I'm currently working on. Will additional shelter beds, and I don't mean tent camping because I don't actually believe that's considered by the Martin B. Boise case to be. But will additional shelter beds be viable, sheltering options be in place prior to initiating this component of the plan? Repeat that last part again. Will additional shelter beds be in place prior to initiating this component of the plan? Will we have additional shelter beds before the enrollment of this? Yeah, we'll have 50 additional beds hopefully through actions this evening, yes, at the tourist shelter. Okay, and that's prior to initiating these efforts? Some, yes. Any comments? The plan, there's two options. We have additional shelter bed capacity within the tourist shelter right now, and we also are looking at the encampment. Because we know from our engagement that not all individuals want to go into the tourist shelter. And so what we want to do is that we implement looking at a phased approach, looking at areas of the highest risk, such as Upper Park with high fire risk. And we're identifying and trying to grapple with reducing that risk. If we do impact or if an unsheltered individual is impacted, that we have an option to transition them into the tourist shelter. And if that's not their desire to go to the tourist shelter, the encampment is the option because the supplemental goal we're trying to accomplish is the reduction of spread of COVID. And to consolidate in such a manner that we can bring service to providers to provide services to the at-risk population because right now they're geographically spread across the entire city. So as we hit geographic locations, we're trying to get them to be at risk. And so we're looking at that. You offer them one of the two options, and either option gives them a portal into those services in the hopes that we can start to escalate the level of service and get them into more stable housing ultimately. But we're not going to force somebody who does not want to go into a physical structure and a bed to go somewhere else when we have it. We'll give them an encampment option that's a better option than where they are right now. Do we have a group from service providers to engage with the people living in the encampment? Yes. And what we're looking at is that we're looking at a portal. And one of the options you'll see in the plan a little bit later on is an allocation of dollars for outreach because that's a critical component of this. And is that outreach specific to the target team? That's in conjunction, working in conjunction. That money is not for the target team. It's for the actual service providers. City Attorney Jarrett, can you answer a question for me or try? Do tents count as a viable sheltering option under the Martin B. Boise verdict? I don't think that Martin B. Boise calls out specifically. I don't think that Martin B. Boise calls out specifically. Tents, not tents. Shelter, not shelter. But as staff was explaining, this is just part of the strategy. I don't think that the strategy is to enforce anti-camping citywide and force anyone anywhere. It's to provide another place to go for camping opportunities, shelter opportunities. While various locations where camping is currently not allowed would be focused for enforcement. So is what you're saying, if somebody's camping in the park, they receive a notice to move out of the park. Right. They don't move out of the park. They then are cited or arrested for not moving out of the park and not moving into the campground that we've established. Are we? Are we liable for a lawsuit? So your hypothetical makes a statement there that I think is incorrect. Okay. And that is they're being cited for not going into this new encampment facility or something along those lines. They're being cited for violating the camping ordinance. Correct. Thank you. Yeah. And so Martin's very clear you can't enforce a citywide anti-camping ordinance. But at footnote, I think it's important. It is six. It says that it's not addressing focused ordinances. So if we say parks, greenways, waterways, sidewalks, all of that stuff would be included as just specific areas, civic center? I think it's something we have on the books in Chico, citywide camping ordinance. Right. It's not being enforced because of Martin. Mm-hmm. We also have other ordinances that deal with focused areas, the civic center. There are park rules and an ordinance relating to overnight or being present in the park overnight. Those two aren't being enforced because of just a practical nature. Mm-hmm. So, yeah, citing someone, making an arrest. So, yeah, if you're making an arrest based on forcing someone to go to a particular place, no, that's not going to happen. What will happen is for failure to abide by an ordinance that is lawful and able to be enforced. Okay. Thank you. Mm-hmm. So, Chris, I have a quick question. So, in Ms. Brown's example, if you interacted with someone in the park and they didn't want to go to the Tory shelter, would you be able to go to the park? If they didn't want to go to the park and they didn't want to go to our now sanctioned campground, then what? Well, exactly what was outlined now. We would provide notice, a 48-hour notice. Okay. And they would need to leave one way or another. And I think what we need to clarify here is because, you know, Ms. Brown's example related to camping and the city attorney's discussion of anti-camping. Okay. And the premise and the preference and what we want to do is we're enforcing against illegal acts broadly across everybody. Right. So when Chris is in the park past closing hours, you better believe that we should be enforcing on Chris. You shouldn't be in the park. You need to go. When it involves an unsheltered at-risk individual, the same thing applies. But I think what we have to balance is the compassion of understanding. The degree of risk associated with that individual and offer an alternative. First, as we have bed capacity and the best location, it being the Torrey shelter, is the preference. But we can't force them to go there. Second, an encampment which is no different than your camping now here. It's a different location. But what we're providing there is what we hope to be more access and amenities to service and alternatives that make it for a safer, better environment. But if you don't want that one either, you're still committing an illegal act and we as a community can no longer afford to do what we've been doing for the last seven years and say, we're not doing anything. We have to do something. Because once you directed us and two, there's an impact and three, we're leaving an individual. We're okay with saying that certain laws that we put on the books for a reason are okay. If you want people in the park, two in the morning, three in the morning, let's say that and let the whole community enjoy that park any time of the day. But we didn't. We haven't. So I think there's a distinction we have to make between Chris in the park and an at-risk individual. That was very well articulated. So then my follow-up question, and you alluded to this, the service providers that for a long time talked about, you know, wraparound services in one place, they can get behind this dual idea. There might be some people at the toy shelter. There might be some people at the campground. And these are the same service providers that can't provide all the services now. But now they're going to divide themselves between two different places. I think when we look at this, we're really looking at there's an immediacy because first of COVID. I mean, that's a tremendous aspect that we really are focusing on right now. Two, the number of individuals that are unsheltered that if we have capacity, it's a shame to not have the capacity, not have enough for everybody, but to have capacity and still see people out on the streets. And three, the extent of the illegal acts that are occurring. That are attributable to anybody and everybody in our community is so pervasive that it's the reason why you're looking at this violent crime unit and the need to fight the fires and whatnot. So I think right now we're looking at and that we'll be asking council for we need the immediacy of response now and to continue developing the medium and longer term range plans where the ultimate goal would be everything that we need to get us back to that high level of quality of life that we could accomplish in a cost-effective manner. Thank you. I just have a comment. It seems to me implicit in the success of this scenario where you are, where you're providing an alternative to our public spaces for people to camp. Is that if the alternative you're providing is inhospitable, you're likely to not have any success. Yeah. it has to be you know in addition to having some services you know it can't just be on a hot asphalt surface with no trees or whatever so I think we need to take that into consideration as we're looking at how this will succeed because I think human nature would dictate that people are not going to go somewhere where they're less comfortable that's less hospitable than the place they are for what it's worth then there's not a disagreement there but part of the issue we're grappling with also is a lack of locations that can work especially when we're looking at city facilities and I think in my personal opinion I think living outdoors is not an acceptable option whether there's an oasis of trees sandy beach in Hawaii that's not I don't believe that that's an environment we should be comfortable with for any member of our community some may want it but I personally think no that's not what I would say let's aspire to do that right now what we're looking at is this is there's such an immediacy in dealing with COVID that can we can mirror all our needs and we can do that in a way that's not going to put to work to work work work work work work work work to when I'm speeding in the roadway, I thought I'm speeding, that if I have my red sports car, which I don't, I shouldn't be the one you're picking on to stop all the time, not my white Honda, which I don't have either, driving down the roadway. We have to find a way to be equitable, and we have to find a way to not make the condition of homelessness be the reason why, but rather the illegal acts that are occurring. And that's the focus. And to the extent that we look at areas that impact those who are camping, we're connecting that with, to the extent that we have safe shelter in a structure, then we should be looking at those higher risk areas and addressing them now. Because the first time we have a fire that hits a structure that kills somebody, I'm not going to be able to sleep at night because I knew we could do something about it, and we didn't. So I want to quickly just wrap, if it's okay, just quickly go through the remaining slides and get to the recommendation. And so on each of these goals, we'll have a set of strategies. And as you see, these strategies, we'll have highlighted ones that we'll aggregate to the last slide, which is our recommendations. And so the sanctioned camping, which we've really already done the first two actions in evaluating the needs, is actually establishing and determining the cost for it. And we've assigned a $700,000 cost to that to ensure that we're able to operate something for 90 days. Increasing shelter beds from the Torrey shelter, we're looking at a $300,000. To another site that we're looking at, a potential up to 160 beds that would involve a contribution of CDBG funds to the tune of about $283,000. And then the potential assessment environmentally of non-congregate shelter in a specific location to the tune of up to $100,000, but we hope not to actually expend all that. In terms of our second goal on risk exposure, the most important one for us ends up being the fire risk and assessing that. The remaining ones involve other aspects, graffiti, bike regulations, water condition testing, and the last one is an action already being put in place by Chief Matt Madden, which is the Violent Crime Unit. Under Strategy 2.2, an ability to respond quickly. So we need to be able to support the attorney's efforts in enforcing municipal codes because it's an obligation to enforce codes that falls onto the attorney's office, the city, not necessarily the district attorney or the court system. Provide a dedicated team for cleanliness, cleanups. We've reduced this from what you saw in the plan that was going to be presented at the last meeting. It was $550,000. It's now $300,000. What it now entails is a supervisor, two staff persons, two trucks, and the dump fees associated with trash that we'd have to take to the landfill. It does not include the range of components and some unallocated amounts for parts of the cost we couldn't anticipate what those would be. Increasing the hours of service for target team. We don't have an amount for that because, well, we believe it may end up being, well, it's a staffing issue as opposed to an overtime issue. And then allocating $20,000 for outreach specifically to our partners and providers in working with the target team. Strengthening our ability to withstand economic challenges specifically for our businesses. We already implemented a number of different emergency orders as we were opening up. Those become less important, but we still keep them in place until we're back to 100%. The loan loss reserve fund, the council already approved, and currently we allocate $50,000 in CDBG funds to the Small Business Development Center to assist local businesses. Can I ask you a quick question on the previous slide? Yes, ma'am. Invite partner organizations to participate in the outreach and engagement efforts in partnership with the target team. $20,000. Can you speak to that amount a little bit? Say that again? Can you speak to that $20,000 amount on item 2.2D there? I will have Susie speak to that. Yes, ma'am. And, conversing with our service providers who identified to me that they had outreach workers, the majority of them asked for funding to help support this activity because they were tapped out. Most of their staff wear multiple hats, and or they didn't have an additional person to put on a new assignment. So, that amount came, it's kind of a placeholder. It's not exact science on dollars per person per hour. And who are those partners? I talk to Safe Space and chat primarily. Okay, great. Thank you. You're welcome. I had a question about 2.2A, support the city attorney's efforts to guide the city in enforcing local municipal codes. Among those is no camping is a citation or violation for no camping. So, are we envisioning that we're going to have these facilities in place? Before we are enforcing these local municipal codes? Because otherwise we're enforcing a code that doesn't have an option for people to not break that rule. Obviously, we're not going to be prosecuting a case that is unconstitutional. So, let's not have any ideas that, that, that's not going to work out to the point where we have to put these facilities to work out to work out to the point where we have to put these facilities to work out to the point where we have to put these facilities to work out to the point where we have to put these facilities to work out to the point where we have to put these facilities to work out to the point where we have to put these facilities to work out to the point where we have to put these facilities to work out to the point where we have to put these facilities to work out to the point where we have to put these facilities to work out to the point where we have to put these facilities to work out to the point where we have to put these facilities to work out to the point where we have to put these facilities to work out to the point where we have to put these facilities PD has discretion in whether or not they're going to cite somebody? PD always has discretion to whether or not to cite someone. Okay. Yeah. Particularly not to cite someone. And obviously, I mean, most of us drive vehicles, and I think the national average that I learned in traffic school some decades ago was something like three vehicle code violations per mile that each one of us violates. Obviously, we don't get those kinds of tickets, and if you talk to an officer, they exercise that type of prosecutorial discretion all the time. The same goes with prosecutorial discretion as to municipal codes, and in particular, homeless issues or issues, code violations being, committed by people experiencing homelessness. Let me speak to that a little bit, Mr. Huber. There's a balance. I don't think we can ask the question, are you guys going to enforce or are you not going to enforce? I think there's gradations, and so there's illegal acts that we have been enforcing, should be enforcing. We can increase the level of enforcement on that. Let's, for example, creating fire risks or having flammable material or things of that nature. That doesn't necessarily. Then impact a person in a way that we don't have an amenity for them to go to. We do have the Torrey shelter amenity. We have that right now. We have the bed capacity right now, so we can enforce any of the codes that are all constitutional, and if it displaces an at-risk individual, we have a place they can go. They may choose not to go there, and it's a question of based on our timing of an encampment, is that in place now or will it be? But we won't be enforcing citywide type of restrictions. That means they couldn't move from that location. They're going to move from that location to a different location, and so if your question goes to, hey, are you going to now negatively impact a large swath of at-risk, unsheltered, and give them no options of what they could do to just survive, the answer is no, we're not going to do that, but I think there's a balance. We cannot say no, we're not going to enforce any legal act in our community because those illegal acts, when we enforce it, we're going to apply it across the board to everybody, not just to a certain segment of the population. Does that answer the question? Does that answer what you're looking for? Okay. In terms of our last goal, leveraging partnerships, we really need to start focusing and being strategic on how we define what our priorities are and then how we chase grants because we could chase grants all day long. We need to understand which ones have our impact on us, which fit our mission, and which don't detract from our core services that we provide on a daily basis. We need to leverage our relationships, so creating a partnership map of partners that want to work with the city, that could be effective in achieving our mission, needs to be put into place. We need to ensure our partnership, our partners work with the key divisions and entities of the city, specifically target when it comes to outreach and engagement out in the field. And we need to start developing data driven plans and strategies to drive how we do everything. This should be the norm on everything that we do, but we really start, it's really important to now start focusing on these limited, we really start, it's really important to now start focusing on these limited, resources, you know, is what could be effective in using those resources. In terms of the recommendation we're making to council, this is different than what was in the plan at the last meeting, so we want to highlight that. We're asking for direction on the three-year plan to improve quality of life as it pertains to mapping out a process for engagement that involves the council, staff, and residents on how to expand upon and develop a comprehensive actionable plan to improve quality of life. This really is the build-up to, yes, we want to have more of a strategic plan, we want to build on what you're presenting or revise or modify, but we want to get to a point where we're telegraphing a vision of where we're going to go and how we're actually going to accomplish it and aligning our resources behind those priorities to be able to say no to others that may not fit this direction. The second set of actions we'd like you to authorize, 1.864. million in supplemental appropriations for the following actions that are listed there, the sanctioned camping item at $700,000, the Torrey shelter expansion at $300,000, the use of CDBG-CV funds under the CARES Act for the 160-bed short-term that we're currently working on with a location that we're not prepared to disclose just yet, $100,000 to do a comprehensive fire risk assessment, providing $60,000 of support to the city attorney's office to be able to enforce the limited number of very important codes we want to enforce, the cleanup team to go out for our parks and waterways that would be dedicated to that purpose at $300,000, to evaluate leveraging the target team to the extent possible to enhance their coverage instead of Monday through Thursday to be seven days a week, and to provide funding for outreach and partner organizations to make engagement out in the field in the hopes of connecting individuals to services. And then the last set of actions would be to approve and code the plan for the park and waterways that we're going to enforce, and to provide funding for the city's public health department to implement the concept and anticipate funding for evaluating environmental and planning assessments associated with a non-convict shelter at $100,000 up to $100,000. And with that I'll turn it back to the Mayor for further discussion. Do we have any specific questions for staff before we open up? Comment from the public? I have a couple. Chris, come back. Nice try. The $700,000 for the sanctioned camp operations, and forgive me for not being able to follow all this, this is or is not the emergency camp that the skipper talked about at the beginning? It is. $700,000 for now on January 31st? Correct. It's an estimate that involves... It's close enough. So that would be an ongoing expense if we couldn't close that campground down? So if we go three more months it's going to be another $700,000? That's my question. The emergency directive would only go through January 31st? I realize that, and it sounds nice, but then you're going to come back January 31st and say, hey, we want to kick all these guys out? No council's going to approve that. The alignment here would be the $160,000 that we're trying to... Okay. So the $160,000 that we're trying to... So $700,000 short-term to January, then we jump forward. The short-term shelter beds, that's CDBG funds, so it's not coming from us, kind of, sort of. Short-term is how long? Six months? It would be within the three months. That's what short-term shelter beds means. We get them in the short-term or they're available for short periods of time? Oh, that's through July, correct? July 31st. Yeah, that's through July 31st of next year. 2021. Correct. But they'd be there permanently? They'd go away? It's a short-term shelter beds. No. I mean, again, since we're looking at the immediacy part of it, none of the solutions end up, aside from the 50-bed expansion, goes, you know, for multi-years in the future. Okay. The goal is we're working on the short-term now to get it in place to work on the longer-term expansion to be able so when we start to shut down, we're shifting folks into longer-term. Okay. Solutions. Okay. Last detailed question for staff. Madam Mayor, thank you. Except for the $300,000 for Action 13A, the 50-bed expansion would be permanent? Correct. Thank you. Just to clarify, you said the short-term ends in July. I think we have the option of extending that? Yeah. There's some unique attributes to the location that we're working with. Right now, that would be an impediment to having that as a more permanent option. I mean, we would love to have it along the kin of the Homekey program. I thought when we earlier spoke that we have the option to extend it through the end of the year. So the first option we had discussed with council was the nonprofit would have done a five-year lease with an extension to a year. This is a different facility. That goes from congregate to non-congregate. So this is a more ideal solution because it's a more non-congregate solution. The original one was congregate, which is not ideal. Thank you. And then the Jesus Center project is scheduled to be online in March before the July 31st vetting. Okay. And there are a couple things that are not included on our plan that we're currently vetting. There is some additional funding coming from the state. We're not at liberty to fully disclose because, again, we haven't vetted it yet. But there are two different opportunities with that funding that will be more permanent. So that's why this plan presented today looks different than it did two weeks ago. Things are evolving pretty quickly. This is the short-term plan as those mid-range plans are being developed. Otherwise, we're stuck in the same place. So we're going to have to wait and see. Other questions, comments? I have a quick question. Mr. Orme, you might be able to answer this. On the 1.2 , the $700,000, how much of that could potentially be something that we might be purchasing that could be a hard asset? Is there, could you say 20%, 25%? Or is there a hard asset included in that money? Yeah, that's a great question. So a good chunk of it could be long-term use. I mean, one of the things that we're looking at is, you know, one of the things that we have staff, and I mentioned it a little bit, but let me hit harder on that, is that, you know, a tent structure potentially we could have long-term for any emergency in the future. The showering facilities potentially. I don't think we're looking at buying porta-potties, but that obviously could be something we look at. But there are a number of hard assets that we could potentially have for emergencies in the future. I can't really give you a percentage until I really have that in front of me. And I know that our public works team is working diligently with Ms. Calkins. I think we have a lot of outcomes to get that together in the next week or two here. I think that just helps give a little bit of perspective to people at home. $700,000 to tent camp is a lot of money. So if they understand that there's some actual assets that we will have in the end, seeing as how emergencies seem to come our way often. $700,000 for three months? Yeah, and just... That was my point. And I think it's important for council to hear concerns. We have the same concerns, staff. We don't feel fully confident with this either. So I just want you to know that. But we heard council loud and clear that you wanted a camp to be brought back. This is the only thing that comes close to being able to facilitate it this time. So that's the reason why it's being brought back. But we do not have full faith and confidence that this is the right thing to do. That's why I really need to get feedback from this council. So thank you. Does... Does taking... Does approving action 1.2 see the sanctioned camp operating? Does the operation for $700,000, does that... If we approve that, does that commit us to that location? Or could... Could we still be searching for another location to use those funds for? If there is not a high level of confidence in that location, then definitely let me know and we'd have to search for another. But we've been searching for a location for almost a year. So that's the problem. But if you don't believe that the airport site is the right thing to do, if it is the appropriate location, I would not... If I were council, I would not approve the $700,000. And then that will give me a clear signal that you don't want me to declare that location to be a viable location. Yeah, so I'll jump on that then. I know that initially maybe I had signaled that I thought that that was a good option. But the more I think about it, I think the difficulty of... getting people to go out or transporting them out there, I think it's going to be problematic and I don't want to set us up for failure. And I think that trying to get them out, trying to get that population to move to the airport could set us up for failure. But where... How do we... I just... Keeping the situation as it is sets the whole community up for failure, in my opinion. Madam Mayor? Yes? We still have public speakers on this item as well? Yes. People were giving comments. Did anybody else have any comments? Okay. One other comment I was going to ask, I was going to make about the cost. Mr. Morgan had said is the only thing permanent. I would suggest that perhaps the park and waterways cleanup, while not permanent, is an expense that we're going to have either way. And the fire risk assessment will be a point in time, but should have a life for a period of time. So, I'm just bringing those points up. Okay. So, let's hear from the public. How many people did we have in engaged Chico? We had five comments provided. And we have any emails? Yes. We received three. And how many members of the public are here in person that would like to address us? We have nine speakers. Nine speakers. Okay. So, let's get the speakers queued up. They can each speak for three minutes. We will read the comments that we have received. Can you please read the names of the people who submitted comments? Yes. Comments in engaged were received from Angela McLaughlin, Jamie Damon, Will Brady, Jackie Smith, Kim Dietz. And then the public comment, the emails, Grace Marvin, Diane Suzuki-Brown,! Are you ready to read the comments? Yes. Let's bring our first speaker in. Okay. The first speaker is Charles Withoon, followed by Rhonda Magnuson. Good evening. Good evening. Counselors and staff, thank you very much for this opportunity. I have to start with a question that has not been brought up. A relevant part of the Homeless Opportunities Plan before you tonight is the need for more explanation of the criteria that was used that rendered city parcels not viable. Can you say if any of the criteria that was used to jury the vacant city property, the property that was used to jury the vacant city property, was dated? Maybe before the shelter crisis declaration? Maybe before the campfire? Maybe before the bear fire? Maybe before COVID? The criteria that was used may have been valid under previously typical circumstances. I've heard these arguments. I've heard the criteria. I've heard some of them. That was before the last federal law. Before the four crises. Now we are faced with multiple new crises that warrant old criteria for judging city properties to be reevaluated. I request an explanation of the criteria. There is the Chico Chamber of Commerce employee who tells the story of having to walk around a dead guy to get to work one morning. There is the rape of a homeless woman outside who was ten minutes late getting to the shelter. Daily tragedies such as these unfolding at an ever increasing rate were unheard of in my Chico in the 70s, 80s, and 90s. Our current crises have precipitated the most sad and urgent human emergency to hit the streets and parks of Chico in my life. It has been suggested that we use $6 million to completely fund the city's emergency reserve. By any measure, we are in the emergency of our lives right now. You probably heard about the guy they found on the street in Oroville the other night. Opportunity Village. A tiny home village. The city's largest community college in Eugene was launched for $100,000 cash and $100,000 in kind donations. The mayor of Sacramento has announced his city will fund 500 tiny homes for local nonprofits as well as provide trash and water. The mayor of Seattle calls tiny homes the most successful shelter program we have and their council recently voted to allow 40 more tiny home villages. In Marysville, the 14 Ford Village has won the state's first $1 million in a year. This year, the city has won a state award. With all the new black steel bars on the entryways of our downtown. Oh, is it time? Yeah. Can I ask you a quick question, Charles? Thank you very much. Charles, can I ask you a quick question? Yes. You've named a few of these different kinds of sites and tiny home villages throughout the area. Do you know the cost of the Marysville model that has been highly awarded? I could get you that information. I don't have it off the top of my head. But, you know, these are expenses that are being paid. pale compared to the expenses of our emergency services, our hospital unreimbursed services. This is an important thing that we approve the homeless opportunities package that you have in front of you this evening. Thank you. Thank you. Rhonda Magnuson, followed by Patrick Newman. Hello. I'm going to have somebody do me a favor up there if you've got a computer. Can you go on there and can you find out the homeless rate from 2015 until now? I think you'll find it's that 93% rise. I think that was in March of 2019 to now will be probably about 100%. I am one of that 93%. I do not choose to be out here. Your encampment will not work. You cannot get these people in wheelchairs. You cannot get them out there. People are not going to be brutalized. They're not going to be terrorized. They're not going to be abused. This is what's happening. Ms. Joy, I would love to have one of those 50 beds at the shelter. I have been begging for almost three years now. Please, please, please, please, please. Ms. Joy, I would like for you to tell them why I am not allowed shelter. Ms. Magnuson? No, see, this is the whole thing. You're not understanding. You're not understanding. To address the council. If you've got the people that are doing the hating, the services are not being provided. These beds are not being put into because people are sick and tired of the lies, the slander, the defamation of character. I am being arrested on a daily basis. Never in my 50 years of life did I have a criminal record. I get arrested, what was it, 20 times in eight months because you got arrested. You guys want me off the street because I'm camping when you don't want me to camp. I'm staying safe. I'm staying where I know. I'm a creature of habit. The Jesus Center is my safety around there. I do not go into 20th Street parks. I don't do drugs. I don't use alcohol. I stay clear. Clear. I want one of those beds. I need one of those beds. I need it desperately. And I've been begging for it over and over again with the police department, with Mr. Stone sitting up there, knows me personally. Don't you, Mr. Stone? Who? And I've been asking you for what, two and a half years to sit down and have a conversation with me? Well, yeah, you know, sir, I'm still asking. So if you decide you want to find the truth, you want to solve the problem, I can show you documentation. I can show you video. I can show you research. It does one thing. It proves your problem with the homeless is absolutely 110% fault of the services. 110% fault of hatred and non-understanding. So, Mr. Stone, I am still asking you. I'm still here on this street, and I still want a bed. Thank you. Thank you. There it is. Have a nice evening, Mom. Patrick Newman, followed by Larry Halstead. I, too, have been coming here for seven and a half years or more. Grundle, Sorenson, Morgan, Stone, now Schwab again. I'm sorry, but the bullshit is as deep as it ever was tonight. I don't think our city manager is any closer to really understanding people on the street. And I've said this before. I don't think he spends any time with people on the street. I don't think most of you spend any real time with people in the public space who live there. So that you can get any kind of grasp of what their day-to-day experience is like and what might actually be appropriate versus what's being proposed here. This whole notion that I heard expressed tonight that somehow for seven and a half years we've been sort of letting this slide. That's some of the deepest bullshit I've heard here tonight. This is one month. I've shown you this a dozen times. This is one month arrest log. August of 2019. We don't need camping regulations to arrest people. Roll them in and out of Butte County Jail. This has been status quo for seven and a half years. This is what we do. This is an industry. Something like a third or 40% of our policing goes into just rolling people in and out of Butte County Jail. Moving people along. Profiling. Arresting. On what? Well, drug paraphernalia. A failure to appear on some kind of a minor case. Under charge like jaywalking. I'm not making this up. This is at the core of how we do policing of these people. So a program like Friends on the Street where we've been meeting with people in the city plaza every Sunday for five years now. That's 250 of my Sundays I've been out there. We've spent $50,000 out there just meeting people's needs for sleeping bags, charts, etc. etc. etc. That kind of contact with people which builds rapport. Builds some kind of mutual respect. That has no place in this discussion whatsoever. No place. No place for any funding for the needs of people that are on the streets. In fact, we're removing more from them. So in my three minutes, I don't have time to go down this checklist. I wish I did. Because every single one of these numbers is very problematic. Every single one of them. Because I put that $50,000 over five years. And what it took to get that. Including $25,000 out of my own pocket. In the context of these numbers. For what we're talking about here. It's outrageous. And this whole thrust toward pushing people toward a facility with really a gun to the head whether you want to say so or not. Is not a human rights position. It's not a civil liberties position. And it sucks. Larry Halstead followed by Ulyss Gordon. Followed by Nancy Park. Quality of life plan. There's some irony in that title. Quality of life for whom? It appears that this quality of life plan is being driven by the right wing conservatives that are all behind this war on homelessness. You want to take and basically intern homelessness. You want to outlaw it. We've been doing that all along. You've been doing that through your justice system. This city has a huge police problem. They're bloating your budget. But they're also going to cause you a lot more stress on your financial. You try and enforce these kind of things. And you're going to find out you're going to have more of the judicial system that you've got to hire. And that's just the beginning of it. I'm concerned that. When the city manager was describing the plan. It kind of showed his colors in terms of his conservative leanings. And whom he really represents. But this plan is a failed plan from the beginning. You guys have not surveyed the homeless. Why don't the homeless want to go to Torrey Shelter? Have you been spending a night there? Do you want to subject to those kind of conditions? Do you want to sleep in a tent out in the parking lot? You know there's all of these ills of society. And I know those that want to turn back the clock. 40 years, 20 years or whatever. I'm sorry that ain't going to happen. I'm from a small town. This is the biggest city I've ever lived in. I've lived in small towns all my life. The ills that you're addressing here. First of all it's bad science. Stop blaming the homeless for your water quality on these rivers. They are not contributing. Action News did a study on this. They brought a biologist. Did you guys survey a biologist about this problem that you want to keep laying on them? Let's talk about the war on drugs. That created a big huge hunk of your homelessness. And it continues to do so. What it should teach you is that when you try and litigate it. When you stand up for the law and order people. That have always been on the wrong side of the history. You're going to create a lot more litigation for yourself. And a lot more problems. The budget you've created for this plan. Way out of control. But you haven't seen nothing. Like the lawsuit from when someone is wrongfully killed by the police. Wrongful arrested. Wrongful incarceration. And I'm here to say that as someone who's engaged in the legal system. Quite a bit in my past. That I'm going to be front and center on issues like. Right now the governor has a mandate. You can't evict people from their homes. If that park is their home. How are you going to evict them? The drug problem is not the homeless problem. That's everybody's problem. The little fires. Whose problem is it? Thank you very much. Our next speaker is Nancy Park. Followed by Emily Alma. Jack Lee. And Jeff Creed. I am a volunteer and board member for Chico Housing Act. And I am part of the Chico Housing Action Team. However I am making this statement as a private individual. Not as a CHAT representative. I only mention CHAT. To indicate I have great concern for homeless people. And I'm doing what I can to be part of the solution. My question to you. Council and staff. Why don't we already have a designated campground for folks camping in parks and greenways. When we are seven months into this pandemic. And we are already in the middle of a pandemic. Yes you have all had seven months to make this happen. And now tonight you are suggesting sending people way out to the airport. That's the best you can come up with. And it's been two years since the City Council declared a shelter crisis in Chico. Yet no additional shelter beds or transitional housing have been added. And no tiny house villages are in place. And I am very grateful to the City Council. And now we are facing another winter with vulnerable people on the streets. My favorite place to walk is Comanche Creek Greenway. Thousands of volunteer hours went into creating this greenway. Including the planting of many native species. About a month ago I went there to walk the loop for the first time in many weeks. It was filled with dozens of campsites. Damaging this beautiful natural area. And the other two years. And trampling down the native plants that the volunteers spent thousands of hours working on. And the people there aren't receiving any social services to get out of their situation. I felt angry. Heartbroken. And conflicted. In fact I wept. Because Chico has a major housing crisis. We must do something to help members of our community who are unhoused. We must do something. We must also do something to bring the Comanche Creek Greenway and all our parks back to what they were. I believe both can be done. It's not an either-or thing. It's not a conservative liberal thing. But the council must act and act now. Thank you. Emily Alma, followed by Jack Lee, and then Jeff Crean. Hello. I came tonight to insist that as soon as possible, you provide an emergency campground so that people aren't stuck out in the cold and the rain. Hopefully we'll get some rain soon. And then I heard the city manager's proposal to put people out west of the airport, which sounds like, I haven't seen the place, but it sounds sort of like I'm reminded of moving Native Americans from their homes to a place where life wasn't possible to really live. And I'm, I hope that there's a way that something else can be provided for people who are camping that I don't think it's going to work. I think it's dead on arrival. I don't think people are going to be willing and they can't be forced to go there, although they might be under arrest if they don't go there and they don't want to go to the tourist shelter. Or aren't qualified. So it's a terrible situation, but I think that there has to be a humane place to put up a campground where people can have a decent life. They are human beings. They're not scum. They're people, we just lost a community member who was homeless. Sounds like he had drug problems and mental illness problems. He's still a human being who was hurting terribly. He scared people. And yes, it was scary. And I don't know what the circumstances were, truly, of his death. But this is a human issue. And people who are difficult in our community are people who are hurting, who we don't know what their backgrounds are, but they have to be treated like human beings and be provided for in ways that are humane. So I'm just, I don't have any solutions because the airport, giving people rides to services, but they're stuck out there so far away from anything, just doesn't seem like the solution. And somehow it seems like there must be a way. There must be a way to replace somewhere in Chico that would work and be humane. Thank you. Jack Lee, followed by Jeff Creed. Jack Lee, 12 Victoria Way, Chico, homeowner. Thank you. And I had a number of bullet points. I have a number of bullet points prepared here, but I can see I'm not going to be able to get through a third of them. So I'll just speak to you personally, coming from the gut here. I appreciate people wanting to help the impoverished, the homeless. I'm not against that. I feel horrible that we have a lot of needy people out there that aren't being reached. But at the same time, I see a lot of other people who are in need of help. Who are capable, who are mentally well, who are physically able, who are living a different lifestyle for whatever reason. We're coming up with a one-size-fits-all plan. And I'm very skeptical that this plan is going to do anything except spend a lot of money, create a little bureaucracy. And once we've created that bureaucracy, it's going to be real interesting to see how we get rid of it. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I don't know. And I don't think you guys know either. And I think we need to know the population that we're reaching out to to effectively coordinate some kind of response, if that's what you want to do. And I don't think anybody really knows. Because that population is really mixed with kids, bums, junkies, people kicked out of group homes because they turned 18, all kinds of problem people, and some chronically mentally ill people. And we're going to put them in a tent city out here on the west side of the airport. Have you been out there in January or February? I've been out there every year for the last six years. And I can tell you when the wind whips through Chico, it really whips through out there. You're going to put them in a tent city? That ought to be interesting. And I don't think that people out there living in that area are going to appreciate the folks that are going to be there. I think you're going to have a real problem. And the cost that I see, I don't know. I say, my gosh, I think it would be cheaper to give these guys a $5,000 check and bus ticket and ask them to leave town than it would be to put them up here in Chico. The cost per bed is astronomical. So, again, I'm just very skeptical. And I appreciate what you're doing. And I thank you for your time. Thank you. Our last speaker is Jeff Creed. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Go Go Go and now you're paying the price for it, and you're trying to do it in the fourth quarter when there's a thunderstorm on the ridge and you're sitting on the roof trying to put up tarts. It's a joke, and it's negligence. It's negligence by the people in this city, in this room. There's no excuse for that level of negligence in any business. No excuse in any business. Find me a business person that would hire somebody who only works when you come to him and say, hey, your job's on the line. Oh, now I need to start thinking about tomorrow other than just today. Nobody's going to keep that employee. They're going to fire him. They're going to fire him quick. Why? Because he's going to cost that business money, right? And what's happening right here, right now? That business, the city, is being drained of much-needed funds on problems that should have been handled and planned for years ago. It's just disgusting. And now you want to give this lawyer's company more money? You know, there's firms out there that do just code enforcement. Why don't you put that portion out to bid? This guy, you know, when Rob Berry can stand up here and correct him on a city issue, that's embarrassing. And, you know, this is just another nimby plan so that the police can selectively enforce camping around certain counselors' homes and push it into the rest of the city. If you're not going to do it citywide, if you're not going to enforce it citywide, then why bother? There's a great video of a mayor from Texas that talks about how she took her city to the top five. Took her city to the top five. You guys are taking a lot of money. So we close the public hearing. We're being asked to do three things. First, provide direction on the three-year plan to improve. First, improve the district's quality of life. We're being asked to authorize up to $1.8 million for various actions. And three, to approve the concept of and anticipate potential approval funding for costs associated for the BMX completion and a non-congregate emergency shelter solution. So what kind of funding? What kind of direction on the three-year plan do we have for the city manager? I'll start if no one else wants to. As far as the three-year part, my first thought is it reminds me of the 20-year renewable plan to end homelessness in 10 years. Well, we have to start somewhere. And while staff made it clear, and Skipper, you started, I'm sorry, these aren't necessarily plans. This is the semblance of a strategy that we can move forward with. I think you all took some heat tonight that was unwarranted. Like I've said about climate change, I've said about homelessness, I've said about affordable housing, a lot of what's happening in our city is not the fault of the council, the policy, the staff. It's California. It's something we have to deal with. I'm concerned about some of the costs, and I know we'll get to that, but I'll get to that in a minute. So as far as the three-year plan moving forward, I don't even know that it needs a time. I think as you and your staff said numerous times, and Susie said at least three times, there's things they can't tell us about. There's things that are being firmed up in the next week. We're not ready. But, wow, you've come a long, long way. We've all come a long way from the original ACT initiative that the Jesus and the Church, the Jesus Center has now moved out and gone on their own. That's not criticism of them. I understand the skipper coming forward because at his wit's end, because he's hearing from council members and staff and the public going, what's happening to our parks and waterways, and this is crazy, what can we do? You had to give us something. And sometimes that's the only way to get towards something that might work is to give something that might not work. So there was no perfect. I don't think anybody expected it. Well, some people clearly did, but there is none. And that's true for all the staff. So I think the only direction we need to give on that particular item, and then we can move into the other stuff. Obviously we want a three-year plan to improve Chico's quality of life for everybody. I will admit I was beyond disturbed at the survey. It was non-scientific. It could have come from anywhere. It said nothing. It bothers me that we spent staff time on that. I think the fact that it was shared was unprofessional. And this isn't an attack on anybody that did it, but somebody should have stopped that from happening. It could have come from the cloud. It just didn't make any sense. But it's also not necessary. We know what quality of life means. We know what our priorities are. Do we want the staff to continue to move forward in making this the best, friendliest place for people that want to live here? Well, of course we do, which gets us to point two, and we have to start doing some things even though we can't do everything. But it's a failure on everybody's part. It's a failure on the state. It's a failure on the federal government. If somebody blamed Ronald Reagan, that's fine. We can blame him too. But what we can't do is become a full-service service organization. And we have service organizations that will do that. And I think one of our expectations has to be that they will step up and work together more. And I think I see that with the appointment of your homeless coordinator. We had one. We had another. I respect them both. They're working together. Some other people aren't. But I don't know that there's specific direction on that to give, Madam Mayor, other than to say, yes, obviously continue to focus on these things that will make this better for everybody. And then what do you need from us, which gets us to number two, to make things better in the short term while we don't spend all of the money we have on something that could be done and gone in three months? So I don't have specific direction other than to say, yes, continue. And thank you for acknowledging that this is the beginning of a plan. This is the beginning of a strategy. I don't know that three years is – it's not going to take you three years to make improvements. You have to make improvements every day. I think what I hear in your frustration, Sean, is the amount of money for something that is really short-term. I guess I ask you, what else can we do? We've heard from people that, you know, the west side of the airport isn't an ideal place. Well, no, it's not. But we have been looking for seven months, seven years for a spot, and we keep running into hurdles. You know? No, I'm not throwing that out. You asked me. I asked about number one. Oh, okay. Which, no, I was only speaking to the three-year plan to improve Chico's quality of life. And then I figured we would probably get to number two. Okay. Which we may dice it up a little bit, or we may not. I was just saying, as far as provide direction on the three-year plan to improve Chico's quality of life, that should always be part of the plan. This is one component of that plan. We'd expect that it would do that anyway. And I was trying to give appreciation where I think it was due. And an acknowledgement of there is no perfect. Well, what I do appreciate is having the plan. Something that we can be measured on and what our progress is and having it articulated is something that can bring people together and say, this is what we are doing. Even if it is just a plan. But we can, it's kind of like a mission statement. Right, Sean? If everybody understands what the mission statement is for an organization, it's a mission statement. If everybody understands what the mission statement is for an organization, then people can make decisions that are related to that. This is something Sean teaches in his class. And if we... No, but I worked with enough of your students that I understand that concept and I really appreciate it. If everyone understands what our goal is and the strategies to make those, that goal, then people can make decisions. It's kind of like, does this fit in with the plan? Or it doesn't fit into the plan. Do we want to expand the plan so it does? But it makes choices easier if someone has a plan. So I do appreciate that. I appreciate that it recognizes that we need a short-term solution, mid-term solution, and a long-term solution. Casey. Can I piggyback on that just for a second? I'm going to call you Ms. Susie because I hate butchering your last name. But I see a specific ask here saying, how can we build a plan? How can we best expand the conversation and develop a comprehensive plan involving city staff residents? Is there something that you had in mind or something that you're needing that you would like for us to move on tonight? I hate to say, God forbid, another ad hoc committee, but are you needing a specific direction or is that something that you feel comfortable taking the reins on? No, I don't think we need specific direction. But in hearing a lot of comments here this evening, and also putting some of the comments from the survey together, it's obvious that there are some strong opinions about what is right and wrong. There might be some opportunity to consult some of those big voices, if you will, in the community, and have them put some plans together. I don't know what it's going to look like. Okay. Thank you. Go ahead, Council Member Heber. Thank you. So it's, I think it's pretty clear from everything that we've been hearing and reading that quality of life is sort of intimately entwined with housing. Either, you know, the inability to have housing or having housing. If I were to provide direction on a three-year plan to improve Chico's quality of life, I would look to the city of Santa Rosa, and the strategic plan that they put together to incorporate a housing-first model into their community. And that seems to have really solved a lot of the quality of life problems related to unsheltered people and housing. So that would be my recommendation. City of Santa Rosa. Okay. City of Santa Rosa's strategic plan for housing first. Just to piggyback on that a little bit, I've read that plan as well, and I appreciate you bringing that into the conversation, Council Member Heber. And to touch on some of Mayor Schwab's comments as well, of course having a plan is better than not having a plan. Also, having measurable outcomes is better than not having measurable outcomes. And so I think as we move forward, and creating a plan that hopefully prioritizes housing first as an option, I'd like to see what we're measuring the outcomes against and what we're looking for. And so I think that's the next element of any strategic plan. I'd also like to see, you know, this is a significant investment, and zero dollars are going toward any sort of housing that's permanent. And I would love to see some portion of this dedicated toward funding North Valley Housing Trust and their work to get affordable housing online, working on some sort of tiny home village concept locally. I think that these are really things that this Council have been asking for over and over and over again. And I want to speak to the sanctioned campsite, because I believe that to be something that this Council has also asked for over and over and over again. I appreciate something being brought forward, and I really do look forward to it. But being the chair of the Greater Chico Homeless Task Force, I've been, you know, had service providers share that they're working on best practices for sanctioned campgrounds, doing the research, studying other communities. And what I'm consistently hearing is that it's better to start smaller and to do these different types of sites, you know, to have three different sites that the city, that are being managed, hopefully by service providers, and by the city's partners and volunteers. What I can tell you is I highly doubt that we're going to get service providers to manage this particular concept as it's being presented to us. For many of the reasons that Council Member Huber cited, some of the reasons that I spoke to a little bit earlier, I would love for us to revisit using the old CHP parking lot as a starting place. I heard staff's concerns on that. It's a smaller, more controlled environment. I believe that you're going to have service providers that are ready and willing to step up to help manage that. And it's a place where we can work out the kinks and make sure that we're doing this right and have it be smaller. And so if we're going to direct funding toward anything related to camping, I would like for us to maybe look at that as an option. Those are my comments. Do we have any estimate of how many people are living in our open spaces? I know that the homeless point in time count has a little south of 400, but... Yes, we've been trying to figure that question out for some time, so Susie. I know I can talk to you a little bit about Target Team's estimate on the number that are in Bidwell Park is approximately 45 to 50. That's all? Mm-hmm. That's just at Bidwell Park. Seems like there's 45 to 50 between Mangrove and... I thought it sounded a little low to me, but that was their estimate. Okay. Other feedback on the plan? I'm going to concur with my colleagues that the campsite located out at the airport will be problematic. I mean, I appreciate why you're bringing it forward. But in every community that we've talked to, that I've talked to, that if we're warehousing the poor, that's that technical term for that, warehousing them off to a remote location, while ideal for some community members and addressing their concerns, is going to create problems. And I will also reiterate the re-look at the CHP building. We have physical facilities, evidence, vehicles, et cetera. That can and should be re-located to that remote space, because it's easier to deal with that on a remote basis, I have to believe, rather than shuttling human beings day in and day out to a remote campsite space. It seems that somewhere along that FAA line, we must have some space where we can ensure the protection of evidence towards that end. So I'm highly suspicious. Skeptical, whatever you want to call it. I don't think we've seen any of these work in remote locations ever. But in a statement towards the exasperation of staff, I get it. And appreciate you mentioning it here. I'm just, I don't think that's going to work. Ms. Cockrums, have we considered looking at sort of a more dispersed model for sanctioned campgrounds rather than one large campground? Yeah, we've had multiple conversations about it. I think everybody believes that that's a great approach. I think where we're lacking is the number of service providers. I have one service provider right now that is the only one that's interested, at least that I have mentioned were interested. And they have some ducks they've got to put in a row before that will even happen. Multiple locations means multiple staff members. And for Vice Mayor Brown, if you have service providers that you're aware of that would be interested in potentially running sanctioned camping, please have them get in contact with me because my outreach is not providing that same result. They were at the meeting that you attended, the Greater Chico Almost Task Force meeting. Yeah. You're welcome. Would it be helpful to have a staff member that would be interested in potentially running a sanctioned camping? Yeah, that would be helpful to move into Section 2 that would help us allocate funds or give that direction. And then that would help provide the feedback to the plan and to the strategic priorities. Okay. I think that would be... I think that would be a good idea. I think it would be helpful. It would help provide some direction. I just also want to reiterate that multiple speakers, staff speakers, said we're not quite there. It's not all articulated. I'm already... I don't necessarily have an opinion one way or the other, but I think Skipper's already feeling pressure against the airport spot. I know he's looked at a gazillion other places. I don't know exactly what he's going to do there. So my caution is that we... I don't spend a million eight dollars on something that has been articulated not to be finalized. But to your point earlier, Madam Mayor, there are some things that we can do... I'll just keep going. We can do immediately that I can get behind really quickly. One of those is expanding existing emergency shelter beds by 50. We know it helps. It's not a permanent solution for a person, but it's a permanent bed. If that helps True North. If it helps us meet the need of the campers and say, hey, look, you need to go to this place. It's available. I know it's not multiple options. I'm not sure how I feel about the multiple options. If you don't like here, you can go here. We could do that all day. So I can certainly get behind the expanding emergency shelter beds by 50. The fire risk assessment, that's a question for the fire chief if it needs to be done. I think he knows that. The code enforcement I'm fine with. The public works request thing I'm fine with. The park and waterways cleanup is going to happen anyway. The thing that scares me the most, quite frankly, is the $700,000 for three months of the campground knowing two things. A, it's not going to go away after 90 days. And this council or any council I don't think is going to say, okay, shut that down and where are those people going to go? And we can't afford $700,000 for three months for very long. But it sounds like. It sounds like we're giving pushback on that site anyway. So whether it's a different site or whether we ask to work with the BMX track location, which is close to the Torrey shelter anyway, I don't know. I can get behind most of this. It's the $700,000 in three months that I have a hard time with. Would you be supportive of any dollar amount for something that would be short term for a couple of months? Well, I would have to weigh that against the fact that I can get. So, Joy, can I ask you a question? Yes. If you can do 50 beds for $300,000, can you do 100 for $600,000? Or are you limited by space? Right. So we're just gutting the inside. Yeah. And then just making it so that we can put more bunks in. So it's not like we're actually adding square footage. Right. Yeah. So. And if we did even more than that, we would have to. We would have to add more bathrooms, more showers. All those things. It would be huge. So the 50 beds was to do an immediate way to. We moved the families out. And so we're able to, you know, do that. And that's a quick and easy addition. Okay. I didn't mean to put you on the spot. I thought I knew the answer. Can I ask you a couple questions? Yeah. Let me. But stay here. But, Madam Mayor, to your point, actually to Ms. Brown's point. I'm not going to articulate it well, but you said something about, you know, these things are more successful when we start small. And that's what scares me. And I say it jokingly when I talk about the Taj Mahal, whether that's your long-term plan or the Jesus Center long-term plan. There's these multimillion-dollar things that we're going to build perfection and we're never going to get there. And I think what the Skipper tried to bring us tonight, and we're trying to get to. And, Ms. Schwab, I appreciate your point. Are there smaller steps that we can take to see if this is having an impact? And continue to go down that road before we spend unbelievable amounts of money and lock ourselves into more? Sorry. No, no. Ms. Morrow, so I feel like I recall that this is this kind of sheltering, the 160-bed short-term sheltering is like a stopgap measure between another effort. Is there two things. One, is there plans? Would there be plans for the tourist shelter of Trudy, New York? Or would there be plans for the North to continue funding this privately or through other means? Two, is there other plans or projects in the works? So the 50-bed expansion, we had received a $50,000 donation towards that project. We have not begun any sort of capital campaign efforts because, as you can imagine, I stepped away for four months. And pandemic, what have you. So pre-pandemic. We were at capacity. Nearly 160 beds filled every single night. And then we slowly dwindled off because of COVID, right? And so a few of the comments that have been made tonight, we are having around 30 to 40 beds. I know everyone keeps nailing the 50, you know. But I also wanted to mention that we have we're still housing people. So because we have this ebb and flow, it's because we have successes. We have a success every day. And so I want to put that out there, too. It's not just paint this negative bleak picture because we are continuing to house people. Anywhere from five to ten people a month, which is huge amongst our climate. So that's why you see the ebbs and the flows. With us moving into the orange tier, we'll be working closely with public health to modify our entry policies for the COVID test because I know that that's a barrier. I personally still have reservations around that, especially when you have someone that's extremely mentally ill and you're doing symptom assessments. So those are my reservations, and that's just me protecting my guests and my staff. As far as other projects in the works, we do have ideas. They're conceptual. One is increasing capacity at another service provider. They just need to be kept in the office. They need to be connected to the sewer. And then we can offer sober living beds. Another, looking at additional outputs so that we can then increase our bed capacity internally as we are outputting people since we don't have permanent housing, if that makes sense. So a more transitional experience within the continuum. So that's kind of where we're at. But again, and then going back to the stop gap. Yes. So we, that's in fact correct. There is ESG, COVID ESG federal funding that Susie kind of alluded to that will be funneled through the COC, about $5.7 million. For Butte County. Pardon me? For Butte County. Mm-hmm. And so it's how do we create a plan around that? But that's all on the COC level. Sure. And that's going to take months. If there's RFPs that have to be put out. And what have you. So we're not going to be able to utilize that right away. Mm-hmm. The potential plans of the 160 stop gap would just essentially bias time. It'll bias time for when Project Roomkey ends. So we're not discharging people to the street. That's that CDBG, CV funds that's listed up there. And we have two options on the table that we're continuing to apply. One is to explore. And so either way, hopefully, we have a plan A and a plan B. And so we have a backup plan, if you will. If funded, if funds are awarded, we can move forward. But yeah, it's definitely, it's a stop gap with hopefully the continuum with the funds coming through the federal ESG. Plus there's the HAP funds. And I think there's a second round of HAP funds coming as well that we'll be able to fund the staffing needed for the additional 50 beds at Torres. Mm-hmm. And as well as extend the stop gap program that we currently have funding for. If that makes sense. Yeah, thank you. Appreciate the information. Ms. Amaru, maybe. Sorry. Welcome back. It's okay. Maybe Suzy might be the better person, but I know we've talked about Project Roomkey in the past. And it keeps getting extended, it seems. Do you have any, you know, if you had a crystal ball, how long would that last? So we actually talked about that. I don't even know what day it was. It all runs together. Yeah. And so the way that that has traditionally happened is the governor has set up a plan. And so the governor has set up a plan to ask FEMA for an extension. And that always happens like the day before the end of the month. And so it's, you know, it causes havoc. And so the county, according to Don Taylor, the program administrator of the home branch of DES, indicated that the county would be willing to foot the bill for a week or two after when it does end so that we're just not exiting people immediately. Mm-hmm. So again, that's based on the governor's ask to FEMA. Do you have any idea how many people in the north county are in the program? Sure. Approximately 100 people as of last week. 20 of them, and then an additional 20 are caretakers. So I would say 120 folks. And then collectively the program has served over 300 people and has almost rehoused about 90. So it has a really good success rate with exits. I was just thinking, you know, that $700,000 is a big chunk of change. And what are other ways that we could allocate those funds? But it sounds like Project Roomkey is at its capacity now. It is. I think it is because most of the participating motels are full. Mm-hmm. And so that's why they had to cap it anyways because the available rooms, especially in north county, were not available. Okay. Thank you. Can I? Sorry. Yes, you may. Ms. Reynolds had something she wanted to say. Just a real quick clarification. The short-term shelter beds, the $657,000, that's CDBG funds? That's not our money. I mean, it is our money. That's not general fund money. That's a question. Yeah, it's the $282,000. Oh, the $657,000. That's what I was just going to clarify. Oh, that's the last one. Yeah, you're looking at the one. This is the renewal from tonight. Oh, the this one. We brought it down. That $600,000 and something was brought down to $282,000, and it is CDBG-CB, correct? That is CDBG-CB. It's non-general fund, yes. Thank you. Yep, you bet. That was exactly my question because the one on Granicus is a $657,000, but I had written down the $282,000. So we should be looking at... So I just want to make sure. Yeah, it's $282,933. Perfect. Thank you. So to follow up on Ms. Schwab's question, Skipper, if we were nervous about $700,000 for three months, so I'm not going to put you on the spot now, but is there a way that could be a lesser amount in a different spot? And I know you've looked at all kinds of different spots. I understand that. They're talking about the CHP building. They're talking about this, that. And the reason I'm asking the question is part of it, we could spend that $700,000 and find out nobody wanted to go to our campground. Right. And the money's gone, and now we have this cool shower facility or whatever. Yep. Is there a smaller way to test that while increasing Joy's capacity to 50? I mean, I'm going to say I think that's a foregone conclusion. My colleagues might not agree. Expand the existing shelter beds. Is there some way we can test our theory about whether these people will want to go and camp somewhere else anyway without spending that kind of money? That's a hypothetical question you're probably going to have to think about. Yeah. And it's also a discussion with the department heads again as well, because obviously we've evaluated all these sites throughout the entire city. And so I will definitely take it back, see if we can shrink it down some way on a different location, maybe using a portion of a piece of property. But I mean, obviously I've already looked at that, and I will do it again. No, I think... So yeah. I get where you're going. I get where council desires from the feedback I'm getting. And so I totally respect it too. I mean, I do. No, I know what you're saying. Yeah. Could I ask the chief a couple of questions? Sure. Specifically about the old CHP facility. You've expressed your concerns that you are using that facility for evidence, and I respect your concern for that. If the council still wanted to go forward with that facility, what would you say would it take for that evidence to be moved, and how much time would that take? I don't know. You don't know. I didn't think you would know. I'll be honest. I mean... I will say though that I wouldn't describe it as old CHP. I would describe it as a police facility. Thank you. Okay. Maybe Mr. Guts can talk about the remodel. His department's overseeing that, but we're working there. Oh. The back facility's already been remodeled. And all of your records division is now working out of there and will stay at that facility for... That's where they are. And so the remodel on the actual front building is already started. Okay. And that is actually going to be records, evidence, and your front counter, your actual where citizens are going to come. They're coming to that facility to create the space that we need because we're busting at the seams in the old facility. So... So that really isn't an option? In my view, no. I mean, we've invested all of our redevelopment funds into this project. We have contractors there every day. The project's up and running. So any questions regarding the remodel, I'd refer to Mr. Guts. Okay. So Mr. Orme, I appreciate how difficult it was for you to bring forward the proposal about the airport. I know it wasn't... Nobody loved it. And it was... You hate bringing something forward that's going to fall flat. But I think what you're hearing here is that we really, really, really want a sanctioned campground, but that doesn't appear like it's going to be the right place. So... You know, I like Councillor Morgan's idea about the possibility of approving a smaller amount for a smaller test area. But on the other hand, it seems like we might as well go... It seems like there's, at least as far as I'm hearing so far, there's an interest in the other action items other than the $700,000. So I'm just wondering if we should make a motion to approve those other action items under the second bullet point and leave out the $700,000 for the sanctioned campground until such time as we've got a workable spot for that. So I guess I would make that motion that we approve the other action items under bullet point two. Mr. Huber, would you consider including that last bullet point in the action item? I would call it the potential action of 1.3.C, which is the planning environmental assessment for a site for non-congregate sheltering, which I think came out of our last meeting, last discussion of... And that is the BMX site. Egress, egress. Egress, egress. And moving forward with that, with the potential of that site being... Maybe that's the tiny home village. Maybe that's the campsite. Maybe that's the location. We still have the hurdle of the equipment, but we decided not to go forward with that. And if we don't go forward with the sanctioned campground out by the airport, still have that $700,000 to consider putting into... And maybe not all of that amount into a campsite at the old BMX site. So I think you're asking whether or not I would include the $100,000 for the... Yes. Yes. The answer is yes. Can I ask a question? So Mr. Huber's motion is everything outside the $700,000 plus the $100,000 to check out the BMX spot. Yes. Which is fine. So one is a point of clarification and the other one is just a statement. Could the BMX site be used after that's done? Has a camping ground? Susie's nodding her head yes. Okay. So it's not immediate, but it's like... Okay. It's potential and then maybe it fits in with this larger plan. The other thing is just a point of clarification. There's not $700,000 that was allotted to this. That's just a number that they went here, 700. I just want to be careful that we don't vote not to use it and then think about, hey, we still have that 700 because I know that's what I would tend to do. Right? I didn't buy this thing over here. Therefore, I have saved the money. I can buy it over there. I get in trouble at home for that a lot. Okay. So Mr. Hu made a motion. Is there a second? I'm willing to support the $100,000 for the assessment of that site. I'm not willing in this motion to commit to moving, giving BMX $600,000. No. That is not part of it. In the previous discussion, we said that it was $600,000. In the previous discussion, it was we need to find out what the lay of the land is, what that situation is. That's a separate decision. Yeah. And quick point of clarification on that. I think that's up to $100,000 because it's an assessment, correct? Correct. It could come in only being $40,000, $50,000, $60,000, but we're allotting up to $100,000 to determine ingress, egress, what do we have to do for sewer, and could it be used, what's it zoned, and all that. Yeah. All these are conservative estimates. Okay. That's what I was... And did the Jesus Center not do that? Did the Jesus Center not do that or we just don't like theirs? Yeah. They did a lot, but that was still a problem that they hadn't quite solved yet, the ingress, egress, because of numerous reasons. So, yes. Did you get a second? I'll second. Okay. So we have a motion and a second to approve all of the supplemental appropriate appropriations except for 1.2.C. What's the total bill on that, if you were to do the math? The one on the revised. Oh, on the revised. The one on the revised. For the record? Yes. On the PowerPoint that's in front of everybody. Correct. So you've got what? So... The 600 whatever is actually 200 and something because it's from CDBG funds. Do you want to read those items? I don't need the whole thing read. I just... The city attorney was looking... Oh, I'm sorry. Absolutely. My question was specific as to item 1.2.C. There's two item 1.2.C's. There's the one on the agenda, the sheet that is different than the one on this. But we're not including 1.2.C. And 1.2.C on the agenda. And 1.2.C on this is being excluded. And this is the plan that was handed out tonight. Yeah. There's no 1.2.C on either on your motion. So, yeah. So, and just to confirm the 1.3B, 160 beds is for 282,933, not the 670 whatever that was in the... Right. Okay. Go ahead and put your name out to the door to see if we have any questão to address. Go ahead and put your name out to the door to see if we have any questão to address. Go ahead and put your name out to the door to see if we have any questão to address. Go ahead and put your name out to the door to see if we have any questão to address. Go ahead and put your name out to the door to see if we have any questão to address. Go ahead and put your name out to the door to see if we have any questão to address. Go ahead and put your name out to the door to see if we have any questão to address. Go ahead and put your name out to the door to see if we have any questão to address. Go ahead and put your name out to the door to see if we have any questão to address. Go ahead and put your name out to the door to see if we have any questão to address. I have to admit, Madam Mayor, we made it farther than I thought we would. Well, thanks for the encouragement there. There were less public speakers on about everything than I thought there would be. So the items that we did not get to, the cannabis program, the ordinance for the Title 12Rs, and the other two items that we decided earlier will be continued to the next meeting. We will go through reports and communications. Item 6.1 is the City Manager's Report. Not tonight. Thank you, though. 6.2 is the Annual Re-Budgets of Fiscal Year 19-20 into Fiscal Year 20-21 and Report on Confirming Supplemental Appropriations for Fiscal Year 19-20. That was for information only. Just for information only. 6.3 is Sunshining of Draft MOU Chico Management Employees CME. Information only. Sunshine of Draft PBR Public Safety Management PSM. Information only. 6.5, Council Member Requests. We received no written requests. Is there any? No verbal requests. I'd like to agendize a discussion of the special planning areas in conjunction with Housing Element Update and General Plan Update. Second. Any discussion? Questions? Is this ready for a vote on that? Let me get that in there. Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. I'm so sorry. That's okay. I'd like to request that the staff provide information or data on the distribution and number of trash receptacles available around the community and have the council consider the possibility of increasing availability of trash receptacles. Are you we've been we've been skirting around the problem of trash strewn everywhere for months. I'd just like to know you know what is our baseline that we're working with as far as number of trash cans per acre of park or per campsite or per whatever. It'd be good to know that. Do we need I don't mean do we do we need council directive to do that or can Mr. Gustafson or somebody just provide that? I'm just trying to get it faster. We're happy to provide that information. We can tabulate that and if council wants a discussion obviously we can bring it back if you need a discussion but we'll get the information to you so you can see if you want a discussion. Okay anybody else? So we'll recess to our closed session in conference room one. Are there any disqualifications from council? And were there any public comments on closed session? No. No. Okay. So we will recess to closed session. So we will recess to closed session.
