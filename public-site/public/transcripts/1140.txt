Anybody wishing to address the council on any matter listed on the agenda should first complete a speaker card which can be found at the back of the room on the small table back there. Speaker cards are available at the bottom of the room. Any questions or comments can be filled out and turned into the clerk to my left to your right and will be taken in the order received and once the first speaker is called no additional speaker cards will be accepted. So last time we only had a closed session announcement just due to our technical difficulties or but we will repeat that announcement from the October 3rd meeting at this time. So I would give you City Attorney John Lamb if you could please. Thank you Mayor. Good evening City Council. This is a re-report of the October 3rd closed session which unfortunately was not publicly broadcasted due to technical difficulties but was formally announced after the closed session. The first item, item 2.1 was conference with labor negotiators. Council was received an update from its negotiators. Direction was provided. No formal action was taken. Item 2.2, a conference with real property negotiators. Council was also provided an update from its negotiators. Direction was provided. No formal action was taken. Item 2.3, public employee quarterly performance evaluation. Evaluations were conducted. No final action was taken. Item 2.4, Council received an update for conference with real property negotiators for properties A through X I believe. Council was provided updates from its negotiators. Direction was provided. No final action was taken. The last item. The last item. Was item 2.5, conference with legal counsel, anticipated litigation. Council, although it was listed on the closed session agenda, council did not actually discuss these specific cases. Therefore, there was nothing to report on this matter. There were no other items that arose after the posting of the agenda. That concludes my report for the October 3rd meeting. All right. And then we'll have you do the same for today's meeting closed session. Earlier this evening, the City Council was recessed in closed session. The City Council considered three items. Sorry. Sorry, I lost my place in my papers. Thank you. There it is. The first item was item 2.1, conference with labor negotiators. City Council was provided an update and a briefing. Direction was provided by City Council to staff. No final action was taken. On item 2.2, public employee quarterly performance evaluation. The City Council did vote unanimously 7-0 to appoint John Lamb as city attorney and also authorized the city manager to make amendments consistent with the appointment. Item 2.3, conference with legal counsel, existing litigation. Council was briefed. City Council provided direction. No final action was taken on that. There was one additional subsequent need item that was added. It was potential litigation, conference with legal counsel. The council was provided a briefing and direction was provided, but no final action was taken. That concludes my report. All right. Thank you very much. And then if Nicole Bateman and Jenny Fails could join me up front. Who's Jenny? Did I get your last name right? Oh, okay. All right. Is this thing on? There it is. Yes. I need my glasses too. Thank you so much for being here and the work you do in our community. So we have a proclamation for Habitat for Humanity on their 30th anniversary. Wonderful. Habitat for Humanity of Butte County. Just easily referred to as Habitat for Humanity. Habitat began its affordable home ownership housing efforts in 1993 and has through its programs, prospective homeowners, donors, and volunteers built 48 energy efficient homes. 13 of those since the campfire. Amazing. Serving 63 adults who raised 94 children. Wow. Received 2,772 homes. And the most important thing is that the community is now able to provide 2,000 hours of financial and home ownership classes and provide 15,000, over 15,000 hours of sweat equity to help build their homes. Habitat has partnered with local government to build energy efficient, sustainable, and affordable housing. And volunteers have provided 25,000 plus volunteer hours on construction sites, which is an equivalent to $378,000 in labor cost savings. And whereas Habitat has a 100% success rate, meaning zero homeowners have foreclosed on their mortgage. And Habitat families have pledged their labor and their commitment to building and maintaining homes, creating strong neighborhoods and communities who shop local. And whereas Habitat's ReStore has diverted nearly 6.5 million pounds or three cargo ships of building materials and house goods from their landfills. And the city of Habitat has been a great sponsor of the ReStore project since 2004 and has generated over a million dollars in net proceeds to support the mission of building affordable housing for homeownership in Butte County. I myself have gone there several times. And both on the donating side and on the purchasing side. So it's a fantastic place. So on behalf of myself and the city council, we wish to thank you for all your efforts in our community. Thanks so much. We'll turn the mic over to you with a nice round of applause. Thank you. Thank you. Are you getting a picture? Can we get a photo? Photos first. All right. You guys like to say a few words? We do, yeah. Thank you, mayor. Thank you so much. Gosh, this is a great honor for us this evening. Thank you so much for your support over the many years. We've partnered with the city for many years now. and we built 30 total 36 houses in in Chico and our biggest products projects which you probably have seen our 16th 19th and 20th Street and and we have five more in the plans right now on Wisconsin and we plan to break ground on those probably a year from now and some of you probably have heard in the past that that with this project we actually received 1 million dollars from the state budget with the assistance of Assemblyman Gallagher's office and part of those proceeds will go towards this project on Wisconsin so in this next year you'll be seeing us more because we're going to be back in Chico we're currently in Paradise mostly right now and these these five will be our houses coming up here in Chico in this next year and hopefully we'll have projects after that but these next ones will be on Wisconsin and we're always looking for volunteers so we'd be happy to have you come out to the volunteers and see what you can do to help us get to where we are today. Thank you so much for your support because this has been a tremendous partnership for many years and so thank you so much for for being really aware of affordable housing and the need for it in our community so thank you. All right now we'll move on to the consent agenda all matters listed on the consent agenda are to be considered routine in nature and therefore can be enacted in one motion do we have any no votes for disqualification?

Good evening councillors. My name is Karen Holcomb and I've been volunteering for the animal shelter for the last 10 years. There's some issues that I've been dealing with. I definitely need to be addressed at the shelter. I appreciate the time that a couple of you have taken to speak with me to get more detail on some of the issues that are going on. We have a building that's 70 years old. It's it's literally falling down. It's any given day something breaks if not every day. I can't tell you how many times a week the washing machine breaks or the dryer or we have a water pipe that breaks in the wall. The newer dog kennel which is very nice kennel had never had air conditioning installed and I don't understand that as an engineer how you design a dog kennel with no air conditioning in the city of Chico. Probably the most pressing issue right now though is staffing. Your staff is at a breaking point and almost everybody there is on the verge of quitting. A staffing study was recently presented to the police department by the outgoing and retiring manager. That is based on national standards for minimum care standards that show there should be at least 11 full time people per day and right now they have seven and a half total. I know the chief is looking into how we can address that issue before the next budget session. Sir I appreciate your help. I appreciate your attention. The staff appreciates your attention. I appreciate your attention. I appreciate your attention. I appreciate your attention. I appreciate your attention. I appreciate your attention. But really I don't know if you know what a breaking point they are at. They are coming in every day, day in day out doing the job of two or three people. That is hard. It is not a public works department where you can just repair the street next year. These are dogs and cats that have to be fed and cleaned every day. We have a wonderful group of staff of volunteers who have come in and been helping. We have people that come in and men look like they are going to be in the hospital. They are going to be in the hospital. They are going to be in the hospital. They are going to be in the hospital. We have the holes in the fences. We have people that come in and help clean. You have a great community involvement. But we can't do it all. We need your help with staffing. Additionally, I don't know if you are aware that the current employees are contract employees. A couple of you might be aware of that. They get two weeks of time off per year. Total. That includes sick time. That includes vacation time. That includes, God, I hope you don't catch the flu and end up in the hospital time. We need to address that issue. We need to treat these people with respect and give them benefits. My time is almost up. Thank you for your time. I hope you address this issue. Thank you. Sherry Kushner followed by Shawn Reese. Good evening, City Council. I am here tonight as an active volunteer at the Chico Animal Shelter, as Karen was. I would like to request urgently needed funding for the shelter. The staff there works tirelessly every single day to make sure the animals are taken care of and are as comfortable as possible in the harsh conditions presented. They are busting at the seams and inexplicably are still in the original building that was built in the 1950s. If it weren't for the volunteers, of whom there aren't nearly enough to cover the deficit of employees, adoptions would be minimal, kennels would not be cleaned, housebroken buildings would not be built, and the dogs would not get walked, and many other various tasks such as laundry and sanitizing bowls would not be done on a daily basis. Employees have to rely on volunteers to fix broken locks, donate supplies, and help keep the facility and its grounds up to an acceptable standard. There are 71 kennels in total, including three for quarantine. 38 of these are in a metal building that, as Karen said, has no air conditioning. Sometimes dogs or cats have to be taken care of. The number of kennels in the building has to be doubled up since there are times when there are more animals than kennels. They only have a couple large portable fans, which, as you can imagine, barely cool the building down when summer temperatures soar into the triple digits. Why has funding for air conditioning in the adoptable building never been approved? It's an absolute disgrace. Did you know the play yard has no grass? It's basically weeds and dirt. It truly is a sad sight to see. The employees are doing their best to keep up with the workload. Sometimes they only have two or three employees running the entire place by themselves during the week. As you would expect, morale is low since they just don't have the staff, time, or funds to properly feed, clean, prep, process paperwork, and handle adoptions. They are not allowed to hire staff on their own, but instead have to go through the city channels, including the animal services section of the Chico PD, but that can take about three months processing time, and by then the applicant has moved on to another job. I suggest each of you sign up and volunteer at the shelter for just one hour so you can see for yourselves the old and decrepit buildings, the unsightly grounds, and the enormous amount of cleaning and prep that needs to be done daily. They desperately need more staff to keep up with the workload. We volunteers do our best to help out when we can and support the staff in whatever they need, but what would help most is to see some tangible efforts from city officials to help. We need to be able to fill their open positions quickly without the red tape and need the city's support in processing funding requests promptly. Something needs to be done. Can you help? Thank you. Thank you. Sean Reese, followed by Bruce McLean. Good evening, Mayor and Council Members. My name is Sean Reese. I'm a field representative from the NorCal Carpenters. I'm a former City Manager for the City of Norcal Carpenters Union, Local 1599. I'm advocating for a cause that is crucial to the well-being of our community. That's the need to provide labor standards on all construction projects. Area standard labor language needs to be the template that developers use in our town and on any future projects. Construction workers are the backbone of this town's growth and development, working day in, day out, dedicating their skills and labor to shape our landscape. Yet far too often, they face the harsh realities of low wages, inadequate benefits, and limited job security. Thank you. It not only affects their quality of life, but also hinders the growth of our entire community. I would like to express to you that without these standards, the construction force is systematically abused through wage theft, 1089 where workers have no workers comp when injured on the job, and a litany of safety violations. Healthcare and a livable wage are a vital necessity to the workers building these projects. Apprenticeship programs ensure the projects are built to the highest degree, and local hire ensures not only tax revenue from money spent by the workers, but ensures the workers can enjoy the basic things in life, like spending evenings with their families, maybe attending their child's little league games, or going to a dance recital, instead of sitting in traffic for two hours. Before I got in the Carpenters Union, I spent years and years working for non-union construction outfits, working on the road, watching my kids grow up through FaceTime and phone calls, spending hours driving to work in communities that are spending hours to commute to my own town to work. It's tough. It's tough on the workforce, and it's tough on the communities. By promoting responsible local hiring practices, we can create jobs for our own residents, reducing unemployment rates, and fostering a sense of pride and ownership in the projects that shape us. The housing crisis in California is a very real issue. The only way to mitigate this problem is by building more housing. But we shouldn't take advantage of the workforce that is helping us solve this crisis. And those same workers should be able to afford to live in the communities that they are building. The language that should become policy here would support responsible contractors that are already doing the right thing. Thank you. Thank you, Ms. Gonzalez. Good evening, Council. We are meeting after meeting, usually in the public section, although today is an exception. We hear various residents from throughout Chico complaining about the homeless situation in their immediate neighborhood or residence. I must say that it was extremely disappointing a couple of meetings ago when there wasn't even a second to discuss, not appropriate, but discuss a managed campground. Now, granted, the homeless situation is a big problem at State. It's taken decades to develop. It may take us decades to resolve. But it just doesn't seem to me as a taxpayer to be a good expenditure of money using very expensive and precious police time to almost endlessly move homeless people from one place to another, let alone talk about the damage it does to people who are homeless. We're already marginalized, the most marginalized in our system. It just makes no sense. It's a poor expenditure. Now, a managed campground that would have the necessities to sustain life, water, toilet facilities, waste management, collection, with some modicum of protection, would be a transitional step. I'm sorry. It's a terrible exercise, but it's a terrible exercise, and it's a terrible exercise, and it's a terrible exercise, and it's a terrible exercise, and it's a terrible exercise, and it's a terrible exercise, and it's a terrible exercise, and it's a terrible exercise, and it's a terrible exercise, and it's a terrible exercise, and it's a terrible exercise, and it's a terrible exercise, and it's a terrible exercise, and it's a terrible exercise, and it's a terrible exercise, and it's a terrible exercise, and it's a terrible exercise, and it's a terrible exercise, and it's a terrible exercise, and it's a terrible exercise, and it's a terrible exercise, and it's a terrible exercise, and it's a terrible exercise, and it's a terrible exercise, I think a lot of us are disturbed by events going on beyond the borders of Chico, but Chico itself has a lot of conflict. I just wanted to reconfirm the commitment that I think a lot of us have for a peaceful Chico, so I wanted to just read this that I feel. God, I feel you are hope. We shall not let go. You help us seek peace and justice and hope and dignity for all people. You lead us towards courageous actions, and we faithfully pray for places of unrest like Chico and elsewhere, instability and fear, and to advocate for basic human rights of all people. Support peace builders who are actively resisting the dehumanizing forces of violence and better proclaim the gospel of peace for your sake. Even though there's... Uncertainty grant us the strength to continually seek a calm and peaceful future. Even as we dream of a time when war-torn places will bloom forth as examples of hope, peace, and reconciliation, help us to be mindfully aware of the volatile present that separates us from the everlasting peace of your promise. Draw ever close to the multitude of injured and grieving people. Gather up the hopeless and abide with the physically and emotionally oppressed. May your presence and your kingdom comfort our siblings in their trauma and suffering, as we are all siblings to one another. God, prepare tables of dialogue and opportunities for truth-telling around us that lead to needed change and compassion. Open the hearts of hurting people so they may witness small signs of hope and feel your generosity and renewal. Surely, with your help, we will continue to seek justice and resist evil all the days of our lives until all people... are able to live abundantly. Amen. Amen. She is our last speaker. All right, thank you. Okay, we'll move on to public hearings. We have a public hearing to consider an appeal of decision to deny a tree removal permit at Forest Stonehaven Court. Before we have our urban forest manager speak, I'd just like to go through the hearing guidelines. We're going to start with... Ex parte communications. So we'll do that first. Then the staff report, which there are time restraints for all of this. That's 15 minutes of council discussion and questions of staff. An additional 10, if needed, up to. Public hearing is the applicant up to 15 minutes. Additional speakers up to 30. And then the applicant rebuttal of three minutes. And then we'll close the public hearing and go to a discussion motion and a vote if decided upon. So with that, ex parte. Communications and we'll start to my right. Mr. Bennett, do you have any? Mr. Van Overbeek? Nope. Nope. Me, nope. Nope. All right. Okay. So, and ex parte communications would mean meeting with the applicant or having any conversation with them. So, none? Mr. Mayor, I met with the applicant. Oh, okay. Yeah. All right. So, all right. So... So, we'll start from here. Staff report. Fire away. Good evening, Mayor, Vice Mayor, City Council. This evening, we bring before you a tree appeal. This was originally heard at the 828 Bidwell Park Playground Commission meeting. At that meeting, the applicants, Mr. and Mrs. Goldbranson, and I just want to check here this evening. Yep, they're here this evening. Did bring forward an appeal. Initially, the tree removal request was denied by staff. They did file a timely appeal to bring it forward to the commission. Public hearing was held. And at that time, the motion was to approve the appeal, but it did fail. Three, three, zero with the zero was one recusal. So, then following that, the applicants did file a timely appeal to have the matter heard at tonight's meeting. So, I just wanted to just provide a little bit of background info on the tree permit system. Tree division is one of 10 divisions that report to Director Gustafson, but we do have the lion's share of service requests. Typically, around 30 to 40% of all requests are tree related. And recognizing that, the tree division does get through an enormous amount of work, but sometimes we just can't get to the lower level, perhaps lower urgency tree service requests. We can't get there as quick as the applicant would like. So, for that reason, we do have a permit system that is optional. At the permit level, we do have a permit system that is optional. At the permit applicant's discretion, they can use an approved tree contractor to expedite the work so that they don't have to wait for the city tree division to get to the work. And typically, we do get between 50 and 60 of those permits a year. Mostly tree trimming, which is just administratively approved, and I don't think we've ever denied a tree trimming permit. But the higher bar to approve a permit is when there is an application to remove a tree. Typically, the tree has to be found to be either dead, dying, or diseased for staff to approve that permit. And in actual fact, if the tree is found to be critical, we'll actually pull that permit and the city will remove that tree, because really that's the way that should happen. In this case, we're not going to be able to remove the tree. In this case, the applicants applied for the removal of the willow tree that does back onto their property, and we will bring up a map just to show exactly where that is, who it is. The applicants do live on Stonehaven Drive, which is the red X on the left-hand map. The Belvedere subdivision is the area highlighted. And it was created back in 2004 as a result of the, back then there was a developer did remove many, many, I think it was a couple of hundred oak trees. I don't know if any of you remember that time. I wasn't in Chico at the time, but I have read about that. And as a consequence of that, one of the trees was removed. One of the consequences was this preserve was created. And the purpose of it is really just to preserve those trees for all time. The focus was oak trees, really because of the developer issue that did happen with the removal of oak trees. If I could armchair quarterback it, I think it would have been proud of the developer. But perhaps the intent to have the wording that really all native trees be preserved, not just to put the focus on oak trees. But I appreciate the intent at the time when this preserve was created. And then on the right-hand side, you can see just we zoomed in a little bit on the map, and you can see the tree in question highlighted in yellow. And the applicant's house is the one due east of that tree. So just to provide a little timeline of this application, initially the city did receive a tree permit back in January of this year. And at the time, the applicant's main concern was to do with the installation of a new swimming pool. And that was the first thing that we did. And the service request is in the agenda packet, and all the detail is there for you to look at the notes that were put into that service request. But the primary concern was concerns about tree roots impacting the retaining wall that defines the property against the preserve. And also the concern that the tree roots may impact the future pool installation. The very next day, the street tree supervisor did go out and do a field visit. And he determined that the tree was healthy and did speak to the applicants at the time. And he recommended that really the tree is not dead, dying, or diseased. So we could not allow for the, approve the permit, which in fact, just to clarify, at the time, we had a permit. And that service request really just was an application to trim the tree. But the street tree supervisor did talk to the applicants and let them know that really there really is no issue with the retaining wall, with the tree roots. And really would be unlikely to have any impact on the future pool, mainly due to how the new excavation would proceed. And probably some tree roots would be removed during the installation. And that would have reduced all of the pool. So that would kind of remedy any issues there. So then what happened in February, we did receive doctor's notes from the applicants. And we did have a few phone calls and emails highlighting the issue that, in fact, their concern is that their adult son that lives with them does have medical issues. And that is, causes epileptic seizures due to the strobing effect of sunlight shining through this tree. So at that time, we did ask for the doctor's notes. We initially got a doctor note from an out of town practitioner. And we did request a more local doctor's note, which we did receive. And at that time, what actually happened is we did refer this to our risk department. And we did refer this to our risk department. Just to find out really how to handle a doctor's note. You know, what weighting does that give? Does that enable us to override our regulatory procedures? And at that point, this matter was referred to the city attorney. And at that time, the advice that came back from the attorney was that if the tree is healthy, maintain, continue maintaining the tree and trim the tree as appropriate. So at that point, now moving on to April, sorry, July, we did, the city actually generated a permit which had a removal request. And then that was denied. So it's part of the process that they now have a denied tree removal permit that they can now appeal. And that led to the hearing that was held on 8-28. So just to zoom in a bit more and to show you what the local preserve does look like. On the left-hand side, you can see that we did observe a tree nest. And this photograph was taken on the 23rd of September. I didn't notice any bird activity in the nest, but it does look to, at that time, it was a fresh-looking nest. So it may be that the birds have fledged. But the presence of the nest does look to be a fresh-looking nest. And the photos show that this tree is utilized as wildlife habitat. And on the right-hand side, top right, you can see the tree in question circled in blue. And that photograph is a panoramic photograph taken from the bike trail that runs along the northern edge of that preserve. And then the bottom right shows the tree up close. And that photograph is taken from the preserve. So you can see, just by looking at it, you know, this is a healthy tree. It's probably been there since around the times that the homes were initially installed back in 2004. So moving on, I think this timeline does help to show really what's going on with this area. There's a lot to unpack here in these two photographs. So I'll start with the photograph that was taken November 2020. And we did pull this off the CRMLS Zillow listing for when the house was initially up for sale. And you can see the backyard as it looked then. And on the right-hand side of that photograph, you can see the tree. And then on the right-hand photograph, you can see the tree is ringed in yellow. So you can compare how the two trees look and how it's changed between November 2020 and July 2023. And really by taking measurements from fixed objects in that photograph and taking a height measurement of the tree back in July, we can calculate that the tree back in November was 28 feet tall. And in July, it had grown to 35 feet tall. So the tree had grown. But back in November 2020, the tree was already a significant feature within the viewshed from the property. And so we've done a lot of work on that. But it's not the only thing that you can see from the porch. And then obviously the right-hand side shows the development that the applicants have installed in their backyard. The swimming pool, which measures 20 by 30 feet. And that pool is still under construction. So during the Bidwell Park Program Commission meeting, there was a long discussion on this item. And a lot of commissioners did have a lot of well-researched questions. Some of the things that came out from the discussions was just to try and understand, you know, how the applicants ended up lodging the appeal. And we did find out from the applicants that they moved into the property. And I want to say it was July 2021. And at that time, they did spend a lot of time and energy retrofitting their property, installing blinds and things like that to kind of reduce the viewshed so that it reduces the impact on their adult son. Some commissioners did have some issues that, as you can see in that photograph, it's pretty apparent that the tree is there. If they should have known or could have known that that tree was going to be an issue at the time they were deciding which home to purchase. You know, that is a factor that the commissioners did ask questions about. The applicants did share with us that their son is an adult son, but has only recently developed a photo. So, it's a bit of a sensitive epilepsy. And I'm sure the applicants will give more information with whatever comfort level they're happy to share on that. So, there were a number of issues as to the approval of this permit. You know, the tree is healthy. A lot of parks commissioners did struggle to find a causal link between that tree and just that tree. And their son's medical condition. No doubt their son definitely has photosensitive epilepsy. But some commissioners were struggling to see the link between just that one tree and the son's epilepsy. So, just going back to the timeline. So, you can see towards the end in August where the public hearing was held. And then we also received, as part of the appeal for this evening, an additional doctor's note from Dr. Kennedy. And that is also in the packet. And that does show more medical information. You know, it definitely corroborates that their son does have photosensitive epilepsy. But in our mind, it really doesn't prove the causal link between that one tree and their son's condition. And I do believe that the parents do think that removal of this tree would solve their problems. But staff were just struggling to find that removal of this tree would solve the issues that their son is having. So, with that said, we are recommending that the City Council consider the appeal. And adopt the following resolution. To deny the appeal and uphold the Bidwell Park and Playground Commission denial regarding a permit to remove a tree. Defined number four, Stonehaven Court. And really, the main points in the resolution, there are four main points. And I'll just read those quickly. Point number A, the tree has been assessed by city staff to determine its condition. And the tree has been found to be in a healthy condition. Point number B, removing the tree would undermine the key preservation goals of the Belvedere Heights development. By setting an undesirable precedent of exceptions to protected tree policies. Number C, the willow tree does not meet the definition of a nuisance under Chico Municipal Code 14.40290. And finally, point number D, Public Works Operations and Maintenance have agreed to trim the tree. To alleviate any encroachments onto the adjacent property. And alleviate any concerns regarding ladder fuels. So that's the conclusion of my presentation. I don't know if you want to take questions from me now or if you want to hear from the applicant. It's question time now. So, council questions? Go ahead. Mr. Bamelit. Yes. Which species of willow is this particular tree? This is a native willow tree, Pacific Willow, Latin name Salix Lassienda. Thank you for the Latin name. I'll remember that. My father was a botanist so I got exposed to it. Is this tree, is the species on the protected, the list of protected species, tree species? So, the conditional measures for the Belvedere subdivision do quote, quote that they're, they want native oak trees are protected. However, it kind of goes on to say that any tree removal requires a permit. But then it. No, no, I understand. But the question was, is this species on the city's list of protected trees? There isn't really such a list of. There is. It's online. Protected trees. Yeah. It is a native tree. So, there is a. There is a presumption that we will try and preserve native trees. Right. But my question is, is this species on the list of protected trees? And the answer is, it's not. And there is a very specific list. And it's mainly oaks. Okay. I'm not sure what list. I can send it to you. Sure. All right. Any other questions? I have one. Which is. I have a question. Kind of a redundant question, too. It's conceivable that 10 trees over the next 10 years could grow in the view shed of this property, correct? Correct. Okay. That's it. All right. And barring no more questions, let's open the public hearing and hear from the applicant. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. So, that's up to 15 minutes. Okay. Use that up to. I use it with . I can't imagine taking 15 minutes, but thank you. Good evening. My name is Michael Gilbranson. And I'm accompanied by my neighbor, Margie Werner, and my shy wife, Christine, who's also in the audience. We appreciate the council taking the time to listen to our appeal. Mostly want to, you know, I'm not sure if this is a good idea or not, but I'm not sure if this is a good idea. But I do want to clarify a few things we've heard from the city. And I do also want to, I just did the same thing with the commission, the park commission. I want to say that I really appreciate the professionalism the city staff has shown in working with us in this. It has been very respectful throughout, and the whole process, we found to be very respectful, and we appreciate the fairness and the opportunity to be here to present tonight. So, a few clarifications I would like to make, based on the city's report and the issue revolving our tree. The first thing is that it has, we're not sure how this has come about, but the conversation has centered around this pool. And it's never been about the pool for us. We don't think that the tree impacts the construction of this pool whatsoever. It came about in a conversation early on when we did ask early on about tree trimming, because there is a dead branch that did fall on pools. And we asked about that. And my wife got into a conversation with the arborist about a number of things, including snakes going into the pool and things like that. And somehow that conversation morphed into this is about our pool. We don't think that this tree has any impact on this pool whatsoever. So even though that has kind of centered the conversation around this, we don't think that that's an issue whatsoever. We've had two main issues from the get-go. The first one is we have a developmentally disabled son. He has autism. Epilepsy. And a few other comorbid conditions that impact his health and safety. My wife and I have dedicated our lives to his health and safety and welfare. And that has been the main issue around this. We also try to respect his privacy. So we're not thrilled about having to talk about his medical issues in public. And when we first talked to the city, we tried to kind of keep that as kind of a minor thing and not make that a big issue. But that by far has been our issue all along. The other issue, of course, is the idea of defensible space. When it comes to wildfire, my wife and I are lifelong Butte County residents. We're now lifelong Chicowins, but we lived in Paradise our whole lives up until the Camp Fire. And although we do acknowledge that that tree is healthy, we had a lot of healthy trees on our property in Paradise that all were burned in the Camp Fire. So we know that that can still be an issue. And this tree is the one tree that butts right up to our property and our neighbor's property. It is approximately seven feet. A little bit over. Seven feet to our retaining wall in our fence. We noticed in the city report, it says 50 feet. I'm assuming they're talking from the tree to the house, but it's about seven feet to our fence and our property line. Matter of fact, the branches go right over the fence, which is a wooden fence for us for the neighbors. Another issue or another clarification is that we even read in the mitigation measures that this from the city report that a tree can be removed regardless of its healthiness. D.P. if it's an exotic tree that's not native to that specific area. Our understanding all along has been this is an oak preserve, and the willow tree is a riparian tree, so it's not native to that area. So even in the mitigation measures, it says a tree such an olive tree can be removed. So we believe that it makes perfect sense to mitigate this issue by planting more oak trees, and we would be thrilled to collaborate with the city in getting more oak trees planted in this preserve to make up for the loss of that one tree that's right against our property. And in fact, we think it makes more sense because those oak trees are more native to that area than that one lone willow tree. So going back to my son for just one moment, as Mr. Bamlett said, the epilepsy is new for us. The autism has been there and a few other issues all along. The epilepsy is new. We know that the campfire didn't cause him to have epilepsy, but what we've learned from our research and from our medical practice and from our research and from our medical professionals is that trauma, such as from the campfire, causes the seizure threshold to lessen. So these grand mal tonic seizures that he now has didn't come up until May of 2020. We moved into that house in June of 2021, and so in the last couple of years, we've been trying to figure this all out with seizures and epilepsy and certainly not being experts in that field. We're experts in autism, but not epilepsy. And so this is an issue that we were trying to figure out for a long time, what's causing this. And one of the things that we noticed is that when he was in the backyard, dizziness would happen. He would complain about these things and he doesn't articulate things well because cognitively, you've heard, we're talking about a 30-year-old man, but cognitively, he's a five-year-old. And so he can't articulate his needs that well. But we found that dizziness was happening more and more when he was in the backyard, and then he started having seizures in the backyard. We talked to our medical professionals, and they're the ones that told us about this idea of photosynthesis and how it's going to affect us. And the strobing effect that can happen from these lights that are coming through trees. They said this is a very common occurrence. I want to note the two doctors that are the first two doctors that were brought in the city report. The first one, Dr. Cartesnell, as Mr. Bamlett said, is not local. He has been our son Christian's doctor for 25 years, and he has always practiced in California. He has moved subsequently, moved from California, but he's been our doctor here in California for 25 years. As a result, he's been a doctor for 25 years. As we know in Butte County, access to services, medical services aren't always as easy as when you go to the city, and that's why you'll find our doctors are located in other places. So UC Davis is our neurologist, and Dr. Parikh is who we see around the step. And she's, I always mispronounce it, so my wife will correct me when I go back to sit down, but an epilatologist. He's an expert in epilepsy. We had a, and the Park Commission, again, was very fair. It was a tie vote, which is why we're here today. But one of the commissioners, I think it was the chair, was talking about some research that she'd done on Dr. Google, and had talked to another physician that I believe was her partner, who wasn't an expert in epilepsy, and talked about how maybe that strobing effect wasn't really a big deal. What we found from our professionals and through UC Davis is that this is a big deal. And so that is by far our number one primary concern, is how this impacts Christian's health and safety, and we want him to be able to use the backyard. Heck, the whole reason we did the pool was for him and for his health, you know, for his happiness and quality of life. That's been our goal all along. And again, the fire concerns are a big concern for us, as well as our neighbor Margie, and that is the other thing. The pool is non-consequential to us. We're not sure how it's become the center point of this conversation, but we acknowledge that that pool is not something that really needs to be considered in this area. And I believe that's all I have. Oh, the one other thing, very minor thing about the bird's nest. We also noticed in the mitigation measures, it has a season for when a bird's nest would be considered, and that season ends in August. So without being an expert on that, I know that that wouldn't be a consideration anymore. As I said before, we're lifelong Butte County residents. We love trees. We love nature. We grew up in the forest and the foothills of paradise. We don't want to remove trees. In fact, matter of fact, we'd love to add trees to that preserve. It's just this one tree. We don't believe that this one tree should take precedent over the health and welfare of our son. So that's all I have to say, and I'd be happy to answer any questions. Questions? Yes. All right. Can we do questions, Madam Clerk? Sorry, I didn't mean to jump the gun on that. Yeah, it's allowed. Yes, that's allowed. All right. Fire away, Mr. President. I just want to, boy, this is awkward. I just want to confirm that you're perfectly willing to replace, if that willow tree was removed, you'd be perfectly willing to replace it with a number of oak trees in the preserve area, and you're open to that compromise? Absolutely. We would be thrilled to do that, and as a matter of fact, we would love to see more oak trees in that preserve. Okay. You might have noticed from the picture it's pretty sparse. We would love to see that grow. I remember the history of that area. Yeah, we don't know. We've only been there a couple of years, but we do know that other non-native trees, like olive trees, have been removed from that area in the last few years. Like we had another neighbor that actually had an olive tree removed, and I don't think they had to go through this process, but we know there's a precedent for that happening. Thank you, sir. Mr. Anoverbeth? I have a comment, not a question. Okay. Well, we'll save comments for the end. Questions? Yes. Questions? I have one. So, it was my question to Richie. What happens if four other trees grow in the next ten years? Well, what we have found is that that is the only tree that's even near our fence line, and the reason that that tree exists— I guess the question is, is what if four trees grow ten feet off your fence line in the next ten years? I don't think that that's going to happen because— If it did. If it did— It's a hypothetical question. Are we going to have you back here? I don't believe so. I would not expect to see that happen. All right. Okay. All right. All right. So, additional speakers? None. I didn't think so. All right. Well, another question? All right. How much defensible space are we requiring from a house? Like, this tree looks like it's going to be a house. I think it's pretty close to the property line. So, is the city maintaining, like, that area to make sure that there is no fire—no fuel there at all? Or if something else appears, will it be removed before it becomes a tree? Or—I'm just trying to understand the maintenance part of this reserve. I'm not sure who can answer that question. That's more of a question for staff, but that's fine. Yeah. –The – –The – –The – –The – –The – –The – –The – –The – –The – –The – –The – –The – –The – –The – –The – –The – –The – –The – far as something i mean if it were definitely impacting you know the private property property from a fire hazard hazard safety component i mean we would remove that and i think some vegetation had been removed some brush has been removed in that area to open it up quite a bit but not to pass it might be a fire or code enforcement a question to if it's something adjacent to an actual building or facility uh what are what are the what does our code say i can't answer that off the top of my head without looking thank you all right thank you very much um all right so we will close the public hearing at this point and have council discussion so discussion so yes thank you uh so i met the gil bransons when i was campaigning and when i saw that uh they had it was their tree in question i i uh called it michael and went out there and looked at it on sunday uh this tree is right on top of their retaining wall seven feet away i think you measured it seven feet three inches and it is an extremely healthy tree it's growing very fast it's grown seven feet uh mr bamal's measurement seven feet in the last three years and the problem is with willows and i like willows but if they have water and because this tree is downhill from the neighbor's backyards watering from the landscaping goes down the tree at some point this thing's going to bust up the retaining wall also under the canopy of the tree there was a lot of dry material so i believe that although willows don't aren't very combustible normally there was a lot of dry stuff underneath the tree which was the branches overhang gil branson's yard the neighbors they've also indicated they're open to mitigation and so to me it's very clear to me that they're this tree is a major problem in their life and they believe for their son i have no reason to question that and i think it needs to go particularly if they're offering to plant oak trees as mitigation all right further so excuse me go ahead so i'm going to suggest a compassionate compromise i'm familiar with caesars and i know it's a major part of one's life to deal with that so my compassionate compromise would be to deny the appeal and allow the tree to be removed and in in exchange for that follow the existing chico municipal code which is tree removal 16.66.085 which details exactly what to do and how to do it as far as tree removals and uh make this part of the condition that the family replace the willow tree with at least three oak trees possibly more and i'll leave that up to mr gufsteadson so that's that's my suggestion all right further discussion yeah i'll admit this is the most complicated tree issue i feel like i've ever dealt with um there's a lot of a lot of elements here a lot of things that none of us are really experts on um i what does get me is that i mean there we've had some complicated forestry issues here before and that this is located on a preserve that has existed since before the house was there since before anybody moved in the intention of the preserve is to maintain the trees not just the oak trees really it's still a native tree in the area and yeah the certainly the the mitigation planning more trees helps a lot i'll say that so i have some comment as well so uh quite often we are faced as my colleagues know with decisions about people living next to property that they bought a house on and then you know there's going to be a development on that piece of property or something along that lines and they go well hey i don't want these uh low income houses built near my property even though they knew all along that that's a possibility that could have occurred you know there were discussions about when inlo was considering their new location the corner of East and Cusick, the hotel property that was on commercial. I mean, we can go on and on and on about this in terms of pieces of property that people bought their property next to and then when something actually happens. So my thought is on this is, you know, these folks bought a piece of property next to preserve, 20 trees could grow back there in the next 10 years. They could do nothing about it. They could block their view shed entirely. I'm certainly sympathetic, but I don't want to come back here in 10 years when the next tree grows or the next willow tree grows or whatever it might be and be back in the same thing. I also don't want to set the precedent of cutting down trees in a preserve based upon individuals need, whether it be medical or otherwise, when they are the ones who purchased the property and knew the tree existed. So that's kind of where I stand on it. Anyone else? All right. Entertain a motion. I have a motion. I believe Mr. Bennett made one. Close. You want to make yours a motion? He did. But granting the appeal allows the... I made a mistake, as usual. So my motion is to grant the appeal, allow the tree to be removed on the condition that the applicant's follow the existing Chico Municipal Code relative to tree removals and require them to plant at least three, and I think probably four would be better just to make it more impactful, oak trees within the reserve far away from your fence line, please. So avoid maybe a future complication that could be avoided so easily right now. So that is my motion. Second. All right. We have a motion and a second. I'd ask you to add a friendly amendment that the care of those trees at least extend for a period of three years to make sure they're in healthy condition. Are you guys willing to do that? All right. All right. With friendly amendment. Council Member Bennett? Yes. Council Member Morgan? Yes. Council Member Candon? Yes. Council Member Van Overbeck? Yes. Council Member Winslow? No. Vice Mayor Reynolds? Aye. Mayor Coolidge? No. Carries 5-2. All right. And with that, we're going to take a short break and we will be back with our regular agenda. Thank you. Keep in mind, your microphones are on. All right. All right. Give us just a second, Mr. Rigg. Mr. Bennett, come on down. Mr. Bennett, come on down. All right. All right. Item 5.1, architectural review and historic preservation board streamlining and cost reduction report from Brendan Beague, Community Development Director. Mr. Bennett? Thank you. Good evening, Mayor, Vice Mayor, and Council. So, just a quick background. As part of your review of the roles and responsibilities of the city's boards and commissions, we're going to be looking at the project that was completed in the city's architectural review and historic preservation board. In addition to the project that was completed in the city's architectural review and historic preservation board, Council directed staff to identify opportunities to streamline the process and reduce the cost for projects that go before the city's architectural review and historic preservation board, otherwise also known as the ARHPB. In support of that effort, Council recently restructured the ARHPB, which is a mouthful, as a subcommittee of the Planning Commission. To facilitate Council's direction, staff met on four separate occasions with members of the Chico Builders Association, also known as CBA, and the City Council. To collaborate on thoughtful ways to streamline the ARHPB process and to reduce cost. A number of strategies have been identified, which I will share with you shortly. I want to share that the meetings were very collegial, highly productive, and I believe that all the parties would agree that we gained a deeper understanding of the important roles and challenges that we each have in ensuring Chico has a thoughtful and quality built environment. So, design review boards, like the city's ARHPB, are very common for cities that are Chico's size. And again, I'll emphasize, especially for communities that value a quality built environment. The ARHPB review process provides an important venue to perform an early project assessment and also to identify any major design issues. And for the public to be engaged on all major new commercial and multi-family residential projects. I don't need to remind you that Chico has a very active and engaged population. The ARHPB, I believe, provides a venue for the public to participate in the ARHPB. And I believe that it's a place for the public to learn about the larger projects and provide input. The ARHPB is often a place where tensions rise, but ultimately there's an education that takes place regarding the city's general plan and the development standards, the rights of property owners, and the importance of a transparent and predictable process. I believe that Chico needs a venue for this public engagement. As a reminder, there have been numerous recent efforts to reduce fees and push decision making down for architecture review projects. Including new categories and fees for staff level small scale and large scale reviews for building remodels, downtown facade updates, subsequent phases of a development, and other minor design review efforts. I'll now share some of the recent strategies that we identified. So in most instances, a proposed land use that's associated with an ARHPB application is already acknowledged as an allowed use. For example, an apartment or office building is allowed to use. But it's not allowed by the underlying zoning. There is no discretion or approval required for the use. Instead, the ARHPB is focused solely on site design and architecture and ensuring they are consistent with the city's design and development standards. This is what I like to call a light approval, as the question of the use has already been determined. Noticing a public hearing allows neighbors and community stakeholders the opportunity to be engaged in the design review process. And then stay informed on larger new development plans. Sometimes, however, it sends a mixed message. As folks believe the city is in a position to deny the proposed use. This is not the case. This public engagement provides a quality of life and other community benefits that I believe exceed the cost to the applicant. Recognizing that the ARHPB process greatly benefits the community, staff will recommend in the forthcoming user fee study update that a portion of the fee for major design review be offset by the city's general fund. A final determination will be made by the council. At a later date. But staff is currently considering a recommendation of a 40 to 50% fee offset. A reduced cost is to the applicant is consistent with council's direction and the city's cost would acknowledge the community benefits of community engagement. Taking into consideration feedback from the Chico Builders Association, staff agrees to remove extraneous information requested on the ARHPB application checklist. Including interior floor plans. Signal or signage details. And final landscape plans. As well as refining other requirements. Not all information this early in the development process is needed. It can be provided and confirmed later during this building plan review process. The applicant will not have as much information to submit which will reduce cost. Additionally, digital plan submittals are supported which will result in more streamlined and cost efficient application submission process. To further reduce processing times for ARHPB applications, staff will commit to an abbreviated application review period when soliciting comments from internal departments and divisions like the fire marshal, development engineering, and the urban forest. If comments are not received within the abbreviated time frame, it will be assumed the department has no comments. Tightening up internal deadlines allows commenting departments to identify any major issues early in the development process. While again, more minor issues can be addressed later during the building permit stage. Abbreviated review periods will ensure applicants get to a scheduled ARHPB meeting sooner. Staff is also committed to being more flexible in determining what deems an application complete. Which allows a meeting date to be set more quickly. For instance, with clarification from the applicant, staff can move forward with processing an ARB application with minor discrepancies between plan sheets. And require that they be remedied later again in the process during the building permit plan review stage. Clarifying minor inconsistencies on plans instead of requiring corrected plans be resubmitted will require cooperation with the ARHPB. But applicants will benefit from fewer delays in getting a project scheduled on an upcoming meeting agenda. Staff has also identified a simpler, more objective based format for ARB staff reports moving forward. Staff has also identified a simpler, more objective based format for ARB staff reports moving forward. As opposed to a wordy written report, key project elements and required information such as zoning, density, setbacks, site coverage, landscaping, lighting and parking lot shading will be listed in a checklist format and a simple determination made of whether it meets the requirement. This will result in cost savings and expedited processing times. So, projects requiring architectural review are already defined in the City's code as either minor or major. Minor projects do not require a detailed review of the project. Minor projects don't require review and approval by ARHPB and are instead approved at the staff level. Minor projects don't require review and approval by ARHPB and are instead approved at the staff level. Minor projects don't require review and approval by ARHPB and are instead approved at the staff level. Minor projects don't require review and approval by ARHPB and are instead approved at the staff level. Minor projects don't require review and approval by ARHPB and are instead approved at the staff level. Minor projects don't require review and approval by ARHPB and are instead approved at the staff level. Minor projects don't require review and approval by ARHPB and are instead approved at the staff level. use. Moving forward, the only projects that will require ARHBB review are new multifamily residential projects and commercial projects located on an arterial or within 300 feet of a residential use. This code change will streamline the process and reduce costs for several project types. So consistent with growing state legislation, which we've shared with you here before, staff will be preparing purely objective findings for approving residential projects, which will allow many multifamily projects to be approved ministerially. This code amendment will be part of a larger phase of amendments for council's consideration in 2024. It's important to note that ministerial projects, unlike discretionary projects, unless there is a clear environmental issue, are not subject to the environmental review under the California Environmental Quality Act, which may result in additional cost savings as well as potential time savings. So I'd like to close again by sharing my appreciation for the collaborative engagement we had with the members of the Chico Builders Association. Again, the meetings were very lively, very honest, and very enlightening. Staff is confident that the efforts outlined here, in conjunction with the recent change of the ARHBB as a subcommittee of the Planning Commission, will go a long way towards achieving council's direction to streamline the process and reduce costs. I am recommending tonight that council direct staff to return in one year with an update on the success of the proposed strategies and determine if additional measures are needed. Thank you. I'm available for any questions. All right. Questions? Mr. Van Overbeek? Mr. V, thank you for all your work on this. I know this has been a big, this has been a slog to get this done, but I think it's very important. So I have one question. If you compare the number of projects in front of the ARHBB prior to these rules and then after, how many, how much is this going to reduce the work that you're doing? The workload on the ARHBB – so – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – we'll just say that there's 15 projects a year that go to the ARHPB, there may be 12 now, or 11. So it's only going to cut it 25 or 30%? That's just going to the ARHPB. To answer that question, yes, but all the other items that I've highlighted would help streamline, get people there quicker and cheaper. Well, I guess the only projects that will be going to them are major multifamily and commercial. Well, to make sure I understand you right, so you went through all this effort and all we're going to do is reduce the number of projects by 20% that get in front of the ARHPB? I can't say with certainty, but I didn't know the goal wasn't to get rid of projects going to the ARHPB as much as it was to streamline projects and reduce cost was what I believe the direction was. Thank you. All right. Other questions? Thank you. Speakers? We have one. Katie Thoma. All right. Come on down. Well, in the interest of transparency, I had my eyes dilated late this afternoon, so I don't want you all to think I'm under the influence of something. We know Ms. Dilger here is the expert with her work with cannabis, so I am not. Have you started the clock? Okay. Good evening, Mayor, Vice Mayor, and Council members. My name is Katie Thoma, and I'm the Executive Director of the Chico Builders Association, better known as CBA. I'm here this evening to provide remarks on behalf of the Board. CBA was invited to provide input on the streamlining process of the ARHPB as directed by Council. CBA would like to thank Community Development Director Brendan Veague, Principal Planner Mike Solley, and Senior Planner Kelly Murphy for their support of the ARHPB. I'm going to now turn it over to the Board of Trustees. For their thoughtful, collaborative, and transparent work on streamlining the process. It was mostly collegial, but we had some very lively conversations, as you can imagine. CBA provided a list of suggestions to streamline the process, including disbanding the ARHPB altogether, because there is no benefit to the applicant, but still retained the historical component. Staff was adamant that disbanding the ARHPB ARHPB was never on the table. CBA expressed since there is no benefit to the applicant by going to the ARHPB, they shouldn't bear the burden of the cost, which by the way is substantial. The cost is $8,526 for the applicant. We suggest that the city should bear the entire cost. As stated in the staff report under other areas of identified for improvement in the staff report, the majority of the CBA Board of Directors support city staff's recommendation and look forward to evaluating the process in one year from adoption. Thank you. That is all. All right. Comments from council or? Well, so I, I'm not sure if I can answer that question. We, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, that this is not the result that I don't think any of us, at least I had envisioned. All right. Mr. Reynolds. May I speak, sir? Sure. I take issue with that, but I'm coming from a totally different position on this. I felt it was an extreme valuable benefit to the Architectural Review and the Historic Preservation Board, but that has ended. It's over. I just don't want to give up my last remaining comment that I don't think this is a good direction for Chico. I think there will be some negative benefits, or excuse me, negative outcomes from this, but again, it's happened and it's done, so I just wanna make quick comment. That's it. All right. Anyone else? Mr. Wenzel. I've been uncomfortable with some things, I think, have come through the ARHPB in the past, and so I had a lot of mixed feelings about this moving forward and I ultimately voted against it to get here. I think that these are a lot of sensible things. It certainly reduces the burden on developers widely, the wide catchment of all the master plan areas being exempted, and if we're looking at it again in a year, then I think that gives us a good opportunity to see if it continues to be onerous in some ways, and we can consider to make further changes, but these recommendations seem pretty reasonable to me. I think the only comment I would add is that I keep hearing in these presentations, and I hear a lot about how this is about providing community of input and public, but the public's place to do it, so if this is all about the community and them having their place to say, why, is all of this about the community? Why is all of the burden falling on the developer? So maybe if it's a public benefit, maybe we need to consider who's paying the fee for that. So that was only pretty much my comment on that. All right, anyone else? Entertain a motion? I'll move to approve. I'll make a motion to approve it with, with the fee split 30-70, 30% from the contractor and 70% from the community fund. So I totally agree with that. It benefits the community most, so. All right, and you and Mr. Winslow started that segment at the same time. Are you willing to second her? No, no, no, I'll give it to her. So we had it at 40-60, is that right? 42-50% offset. 42-50, so would you like to address that? We'll be coming back with a record, so. Recommendation. Push up. There you go. My audio, my audio visual helper here. We're gonna be coming back with a recommendation as part of the user fee update. And then council will make a decision then with all the fees. I mean, you could make some direction tonight if you'd like, but my point is we will have the benefit of a full user fee that would also take into consideration some of the streamlining, attributes that I've already talked about. When will that be? Early 2024. Okay. Because that's the hope. But I mean, it's your project. We don't have a major back load of ARHPP applications. Again, it's your prerogative, but. Okay. So we can change that 30 to 40 later too. If we go 30-70 today, like you said, that is not a whole lot of load, but we can revise it in 2024? 2024, yeah. Okay. Yeah. I was, I'm only sharing that, I was sharing that we will come with a recommendation for what the fee should be, but if you want to give a direction tonight, that's your prerogative as well. Okay. Okay. So your motion stands. Yes. Yes. I'll second that motion. All right. We have a motion and a second. Madam Clerk, unless there's further comment. Council member Bennett. Yes. Council member Morgan. Yes. Council member Tandon. Yes. Council member Van Overbeck. No. Council member Winslow. Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds. Aye. Mayor Coolidge. Aye. Carries 6-1. All right. Item 5.2. We have Public Works Director Eric Cupps. Supplemental appropriation budget modification number 2024, EWO-001. I did not need audio visual. I'll point this to the board. He can tap the mic for you, Jim. Thank you. Yeah. I'll be quick on this one. Item 5.2 is a supplemental appropriation to move 43,000 in ARPA funds from one project to another. In fiscal year 22-23, capital project 505-34, built what we like to refer to as kind of the university bike path fence. I know Mayor Coolidge, you were heavily involved in that effort in coordination with the university on that project. So we basically replaced the fence adjacent to the bike path. We're going to replace the fence. We'll separate it, separate it, separate it, separate it, separate it, separate it, separate it, separate it, separate it, separate it, separate it, separate it, separate it, separate it, separate it, separate it, separate it, separate it, separate it, separate it, separate it, separate it, separate it, separate it, separate it, separate it, separate it, separate it, separate it, separate it, separate it, separate it, separate it, separate it, separate it, separate it, separate it, separate it, separate it, separate it, separate it, separate it, separate it, separate it, separate it, separate it, separate it, separate it, separate it, operations with the alt site out of the genesis operating budget the operating budget that we use for genesis so there was no real identified standalone funding for alternate site operations and so what I'd like to do is create a capital project to fund the alternate site and that includes you know the the multiple times per week we service the dumpsters the portable restrooms the fencing costs all of those add up to several thousand dollars per month and so I would like to establish this capital project to fund those ongoing operational costs for the alternate site all right questions okay seeing none speakers all right entertain a motion I'll move to approve but just a clarification the capital product 505 34 that is a new account that will go on in perpetuity so it'll help us for tracking purposes correct or is that used for other items 505 34 I think was the previous capital project we will create a new capital project once this is approved and it will go on to fund the operations and so they will be easily identify on trackable that's what I was hoping for okay move to approve second all right just say that while I'm not sure exactly what this is gonna entail in terms of work going on out there I'm glad that we're taking I think some responsibility for the alternative sites which all are ours and we are no longer going to pretend like we're not responsible for what happens there what is there what isn't there so all right we have a motion from vice mayor Reynolds and tying motion between councilmember Tannen and council member Tannen council member Bennett yes council member Morgan council member Tanden yes council member Van Overbeck yes council member Winslow yes vice mayor Reynolds yes mayor Koolidge aye carries 7-0 all right we're going to move on to the next item that we're going to be discussing is the! item 5.3 ratification of memorandum of understanding Chico police management employees Chelsea Pivas director of human resources and risk management good evening mayor vice mayor members of the council before you tonight is our final draft of the ratification of the MOU with Chico police management group we have called out several areas that we saw key changes in the last couple of weeks and we are going to be talking about the changes in the last couple of weeks and we are going to be talking about the changes in including removing the limited re-opener so the contract stays as is for the duration unless we go back and do some meet and confer which is always possible but we changed the way that the pay increases are structured as part of the contract we also added things like bilingual pay and amended uniform allowance and essentially took anything that was within the Chico police officers association contract and compared it against the Chico police management contract and said where are we missing the gaps to make people want to promote and that was really sort of what we looked at when we entered into negotiations and we were successful with moving forward with the contract before you tonight and the approximate cost of the contract is just over 1.5 million for the duration of the contract and it is for a three-year term all right questions thank you speakers entertain a motion move to approve I have a motion from council member Bennett second from council member Morgan madam clerk when you're at council member Bennett yes council member Morgan council member Tandon yes council member Van Overbeck yes council member Winslow no vice mayor Reynolds aye mayor Cooley aye carries 6-1 all right item 5.4 council member Van Overbeck requests downtown parking requirements and I believe we have you for this one all right so on under Chico's municipal code 19.70.040 provides that residential development for the downtown in the in lieu parking benefit area must have one designated parking space per unit what's happened across the state is that this requirement has been eliminated in order to facilitate the conversion of many times vacant second stories into residential and beyond that our general plan in section DT the downtown element 7.2.1 is a! separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate what, where's that threshold, if there is one. Third, I think if we do this, that Chico needs to have a residential parking permit system for a reduced rate for people who live in the core and park in the 10 hour zone. And then the fourth is the amended language to update the code. All right, may I add one thing? I'm sorry? May I add something? Yes, please. The entire city because of where the bus routes are, the entire city actually falls within a half mile of a transit stop. Easy. So I only know that because I served on BCAD for two years. So Casey probably knows that too, because she's our rep now. So, all right, questions? Mr. Bannon, over back. Can I make a recommendation? Here we go. You can certainly add something to his information, sure. No, and I appreciate that. And we, I met with council member Van Overbeck and so did Brendan Ottoboni. And this is something I think that's highly supported by staff, anything that can help invigorate the downtown area. And so what I would request is we have a significant plug of code amendments that's coming forward as part of the housing element. Also other state mandated requirements that all fall under a heading that I like to call residential readiness. This kind of promotes that as well. And so I'd like to include this request, as part of the, as part of that great big plug of code amendments that will come forward, get vetted by staff, then get a recommendation from the planning commission. Again, this is something we're looking to do in the early part of 2024 and get that in front of you. So that would be my request to kind of put it with a lot of other things that will support residential development. Okay. So do we have any speakers on this item? Four. All right. Let's hear from them. Three minutes peace. Unless there's any more questions for Mr. Bannon, over back. I have comments, but I'll wait. Okay. Thank you. Okay. The first two speakers are Bryce Goldstein, followed by Bruce McLean. You can go ahead and line up. You go ahead and come up, right? Thank you. Oh, you have a different microphone now. Just for this meeting. Wow. Special. Hi everybody. My name is Bryce Goldstein. I am a former planning commissioner, current climate action commissioner, and I'll make this quick. I want to thank council member Van Overbeck for bringing this item forward. I think this is a really important item and a really important discussion. I like being able to walk everywhere and I love to see more walkable housing opportunities being built in Chico. And I've been sad to see some projects in the downtown area not come to fruition because of parking requirements that just made them either not pencil out or otherwise they failed due to these excess requirements that I feel are not necessary. So I think that our lovely downtown area is a great place to be. And downtown looks and feels so nice because it was built in an era before extensive parking requirements and that we can get back to that by deregulating it. So I support removing parking requirements in the downtown north and downtown south areas. Thank you very much. Thank you. Bruce McLean followed by Monica McDaniel. Hi. If any of you have been lucky enough to visit and walk around downtown, it's really a separate city than it ever was, it's separate than it ever was, it's separate than it ever was, it's separate than it ever was, it's separate than it ever was, it's separate than it ever was, it's separate than it ever was, it's separate than it ever was, separate than it ever was, separate than it ever was, separate than it ever was, separate than it ever was, separate than it ever was, separate than it ever was, separate than it ever was, separate than it ever was, separate than it ever was, separate than it ever was, separate than it ever was, separate than it ever was, separate than it ever was, separate than it ever was, You don't see anybody coming to the United States and wanting to walk around our suburbs. They're not very interesting places to visit. There's very little, if any, commercial. So I want to also congratulate Councillor Overbeck for bringing up this issue. I think it's a very important issue. It would be nice to see downtown further populated with residents who obviously would be having their coffees and eating their restaurant meals. More likely downtown than some other far-flung area. It'll help revive the city. But I've heard you mention that this could be applied throughout the whole city. And I think that's a great idea. Thanks. Thank you. Monica McDaniel, followed by Mike Jensen. Good evening. Council. I'm grateful that this is on the agenda also. I was a co-owner of a business on the corner of 1st and Esplanade that was a mixed-use property. And when we wanted to expand the business, the parking requirements made it cost prohibitive. So cost prohibitive, we had to take out an additional loan to do those changes on that property. So I'm excited to see the parking requirements considering to be changed. And I'm in support of it. And I just wanted to share that. Thank you. Thank you. Mike? Mike Jensen is our last speaker. All right. Great. I'm in total salute of this overbeck. I'm glad to agree with, you know, the proposal. I'm glad I'm here. I haven't been on stage for a while. So maybe I'll get some kudos from the neighbors and people that watch this on TV. I come out of Sacramento. My older brother was more of a mechanic and he could make things run mechanically. So I would get on the bus or go downtown on the transit. I found the sack. There's a little light rail there. And so that's where I get on this issue where, gee whiz, you could just major cities, Chico's not one, but you could just impact near the transits. And that's, I guess, it's an AB, a state thing. Great. Just, whew, excellent. I don't know what it does for taxes. I don't know what the police and fire think about it. But I think it's a great way to get more people. I happened to live at 1200 Park 10 years ago for two years. And I was able to, you know, enjoy downtown more. So let me see. I kind of want to waste a minute. Maybe I won't. But, yeah, I'm glad I'm here. And I salute Mr. Overbeck. I sure hope it goes all the way through. And we manifest this as a city regulation. Thanks. Thank you. This is our last speaker. All right. Thank you. Okay. Comments? Motion? So no one showed up in favor of parking, which I think is incredible. I mean, good job, Chico. I think across the city you can see where when we put in mandatory off-street parking requirements, the urban character has just significantly degraded. Like, I don't know. I think it's in our general plan because it's very widely recognized that the old neighborhoods, the central neighborhoods are the places that people like better. And I think that's a really key element to it is that you can have, you know, commercial with like a little setback or no setback and not set behind parking lots. And there's a lot of different elements to why I support this. I, you know, no secret, I would like to see large downtown housing projects. And I think that really we don't have the opportunity in Chico for people to live in a place where they don't pay for parking. Because if the city is requiring that you put in parking to build your apartment, then if you don't have a car and you don't use that space, you still pay for that parking. Somebody else might use it or not. And there's a lot of strategies that other cities are implementing to like across the board give opportunities for people to have more affordable living environments that are not dominated by the use of automobiles. You can unbundle your parking costs from housing costs. I think we should look into a lot of these things. Where I differ with this. I think this recommendation just on some little things is I don't think we should be looking at just small projects. I think we should be looking at the kind of housing projects that are proposed downtown and work backwards from there of what pencils out, what is feasible and how do we actually get the kind of building that we want to see to happen downtown. I don't know that there's a lot of eight to ten unit projects to be proposed. There are certainly some vacant spaces that can be converted to it. But to my knowledge, the only two housing projects in downtown since 2018 were both recommended by staff. So this sort of idea sort of sort of sort of sort of! 15 minutes in peak hours. We don't have any of that in Chico. We have some of the best transit in the north state, which doesn't really say a lot. We need to work our way up to that, and these are the sort of projects I think will get us there. What I would get to is I like the recommendations here, and I think that our staff is very confident and could come back with really good recommendations for us, but as the policymakers, I think it's important that we give the direction to move forward and say what we want. We might not have the answer right now. I think that internal affairs is a better place to work out those sort of things. Council Member Van Overbeek and I both sit, and I think we can get an analysis from staff on what would be the impacts if we were to move in particular directions, but I do think that it's on us. If we want to see these kind of projects, then we should give the direction to just eliminate the parking requirements and go forward there, rather than give staff the option of bringing us back to that or allow them to choose, because it's not really the direction that they have. I think that's something that we have to make dramatic changes, but this is something that I think we're in agreement to a certain extent that we want to promote. All right. Further comment? So just to be clear, what I'm—when I get a chance to make my motion, it will be to have staff return with a recommendation, and I'm not proposing that we limit it to 10 or 100 or any other number. I want to hear what the staff has to say by studying what has been done in other cities and best practices. Yeah. And I have every confidence that the staff— Our staff can do that. You want to make that a motion? Yeah. So my motion is to have the city staff draft a proposal that would eliminate or modify the current city code requiring designated parking for residential development in the downtown core and be in compliance with Chico's general plan in AB 2097. Can I suggest a friendly amendment that we come back to it in internal affairs so we have a better opportunity to workshop it ourselves? With seven people, sometimes it gets difficult as— Yeah. As the chairman of internal affairs, I would rather have a friendly amendment. I would rather bypass that and let staff do it. And if we don't like what staff comes back with, then maybe we can take it to internal affairs. All right. We have a motion and a second. I would like to make a comment. Anyone else? Let me substitute motion. But you go first. Oh, okay. So I like this. I do think we need to be careful in terms of the, you know, larger developments. So I think larger developments in the downtown, let's say it was 100 unit. Okay. So, you know, if you're looking at, let's say, a lot of the, you know, the! I mean, I think the parking spaces, you know, the parking spaces that are within a half mile of the bus stop isn't always come to fruition. So I don't anticipate it as a problem here, but I'd also like to pay careful attention to how many units versus how many parking spaces, particularly in the college town. You know, having kids who have gone to college, I've seen, you know, plenty of college parking problems around parking units that don't have enough room for the cars. So I think it's just something to be aware of, but I do appreciate you moving this forward. I think it makes a lot of sense on its basics. So I'll definitely support that aspect. And you had a substitute motion. It is my experience that in 2023 in Chico, we have a housing crisis. We don't have a parking crisis. And I think if that ever turns around, we will certainly have the opportunity to come back and reevaluate our policies. But my substitute motion would be to approve the recommendations of Council Member Van Overbrook with the exception of directing staff to come back with a proposal to eliminate parking spaces. Okay, so, again, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, I think looking at a residential parking permit program and the area where we eliminate the parking requirements is good, but I would like to not ask for staff to come back with a recommendation for what size of projects we are limiting this to, but simply, like many cities across the state or anywhere with a major transit stop, eliminate parking requirements for housing altogether. Oh, okay. All right, so the suit motion, do we have a second? All right, so the suit motion fails for lack of a second. Madam Clerk, you can take the roll for the original. Okay, let me get back there. When you're ready. Okay. Council Member Bennett? Yes. Council Member Morgan? Yes. Council Member Tandon? Yes. Council Member Van Overbeck? Yes. Council Member Winslow? Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds? Aye. Mayor Coolidge? Aye. Carries 7-0. All right. All right, we have a report, and as it's noted, a report only from Barbara Martin, Administrative Services Director. And I'm assuming that means that we can't do anything because it's a report only, yes? It says report only. No? We can't do something? That's what you asked to have come back. Okay. But we can still take action on it because it's on the agenda, correct? Correct? Yeah, that's the question I'm asking. Yeah. Okay. Okay. So report. Report and maybe action. We'll see. Okay. Fire away. Thank you, Mayor Coolidge, Vice Mayor Reynolds, members of the council. On September 5th, a report was provided to you all about short-term rentals within the city of Chico. After discussion, a couple questions were asked by the council to be brought back later meeting, and I am bringing those answers back to you tonight. One of the questions was about mailing addresses of the property owners of the short-term rentals within the city. The first one was about the impact to hotels and their occupancy in the city, and then also a request for a map of where the rentals are. The first one, well, the third one, really, the map was provided in the report. As you can see from the plot map there, they're pretty well spread out throughout the city limits. Many different areas. Not heavily dense in any one area except for those areas that have quite a few housing areas. So, there's a lot of items there. Regarding the mailing addresses in the report, you can see that there are 22 properties that are property addresses that are outside of Butte County, 42 in another location in California, and five out of state. That's out of the 300 that are considered active in the system right now. I just want to note about those properties that are spread out. I looked through all the different addresses, and there wasn't any, you know, one company that had a bunch of properties. All renting out in the city limits. There were many diverse, mostly single owners that were on the list of owners for the properties. And then also wanted to note that of the 300 registered, or of the 300 active property owners or active properties within the short-term rentals, HDL considered as of June 2023, 223. And then 215 registered with them, which what they kind of considered those in the business of doing short-term rentals. So, they have, they're active in the system, and then they've also filed a return within the last year. According to HDL, there are a number of properties that are out there that they just never close. They may have rented long ago, and then it's still active in the system, but they don't have a, they haven't filed a return within the last year's time. Also, there are a lot of properties that are listed on the list. So, they're on Airbnb and such that actually never rent, or maybe they only rent one week out of a year or something like that. So, it's not an ongoing thing for them. And then I just also wanted to note that as of the part of the recently approved housing element, the city committed to monitor short-term rentals and their impacts on the housing availability within the city. So, with that, I'll take any questions, any additional items that you want to talk about. Questions? Do we require business licenses for short-term rentals? Yep. Even if it's just one, anybody who pays the TFT? Yeah, anybody that's advertising there that is an active listing that required. That's one of the things HDL does is make sure they have that. All right. Other questions? So, they don't automatically renew it. If HDL finds somebody listed a property, then they make them get a license? Is that how it works? Yeah. If they find them and they acknowledge that they are actively renting the property, then they can get a license. If they don't get a license, and they don't have a property, then that's part of the process. That's part of kind of their auditing is to make sure they have a business license. Is there any consequence for those property owners who do not comply? I'm sure there are. They get delinquency notices and things like that, and HDL follows up with them. I'm not sure what their exact penalties are, but they go after them when they are delinquent on any of their reports. It has been brought to the attention that Airbnb, for example, is a very expensive property. It works directly with cities to get the taxes to be paid. I'm not sure how much do we pay to HDL to do that service? 15% of the returns that they collect. Did we explore working directly with the platforms to do that? We haven't recently. When we did the contract with HDL back in 2018, we did an RFP, and that was the best deal on the block at the time of who responded. We can certainly go back out to RFP if this is more of a, you know, this is such a fairly new business for many people. I think that there are more entities out there now that are in the business of actually doing this collection and that sort of thing for cities. So we can definitely look into it. Is that an open ending contract that just automatically renews? Yeah, we can terminate it within, for 10 days notice kind of thing. Yeah. You know, I do believe that, you know, that, I mean, it says in the report that we have 215 active units, but, you know, a quick search on Airbnb, that's just one of the platforms, shows they're close to 400 listings. So it seems like there's a big discrepancy, and I do understand this looks like a small number compared to 49,000 housing units. But a lot of the cities who have not done anything. Eventually got into the trouble and had to go out and ban them. So I'm looking more forward to do small restrictions or define who can have it and how many they can have it. I'm not looking here to eliminate that because travel has certainly changed a lot after COVID. And this is a necessity of the community if we want to promote tourism. So I have a couple of recommendations, and I'm totally open to taking it to the internal. I'm open to doing internal affairs where we can, you can bring more information on how to collect it and discuss the recommendations on that as well. Let's do speakers. Yeah. Any more questions? All right. Do we have speakers? We have one, Monica McDaniel. Thank you, Ms. Park. I'm surprised I'm the only speaker. I've heard so many questions. I'm not sure I've heard so much hubbub about Airbnbs. I just wanted to share my opinion. I'm very pro-tourism. And I think that Airbnbs provide the visitors to Chico an authentic experience of getting to see our city. And I'm all for that. I applaud the city and their efforts to reopen the airport, all those things. On the flip side of that, I'm worried about housing. And I'm glad to hear that that's already embedded and councilors are already thinking about the housing backside of that. I'm worried that out-of-town interests are buying up affordable housing. The other side is that since they're not hotels, they're not regulated like hotels. And I have heard citizens complain about Airbnbs parties and different things going on. And they don't have any oversight because the owner is not on site or is not nearby. So those are just some of the concerns that I wanted to bring forward to council as they consider ways to regulate Airbnbs. And short-term rentals. Thank you. All right. Thank you. Comments? Discussion? Yeah. I want to share my first observation upon seeing this map of the locations of Airbnbs. I wish we had it up on the screen because I don't think it's just me. But I mentioned it at the last meeting. It's like the concern that I had through talking with people through my understanding of other cities is not so much that Airbnb impacts the overall city. So when you look at it relative to the number of housing units. Citywide. It can seem really small. But there are some particular neighborhoods with, especially with walkable access to areas that people want to be like downtown that are disproportionately impacted. And that's what I see in this map. I see a concentration especially in the E streets right over here. What realtors call the golden triangle between downtown 1 Mile and 8th Street. In the neighborhood and in portions of the avenues, especially the closest to downtown where people can walk here well. Those are really good places for people to live when you work in downtown Chico. And people love those areas. They're very desirable. And so that's where I see that Airbnb can threaten to outbid like local workers' wages. And that's where I think we have the risk of it growing to become more of an impact. And it has, you know, more or less gradually. There's certainly market trends that make it not just scale up. But I do think it's something that we should continue to be concerned about. And I don't think that the analysis that came from staff really matters. I think it's something that's really represented those concerns that I see just looking at this map and where a lot of these Airbnbs are being concentrated. Well, depending on whose numbers you believe, between .4% and .8 or so percent of the city's housing stock is used for Airbnb. This is not a problem. And so the last thing we need is more regulation and to suck up more council time on something that is not a problem. And maybe we hear about it a year from now, get a report. But at this point, I think what we've determined given the numbers of almost 50,000 housing units against 2 to 400 Airbnb units is that we do not have a problem with this in Chico. I'm not sure you understood what I was saying about the concentration in particular neighborhoods. I heard you. In that neighborhood, if we were to look at it, I think it would be more shocking. I listen to every word you say. Yeah. I listen to every word you say. All right. Any further comments? No. Okay. Thank you. I have some interest in exploring this. I think it's worthwhile to look at it. I certainly have a concern for some of those particular neighborhoods. I think it's maybe worthwhile to explore some additional regulations if they're needed. I think it might be worthwhile to explore a new company, put this back out to bid. I'm not really sure. What kind of motion am I – What kind of – I mean, we certainly cannot create housing as quickly as if we can eliminate some of these housing to become a long-term housing available to the residents right now, which was our main thing is that we have seen in many cities that people from out of state or out of city comes in and buy a bunch of houses and turn them into short-term rentals that takes the housing stock for the long-term housing. So I think the one thing that I would like to propose is to only allow the residents of the Butte County to be able to operate a short-term rental housing in Chico. So that way the money remains local because it's more local. I mean, we need it. We cannot eliminate it, but we can try to keep it more local. That would be my recommendation. And maybe limit it to two years. Two short-term rentals per individual. So we don't have someone come in, buy like 20 units and turn them into a short-term rental. Those are my two recommendations at this point. All right. Mr. City Manager, I'm going to do what we're allowed to do, but we very rarely do, is get your opinion on this issue. Gee, thanks. Yeah. You're welcome. You know, we're happy to take whatever direction council wants to give. Yeah. You know, having looked through a lot of ownership records, it's exceedingly difficult at times to tell where the owner lives. I've looked at people I know, and I see an out-of-state address because a son or daughter handles their property tax payments and some other things. Sure. So I just worry about the practicality and how much time and effort. And then what is the objective? So that's what I'm looking for you folks. Okay. What is the objective? And I heard local ownership, but I wonder about the practicality and I wonder about the legality of such a restriction. You danced really well. Thank you. Well, maybe I can make a quick comment. I completely understand where you're coming from on this one, Topeka, and I agree with you on it. And it is definitely. It's definitely something we need to watch. Maybe going back out for RFP. Surely the technology has got to be a lot better for tracking houses. I mean, you can pull up Airbnb right now and there's three, four hundred and we're only seeing 215. So let's make sure we're getting the TOT and the tax revenue and the business license and everything that we should. And then maybe we visit it in six months, a year, whatever it is, when we actually have a little bit more accurate data. But if I could on that point, you know, we have how many zip codes? Nine. Nine, five, nine, two, six, nine, nine, two, eight, nine, five, nine, seven, three. And each one of those extends far beyond the city limits. Yeah. So just because a listing says, quote unquote, Chico does not mean it's in the city limits. Yeah. Gotcha. Yeah. And when they do list on Airbnb, if they actually rent from their HDL gets that information and they do get that's kind of what they do is they track that. So that's what they're saying is that there are a lot of people that advertise that don't. Actually. Ever. Ever rent anything on there. So that's why there's a big disparity in the numbers. Or maybe they advertised a long time ago and never pulled it down or something like that. Gotcha. Okay. Thank you. All right. I'm going to make a motion that we go back out to bid on this. And if HDL ends up winning it, they do. And then staff comes back in six months with an update in terms of the number of units in Chico. Hmm. As a compromise between our two sides here. Our two sides. I think it's more complicated issue than two sides. And I can say that because I'm not even sure what I want to do. So I don't know that I'm on a particular side. I certainly don't want to ban Airbnb's. I don't even know about just restricting it to people Chico addresses for the reasons Mr. Sorson mentioned among others. I've read of a lot of different things that cities have done to try to, you know, from just trying to recover more revenue out of this something like tiered fees. So whether it's owner occupied this being the goal being we want this to be. A legitimate business option for people who own a home. We want it to be able to expand our capacity to take into risk for particular times of the year like graduation notably here. But we also don't want to see it gobbling up existing kind of lower cost homes in good areas of Chico. And so tiering the fees allows you like. Select more towards the owner occupied smaller scale more flexible and less against it as a business model of buying up houses converting them to Airbnb's. That's just one of the ideas. I'm not really saying. We should. Suppose that right now because I just don't think that I have the votes really. But I do think that we probably we should keep looking at it. I think internal affairs again is a good place for us to workshop things like this. And we certainly aren't stacked there in favor of some extreme regulation. So if we were to continue talking about it I would suggest that we do it there. Perhaps make that a motion that we just continue this. Is that a substitute motion because my motion is still on the floor. All right. Was there a second for my motion. Hold on. So there's a second for my motion. There's a second for the substitute motion. Excuse me. No. Were you substituting this first or the second. I'm not sure. No. I'm not sure. Okay. Substituting my motion to go out back out to bid and then bring it back in six months. I would like this to go to the internal affairs committee. Okay. To take a good look at it. So. They can discuss it and then bring it back. Okay. So procedurally is there a second on my motion or no. All right. We'll let it die. So. Okay. Your motion becomes the motion. The motion. The motion that I made. Yes. And you have a second. Madam McClart. Do you have a full understanding of that motion. If I could have Council Member Winslow please repeat his. I with no qualification just said we should continue this discussion in internal affairs. Okay. Thank you. So just continue the discussion. And Mr. Bennett you're the second. All right. Okay. Seconded by Council Member Bennett. Council Member Bennett. I think so. Yes. Council Member Morgan. I'm sorry. I'm voting no because this is a solution looking for a problem. Council Member Tandon. Yes. Council Member Van Overbeck. Yes. Council Member Winslow. I think so. Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds. Abstain. Okay. Mayor Coolidge. Aye. Okay. Carries five one with one abstention. All right. So we have a motion. Second. Second. Second. Second. Second. Second. Second. Second. Second. Second. Second. Second. Second. Second. Second. Second. Second. Second. Second. Second. Second. Second. Second. Second. Second. Second. Second. Second. Second. Second. Second. Second. Second. Second. Second. Second. consideration of a resolution that calls for formally calls for the the referendum on Valley's Edge for resolution 08 Dash 23, which was the approval of the general plan amendment and then resolution oh nine 23 which was the approval of the specific plan those were Referred by the council in April to go to a special election, which we asked you at the time When you wanted to hold it you said you wanted it to be consolidated in with the presidential primary election to be held in March of 2024 so this resolution And I would like to note real quick is that everyone has in front of them an amended resolution with the correct ballot title in summary it also lays out the deadlines for Arguments, which is November will be November 6 for arguments and rebuttals will be on the 27th of November It also directs the city attorney to prepare an impartial analysis So that resolution also asked the county to please consolidate this election in with their presidential Primary because typically the city of Chico does not hold our elections or have anything go at this time in addition this has to be approved by the supervisors that they Once we get the adopted resolution over to them it actually goes before the supervisors and they decide whether or not they want to consolidate I They have they have always consolidated I don't think that it would be any different but anyway that is what is before you and if you have any questions I'm happy to answer anything. All right questions I just want to clarify if you want to say yes to Valley's Edge you vote. Yes. Yes And if you want to say no to Valley's Edge you vote no, that is correct That is how it's laid out in the amended resolution It is online it we uploaded it to Granicus as well as we provided hard copies here in the back of the room as well as In front of the council better better than the opposite Sure, all right. We have any speakers we do we have one speaker and that is David Welch All right, there we go entertain motion Second A motion and a second Councilmember Bennett Yes Councilmember Morgan Yes Councilmember Tandon Yes Councilmember Van Overbeck Yes Councilmember Winslow Yes Vice Mayor Reynolds Yes Mayor Coolidge Aye Carries 7-0 Okay, we don't need to read the whole resolution. No sure. I'm positive. Just kidding. I don't want to read it. I wanted her to read it just for fun. All right, Mr. Ottoboni director of public works slash engineering. Welcome. Hello. Good evening. Mayor, Vice Mayor and City Council members. Item 5.7 is a consideration for adopting a 10-year roadway priority list. Can I get the presentation? I thought I did. Thank you. That would not be mine. All right, here we go. And now I can't find. There you go. Thank you. Now I have a technical support staff as well. So, I'm going to go ahead and take a quick break. Got to keep that going. All right. So, thank you. So, we're here this evening to talk about 10-year roadway priority list. I'll go through some background first. So, we've done some previous pavement condition indexes, pavement management program updates in 2015, 2019, 2021, each resulting in a network PCI or pavement condition index. With 2015 being a 61, then 2019, 52, and 2020, 52. And then 2021 going down to a 49. The most recent adoption or pavement management program update identified some funding analysis for different intentions, I guess, to achieve certain PCI outcomes. And so, this table here is provided of what those were identified back in 2021. I want to start here by also talking about the first Measure H project that we did. So, we had a budget of $4 million to be delivered this year. So, in the 2022, 2023 fiscal year budget, $4 million were allocated. Due to the timing of it, we implemented a slurry seal project so that we could get to those quickly. They don't require as much design work. And we are happy that we were able to deliver those projects. Our staff really did an amazing job jumping on that and appreciate the council's support to address this critical community need. This is a 10-year roadway project. It's a big challenge, we know, with the Measure H passing and some of the funding going to roadway improvements. But it's a challenge that myself and our staff are extremely excited about. Can't say enough good things about our staff that we do have and the team that we're building in the engineering department. So, to showcase some of those improvements, this past summer, we completed East Avenue, Lassen Avenue, and Locust Avenue with some of the adjacent streets off of Locust being addressed. So, you can see the block of roadway. You can see the four and after pictures, extending the life of the pavement, but also refreshing the striping and other elements of the roadway. So, getting into the meat and potatoes here, why adopt a 10-year CIP for a roadway maintenance program such as this? First, obviously, citizen communication expectations. We receive a lot of calls and complaints of the condition of the roadways, as I know many of the City Council members do as well. So, this is a lot of work. So, this enables us to communicate and create expectations as those citizens call and e-mail us on when the road in front of their home or on the street that they drive is going to be fixed. Second, is utility coordination. So, a lot of our roadway projects, especially the reconstruction ones, require a lot of utility coordination, so that when we go and spend taxpayer dollars on fixing the roadway, we're coordinating the underground utilities, so that those are repaired on the same timeline, ahead of when we start rebuilding, of our reconstruction work and that way the roadway is done no underground utilities will have to be done after that and trenched through our road so examples in the past we've coordinated with cal water and pg e quite frequently and they've got on they've gotten on board with our program and either the year before or prior to our construction they're doing their design work and putting their crews to work to replace those those older lines so it's kind of a you know fix it once touch it once type of approach third design considerations timing and right-of-way acquisitions so a lot of our projects require design work to be complete especially the more complex ones there's a lot of processes that go into the design and one of which is right-of-way as we need to expand our right-of-way construction and we will be able to get that done in the future to put in sidewalks where they don't exist. In terms of design considerations, as staff, the process that we go along is we have to first start with topographic survey. We go in and we do base mapping. We start to develop our design software. Through that, we start to coordinate with utilities. We evaluate what the improvements are going to be. We incorporate planning level documents, such as our bike plan, active transportation plan. We look at if there are sidewalk gaps from an ADA standpoint, we're going to fill those in so that there's accessible paths of travel. Also, if there's lighting deficiencies, we'll look at adding street lighting so that, again, when we touch this roadway and we walk away from it, that it's done and complete. Timing-wise, looking at a 10-year program, what that does is a lot of the projects that you'll see kind of in the beyond years, the year 7, year 8, year 9, are more complex. For example, the avenues. Those are very old, outdated infrastructure elements. So the design pieces are going to be more complex. And by developing and adopting a 10-year CIP, we can start the design now. And by the time that project comes available for that year's funding, it's designed and ready to go, and we can meet that commitment. And lastly, we're going to look at the design of the roadways. So we're going to look at the operations and maintenance coordination and their efforts. We've got an excellent operations and maintenance crew with Director Gustafson. We coordinate regularly so that we're complementary to one another and that we're looking at these roadway improvements holistically and efficiently so that we can deliver on extending the life of our pavement at a cost-effective rate. So for assumptions, what we're doing is basing our roadways on the roadways. We're going to look at our assumptions in terms of funding off of the fiscal year 23-24 budgeted amounts. Our gas tax funds are about $2.6 million per year towards our capital roadway improvements. We have about $1.4 million in waste dollar franchise revenues that go towards capital replacement for our road rehab projects. And then this first year, Measure H was a $10 million allocation. So from a programming perspective, we're assuming a $14 million allocation. So we're assuming a $14 million per year allocation of funds. I understand Measure H, you know, we're still in the infancy of that and trying to understand what those actual revenues will be. So there's some variability in that, but as a starting point, we're assuming that $10 million figure. If the funding goes up, we can increase projects, add projects, or accelerate some. If it goes down, we can pull some off. So I just wanted to caveat that. But we have to have a starting point for our assumptions. So lastly, I know it's kind of hard to read here, but it's in the staff report outlining the intended locations, year one through year 10. We've provided this map to showcase and highlight the intended areas. Some of these areas will include slurry seals of general neighborhoods. That's why you kind of see the clouds in there. Generally speaking, our approach is not necessarily a worst first. It's a combination of reconstruction of failed roadways that are heavily traveled, so arterials and collector types. And then while we're in that area, the intention would be adjacent to that, hitting neighborhoods with slurry seal type of projects so that when we fix the roads in an area, we're addressing that whole area and moving on and progressing through the town. Generally speaking, I think one thing I know to be fair to all council member districts, generally speaking, it's... We wanted to make sure, too, by showcasing this map that, again, generally speaking, we're kind of touching evenly all the council districts so that, again, it's spread throughout the town evenly. That concludes my report, and I'm available for any questions. Questions? Mr. Brennan? I'll be quick. On the list, I just have a few questions about year one, 2024. It says Bruce Road widening $4 million. $4 million. That can't be for the widening of all of Bruce Road, is it? Yes, it is. Is it engineering? Yeah. So we put the project out to bid in May and received very high bids compared to what our original estimates were, and so we've been hit with some inflation. And so, yes, part of our recommendation is to include what we believe the delta is needed to make up that difference and deliver the project, put it out to bid this winter. Is that going to be four lanes then? No, on top of the grant funding. Oh, on top, sorry. On top of the grant funding, yes. This would be $4 million in addition to the grant funding. Thank you. Sorry, I didn't understand. I looked at that and thought, wow, you're amazing. It would be a really good... Or it's a really cheap road. Yeah. The bridge itself is going to cost more than that. That's what I thought. He is amazing, but not that amazing. Notre Dame Boulevard, I assume that's going to be an overlay or slurry seal? That would be a reconstitution. Reconstruct. Reconstruct. Rio Lindo, I'm familiar with. And the park roads in Stillson Canyon, I have no question. Thank you. Yeah. Thank you. Mr. Hanover. So let me start by saying I applaud your having a 10-year vision for this instead of doing this stuff a year at a time and for all the obvious reasons, that's a good idea. But related to that, if we approve this 10-year list, I'm presuming that one of the things that we'll see in it, it will be separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, separate, over what we completed the prior year and what the intended budget would be for that upcoming year. That would be, yeah, my expectation. Thank you. And I did have that on my list. And I think it'd be perfect to come back in October, the year, and that's in plenty of advance of the, it's in advance of the budget season. So if you saw some changes that need to be made or we see some changes, we have plenty of time to talk about that prior to the budget cycle. So I'm gonna suggest coming back in October of each year, giving an update and let us see where you are. We had some discussion about this, having it prior to the budget discussion each year. So maybe more like a February or March. Would you be willing to? Certainly. I mean, we're not there yet. I mean, we've gotta hear public comment and everything else, but I'm just thinking, you know, I'm not sure if we're gonna be able to do that. I want it outside the budget discussion, but I think it's about as well. I think it would be helpful to have the budgetary numbers. We're usually a year ahead. So if this upcoming budget, you know, that'll start for internal staff in the January timeframe, we come forward and typically the April or May timeframe to council, that'll be the 24, 25. So that funding really doesn't get put into place until 2025, the second year of that fiscal year, due to budgeting purposes. And then putting out to bid contracts and hiring contractors and having the funding available. So one added element is just if the budget numbers fluctuate from that measure H number, that allows us to be nimble and communicate to council how maybe our original list is affected by those numbers. All right. Do we have more questions? Yeah. So I think in this report, really appreciate you made a really good case for why we should have this kind of 10 year plan to like look ahead what needs to be done. And I think that's something that's been done in advance and how some of these projects are lined up that way. But I didn't see any analysis of why we chose these projects in this order. And you say it's not a worst first deal, but because we have so many different city policies relating to like where we should put our infrastructure funding and you can find it in our housing element that we just passed unanimously. And in our circulation element, there's really like an emphasis towards building this multimodal transit system and transportation system. And what I'm trying to say is, you know, what I'm also concerned about is we have a draft active transportation plan right now. It's in draft form. We haven't approved it. We haven't even seen it as a council. And so I'm wondering like what informed this selection of projects, if you can go into that. Yeah, I think I briefly mentioned it earlier that, you know, it's multifaceted. So arterials collectors carry higher volumes of traffic. So more people are touching those roadways with their vehicles. Typically, so those are kind of priority locations for reconstruction, typically. And then again, based on that, we're gonna try and achieve slurry seals and more of the local residential type of roadways. So in terms of an active transportation plan, yeah, that's in process. We're gonna be bringing that forward here soon. That doesn't necessarily prioritize where we're doing it, but in every instance, we always include analysis and review of our bike plan. And when we're fixing the road, of course, we will, you know, AND THE PROJECT OF INCORPORATING BIKING FACILITIES AND INFRASTRUCTURE. OUR HISTORY OF ROAD REHAB PROJECTS, COHASSETTE ROAD, ESPLANAID, PARK AVENUE, MULBERRY STREET, HAVE ALL CREATED NEW BIKE LANES THAT DIDN'T PREVIOUSLY EXIST AS A PART OF THE RECONSTRUCTION EFFORTS. AND SO THIS ISN'T OUR ENTIRE CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM. THESE ARE JUST ROAD REHABILITATION PROJECTS. AND SO THAT WAS THE FOCUS OF THIS EFFORT IS ROAD REHABILITATION. AGAIN, PARTIALLY IT'S TRYING TO ALSO SPREAD IT AROUND. WE'VE DONE WORK, AS I MENTIONED, UP ESPLANAID, EAST AVENUE NOW. WE'RE GOING TO BE DOING BRUCE ROAD. WE DID PARK AVENUE. SO WE'RE TRYING TO SPREAD IT AROUND SO THAT EVERYONE IS SEEING THE BENEFITS OF THIS ADDITIONAL FUNDING. I CAN SEE THAT, LIKE, ROUGHLY, BUT GIVEN THE SCALE OF THE FUNDING THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT, I WOULD FEEL A LOT MORE COMFORTABLE IF WE HAD AN ANALYSIS OF HOW THIS IS INFORMED BY THE PAVEMENT MANAGEMENT PLAN THAT WE HAVE, THE ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION PLAN. IT WOULD FRANKLY BE BETTER IF I THINK THE ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION PLAN WERE ADOPTED BEFORE WE MAKE THIS KIND OF COMMITMENT TO THE EXTENT THAT IT'S THERE. EVEN JUST BACK IN JUNE, WE APPROVED A BUDGET WITH FUNDING FOR DESIGN FOR A NUMBER OF STREETS, AND IT INCLUDES, LIKE, HUMBLED AVENUE, CHAPMANTOWN, EVERYTHING ON THE EAST AVENUES FROM MANGROW TO 99. IT'S LISTED IN THERE, EAST AVENUES FROM ESPLANAID TO 99. AND HERE IT ONLY SAYS ESPLANAID TO MANGROW, MEANING THESE STREETS LIKE SHERMAN AND SHERIDAN THAT GO BY THE LIBRARY ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THIS. SO THEY'VE BEEN JUST BETWEEN JUNE AND NOW WHEN WE ADOPTED THE BUDGET, IT LOOKS LIKE THEY'VE BEEN TOSSED OFF THE DOCKET. AND THAT'S JUST MY COMMENT IS THAT I APPRECIATE AND I SEE THE LEVEL OF THOUGHT THAT WENT INTO THIS. I'M CONCERNED THAT IT'S BEING DONE IN ISOLATION FROM A LOT OF THESE OTHER ELEMENTS OF OUR CITY POLICIES. YEAH, I WOULD ADD THAT WITH OUR STREET SAVER SOFTWARE THAT YOU CAN PUNCH IN PARAMETERS AND IT WILL OUTPUT RECOMMENDATIONS. I BET IF YOU RAN 100 OF THOSE, YOU WOULD HAVE A LOT OF RECOMMENDATIONS. IF YOU RAN 100 OF THEM, YOU WOULD PROBABLY GET 100 DIFFERENT OUTCOMES OF DIFFERENT ROADWAYS. WITH THE 49 PCI OVERALL FOR OUR NETWORK, IT'S HARD TO FIND A ROAD THAT DOESN'T NEED TO BE REPAIRED AT THIS POINT. AND SO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS COME UP WITH SOMETHING THAT IS GOING TO GENERALLY WORK. AND WE FEEL WE'VE ACHIEVED THAT. WE LOOKED AT THE AVENUES. I MEAN, THE AVENUES ALONE, THE COMPLEXITY OF THAT BECAUSE IT'S SO OLD. WE'RE TALKING STORM DRAINAGE, HAVING TO DO THAT. ADDING LIGHTS. RECONSTRUCTING ALL THE CURB AND GUTTER. REPAVING THE ENTIRE ROAD. TREATING THE SUBGRADE. IT'S ABOUT $60 MILLION TO DO THE AVENUES ALONE AND OF ITSELF. SO IF I CAN ASK YOU, THIS MIGHT BE A GOOD TIME, TOO, TO JUST INFORM THE GENERAL PUBLIC BECAUSE I CONSTANTLY GET THIS QUESTION. THEY GO, LOOK, JUST RUN A PAVER OVER THE STREETS AND THE AVENUES. WHY CAN'T YOU JUST DO THAT? I'M LIKE, WELL, IF YOU DO, THE ROAD'S GOING TO END UP IN THE SAME CONDITION WITHIN A YEAR OR TWO BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT DOING A COMPLETE STREET. BUT LAW ALSO REQUIRES IT. SO IF YOU COULD JUST SPEAK TO THAT REAL QUICK. ABSOLUTELY. THAT'S PUTTING GOOD MATERIAL ON TOP OF BAD MATERIAL. AND SO AS PAVEMENTS AGE, THEY DETERIORATE. WHAT MAKES UP ASPHALT IS OIL, AGGREGATE, TYPICALLY SOME SAND. AND SO AS OVER TIME, THAT OIL DETERIORATES AND THAT'S WHERE YOU START TO SEE PAVEMENT FAILURES. SO RECONSTRUCTING IT, WHETHER IT'S AN OVERLAY, WHICH MEANS YOU'RE GRINDING OFF THE EXISTING ASPHALT AND PUTTING NEW ASPHALT DOWN, THAT WOULD BE A TREAT. AND SO THAT'S WHERE WE'RE GOING TO BE TREATING FOR THAT FAILURE MECHANISM. SO LET ME TAKE A STEP BACK. THERE'S DIFFERENT FAILURE MECHANISMS. SO SOMETIMES IT'S A SUBGRADE FAILURE WHERE THE UNDERLYING SOIL CONDITIONS BENEATH THE PAVEMENT SECTION FAILS. AND THAT'S WHERE WE'VE IMPLEMENTED CEMENT TREATED BASE TREATMENTS SUCH AS WE DID ON EAST AVENUE, MOLBERRY, PARK AVENUE. AND SO IT DEPENDS ON THE FAILURE. BUT, YEAH. WE'RE NOT GOING TO PUT BAD OR GOOD MATERIAL ON TOP OF IT. WE'RE GOING TO PUT BAD MATERIAL ON TOP OF BAD MATERIAL BECAUSE IT DOES NOT EXTEND THE LIFE OF THAT PAVEMENT. WELL, AND THEN IF WE HAVE TO RECONSTRUCT THE ROAD, WE HAVE TO DO A COMPLETE STREET, WHICH MEANS CURB, SIDEWALK, SCUTTERS, EVERYTHING ELSE. AND USUALLY LIGHTING. YEAH. WE HAVE ADA REQUIREMENTS. SO ANYTHING ABOVE A SLURRY SEAL REQUIRES US TO UPGRADE ALL CURB RAMPS. THAT'S WHERE THE REAL COST COMES IN BECAUSE WE CAN'T JUST RELAY THE ROADS AND THE AVENUES. WE HAVE TO PUT IN SIDEWALKS, CURBS, AND GUT. YEAH. AND TYPICALLY THE DESIGN LIFE FOR ASPHALT IS 20 YEARS. THAT'S THE DESIGN CRITERIA. THERE'S ENGINEERING THAT GOES INTO THE TRAFFIC INDEX, WHICH USES THE R VALUE THAT IS BASED ON THE GEO TECHNICAL MAKEUP OF THAT SOIL. SO THERE'S A LOT OF ENGINEERING THAT GOES INTO THE DESIGN OF THAT TO MAXIMIZE THE LIFE EXPECTANCY. SO WHEN WE SPEND TAXPAYER DOLLARS, WE'RE NOT COMING BACK IN FIVE YEARS OR TEN YEARS TO FIX SOMETHING. IT'S GOING TO LAST 20-PLUS YEARS. SURE. AND IF WE DO PROPER PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE. IT CAN LAST 30, 40, 50 YEARS. ALL RIGHT. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS? ALL RIGHT. SPEAKERS? WE HAVE FOUR. OKAY. SUSAN CHRISTIANSEN FOLLOWED BY BRYCE GOLDSTEIN. GO AHEAD. AND IF YOU COULD LINE UP IN THE MIDDLE AISLE. THANK YOU. GO AHEAD. MY NAME IS SUSAN CHRISTIANSEN. AND I EMAILED EACH OF YOU A LETTER ABOUT MY TRAFFIC CONCERNS AFTER READING ABOUT THE APPROVAL OF A 420 UNIT DEVELOPMENT ON EATON ROAD STRATTLING MARIGOLD AVENUE. MY CONCERN IS WITH INCREASED TRAFFIC AND VEHICLE SPEED ON THE ARTERIAL ROADS THAT GO NORTH AND SOUTH BETWEEN EATON ROAD AND MANZANITA AVENUE. ON THE MAP IN THE STAFF REPORT AREA THREE, YOU CAN SEE THAT LOTS OF DEVELOPMENT HAS TAKEN PLACE NORTH OF EAST AVENUE AND ON EATON ROAD. THE TRAFFIC ON FLORAL AVENUE, MARIPOSA AVENUE, CIANOTHIS AVENUE, MARIGOLD AVENUE, AND CACTUS AVENUE HAS INCREASED. THE TRAFFIC ON THE EAST AVENUE HAS INCREASED DURMATICALLY OVER THE YEARS. I FIRST CONTACTED THE CITY IN MAY 2017 AND I TURNED IN A NEIGHBORHOOD TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT PROGRAM WITH A PETITION REGARDING TRAFFIC SAFETY FOR CIANOTHIS AVENUE IN JANUARY 2018. BECAUSE THE ROADWAY BETWEEN EAST AVENUE AND MANZANITA AVENUE LACKS CONTIGUOUS SIDEWALKS AND CURBS, IT IS IN A SCHOOL SPEED ZONE AND IS CLASSIFIED AS A BIKE ROUTE, IT QUALIFIED TO PROCEED WITH THE PROGRAM. UNFORTUNATELY, THERE WERE NO FUNDS AT THE TIME. I NEVER HAD TIME TO MAKE ANY IMPROVEMENTS. FAST FORWARD SIX YEARS, MORE DEVELOPMENT HAS OCCURRED, ALTHOUGH I COULD NOT GET AN EXACT NUMBER OF UNITS FROM THE CITY OF CHICO BUILDING DEPARTMENT. THE SALES TAX INITIATIVE PASSED, WHICH INCREASED FUNDING FOR ROAD IMPROVEMENTS IN CHICO, AND TONIGHT YOU ARE BEING PRESENTED WITH A MEASURE H, 10 YEAR ROADWAY LIST APPROVAL PLAN. WHEN CHICO UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT PUT IN THE ALL WEATHER FIELD SERVICE AT THE PLEASANT VALLEY HIGH SCHOOL STADIUM, WHICH BORDERS CIANOTHIS AVENUE, THE NUMBER OF ATHLETIC EVENTS, TEAMS, AND COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS THAT USE THE FACILITY INCREASED. WHEN CARS ARE PARKED ON BOTH SIDES OF THE STREET, IT CAUSES A VERY NARROW PASSAGE, WHICH IS NOT SAFE FOR PEDESTRIANS, BICYCLISTS, OR VEHICLES. ANOTHER SAFETY ISSUE IS THE INTERSECTION AT MANZANITA AVENUE AND CIANOTHIS AVENUE. DRIVERS CUT THE CORNER, TURNING LEFT ONTO CIANOTHIS AVENUE, ENDANGERING BICYCLISTS, PEDESTRIANS, AND VEHICLES. DRIVERS AND BICYCLISTS HAVE A HARD TIME TURNING LEFT ONTO MANZANITA AVENUE DUE TO THE AMOUNT OF TRAFFIC AND THE DRIVERS EXCEEDING THE POSTED SPEED LIMIT. THERE ARE THREE SCHOOLS IN THE AREA I AM CONCERNED ABOUT. PLEASANT VALLEY HIGH SCHOOL, MARIGOLD ELEMENTARY, AND LOMA VISTA. IT IS IMPORTANT TO MAKE THESE STREETS SAFE FOR STUDENTS, PEDESTRIANS, AND BICYCLISTS. I HAVE ASKED FOR SIGNAGE THAT WOULD DISPLAY A DRIVER'S SPEED AND FLASH WHEN SPEEDS ARE IN EXCESS OF THE POSTED SPEED LIMIT. THESE SIGNS HAVE BEEN INSTALLED AT CHICO HIGH SCHOOL ON SACRAMENTO AVENUE, NEIL DOW SCHOOL ON EAST 5TH AVENUE, AND THERE IS EVEN ONE ON ARBUTUS AVENUE. THE TIME TO DO IT IS NOW, NOT PUT IT OFF UNTIL 2026 AS LISTED IN THE TENURE PLAN. WE NEED TO MAKE THIS A PRIORITY IN ORDER TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF OUR STUDENTS, PEDESTRIANS, AND BICYCLISTS IN THE AREA. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND THANK YOU TO PUBLIC WORKS AND ENGINEERING. THEY HAVE ALWAYS BEEN VERY HELPFUL, PROFESSIONAL, AND I APPRECIATE ALL THAT THEY DO. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. BRYCE GOLDSTEIN FOLLOWED BY KAREN LASLO. GOOD EVENING, COUNCIL. MY NAME IS BRYCE GOLDSTEIN. LET ME TRY TO ADJUST THIS MICROPHONE. I GUESS IT ONLY GOES ONE WAY. MY NAME IS BRYCE GOLDSTEIN. I INTRODUCED MYSELF EARLIER, BUT ONCE AGAIN, I AM A FORMER CITY OF CHICO PLANNING COMMISSIONER AND A CURRENT CLIMATE ACTION COMMISSIONER. AND I'M ALSO A MEMBER OF A LOCAL ADVOCACY GROUP FOR MULTIMODAL TRANSPORTATION CALLED CHICO SAFE STREETS COALITION. FIRST, THANKS TO BRENDAN FOR THE PRESENTATION AND FOR PERHAPS ALREADY ANSWERING SOME OF THE THINGS THAT I HAD WRITTEN INTO MY COMMENT. SO I'M HERE TO EXPRESS MY CONCERNS WITH THE PRIORITIZATION OF FUNDS FOR STREET IMPROVEMENTS AND TO SUPPORT REPRIORITIZING WHERE POSSIBLE THE CORE AREAS OF CHICO FOR THE FIRST FIVE YEARS OF THE 10-YEAR ROADWAY REPAIR LIST. THE CORE AREAS OF THE CITY ARE IN DIRE NEED OF PAVEMENT REHABILITATION, BUT THEY'RE NOT PRIORITIZED FOR FUNDING UNTIL YEAR SIX GENERALLY OR LATER. THAT'S SIX MORE YEARS OF FURTHER CRUMBLING STREETS IN DOWNTOWN, BARBER, THE AVENUES, SOUTH CAMPUS, AND MORE. AND HIGHER INCOME SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOODS ARE GENERALLY GIVEN FIRST PRIORITY IN THIS LIST. BUT WE ALL ARE PAYING INTO THE MEASURE H TAX, AND STREET CONDITIONS IMPACT EVERYBODY. SO I THINK THAT THE ROADS THAT THE MOST PEOPLE ARE USING THAT ARE IN THE WORST SHAPE DESERVE THE HIGHEST PRIORITY ON THIS LIST. AND AS A BICYCLIST, I'M VERY CONCERNED THAT THE ROODS THAT ARE IN THE WORST SHAPE DESERVE THE HIGHEST PRIORITY ON THIS LIST. AND AS A BICYCLIST, I'M VERY CONCERNED THAT THE ROODS THAT ARE IN THE WORST SHAPE DESERVE THE HIGHEST PRIORITY ON THIS LIST. WE DON'T WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE NOT ALIGNING OUR ACTIONS AND FUNDING WITH OUR STATED GOALS OF BEING A BICYCLE-FRIENDLY COMMUNITY. TO TRULY SUPPORT BICYCLING IN CHICO WE MAKE SURE THAT THE ROADS ARE NOT FALLING APART. ESPECIALLY IN THE BIKEABLE CORE AREAS OF THE CITY. AND TO MAKE SURE THEY ARE NOT DANGEROUS AND UNCOMFORTABLE FOR BICYCLISTS. Additionally, I want to see community input and Complete Streets elements in these projects. I've heard that there may not be public input processes and Complete Streets in them, and I think that if those elements are there, they're not shown in the project list, so I think that more transparency on that would be great. I know that we have policies in the general plan on including Complete Streets elements like for bicyclists in a lot of our road rehabilitation projects, and that's how we're getting bike lanes on Mulberry, and we'll soon get improvements downtown. So I just want to make sure the project list aligns with those policies. And additionally, we're in the process of updating and approving an active transportation plan, which centers largely on procuring state funds, but I think we can also prioritize how to use the local Measure H funds in this plan, and I just wanted to note that I want to make sure we are aligning well with the active transportation plan. So yeah, let's fix the streets in our most dense neighborhoods where people walk and bike the most. Let's make sure this list aligns with the goals in our active transportation plan and general plan Complete Streets elements. May ask is for prioritizing these core neighborhoods and for more transparency and detail in the project's list. Thank you. Karen Laszlo, followed by David Welch. Uh-oh. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I want to second everything that Bryce said, but I have my own comments here. Can you hear me? Is this thing on? There it goes. It's on. Okay. Stop that clock because I ride a bike for transportation. I live in the avenues, and our streets are a mess. And I'm not sure if you can hear me.

Most of the time I end up not signaling at all, which isn't safe either. If our avenue streets were fixed, it wouldn't be such a problem. A cyclist could make a hand signal without having to worry about falling off their bike when they hit a pothole or ride over rutted and rough pavements while trying to make a turn. I was hoping Measure H would get some help with our infrastructure of the avenues, but today I learned that the avenues' neighborhoods will have to wait until 2030 or beyond before we get our streets fixed. This is also unacceptable. I know the city has a policy of spending money on nice new streets to keep them that way, while letting our older neighborhood streets deteriorate even more every year. This is unacceptable. If I'd have known I would be voting against my avenue, and my neighbor's best interest, I never would have voted for Measure H. So, Vice Mayor Reynolds, you were the one that thought up Measure H. So, did you know this was going to happen to our older neighborhoods when you introduced Measure H? And if not, you should speak up in defense of our older neighborhoods and make sure we get our streets fixed as soon as possible. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. David Welch is our last speaker. I'll avoid repeating things that have already been said, but mostly just want to put in a word in support of the idea of really making, whenever streets are reconstructed, the importance of making these complete streets complete in the sense of including adequate provision for pedestrians and bicyclists in all aspects of that. And I just think it's important. It's so important that we do that. And also the idea that seeking public input from people who actually use the streets and use the streets in a whole variety of ways is really important as we do these design processes. Thank you. All right. Last speaker. Craig? Yes. That is Craig. Okay. Comments? Yeah, some comments. Comments? Comments? I have some comments. Sorry. Just to elaborate on some of what I was getting at. I think when we're looking at roughly $140 million over the life of this, this 10-year plan for this, then we can expect a little more detail in the selection of the projects. I really don't want to get to the point of saying that it's like I want my neighbors to get funding before somebody else's neighborhood. I do tend to have a bias towards the neighborhoods where we have denser housing, more low-income housing. And I think, I mean, there are policies in the housing element we just unanimously approved like a month ago. That support that. We should support resources to our older neighborhoods with more of a mixture of housing. What I would like to ask for is something more general. I'm going to get, this is going to get a little lengthy because we have a lot of plans that relate to city policy making. This is funding for our road maintenance and redesign is a huge part of city policy. So I think it's worth that kind of effort and attention and intricacy and coordination between the city and the city. The city, it's a separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate Normally, when we see some projects coming from community development, we tend to see the list of the policies and how what we're doing relates to that, how this is in compliance with those plans. And that's something that I think we deserve to see when we're talking about this scale of allocation of funding. So the circulation element, we have a pavement management program that is that assessment of pavement condition. We have an active transportation plan which is not yet approved. We have our housing element which we did approve. We have a regional transportation plan through BCAG. And we also have the sewer replacement that's going on. And my understanding in previous talks, we had said that we wanna coordinate road replacements with the sewer. And I understand that these things can't happen at the same time, but I think that when we have sewer lines that are in dire need of repairs, those should be areas that we prioritize. And just because it wasn't detailed in there, I don't know that that's what we have with this plan. So I would just like to see that, like this brought back in the same form or otherwise, but with, with some explanation detail and how it relates to these plans and elements. All right. Mr. Randall, Rick, you can comment. Okay. I have a comment. I think part of the problem here is that we're not showing our community necessarily the entire picture and our community is frustrated with that. And I think the reason why we're not showing our community the entire picture is because we're not certain what the entire picture looks like yet. And I think that's because of our tax revenue. So certainly measure H is not absolutely for sure. There's a possible, you know, ballot measure out there. There's, there's other things, but in terms of projecting it out, I think we need to project it out for our community so they can actually see it. What we're projecting in this is you're showing, you know, $4 million on both the transfer or the franchise tax and the gas tax for the next 10 years, which is $40 million. And then you're showing measure H funds as 10 million times 10 years, that's a hundred million. So you're showing $140 million of projects over 10 years. But in reality, measure H is probably more like $24 million a year. We're on track for that this year. It could be higher some years, could be lower some years. So it's actually 240 million. So I think what we're missing is that $100 million. If we just estimated it as at 20 million, or even if we said it was 17 or 16, I think we need to show our community that higher estimate and try to move some of these projects forward earlier. Plus we also have the, you know, we all know we approved the sewer aspect too, which also helps lend to complete streets and going all the way across the roadway to do repairs as we replace sewer pipe. So I think there's some things in here which are just missing in terms of long-term projection. I mean, certainly I'm not happy, like, looking at this and going, okay, we're only gonna do these roads when we pass this huge tax. We're gonna have $240 million. But we're not necessarily gonna do that. We're not necessarily showing $240 million worth. We're showing $140 million worth work over 10 years. So I'd like to see the numbers adjusted. I don't wanna slow this down though at all either. So I'm apt to approve it, but with maybe a amendment to bring it back at the higher number, because I'd really like to see what that higher number is gonna get us. I think our community would be a lot more satisfied with, you know what, we're gonna be able to move a lot of these projects forward. And we've had those talks. I've had those talks with the city manager. Is, look, a lot of these we wanna slate forward. And I think our community needs to show that, you know, right where we're gonna be a really good estimate because we passed this tax measure, you know, I was the one who agendized this thing, you know, we need to show them that belief in it. So that would be my thing. So at that point, I'd make a motion to approve with a caveat to come back, you know, and if you wanted to come back to us in March, that's fine with me. Showing the full, you know, maybe do it at $18 million on the Measure H funds. I'll second that. I'll make the comment that, yeah, I had no idea when we were going through with Measure H where the road funds would go. I also had no idea that the state of California was going to make it to where it was gonna cost $60 million to do the streets in the avenues. So I also live on a street that has really crappy roads and I'd love to have mine fixed too, and they're not fixed. So, yeah. No, I had no idea where the funds were gonna go and what they were gonna do when I supported Measure H. I wanted all the roads in Chico fixed for all the people as soon as we can possibly get it. But I've also sat up here for every single year and listened to the painstakingly long, horrible report that we have to listen to about how, what our PCI index is at 49 overall for the city and how if we don't take care of new roads that we've done, how much more it's gonna cost us later down the road. So as we make education, we're gonna have to make a lot of decisions. And so we have to make sure that we're not spending good money after bad. And that we're maintaining the investment that we put into our community. So I will second the motion to move this through, but I do like the recommendations. And let's hope we get the 20 million a year, but I think it's safer to plan and not, I also don't wanna over promise and be like, oh, we're gonna have all this done in five years. And then when we're sitting up here and something else changes with Measure H and it's 10 years and then people are pissed too. So I think it's, I think it's a good idea. We need to be realistic. Mr. Sorenson, can I ask, what are your thoughts on projecting that scale of the use of Measure H funds? Well, we've already allocated, by memory, four or five million towards public safety. So the whole 24 million is not available. Right. Secondly, as we've said, we only have one quarter of actual data. While it paints a pretty good picture, that's not enough to say that we're gonna have enough in my mind to be spending those dollars before we have them. And then comes the issue of sales tax volatility. When the economy goes south, sales taxes are very squirrely. So once again, if we're over allocating those funds, we'll be coming back to you trying to figure out how to cut it. So when Brendan and I had this conversation, it was, for today, let's start with 10 million, because it's a whole lot easier to add five, six, eight million and accelerate or add projects later on than it is to cut them. And another point, when I look at the projects in 2024, we're hoping to get at least one or two of these out to bid in the next few months, because, you know, we need to have them ready to go when the construction season hits. And once again, when you're coordinating with all these different utilities, we need a lot of lead time. So again, throwing the $10 million out, number out there, that was the best we could do with really a lack of information. So do you think March or by the next budget cycle, you'll have a better idea? Well, sure, incrementally. You know, three months from now, we'll have another quarter of data. Six months from now, we'll have three quarters of data. So if we brought it back in March, are you comfortable with maybe looking at adjusting? Oh, sure. And that was always our intent. Okay. But we have to start somewhere. Okay. You know, particularly for the long range efforts, particularly involving utility coordination. Sure. You know, PG&E, Cal Water, that can take two, three, four or five years in advance of a project. And again, looking at the avenues, there's a lot of stormwater. There's a lot of storm drain requirements that are gonna hit us hard there. And that's gonna take years of wrangling all by itself. Okay. But I mean, if we pass it and then brought it back in March, we could at least at that point. That was always the intent year by year. Okay. Yeah. I just wanna make sure it's there so we can reexamine. But we have to have a, we don't have to, but we thought it beneficial to have some sort of a roadmap to start us off. Okay. All right. As opposed to no roadmap. So we just. So the projects that are going out to bid this winter or intended to, those are already funded. So this doesn't really have any bearing on whether those projects move forward. And if we were to say, we wanna come back with more detail and analysis, we wouldn't be delaying any projects, correct? Well, Bruce Road, for example, that should be going out to bid by December. Yeah. Just as an example. Right. Ideally Rio Lindo would, just because you tend to get better pricing. But there again, coordination with utilities might delay that. Yeah. So I don't think that we're, we're not gonna postpone roadway improvements because we wanna look at this 10 year plan in more detail or with more analysis. So. I think you just said it would delay Bruce Road. Right. All right. So we have a motion and a second. Madam Clerk. Council Member Bennett. Yes. Council Member Morgan. No. Council Member Tandon. Yes.
