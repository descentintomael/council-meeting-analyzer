 All right, we ran over a little bit of time with the attorney, and we're going to take a few minutes, just a quick two, three minutes, and then while we get the attorney into this room on Zoom, we'll be back in. All right. All right. All right. All right. Ready? All right. Go ahead and call it to order. We're just trying to reverse the camera. Yeah, I was going to say, am I in the camera? I need a mirror. Just saying, it's a little backwards. So welcome, everybody. A special session of the Chico City Council on June 8th, and we will call the meeting to order. Please stand and join me in the Pledge of Allegiance. Thank you. One. I pledge allegiance to the people of America, to the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. All right, Madam Clerk, can you do the roll? Council Member Brown? Here. Council Member Denley? Here. Council Member Huber? Here. He is here. He's actually zooming in. Yeah, there you are. Council Member Morgan? Here. Council Member Tandon? Here. Vice Mayor Reynolds? Here. Mayor Coolidge? Present. And we'll have the City Attorney do the closed session announcement. All right, thank you very much. So public participation in this meeting is being conducted. In accordance with Executive Order N29-20, public participation and attendance at the meeting, masks are required. Citizens will be allowed to attend the meeting in person with attendance limited 50% capacity and designated seating with families allowed to sit together. Face masks are required in order to attend the meeting and address the council in the council chamber. For those wishing to not wear a mask, a podium will be set up in the lobby. Public participation prior to the meeting, the Engaged Chico Civic Act engagement program was available for citizen input on individual agenda items prior to the meeting, and that program can be accessed through the city's website. Remote public participation during the meeting. The public may view the meeting on Comcast Channel 11 or via streaming video found on the city's website. And we'll start with special agenda item number two. The public will have an opportunity to address the council on any item describing the agenda before or during consideration of that item. The city council is prohibited by law from considering any other business. At this meeting, item 2.1, and I believe we have met. Mr. Marcon. Sir, Honorable Mayor, members of the council, thank you very much and good late afternoon to all of you. Before you, you have the recommended preliminary allocations of the American Rescue Plan, or what I'll refer to as the ARP funding, for projects totaling $22 million. So, Mr. Orm, can I just stop you because we're going to do 2.1, and then we'll go to the... It's... It's... It's the cannabis tax grant relief. That's the consent agenda item that is... Oh, it's consent. Right. Yeah. So, it's on there first. So, I don't know if... Is the chief here to speak to that, or... Oh. So, she didn't indicate... It is a consent agenda item, so... Okay, it's not indicated that way on mine. Correct, I apologize. So, why don't we just take it as a regular agenda item, then? Yes. So, Mr. Matt... Chief Matt. Yeah. So, I'm going to have Captain Billy Aldridge come up and address this particular grant. Welcome, Captain Aldridge. Thank you. Honorable Mayor, Vice Mayor, and Council Members, I'm here to present with you an opportunity we've been afforded from the California Highway Patrol as it pertains to the education enforcement of the impacts related to impaired driving within our community. Thank you. Thank you. The California Highway Patrol law enforcement grants provide financial assistance to allied agencies for the education, prevention, and enforcement of laws related to driving under the influence of alcohol and other drugs, including cannabis. The intent of the program is to educate the public regarding the dangers of impaired driving, enforce impaired driving laws on the roadway, improve agencies' effectiveness through training and development of new strategies. Our total award from this grant was $318,000 and some change. The period for this grant will run fiscal year 21-22. Chico PD will use this funding to boost the city's ongoing commitment to keep our roadways safe and improve the quality of life through both enforcement and education, including standard field sobriety test and drug recognition expert training, DUI checkpoint planning and management training, public and school-based educational hands-on exhibits and presentations, public and community leadership outreach, outreach and education, enhanced DUI checkpoints, DUI saturation patrols. Chico PD will also use this funding to upgrade necessary equipment to accomplish the objectives of the grant to include purchasing a new DUI checkpoint trailer with all required equipment to include new alcohol screening devices, safety gear, and media campaign materials. Purchasing educational material for community presentations to include pamphlets on the effects of drugs and alcohol as well as the results of driving under the influence of alcohol. Purchasing goggles which provide a perspective of being intoxicated and having citizens perform field sobriety tests while wearing them, which should be fun. Key points to consider. There is no requirement for matching funds, just the desire for Chico PD to continue the efforts in the future. So we get to keep all associated equipment that we purchase from the grant, which is awesome. There is no requirement to request or add additional staffing after the grant. The grant will pay for all associated costs and there will be no cost to the city of Chico. So that is obviously a positive outcome of this grant. Lastly, I would like to thank the California Highway Patrol for awarding the city of Chico and the Chico Police Department this grant opportunity as it will help to make our roads safer for our citizens, help to train our police officers to better educate and enforce impaired driving, and accomplish this task with no impact upon our current budget. Thank you. Thank you for the opportunity to present this grant opportunity and I am now available to answer any questions or concerns you may have. All right. Questions? Okay. Seeing none, thank you, Captain. All right. And at this point, do we have any public comment on this item? We do not. Okay. No questions from the council. Entertain a motion. Move to approve. I have a motion and a second to approve a resolution of the City Council of the City of Chico to approve the receipt of cannabis tax, which is a tax grant. Thank you. Thank you. Well, since the screen is backwards, I figured I'd do the agenda backwards, so I apologize. I apologize for that. Wow. You know, you can obviously tell where my mind is at. Well, thank you very much. As I said earlier, we have before you the ARP funding in the amount of $22,118,301. Staff is seeking your approval of the framework and the allocation of these ARP funds. We already received back in May, just last month, half of the allotment in excess of $11 million, and we'll receive the secondary allotment next year in May, we anticipate. The ARP funds are to be fully expended by December 31st of 2026. The Treasury Department has put out interim regulations on how to utilize these dollars, and those categories are noted in the staff report for council. Staff focused on project assistance to support local business, around 20% of the funds, government services, around 30% of the funds, and on infrastructure, which equated to about 50% of the funds. Many of these recommendations cannot be implemented in the city. The city has not yet implemented any of these, and some further information will come back to council on the projects as they get legs under them. So by no means can all of these be implemented immediately. I want each department to speak to the request to give you a little bit better understanding of the direction that these are heading in and the importance of each of these items. I'm going to start it off, and I'll just speak from their locations there, with Director Brendan Veague, to share a little bit about the community development, technology improvements for development services and code enforcement. Brendan. All right. Thank you, Mark, and good afternoon, Mayor Kulit, council. The items are highlighted. I don't know if they have them in front of you, but it's some cloud-based access to some information that's being archived. There's a digital video plan checking hardware and software, and then also increasing some capacity related to our ability to do virtual meetings. And so I just wanted to highlight that, again, two of the items will help support ongoing, archiving efforts and expedite public access to cloud-based database- cloud-based database-containing property files, land-use entitlements, and code-enforcement information, which will reduce demands on staff, but also help address the growing demand on public-records requests. We also will allow the department to start moving forward-kind of wading in- not-jumping-in-on-electronics-submittal-of-building-plans- and then finally-enhanced-virtual-meeting-capabilities- which-I guess-I wanted to share-in-one-form-or-an-other---is-here-to-stay-. So I'm available to answer any questions. Those are the items that we have in front of you. All right, questions for Mr. V? Great. The next item I'm gonna have Chief Madden speak to, and that's the CAD system. You'll notice a trend of a lot of technology to create that ability for people to engage with the community more, to ensure that public safety have a great ability to engage at a higher level, and just so that people can remotely access information that they typically would otherwise have to come into City Hall for. So with that, Chief, please share about the CAD system. Yeah, thank you, Mark. Council, so CAD, computer aided dispatch, it is essentially the software that runs your entire police department to include most of fire operations as well as when it comes to dispatching. In addition, it also runs our records management system, our jail management system, essentially your entire police department. Unfortunately, the system that we have right now has been sold to a company. That company bought that software not to go forward, so it's unsupported, and they really bought it for a customer base to draw customers to their current product. As we move forward, what we realize is the majority of your law enforcement agencies in the county have gone to the same CAD system for interoperability. That system's by Sunridge, and it's called RIMS. And what we're seeing is that with speaking with the sheriff and having some conversations, the city has potentially the ability to join forces with the sheriff's office and go to this RIMS CAD platform. And what it would do is it would be the same for almost every department in the county, excluding a couple of the state agencies highway patrol. But that would include the sheriff's office, Chico, Paradise, Gridley, Oroville, and Chico State being on the same system. If we go to what's called a super agency, which we're in conversations with with the sheriff's office, what it'd also do is provide redundant systems throughout the county. So if the sheriff's department had a major malfunction or let's talk about the Oroville Dam incident, they simply could come to the police department and all their data would be there stored on our server. The other thing it's going to do is it's going to, make every dispatch center in the county the exact same. So you're essentially going to gain six dispatch centers throughout the county where every dispatcher in the county has the same radio system and operating system, and they'll be completely interchangeable. So if we had something happen in the city of Chico, our dispatchers could go to the sheriff's office, sit down, log in, and it would be the exact same system as what they're working on right now. So this is an incredible opportunity to get to full interoperability. You know, most agencies have upgraded to that 911 Viper system, so their radio consoles, everything is exactly the same. And to look forward to creating an automated dispatch center with the rest of the county. The information sharing, the efficiencies, the ability to provide accurate, descriptive information at record speed back to citizens and whatnot because we're all on the same system. We have that access. If dispatch had something going on and we needed to check history from somebody from Oroville, we simply could do it. Right now we have to pick up the phone and call the other dispatch center. So it's an incredible opportunity, and the timing is really right for this one-time funding to look at our CAD system and get with that technology. Great. With that, we'll move on to the fire department. Station improvements. Any improvements in funding for station design? Chief Standridge. Mayor, Vice Mayor, Councilmembers, thank you. We have two line items. One would be for station improvement of $380,000. And in addition to that is fire station design for a new Station 6, which is desperately needed at the north end of the city. Unfortunately, there wasn't enough funding from the CARES Act to fund a new station. So that will at least get us started to plan for another station. Thank you. Okay. Public Works Engineering on the sewer, the BMX site, and the downtown sidewalk expansion. Deputy Director Gianco. Thank you, Mark. Good afternoon, everybody. I get to highlight three of our infrastructure projects for the ARP funding. The first one is going to be our sewer expansion project. This is an element of our sewer master plan that brings a trunk line to provide sewer access. It's currently in design. This funding, our proposed funding, would provide construction funding to advance this project. The second project I'd like to talk about or give you a brief update about is the BMX relocation. This is a project that can currently use the funding right away. We are currently in construction, currently undergrounding sewer and water lines. This proposed funding would assist with pavement, landscaping, and other construction projects. This is the project that is in the planning and electrical elements for the project site. Third project is the downtown sidewalk project. This is another exciting project where we can help encourage outdoor dining and retail. It's currently identified in the downtown access plan. This funding would help us advance the project from concept to preliminary engineering. I'm available for any other questions. Go ahead. The sewer expansion in southeast Chico, what area does that cover? It will come from the west side crossover 99 and eventually go up to Potter. And so it opens up a lot of opportunities for southeast Chico. Again, it's a major trunk line called our P18. It's connecting to our last element. Thank you. Thank you. Any other questions? I had a question. I have a question. Go ahead. So you stated the BMX line item is your guys' item. Yes, ma'am. Can you explain what the nexus to homelessness part of that line item entails? Sure. I can help with that one if you get lost. Yeah, definitely. Well, I mean, my part is primarily the engineering aspect. And so the aspect I'm looking for in providing is the youth activities. But, as far as the homelessness, I think Mark would better be able to better explain that. Yeah. So as staff went through and we are looking at the breadth of funding utilization, staff had to go through and they basically strained out every aspect of what funding can be used for. And so as a matter of transparency to the public, council said in years past, you know, let's evaluate this site potentially for a large project. That never came to fruition. However, it's still a project that we're working on. It's still an option for council if they decide at some point in time to make it an option for potential locations. We're struggling finding areas. And so it was just noted in that facet. It by no means means that it's moving forward as a site for homelessness, but it was just noted for that simple fact of transparency. I just have concern that that is on this item with that description. We voted on April 26th not to pursue that anymore. And now in, in some matter, whether how small or big, when this was written, staff was discussing that for it to have been typed there. So, first of all, I don't know if that's even legitimate to be there. And second of all, in honor of transparency with the community, if we really aren't intending on moving forward, that should be deleted. It should not be there. If it's, if we're going to have the economic development person speak to it, when really it's a homelessness issue, I think that in itself is a huge transparency issue that he had to bring that up. I don't, I don't understand. Yeah. Then it's council's option to just have that struck from this list. It's fine with me. It's ultimately council's direction as it relates to utilization of funding. And if you don't want it directly related or even a nexus to homelessness, then by all means, delete it. We're happy to amend that aspect to just delete that line. Yeah. I guess I'd like to hear the city attorney weigh in. Cause I mean, if, if at the end of this discussion, if this was moved forward with this packet, cause I don't know whether or not that'll be deleted or not. If it was, if it was approved tonight and that was still there, is that a legal issue? Because we already have a vote on a previous meeting not to do something with it. So I don't know if the city attorney is still around, but I'd like to hear that. So Mr. Orm, if I may, Vince, you might want to hear my question. Then you can chime in on everything. So this isn't for the existing site. This is for the new site. Correct. So I'm just trying to make sure. That the community has a clear understanding that this is not money to be spent on the existing BMX site to change it. This is on the one out by Westside Little League where they've spent already. I think we've had almost up to words of a million dollars donated to create a state of the art BMX track. And this is to run my time. So this is to run the sewer and water and things along those lines out to that particular site. Absolutely. So this funding is directly for you. Yeah. I understand the, you know, the nexus to economic development through this. The homeless aspect, I think, has something that we should maybe consider a strike. But yeah. Yeah. I mean, that in itself is concerning because if this line item is really for the BMX site at the new moving location and doing stuff to that. So then I'm thinking, okay, again, homelessness is there. So are we talking about homelessness nexus at the new one? I mean, that, that it's just, that's a mess. I don't understand how this ended up here. And I'd still like to hear the city attorney clarify my question. So Mr. Ewing, could you have a opinion on that? Sure. To make sure I understand, I'll try to clarify, but I think I heard from the council member, didn't I? So the concern is that there's an item for you that identifies a location that the council previously, voted not to consider and so forth. And then that would be a concern. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks. The second item is small business support. This is for $1 million. Our local businesses have been really fortunate that there's been a variety of different states, federal, and local sources that have been out there to help them. But the reality is that we still have a lot of businesses that have gaps. We have a lot of businesses that haven't been able to access these funds for a variety of different reasons. And so the goal is to help provide funds, provide support, for these gaps that are existing. Now, I started by saying there's a lot of different programs that are out there. So the county of Butte has hired three corps to do a gap analysis to really look at what the funding sources are currently, talk to businesses about what they're seeing in terms of the gaps, talk to business assistance providers about those gaps, and also talk to banks about what their clients are seeing as those gaps. And then put together a recommended program. So that recommendation would come to the city, and we would look at that to see if this is something that would make sense for our businesses here locally. And then we would work with the council to decide whether or not it makes appropriate sense to go forward with this regional project or to do something on our own. Is three corps currently working on that? Did you say? They are currently working on that. And what's the approximate turnaround time for having information back from them? They should be almost done. I want to say, Council Member Reynolds, that we have a meeting coming up in the next week or so about this. So it is something that is, it is definitely already in the works. Yes. Thank you. The next item is downtown parklet development for 300,000. So as you know, with the pandemic and we had to shut down our businesses, the council and staff worked very quickly to make sure that we have the opportunity in our downtown area to accommodate customers outside. And this was through a temporary ordinance, and we have temporary parklets, and whereby it's great and you see the action. You see the activity that's happening downtown and you see the excitement and the vitality. They lead a little bit to be desired in terms of the look and the feel. So what this item would do, it would be taking that concept, and again, because what you see right now is temporary, based on a temporary ordinance, this would be the opportunity to put some money into a design that would actually add a nice aesthetic feel to the downtown area, and then actually construct parklets in a more cohesive manner. The idea would be to provide up to eight parklets in the downtown area. So that would include both the design and the construction. The next item is also downtown related. This would be downtown building enhancement for 200,000. Downtown, as you know, is one of our jewels. And right now we have a number of businesses that have done an excellent job of fixing themselves up. We've seen investment in terms of Stovall Coffee and others, but we still do have a lot of businesses that could use a little bit of a facelift, whether that's the replacement of an awning, whether that's a paint job, whether that is new windows, new signage. And this is not funds for a full facade improvement program, because this isn't anywhere near enough funds to do that. But this would be an opportunity to provide grants to businesses or landlords in the downtown area that have been impacted by COVID to really fix up and clean up their businesses. The next item is Transitional Employment Pilot Program for 500,000. And this program provides an opportunity to develop a pilot program for the employment of homeless individuals. There's a variety of barriers for homeless individuals to enter into the workforce. And so what we tried to do is take a look at how can we address those barriers and create a program that could get people to work that are eligible and don't have as many barriers to enter the workplace, and then really provide them a path to employment in the future as well. So the short-term goal of this program would be to place 15 homeless individuals currently staying in local shelters in transitional employment positions with local employers for a period of six months. There's several steps that would be part of this. It would include develop and implement an intake process, where an individual would be able to assess in terms of what the opportunities and what the barriers are to employment. We'd provide three 90-minute basic employment skills workshops. This would be an opportunity to provide some employability skills and really also some workforce training or vocational training. It's also an opportunity to make sure that people are interested in working. If you show up to these workshops, you're showing commitment to the process. And this is something that we feel would be valuable. And then certainly providing supportive services as necessary, such as bus tickets, work boots, clothing. You certainly need help and assistance in obtaining an ID, a mailing address, and other items that are responsible that were necessary, I should say, for an I-9 documentation. And then we'd connect these individuals with local employers, most likely in the fields of yard maintenance or food preparation or janitorial services. And then they would be hired. However, they would not be hired by a local employer because what we're hearing is local employers have a difficult time with the workers' comp and the liability associated with this. This would be through a staffing agency that would take care of the workers' comp, the liability, and whatnot. And it eases up those restraints on those businesses that might be interested in hiring a homeless individual. And then the idea is that we'd send 30 people through this program, but ultimately 15 are able to be employed for a period of six months. And at the end of the six months, the great thing about this is they have the I-9 documentation. They have some basic employability skills. They've got a resume that's helped put together. They have some work experience. And if the employer that they're working with wants to hire them on at this point as an employee of their own, Alliance for Workforce Development could work with them and put them through an on-the-job training program, which would provide the cost of the employee for up to six months, up to 50% of that cost. So there's a benefit here to the individual as well as to the local employer. Okay. It's hard to talk with these masks. I actually have a question about that. Yes, go ahead. Is that a city-run program? I'm sorry? Is that a proposed city-run program? So it would have to be something that we do in cooperation with local agencies. So we've talked with the Alliance for Workforce Development. I've run the concept past the Jesus Center. I've run the concept past the Chamber of Commerce. It's really going to have to be a partnership. If there were one silver bullet in person or organization that could run this program, they'd already be doing it. This is going to take some collaboration between partners. So the city can help pull this partnership together, but we would not be the individuals that were running this. There would be a contract with someone that would be the lead that would then be working with this web. And I realize there's expenses there too, but $500,000 to give work training for a short period of time to 30 individuals? There is a lot of cost related to this program. The concept of a pilot program, though, is that there's always going to be a greater cost the first time you do it, because you'll be putting together, really, the structure, the partners. You'll understand better what's working and what's not working. And you have to look at what's the benefit at the end, certainly. And hopefully the end is that we can create a pathway to employment for individuals that wasn't there previously. If I were to guess, Mayor Coolidge, if this type of a program were to go on in the future, that cost could potentially be half of that. I don't know for certain. I understand that that is part of the biggest portion of that cost is the cost to have the staffing agency, whether it be the California Community College Foundation or Express Personnel or anything else that would be the other staffing agencies, take on that workman's comp, the liability and the payroll services. Thanks. Any other questions? And then finally, the last one's simple. This is economic stimulus promotion program for $100,000. This is to promote local. This is to make sure that the City of Chico is promoting our local events, that we are getting the word out about these events, that we have promotional material available for these events. This type of activity helps our local businesses, our restaurants, our retailers, and like I said earlier, hopefully it'll bring an entrepreneur or two into our area that looks at Chico then as an opportunity to start a business. So those are the basics that we talked about. And again, we've been looking at where the gaps are and also where can we put one-time monies to make long-term impacts. So I'm happy to answer any questions. Okay. I think we all have some questions on the last one there, the homeless resting, sorry, and part rehabilitation program. So I don't know who wants to field that. Mr. Orme. Sure. Still had a couple of other. I was going to do that one last if that's okay. Okay, great. Our next one is HR. So Director Cannon, Workforce Technology Improvements. Good evening. My little sliver of the pie is to fully round out the NEOGov Suite. This is a government software system that most local governments use within the state of California. Currently we use NEOGov for recruitment and for employee performance evaluations. Both systems are paperless. The two new add-ons would be what they call onboarding and e-forms, which will just be one step closer for HR as we're in this new world with remote employees, local employees, to try to figure out how we can best meet their needs and get folks hired and processed as quickly as possible. So this will round us out, make us more efficient, and just be a really great suite for us towards our goal of being fully paperless. Thank you. Remote access. All right. And then I'm going to shift it over to City Clerk Cresson with regard to agenda management. Thank you. City Manager Orman, Council. So what you have before you is a proposed use of some funds for, it says agenda management, but it's actually two components. Both of these programs are integrated, fully integrated into our Granicus program. And the peak agenda management group, or that's the group, is a solution, is a paperless agenda process. And so one thing that the pandemic really reinforced with all of us is the need to look for innovative ways to be able to still continue to work in a crisis and to still be able to provide a high level of participation by our staff and the citizens. And so when looking at this program, it would be an automated agenda process. So staff, if they had to work remotely, if they couldn't get in, they would still be able to do everything electronically. It would have an automated approval process. And so the city attorney would have to be, it goes in stages. And so if the city attorney needs to review and approve to form some item, they know exactly when that has to go and it's all electronic. Then it's completely paperless. So right now, while the council has gone paperless, the department of public health and the department heads still bring and send up their staff reports all in paper. We review all of those documents. Every document comes through my office. So this would absolutely automate that and take the people part out of it in terms of having to find that report or anything like that. It also tracks the agenda process and calendars upcoming items. And so those tools would be available to the council. The other component that I'm looking at, still part of the Granicus program, is the board and commission solutions. And that one really is a program that I think would be great for our boards and commissions. It's a single automated tool that allows the application process to be paperless during COVID. When we were doing the biennial recruitment in 2020, citizens had to try to stick their applications through the door so that they didn't get near anybody. And so there is a true need to provide a new way to participate electronically. It also does attendance tracking. It also does onboarding of the new appointed commissioners as well as any potential trainings. It also provides a huge database for all commissions. So if I need to let them know that a new law has been updated and this is what this means, I can send it out through this program and it gets it to every single commission. And I can send it out to every single commissioner at the same time. So if you have any questions, I'm happy to answer those. Great. The next item is Administrative Services Director Dowell. And that's with regard to broadband and some IT related items. Yes, thank you. I am excited about broadband opportunities. You may remember my presentation at the budget meeting. This is kind of getting some legs to getting us a starting point. We estimate if we decide to go through a full utility for broadband, that that would be a 70 to 80 or 90 million dollar project. This would be approximately 5% of that. Just to recall that we're going through a broadband plan that we will be bringing back to council probably in the fall and outline the specific uses of these funds. If we don't decide to go for a full utility, there's still, we're working with the different providers, that these funds would go to help set us up for business, education purposes, and improve the quality, the speed, and the price for internet here in the city of Chico. So it's an exciting opportunity for us. The other two items here, IT projects, I've got a list here of about 15 projects that we can fund that will help out. For instance, dealing with conference room upgrades, getting them with webcams, TV cameras, and teleconferencing. Getting the capability to kind of follow along with going wireless, being able to sign and provide documents throughout the city on a wireless platform that's through like an Adobe or a DocuSign, something like that. And doing security issues, ransomware and these kind of things are a very strong threat that we take seriously, and so those areas would help us, that funding would help us in that area. And then last but not least, it would be a great opportunity is this is actually a good thing. Our investments have grown to a point where we are, some of you may recall as we talked through the budget process that eight years ago we were down to $5 million. Well, it looks like here in July we're going to probably have, or I should say June, the end of the month, probably $150 million that we're accounting for. Those accounting transactions are something that we have to keep track of for transparency and everything. And so we need another module to take care of that for our accounting department, and that's what the $15,000 is. So if you have any questions for me, I'm happy to answer those. All right, you almost made it sound like we have $150 million. Unfortunately, we don't. Go ahead, Ms. Roehm. I had a question about that actually. Sorry. I was just hoping to get a little more explanation just because we have a lot of money, and we did hear your excitement about the broadband, but we didn't hear anything about looking at other communities to do it and hearing what their repair costs are, what they're averaging for running it. We just haven't heard any of that yet or any of the liabilities. So I was a little startled to see even the $2.2 million coming out of this first allocation. So I was just hoping you could help me understand your urgency behind getting this even on the first allocation without us having any of that information yet. Sure. And the challenge with this, the way it's set up is, we're coming really rather early to you on these American Rescue Dollars because we don't even have all the interim guidelines there, but there's some immediate needs, and that's why they're being brought to you right now. These can change, obviously, and so we're asking for a preliminary. As part of the broadband plan, what we're doing, in fact, we're meeting... I am so excited how this is progressing, and we even have... Council Member Tannen has attended some of these meetings as well. So what we're walking through is we will have a plan where it looks through, here's what's worked in other agencies and groups, here's what's looked at in ours, and we're going to look and see what would be the best fit for us. We're going to... As I mentioned before, we're kind of behind the curve, but we're trying to get ahead of the curve. So yeah, you're right. It's a big ask, but I could tell you we could use the funds to provide... Right off the bat, if we went down that route, and I'm not saying we're... I'm not even proposing this, but there's options. We could use that money to create reliable internet out to the airport, which provides businesses and everything like that. That's one option that we're looking at. So I could tell you that we could use that money immediately to do that. Again, that's one source of it. But you're right. I don't have a full plan that I could come and say, let's sign off on here. I wish I did, but we will have that in the fall. So I agree with you with your... your concerns on that. But we will come back with a full allocation. What should be noted about, what's very interesting too, is this funding, specifically broadband, is a high priority item for the federal government, that it has its own category. That's whole section D is there for broadband. So with this seed money, what it also does is it opens the doors for us to go after other grants and provide some matching funds, which we're also looking at. So it really does open some, I think, some larger doors for us going down in the future. When you think of what we could do for... We have a... We're blessed to have a Chico State here and students that need reliable broadband. If we can get... If we could go at 10 times the speed of where we're at now, can you think about... Can you think of the impact generations this could have? And so that's why we're asking for that seed money today. You can tell I'm passionate. I could talk to you. I could talk with you all day about this, but I will spare you on that. But yeah, you're right. Good question. And we... I don't have all the answers at this point. So one short follow-up. Thank you. And I do appreciate your enthusiasm. I mean, I love to see that, you know, you have a passion project and it could be great. I'm just curious just more as I kind of keep mulling all of this over. Is there anything you see in trying to keep looking into the program? Is there anything that would be hindered if maybe there was nothing in the first allocation but possibly some in the second, not saying anything's there yet, but I'm just curious if that would affect anything in what you guys are doing for research, grants, that stuff? So this is a year allocation. What it does is if we came back in July, or I'm sorry, let's say we come back in the fall and you decide and say, hey, we want to go forward and do this, it would be a delay. So if we don't have the money, it delays going forward. So that's why we're looking and going, hey, if we had that seed money to begin with, but you're right, if we wait, hey, I hope it would be $5 million, but if you waited a year, it just means everything's delayed a year. So it's just a delay, not a cease and desist, but just a delay. Okay, thank you. All right, any other questions? Mr. Dell? No, not from Mr. Allen. All right, Mr. Allen. All right, and the last item on there is the Homeless Resting Site and Park Rehabilitation Program to the tune of $1,050,000. And really all this is, is we've seen the impacts COVID had on not only the city as it relates to the parks and public spaces, but also in an attempt to be able to manage through some legal concerns that we have. These resources will be readily available should and when we proceed pursuant to any legal concerns that we remedy. In addition to that, it's vitally important that we rehabilitate the park space. And I am excited, and I know Mr. Gustafson is excited to be able to get in there. We see a tremendous amount of damage that's occurred, particularly with some of the landscaping infrastructure that needs to be repaired. And at this time, we're still working towards those ends. So I know there's going to be other things that arise during that time. So that's what this funding would be designated for. And so right now, there's no plan that I can put in front of you. Like I said, this is a framework. And so this allows us to know if this is an avenue that council desires us to set money aside for as we engage further on these items. All right. I'm sure there's some questions on this. None this way? No? None? Councilmember Denley. So I have two questions on it. I have more, but I'm just limiting it to two right now. Sure. So it kind of has a lumped resting site and park rehab. I'm curious if we can delineate. They're two very different things in my opinion. What are you, I know there's nothing exact, but I mean, are we talking 50-50? Are we talking 80-20? What are you looking at for those? They're two different things. Unfortunately, I don't know. That's the problem. So I wanted to get enough in there to be able to come back to council and say, okay, we're going to need this amount for this. Until we're able to get into some of these locations where folks are currently staying, we don't know the costs associated with that. with the repair to the damaged infrastructure. So it's really hard to say. This is one of those framework items where this is kind of a path that we want to see if council is okay with allocating these funding. I can't tell you right now, similar to the small business stuff and similar to a number of the other items that you heard, the larger dollar amounts, we know it's going to probably be in a ballpark somewhere, but I can't even ballpark this one. I don't know what the costs are going to be, unfortunately, but this authorizes funding to be available when whatever legal course takes place that we can engage on these issues. Okay. And then my one other thing is, in doing my reading on the eight-page Department of Treasury guidelines, little fact sheet they made for these funds, I noticed what isn't in the staff report but is in their document is the ineligible uses of the funds. And I saw that, which was important to me to note, that settlements are listed as an ineligible use of these ARP funds. So if, theoretically, part of it was used for a resting site as part of what's coming up legal, I'm a little bit concerned because if we see a resting site and these funds going towards that as a settlement chip, if we did, that's an ineligible use according to what I read in the eight-page guidance. So that concerns me and is part of why I also would like to see, even if they're ballparks, separating the two. Okay. Yeah, that's, and that's if the council desires for us to come back later with them separated, I'd be happy to do that. But that's where the last paragraph in my presentation speaks to that actually. These are interim regulations and they haven't given us the final regs. We've seen them change time and time again, various interpretations. So candidly, on a lot of these things, I'll help out, I'll just read what I wrote. City staffs reviewed the federal interim regulations that prepared the preliminary allocations to projects based upon those regulations as people have been advising us on them. These regulations are interim and subject to change. Should there be any modifications made to the regulations that voids any of these recommended projects, staff will return to council to request such modifications. Staff would like to allocate the first half of the funding immediately to expedite time-sensitive projects, realizing that most of those are related to technologies to enhance remote access capabilities. So with that, I was going to ask for any direction from council and or to approve these allocations. All right. I believe we have another question. Okay. So I didn't get every question in as we were going down the thing, but I just wanted to, as we were going through each item, but I wanted to list off a couple things, you know, like from Mr. Vig. Like I'm assuming that if we get this new software, that plan check software, that once we have that online, like that's going to make things faster and better and easier for you to go. That wasn't stated, but I would think when builders submit stuff and it's online and... Correct. And a lot less paper. A lot less. I mean, the reason I want to start and transition is you don't just unleash something without kind of working with the local development community, making sure that they're ready to make that transition. But so this is kind of wading into those waters. Okay, perfect. Thank you. And then Mr. Madden, I wanted to... Chief Madden, sorry. I wanted to... I think I heard you say that the company that bought the current system we're on now, what we have is obsolete. So we're going to have to make a change at some point anyway. So it's probably best to do what everybody else in the area is doing. Yes, that's correct. And if I can add something, you know, just understanding that because the communication dispatch for fire, there's still a lot of work to do with this process because we have two different functions that it has to serve. So there's probably some additional things we're going to have to do. But this really gets the project at least up and running and gets us to start having the conversations with the surrounding agencies moving the project forward. Great, thank you. Thank you. And then back to parklets. That's a huge topic. There's developers and builders and people that have put millions and millions of dollars into their buildings and spent a lot of money on parklets. So then to go in with $300,000 worth of parklets, which I agree needs to be done, and I would love for that all to look much better than it does now. I guess part of my question is, you know, who are the eight people and how... And one thing I wanted to get on record is make sure this is a time-sensitive... These aren't parklets that are going to be there forever for these people that have spent a lot of money remodeling the whole face of their buildings. That is correct. I'll take that in a couple of different components. First of all, I want to make sure we're clear on... A parklet is a little bit different in that we have the business and then you have the sidewalk and then you have the seating area that's actually in the public right-of-way. So this is not a continuation of the building. It is the building, the sidewalk, and then the eating area. So I wanted to make sure that that was clear, first of all. Right now, currently, there are six different downtown businesses that have temporary parklets. When the temporary ordinance goes away, that will need to be addressed. What's to happen to this outdoor seating? What's to happen to these businesses? What's to happen to this increased revenue? These are decisions that are going to need to be made. So by looking at providing funding for eight, it could take care of the six currently that are in temporary state. And then we are also aware of a couple of other additional businesses that have been looking into it. So that would allow for two additional. So I hope that answered your question. Yes, thank you. Thank you. And then probably Mr. Ewing, I'm guessing I would need to recuse myself from that part, at least with having a business in downtown, but we can address that when it comes to that. I don't have time for the vote, but I just thought I'd throw that out there. And then I think I definitely want to hear from the public, but I just need to put it out there out front that putting this all together and making this decision right here right now when we're just getting this information is just really, really, really super uncomfortable. So I don't know if this is, if you're wanting a, yes, this is a general area we want to go, but each of these are going to come back to us to be voted on at a later time. So I'd like just some clarification on that. And then turn it over to the public, and I'm sure there'll be more questions after that. Okay, I can answer that one. So absolutely, it is, it's one of those things that I contemplated just bringing back a couple pieces and just saying, hey, council, you know what? These are immediate needs. Let's get these approved. However, then I realized you would never get the big picture. And so I thought it was prudent that staff, after they had given all of these wonderful ideas and thoughts, that we just put together a comprehensive plan so you can look at it. And if you don't want to make determinations or decisions tonight, that's up to council. However, this is a roadmap that I think, and what I termed a framework, of where I want to see if the council's willing to buy into these aspects. Because when I tell the chief, okay, start having those meetings on getting this conversion going for interoperability to ensure that public safety services throughout the county can engage at a higher level if we have another COVID situation or something like that, he's going to get going on that. If we don't get that green light, he's going to delay. And it just causes delay. And that's all it is. Like Mr. Dahl, that Director Dahl had mentioned, all it does is cause a delay in getting some of these things going. However, if council was like, you know what? These look like the right places that we need to head in these. We need to give the flexibility of staff to know these are a good path to go towards. Obviously, I told you, we're going to come back on a number of these items for more clarity so that council understands the design of how we're going to implement the program. So that's a tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip so that we can proceed in order for staff to move forward on these initiatives. Because we've developed the nexus between the funding. We've sat through a number of sessions regarding this funding, and every city is going through this right now. So it was my responsibility and obligation to give you a comprehensive picture and not just a, hey, here's a piecemeal. That's the reason why that occurred. And I do appreciate that part. It is great to be able to see and see the directions that we're going. And I appreciate the report. Thank you. You bet. All right. Council Member Tandon. I just have this question. It says widen the downtown sidewalks to allow for more outdoor dining and outdoor retail spaces. Is that going to affect the parking downtown? That's what we will be looking at. So in widening the sidewalk, it also requires us to address the street and the widths. And so we have to look at that concept a little further, and that's what that funding would help us do is to take the concept and then we can look at the concept and then we can look at the concept that was identified in the downtown access plan and look at it from an engineering perspective. But that could be some things that's still too preliminary, and that's the reason why we've requested that allocation or proposed the allocation for the second half. And that would be an item that would be brought back to the council. Thank you. All right. I had a question on yours. Sorry. Please, no. Go for it. I'm laughed sometimes. Okay. All right. All right. All right. In terms of, let me find the item. Okay. So the resting, sorry, park rehabilitation, I agree with Council Member Denley that those should be delineated. You know, I certainly would see us and understand that we need to, particularly because of COVID, need to increase and return our parks to their previous condition. And obviously some of the issues that have surrounded Comanche Creek and other sites too. But I'd really love to see those separate. I feel pretty uncomfortable just giving a blanket for, you know, is it $900,000 to the parks or is it $20,000? So I just think that needs to be specified. In terms of a general direction, you know, some of these are, I think moving forward on them quicker certainly makes a lot of sense. The SST, for example, you know, I'd rather start saving money sooner rather than later. So I do see some of these as, as urgent or at least having some cost savings as we move forward. But I think maybe we can pull a few of these things out. But I think at that we should hear from our public. I actually have a couple more questions and I want to hear from the public too. I just think that my questions would probably be things that the public will possibly want to address. So that's the only reason I do want to hear from you guys. So these are just general questions. They didn't really tie into any of the specifics. So I saved them for now. Like I mentioned, I read the guidance. And there were a lot of things, I saw in the guidance that I'm not seeing in the staff report. And I'm just want to run through them and then figure out why I don't see any projects for those or not even have it listed. So the first couple looking at what we have listed as category a, I noticed that the, there was like a behavioral health word in there, but I didn't see any projects at all dedicated for those funds. And when I read the guidance, it said that we could use funds for provision of, behavioral services exacerbated by the pandemic, including crisis intervention, mental health treatment and or substance abuse treatment and hotlines or warm lines. And then also in category a, what we called it in the guidance. I also saw in that category that there was a possibility to use funds to support for COVID prevention, mitigation or other services in schools, capital investments in public facilities, such as schools and ventilation improvements. And so first, I'm curious why there aren't any projects for those. Did we hit dead ends? Did we not think about it? Yeah. Yeah. So particularly on those, I would say, um, because category we did define it in the, in the report, there are so many avenues you could take. And if we want to help support behavioral health in some way, a county department, we're happy to try to find ways of allowing our local funds to get to the county. I know they already have their own funds. They have more than us, um, as it relates to the schools. Likewise, they're getting their own allotment of funds through a lot of varying means to for COVID impacts. So, so we really tried to focus on city specific. Uh, so that's the reason why those weren't in there. Okay. Um, and then the next, I only have two, two more, two more. Um, so we had four categories listed a through D and I noticed in the guidance, there was actually a fifth category, which you kind of maybe hit to why it's not in there. I just would have liked to see it still listed. So the community knew, and we knew that there was an option. There's a fifth category listed in the may 10th guidance from the treasury that says funds may be used to address educational disparities, um, through newer expanded learning services, the provision of additional resources to high poverty schools, the support of newer existing tutoring or afterschool programs, or the addition of new services to address social, emotional, and mental health needs of students. I mean, I know that the school district obviously has their own help, but they, those are our kids. So I would have liked to at least seen it listed as a fifth category. It wasn't even on the report. Yeah. You know, like I said before, we tried not to mix apples with oranges. And even though there's a need, uh, we felt that the city priority needs, uh, we wanted to put first, um, children are obviously always a, uh, important aspect of, of need, uh, to, to meet the needs of. And, um, you know, we have a great relationship with the school district and nobody from the school district reach out saying, Hey, can we access some of your funding? If they would have, I would have brought that forward to saying, Hey, you know what? They're, they're looking for additional funds. They don't have enough. So would the council be willing to get a little bit more? Uh, we didn't, we didn't have, uh, that conversation with them. So I wanted to stay focused. On city. Great point. Uh, happy to put the regs attached to this, uh, the next time. And that way, uh, those questions are more easily and readily seen. Yeah. I mean, it'd be, it'd be interesting. Maybe if we'd put it in there, it would have maybe popped up with somebody who's tied to the district, even if they would have seen it. Um, and I would be liking to look, reach out to them and see. So my last one that I saw mentioned in the staff report, but then there was no like followup money towards it. But I was curious about was, um, the premium pay that was listed. I don't remember what category it was in, but the premium pay, pay for essential workers who were physically at work during the pandemic and fields such as public safety, like our officers or fire personnel, um, and many others. And the pay could go retro back to January 27th of 2020. And I'm curious why there's no monies grabbed for that. I mean, they've put their lives on the line to serve us in that time when it was really scary there. And I don't know why that's not no money at all. Yeah. Uh, we put category B in there, uh, to highlight the fact, that it was a availability. We decided not to put any funding towards that, um, because virtually all of our employees will, we're continuing to work, uh, through the pandemic. Um, and very, very small number weren't. And so to, um, go to the public and come to a forum such as this and say, Hey, we want to give our employees more money because they worked hard. Uh, our staff was proud to serve and work, uh, because they know that they have very, very, uh, uh, wages and benefits. And, uh, so we thought that would be a little bit in the slap in the face to some of these other things where there's a vital need. And so, um, it was conscientious to list that category, but not fund any of it. Okay. Right. So just to wrap that up, the guidelines are, are not specific to just cities and towns and schools. They're all encompassing. So they're given that everybody, a lot of agencies. Okay. Yeah. Cause my understanding is that, um, that the school aspects of course would be considered by the school, but then the city aspects by the cities or the counties, whereas they wouldn't necessarily cross consider. And I'm not keeping track of all the other funding mechanisms, but I do know that cities are alive in a specific amount and they have options for those cities that engage at a higher level. Maybe they deal with behavioral. I don't know. Maybe there are some cities, maybe San Francisco that does behavioral health type stuff. Sure. Yeah. So they give you options to do it in San Francisco. Yeah. Cause they're serving in the county together. Um, maybe Mr. Dow knows this. Are you sure? Do we know how much the county received as well as the school district? No offhand. No. Yeah. Offhand. I don't know. I know the county got more than we did though. Yes. I think it was in the 40 million range somewhere in there. Yeah. So 40 something. All right. So go ahead. You know, for county plan given us. Yeah. So, so there was some, some discussion that we've had, I know the mayor has engaged on that issue as well, along with some others of you. And I think that there potentially will be some discussion, um, of that, um, particularly related to regional issues, um, surrounding possibly homelessness, things of that nature. But, uh, no, I, I have no final commitment of those funds, but there is a caveat to say that the conversations are continuing. All right. No more questions. All right. Madam clerk, how many speakers? We have 17. All right. I'll do two minutes piece. Two minutes. Okay. So our first speaker is William Brady, followed by Tom DiGiovanni. Good evening. I'm, uh, here to speak in favor of, uh, everything in the economic development department here for downtown, uh, COVID has disproportionately affected downtown. It's kind of the nexus of, uh, community and due to its, uh, I mean, there's a per capita, far more restaurants downtown. So we were all closed. Um, I think there's a holistic approach we need to take towards parklets, um, parking spaces, um, trash cans, maybe getting rid of the trash cans, that open and close. We can create, um, a less abrasive looking situation downtown, uh, next to a parklet. Uh, if we spend all this money beautifying the town, I would like to maybe have some approaches towards the homeless that could be kinder than letting them root through the garbage. Maybe having shelves for unused food or whatever people want to donate, but having more hardened trash cans. That's been something I've been talking about for six or seven years. It's very hard to get funding though. I realized, and I think we could, uh, kind of work that into this. I would imagine, uh, I would also state, you know, parking is not as important as businesses downtown. I think we learned that through COVID, uh, there was parking everywhere, but no businesses and, uh, revenue generated from parking, uh, pales in comparison to what you'll generate through a sales tax. So let's try to have that forward looking, uh, pro business. I think, uh, an approach that would benefit us all would be to, uh, take this and if there's anything you cut out of it, refocus it on economic development. Uh, if there is anything like more for that, please, if at all possible. Widening the sidewalks is also part of that. All of our sidewalks are pretty trashed up pretty bad. There's a lot of trees have grown in and everything you can give us would benefit us. So appreciate your time. Okay. Thank you. do you have Dia Giovanni followed by Katie Toma? Thank you, Mayor, Council members, um, as the, as the president of the DCBA, I wanted broadly speaking, uh, support this. It's a significant, it ends up being a significant, uh, uh, lift for, for downtown. Um, and in, uh, one of the things I wanted to, uh, mention though is somewhere along the way in this, in, in the, uh, as the council was talking, the, it was a reference to the access plan, uh, for downtown. And frankly, um, from our perspective, the, there is a nexus between the, uh, commerce that takes place that is food and beverage and office and, and, uh, uh, and retail. But, uh, and that, that nexus is that, that, that the parking, parking really is important. Well, I, I agree with Will. There's a real balance here to be achieved. Some of that involves, uh, the appropriate placement of, of, um, of parklets as well. But the way that access plan was established is that in general, uh, beyond the, the, the, the, uh, the, uh, the curbs of the, of the street that the, that the parking be on either side of the downtown generally. And so there's a lots of parking there onto the, to the east more to the, to the west. One of the things that's given me concern, uh, is that the, um, the parking, the existing parking structure is not well used. And for a reason, there are some real problems there, uh, with, uh, trash and, and there, I, I understand that there's a, there's an effort the city is going to be undertaking, uh, to, um, to, to make that much more presentable. But there, we, we think that some of that, that nexus could be, uh, used in improving the, the existing municipal, uh, parking structure. Thank you. Katie Toma followed by Doug Roberts. Well, good afternoon. I have to say it's great to be in person. So, uh, Mayor Coolidge, Vice Mayor Reynolds and council members. I'm Katie Toma, President and CEO of the Chico Chamber. And what a great opportunity we have, um, to, for the city of Chico to move Chico forward with these funds that have been provided through the American Rescue Plan. The Chico Chamber's vision is established in 2015 is to see Chico as a strong and vibrant community by having a thriving business community, healthy local government, be a safe community, and be a, a, a community that has premier arts and recreation facilities. The Chico Chamber's scope of work this year is to support and advocate on behalf of businesses in the recruitment of and retention of employees. The scope of work was developed based on a deep dive survey we conducted with our members and also the members of the downtown Chico Business Association. Over 200 members responded and they identified three areas of struggle in employment, employee retention, and recruitment. Lack of housing, overall safety in the community, and the declining condition of our parks. They're less clean and safe. And reviewing the preliminary allocation of the American Rescue Plan as put forth by staff and identified in the economic development portion of attachment A, we see tremendous opportunity in addressing the struggles businesses are facing post-Camp Fire and pandemic. We're also very excited to see the! We're excited about broadband, maybe not as passionate as Director Dowell, but it is a very important tool in recruiting businesses to this area. This has been a huge barrier in recruitment and is just a, just a great opportunity. So we look forward to continue working collaboratively with the city and staff, city staff and council in moving Chico forward. Thank you. So, Doug Roberts. Followed by Carla. Hello Chico City Council. Mayor Coolidge, Vice Mayor Reynolds. My name is Doug Roberts and I own Duffy's Tavern across the street. I've owned it for 30 years. And I also own the building that the bar is in. And our business took a pretty big beating over this last year with the pandemic. And I'm very proud of that. I've been in the business since the pandemic. Going into the pandemic, I had 20 employees. Now I have eight. I was open 16 hours a day, seven days a week, Christmas, New Year's, Thanksgiving, every day. And now I'm open, you know, four days a week for about nine hours a day. So we're, we're, we're kind of on the path, you know, we're, we're sort of recovering. We're, we're in that process. We follow the guidelines through the different tiers, but every time we're open, we lost money. We lost, we lost money every time we got open until we were able to use outdoor seating. And I'd like to thank Brendan Ottoboni and Sam Harrison for helping us get our temporary outdoor seating permit. They helped us push it through. And now that I know how much the outdoor seating has helped my business, I want to do as much as possible to extend how long we can continue doing it. So that's a tip that I think that's a tip that's a tip that's a tip that's a tip that's a tip that's a tip that's a tip that's a tip that's a tip that's a tip that's a tip that's a tip that's a tip that's a tip that's a tip that's a tip that's a tip that's a tip that's a tip that's a tip that's a tip that's a tip that's a tip that's a tip that's a tip that's a tip that's a tip that's a tip that's a tip that's a tip that's a tip that's a tip that's a tip that's a tip that's a tip that's a tip that's a tip that's a tip that's a tip that's a tip that's a tip that's a tip that's a tip that's a tip that's a tip that's a tip that's a tip that's a tip that's a tip that's a tip that's a tip that's a tip that's a tip that I'm all over the idea of coming up with a better design to make it more appealing, and I would really welcome any help we can get with that. I have some designs that more or less conceal the K-rail, but I'd need to help with an engineer to get that finally put through. Thank you. So it's Carla, followed by Catherine Posey. Hi, my name's Carla. I had a prepared question there that I was going to ask you about, but I want to speak about something that's a little more personalized, and it actually addresses the endeavor with, is it a million dollars for small businesses to bring tourists in and get that business going or that industry going? So I'm a massage therapist. I was involved with Chico Massage Therapy School for four years. I started attending in 2009. I was prepared to expand my business and hire on two therapists before the COVID-19 hit, and I don't want to particularly go into the effects of COVID-19 on my own tiny little business, but I do want to say Chico is the only... the only town in California that I know of that does not require massage therapists to be certified or licensed in order to get a business license. In other words, any one of you could go to the... to go get a business license, hang up a shingle on an office, and say you do massage therapy. So I would suggest that you take some of that small business money and use it to look at how you can overturn and get a more effective and safe procedure in place for having massage therapy businesses in Chico. Licensed massage therapists are fingerprinted, background checked. We have minimum education. We have to recertify every two years. And that's it. Catherine Posey, followed by Charles Bethune. Hi, everybody. Thanks for the info about everything. I just had a simple kind of concern, and it's about the allocation for the small business support. Now, I know a lot of the funds are going to help small businesses in different ways. My grandparents owned a business in Chico for many years, the Posey Fair. But I know, I looked at it, and I know there's 1 million in 2021, 1 million in 2022. So my concern is, could small businesses receive more than that? I know that Aaron Rodgers gave 1 million to small businesses. We know that 400 small businesses in Butte County closed during the COVID-19 situation. Aaron Rodgers was one individual, and I know his funds went to help 80 businesses. So I'm wondering, you know, how many businesses will this funding go to? And so, you know, I just am concerned about that, because I do feel strongly about supporting those small businesses in Chico that have suffered as a result of the lockdowns. They're a vital part of the economy here. So I just wanted to encourage the council to take a detailed and rigorous look at that, and consider whether there might be the possibility to give more funding to the small businesses. Specifically, small business support. Now, I know it's great, like the expanding of the downtown and some of the other areas. I know that Mark Warren mentioned that are going to benefit the businesses. But specifically, the small business support is what I kind of wanted to highlight. Thank you. Charles Withoon, followed by Rita Miller. Mayor Coolidge, Vice Mayor Reynolds, councillors and staff, thank you very much for this opportunity. Charles Withoon, business owner and operator and employer in Chico for 40 years. And I'm here tonight because I love the downtown. I got a business going that employs people to this day. I sold it. I have a comfortable retirement. And I gave up sports, my sailboat. I went on vacations to see if I could save downtown from the situation that I see it in. In the 70s, in the 80s, in the 90s. The word homelessness was not even in our lexicon. It wasn't spoken by journalists to speak of. 2008 rolled around. My income was cut in half. Got mine. And now we have Pulitzer Prize winning journalist Dale Maharidge in a national magazine studying California. And he said in his research, he quoted, he expects in the order of 5 million Californians to be facing eviction this year. We need to think about that. We need to think about campgrounds. We need to think about tiny home villages. Your lauded presentation by Buchanan Behavioral Health, Scott Kennelly, said you're going to need safe car parks. You're going to need campgrounds. You're going to need tiny home villages. Thank you. Rita Miller, fellow by Paula Hare. I really didn't have any time to get your question. I'm going to get it addressed. So I didn't really know it was coming here today. But I live at Comanche Park. And I am a campfire victim, survivor, whatever you want to call it. And I understand that we are definitely a drain to the community at this point. And I get that this is not an easy solution. And I just want you guys to know that I believe in Chico. And actually, if you count even all that, I keep telling people that. They don't. They always scuff at me. Like, whatever. Nobody cares about you. I'm like, I believe that you guys care. And I hope that in the long run that you guys will come up with a solution that's good for everybody. Because I do not like the way I'm living. And I don't want to be a drain to this community. But that is where I'm at. And I don't like having to be ashamed to walk to the store because everybody looks at me badly. Because I'm one of those people. But that's where I'm at. And I just, that's, I think that everybody has a right to housing. Nobody should be left behind. And this isn't just, it's the states, it's everybody. It's not just Chico. It's not just Butte County. It's all over the state, right? So everything's kind of clumped up and everybody, and then there's the pandemic on top of it. But I just hope that you guys can realize that everybody that's living there, that's living there, that's living there. And everybody that's homeless isn't just, shouldn't be thrown away. Because we care too. And I run around picking up your guys' trash too. I'm not throwing trash all over the place. But I'm picking it up. You know, and that's just my way of trying to give back. Because that way I have something to do. I'm disabled. And so, you know, maybe I wouldn't be somebody that would be able to be in that program for the job. Maybe I would. But I just, I just don't know. I just hope that you guys realize that there are people out there too that still matter. Okay? Paula Hare followed by Nicole Nava. Last time I spoke to you, I talked about you should have that camping and stuff and the parking stuff out there by the airport. I haven't heard you talk about it. I haven't heard anything funny about it. All I hear is the BMF track. Okay. And the small houses. Well, the small houses is fine for a few people. It happened like for a year. And then they are captured out and another bunch is put in. But you got a problem out here. And you don't want to do anything about it except make it worse. You got the garbage problems down there. I had to pawn with the campers because you don't want to move them out. So we got to pawn now with garbage. And still, nobody's taking the garbage out of the airport. They're going to keep putting more in. You got to have the same problems with your rivers. And it's cost you how much money? Because you've had to bring all that heavy equipment down, take tons and tons and tons out. When you could have had all this stuff out there by the airport, and you wouldn't have a problem in any of our areas where you'd have to take all this stuff, garbage and other stuff out. And people would have known where they are. And you could have had all that stuff for the help of what they needed. Instead, you're spending all this money and spending your wheels and doing absolutely zippage. And if you think I'm wrong, well, I hope I am. But maybe I won't be around until this be the last time I can be as long on your damn side. Because I'm going to have one surgery on the 29th and I might not even make it. Nicole Nava followed by Jeff Creed. Good evening again. So I brought a couple different versions because I didn't know which way anything was going to go. And after hearing the discussion, there's a certain part that I think should be addressed first. And after hearing you lay out the different budget elements, I feel like you need to refocus and ask yourselves the question, what is the role you want the city of Chico to play in regard to the homeless services? Because to me, it is hanging up a lot of people's heads. And I think that's a big part of the business getting done. And there was so much unclear in here because we did have the nexus to homeless, which I addressed in an earlier closed session public comment. That was the 600,000 that now we're hearing there was talk about it. Okay, no, it's infrastructure to put in at the new BMX site, which is more toward the airport side of town than ours. And it was the nexus to homelessness. So are we talking about setting up infrastructure there? So it was like, well, maybe let's remove it. We don't know what to focus on and how to direct our comments when we have things like this. So for me, another question is, what will you do if people refuse to come to your new solution? What's going to happen, right, with the service-resistant when there's already consistently open shelter beds they refuse to go to? What will you do with newly arrived people who are homeless in Chico and have no visible means of support? What will be your exit plan for this solution? Or is this going to be an ongoing budget issue where we then do not have the outbound? What is the allocation to draw from? When will the representatives at any level acknowledge that they must either advocate to the next level of representatives for 24-7 addiction and mental health services? Or we can never see our way out of this situation. We would be doomed to grow this problem and destroy Chico. The housing will be there because these will be treatment facilities for these folks. And where is our DA in all of this? So if we can all of a sudden now actively enforce if there's a resting place, have you checked with him? Are we going to? Are we going to do anything about it? So I think there's broader questions that need to be directed. I have three minutes, but that's nothing. Sorry. Jeff Creed followed by Grace Marvin. Oh, this is a funny day for me. I get to come up here and laugh because this is funny. And it's sad. It's really sad. Mark was very clear. He didn't want to dive into other people's areas of responsibility. But then he wants to dive into the homeless area of responsibility and expand that area. And, you know, it's just funny because it seems, you know, touching on what Councilor Danilay was saying, you know, there should be something set up for the youth of Chico this summer. And, you know, it could be quick, timely summer camp activities to keep them out of trouble so they're not out causing problems. Because they've been cooped up for years. They've lost social skills to interact. The schools aren't going to have them in session all summer. So why can't, why couldn't somebody have come up or why can't they do it now, come up with a plan to help the students and the young adults and the children in this community over the summer and maybe next summer? It was incredibly hilarious to hear somebody, like, go on and on, like, oh, we need to attract entrepreneurs. We need to attract entrepreneurs to downtown. And then you've got this. We've got this slush fund set up for downtown. You want to go and fix an awning on a building where they haven't had an awning for five years. That's the building, that's the owner's responsibility. You know, you look at some of these businesses downtown, there's spots that are rented for years just to keep other people from using that space. At 2nd and Main, those buildings were trashed two years before COVID. And nothing's been done to fix those two buildings. And now you want to come up here and spend city money? That's laughable. I guess some of the people in this room weren't here, like, what was it, four years ago, Mayor, when the lady came up here and said they couldn't hire doctors because the crime in the city was so bad? And has crime gotten any better? No, it's gotten worse. Trash has gotten worse. It's gotten worse. And it's just funny to talk about tourism. What a joke. Grace Marvin. No applause, please. Grace Marvin, fellow mayor. Thank you. And I'm going to turn it over to the next speaker, followed by Lori Harris. Yes, please. I just wanted to make a few comments regarding homelessness in particular, which I thought would be more a part of this agenda than I had thought. But I've all along expected that homelessness would be much more a part of the agenda of the city council and that we would get more responses to the many advocates for helping the homeless as well as from the homeless people themselves. It's not just a matter of trash. It's also a matter of disease and public health and people dying from homelessness. We need you to address this and to be open and to be transparent. We had hoped that Judge England's prior decision that you should educate the public about the law, for example, Martin v. Boise, would mean that we'd actually be able to address this. And we hear about what are the laws that affect homelessness. But we haven't heard much of anything. And we also hope that you come up with very constructive projects that maybe are partial projects for 60, 50, 60 people and see how effective they are. Hillary has one in mind and that we think is really, really good. Then see how that works. But then in the meantime, meet the basic needs of the other homeless, too. There are so many in this community. A lot of us have lost our pride in the city of Chico and we want it restored. Thank you. Lori Harris followed by Greg Scott. She may be outside. Why don't we move on to the next speaker and go back to her. Okay. Greg Scott. You can just call our name. Next one. Mayor Cooley, just counseling. I, too, like Mr. Brady and Mr. DiGiovanni, support the economic development section of this with a couple of exceptions. As a business owner downtown, one whose business has spent several hundred thousand dollars in outdoor dining, the parklets kind of leave me a little off on that. The main thing is I'm going to talk about the downtown parking structure. And I've got a really simple solution so people can kind of get an idea. Our parking structure, I say ours, the parking structure next door to the hotel is dark, gray, and security cameras that go nowhere. Go down to the parking structure next to the University Police Department and just take a look. And then drive down to ours and take a look. It's self-explanatory. It is absolutely ridiculous. It's absolutely ludicrous to have as many break-ins as we have, which aren't reported every time. So when you look at the police reports for break-ins in the parking structure, you can't really tell. We have several. If nothing else, it's just vandalism, breaking windows. And we've all experienced that. And I think it's time, you know, I believe we spent, when I say we, our family business spent about 25 grand to help put the cameras into the parking structure. I thought they were going to the police department. I don't even know where they go. But nobody monitors. We'd have been better off spending about $2,000 putting ring cameras in and having them go to our phone. I just encourage you to spend some money to actually protect the safety of the people in Chico. You know, one of our places just the other night, some guy ran into the back with a college student in the building. He was captured. Scared the bejesus out of her. But, you know, she's a good person. She's back home now. But that's the kind of things that are happening in this town that shouldn't be happening. And I think we need to use some of this money to do that, protect the safety of the town. Thank you. So I'll call Lori Harris. Do you like my mask? It goes over my eyes. Did you notice? Because it's such a joke what's going on here. What a shame. That the people that are supposed to represent us are doing such a bad job. I had a whole comment on the Ponzi schemes going on that the city's doing with the CalPERS. Ma'am. But after listening. Lori, we're going to need you to actually wear the mask when you speak. Oh! That'll make a big difference, won't it? After listening to the huge gaps and gaping questions this budget has in its presentation, I changed my mind. I changed my mind about the CalPERS Ponzi scheme. You know, this ARP is just providing money that's really not ours. Just like these guys have said, downtown businesses are dying. Why in the world would you take more money that isn't yours to start with instead of helping real people and real families? Any answers for that? What about the COVID relief money? That's a joke too. Let the government give you more false money that's not even in your budget and put it into a budget that needs to cut out all the superficial crap that's in it and get down to real business and real people? That $500,000 transitional employment program? Really? I just texted my friends at Jesus Center and they're going, huh? I'm sorry. What are you talking about? Well, we need to decide that the people are more important than the money. Quit following the money and get in the streets with your people and listen to what they really need. Try that on for size. Jessica Giannola followed by Agenaia Beatty. Hello, everyone. I'm Agenaia Beatty. So that's a tip that's not a tip that's not a tip that's not a tip that's not a tip that's not a tip that's not a tip that's not a tip that's not a tip that's not a tip that's not a tip that's not a tip that's not a tip that's not a tip that's not a tip that's not a tip that's not a tip that's not a tip that's not a tip that's not a tip that's not a tip that's not a tip that's not a tip that's not a tip that's not a tip that's not a tip that's not a tip that's not a tip that's not a tip that's not a tip that's not a tip that's not a tip that's not a tip that's not a tip that's not a tip that's not a tip that's not a tip that's not a tip that's not a tip that's not a tip that's not a tip that's not a tip that's not a tip that's not a tip that income-wise. So if that's something that we can support, I'm all for it. Fire stations are great. Supporting them, even the CAD, having our police system on the same system is really important for communication. Those are all ideal things. What I do find alarming is that every time the word homeless or homelessness is mentioned, there's a freak out. And it's like, oh, don't worry, just take it off the table. And that's a real impact. I can't think of anyone else who'd be more impacted by the recession. I mean, that's what the American Rescue Plan is. It's signed into law to speed up recovery from economic and health effects of COVID-19 and the ongoing recession. Who better impacted there than people without a home or job? So I do support the rehabilitation program. I think it should be more than six months. It should be like 18 months, 24 months. Because people are out there who obviously haven't gotten a job yet. So let's support them. They're helping the community by holding jobs. They need the support to get them. Then that's something we should be supporting too. Broadband's important, especially for people who are unhoused or can't afford to have internet on their own. Because that's often how they use their phone. And people who are trying to get out of being in a homeless situation are trying to communicate with people, housing, Section 8, the different aspects that need to contact them. And they can use an app-based phone. So that's a tip that's a tip that's a tip that's a tip that's a tip that's a tip that's a tip that's a tip that's a tip that's a tip that's a tip that's a tip that's a tip that's a tip that's a tip that's a tip that's a tip that's a tip that's a tip that's a tip that's a tip that's a tip that's a tip that's a tip that's a tip that's a tip that's a tip that's a tip that's a tip that's a tip that's a tip that's a tip that's a tip that's a tip that's a tip that's a tip that's a tip that's a tip that's a tip that's a tip that's a tip that's a tip that's a tip that's a tip that's a tip that's a tip that's a tip that's a tip that's a tip that's a tip that's a tip that's a tip that's a tip that's a tip that's a tip of the FOIA request that just came out into the public where masks do not work. I want to know which one of you are going to stand up to rescue Americans from this draconian law and the lies from this pandemic and the bio-warfare that has been assaulted on the American public. I have to say that I'm absolutely upset and discouraged with this whole plan. Again, we want to take $1,050,000 for homeless, but yet COVID, this pandemic has affected people who do not choose to be homeless or be addicted to drugs. People like children. What would $500,000 do for children's sports and emotional well-being? What would $500,000 do for special needs programs? Because in this American rescue plan on the Department of Treasury, it says that you can assist nonprofits, but yet Mr. Orr doesn't want to address children nor nonprofits. I'm so sorry, but I don't give a frog's back behind about the damn homeless who are doing their drugs, living and messing up our parks. I care about our children because that is America's future. I care about homeless, not homeless. I care about people who have special needs. They're artistic. Adults are down syndrome adults. They have all been kicked to the curb because of this pandemic, this shandemic, the election infection that has killed children and special needs and elderly people, yet I don't see any of that addressed. I am absolutely disappointed in Orr's thought of what we can address children. That's time. Thank you. And I'm sad that we can't. So our next speaker is Mary Murphy. Good afternoon. I had something completely different prepared, but I am really concerned about we have, we've had, my family has given over $200,000. $200,000. That's a lot. And we have been in places like the Jesus Center over the years. And so we have a passion for the homeless situation. At the same token, our kids, similar, are our future. And when we, I don't even want to come downtown, frankly. I don't. I only come through to get certain items and leave. But there's more businesses than just downtown. You're just concentrating on downtown. There's lots of businesses that have supported. There's tons of people and tons of employment. And all we talk about is downtown. There's, as she said, 400 businesses that were closed. You know, the Cozy Kitchen, that kind of stuff. Lots of people went. They couldn't go. And they abided by your guys' rules as far as the COVID went. And they got nothing from it. And they're still closed. Because they didn't survive through it. Where are you in helping that group? And as far as the education part, I'm all for education. My gosh. Why wouldn't anybody? But 500,000 for 30 people, and we have places like Duke College, incorporate them. And the fact that you're spending that much for 30 people, I think that's really irresponsible. I don't know. There's too much to say in two minutes. You have no applause. Thank you. Thank you. She was our last speaker. All right. Any further questions? I actually have a couple more questions, if the council will indulge me. Are the parklets permanent or not permanent? You know, we could look at the design. The concept of the parklet, as we were talking about them, would be more of a temporary fixture as opposed to the permanent fixtures that you're seeing, because of the fact that, as you heard mentioned, we are looking at other opportunities for realignments in the downtown area. We want to make sure that we weren't putting good money towards bad. All right. And then just an area of clarification for Mr. Ulmer. This is really a softball question, but it is for the education of the public. A lot of times when we have people talk about public monies, they go immediately to the potholes on the roads in front of them and go, why aren't you spending money on that? So if you just offer us some clarification that this money cannot be spent, for those type of things. Yeah, there are a tremendous number of areas of need to include filling a pothole that these monies cannot be used for. The roads weren't impacted by COVID. If anything, they were helped by COVID because there were less people beating them up. So unfortunately, we can't use it for that, but thank you. Thank you. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. I also want to ask a question in regards to a question about the money that was included in the BMX part of the proposal that had to do with homelessness. Can you really explain why that period in there and what your thoughts are on that? Yeah, absolutely. absolutely councilmember huber so there was originally a nexus between homelessness and the relocation of bmx that's the only reason the note was on there it doesn't need to be on there because this funding goes directly towards the bmx project on the site out near the airport so hopefully that brings clarity that we approve the preliminary allocation of the arp funds for city projects knowing that the removal of homelessness in the next publication to retain a a a a a So you clarify that maybe? So are you saying that the nexus should be removed or that the money itself should be removed? The portion of the money that was included for home use within that particular item is not needed in that particular item. So it sounds like, Council Member Huber, that you just want that language stricken from that line item because it's not in relation to homelessness. Yes. Okay. All right. So before we move on, I just want to make a point about parklets. And I know Mark was here, and Andrew, I can't remember if you were here. I don't remember who else was here. But we had almost like a bottle-throwing conversation. We had a lot of people at the parklet contest when we tried to put a parklet in front of Starbucks. I was here. I mean, it was crazy. So just proceed with massive caution. It was, you would have thought we were turning Chico upside down and shaking all the people out of it. That's what people were acting like. It was going to be Armageddon because Starbucks was going to have a parklet. So I'm not opposed to it. I just think you need to be careful. I think Mr. Scott made some pretty good points about what we can do. For safety and some of the other parking structures. I'm not going to get into that, but just be careful with the parklets. All right. We have a motion. Well, I'll keep talking. Not prepared to second the motion necessarily. I think taking a language out doesn't make any difference at all. It's semantics. It makes people feel better, but whatever. I had this conversation with a couple people, including reporters, that were like, Oh, my God, tonight's going to completely change Chico. Tonight's not going to do anything. I asked a couple people, how much money are we spending tonight? Nobody could answer. The number's zero, by the way. This is an approval of a preliminary plan for the staff to move forward in some different ways. If I broke down all the numbers myself, I'd come up with a different allotment. And I suspect so would all of my colleagues and all of the staff members. We either trust the staff or we don't. Nobody spends more time understanding what the deficiencies of the city are. We trust the staff more than the staff. Okay? We're policy makers. That's it. We're not supposed to get into operations. So while we can get in the nitty gritty, we can get deep in the weeds and go, Gosh, I might put $100,000 this way or $100,000 that way. At some point, we have to trust what the staff is doing. We're certainly not turning Chico into L.A. or doing any of those things with this. I know there's a lot of concern over what this may or may not do. As far as funding something. I think it's a good thing for the homeless people. But it also opens up another avenue. It's just the amount of consternation over this thing is slightly ridiculous. So I'll say that and leave it up to the rest of the council to make their comments. All right. So that was the second? Yes. Oh, it was not. Okay. Since you asked. Yeah. I know one council member asked about maybe breaking some of these things up. I think that might be appropriate. If there's, you know. Enough divisiveness that we don't want to include something like that. We could certainly do that. And I would understand. I think the public would as well. If we wanted to take some of these things out and vote on them individually. And maybe that's easier than doing the whole thing in one fell swoop. I don't have a lot of opinion either way. But I'd support it if somebody wanted to. Okay. Do we have a second on the item or not? Okay. I have a second, but I have a question. Oh, okay. Go ahead. Mr. Orm. What would it look like to have you? Bring this back to us? Because we have another meeting in seven days, right? To put these weighted and bring them back to us and let us digest it a little bit. And what you need absolutely want to do right now. What's the number one thing? If we think broadband is the most number one, we absolutely don't want any slowdown on that one. Let's do that. Could you wait these and bring them back to us? And could we vote on it on Tuesday? Or would that be earth shattering and change everything? We can do that. The only unfortunate reality, if I were. I had to do this whole meeting in the morning to bring it back to the next meeting. The next meeting already is full. This will cause a lot of public comment has been witnessed today. It would then make staff look really silly because we've again stacked the meeting with a lot of items that encouraged the intrigue of many members of the public. So I don't know if it would help or hinder your ability. Bottom line is with regard to I can do anything Council does ask me to do. I can wait these items. And I will tell you that. Okay. all of them I'll probably rate at a number one. I wouldn't put them on there if they weren't a number one. And the reasons why is because when you look at the circumstances surrounding COVID that we experienced over the past year plus, we have so many deficiencies across the board. And I was trying to be as generous as possible to get the money out of the city into other interests outside, from businesses to a variety of things. Although they look like they're city items, they actually help the community and members of the community in a variety of ways. And so I don't know if me sitting down and scoring them would help. That's all I have to say to that. Because I took off, I don't know if we had double the amount. I think it was over 50 million in items. And I had to boil it down to 22. So I already had to prioritize these, unfortunately. So I don't know if it would help. But I'm happy to do it if it gets. Council desire. All right. I have a question that I asked earlier that wasn't necessarily answered. Kind of got skipped over. With the resting site option on here, the 1.05 million, with that very likely being tied to a legal settlement situation, I'm still curious, and the city attorney, if you can weigh in on this, with settlements being listed as an ineligible use of these funds, would it be wise of us to move this forward with that on there at this time? Mr. Ewing, did you hear that? Thank you. I think I'll take a look at the Department of Treasury and get back to you on that question. I want to make sure I have a clear understanding from the Department on what its guidance is, what you consider a settlement, what would not be considered a settlement, and what would be considered a settlement. So I don't know if that answers your question yet. But I'll be happy to bring it back to you in the next meeting. Thank you. All right. Do we have a second on the motion? If not, it's going to die for lack of a second. So let's move that way. And then I'd like to make a motion to approve, remove the nexus to homelessness on the BMX track, withdraw the transitional employment pilot program. Wow, it's a tongue twister. For additional information, remove the homeless resting site park rehabilitation program for future analysis and actual division between the two proposals. I would have a friendly amendment to the motion if you are willing to include having staff, also look into the dollar amount for small business support and possibilities for children's activities that might fall into our own. Sure. I'd second it. All right. Adding, having staff look into the business support dollar amount, whether that's appropriate, if it needs to change, and then activities that might be something the city could do for children that wouldn't fall under somebody else. Yes. Thank you. Thank you. You know, I really feel like the downtown building enhancement thing, it should not be there too, because to some extent it's the business owner's responsibility. And there are other buildings around town who are business owners too, who might like to ask for that funding. If we do that, it should be for the whole town, not just for the downtown. Is that an amendment? Yes. I'll accept that. Thank you. Council Member Denley, would you accept her amendment as well? All right. Do we have a motion and a second? Two friendly amendments. Madam Clerk, do you need me to repeat that? I don't think so. It was a motion by you. And who was the second? Him. Okay. Council Member Denley. Sorry. All right. To remove homeless wording from the BMX funding item, and then to remove... I believe that that's the 1.1 million for further analysis, a friendly amendment to look into a dollar amount for small business solutions and activities for children that could be funded by the city, and then a friendly amendment by Council Member Tandon to look at improvements, not just for the downtown area, but for the whole town. And then to remove the money for the city as a whole. Right. Correct. Is that correct? Correct. Yes. I have another question. Sure. So on removing the money for the resting site for further analysis, can you define further analysis? And here's why I ask the question. If whatever is worked out in this pending litigation requires that we do something, which is somewhat likely, in order to move to enforce our ordinances again, which is... This is where I'd like to go. If you've removed that as a possible means of helping pay for that, it then has to come from the general fund. Is that your intention? No. It was basically to answer Council Member Dantley's question regarding whether or not legally we can even have it in there because it's relative to a settlement agreement, possibly, which would be contingent upon Vince bringing back some kind of opinion. So my... And also to get a delineation of the funds. Another friendly amendment would be to... Leave it in there pending the city attorney's analysis. That way you don't have to come back and redo it again. Yeah. Vince, can you weigh in on that? Certainly. So you can... What I'll do is I'll go to the Department of Treasury. I'll take a look at the different sources of funding. I'm generally aware of... What Council Member Dantley mentioned. But what I want to... What I would analyze further are the specific restrictions and whether or not they would apply to our set of facts. And so I would come back to you with that analysis at the next meeting. By keeping... By keeping the money there doesn't mean you have to use it. It doesn't mean it's going to be used for a settlement. You can do so based on... What I advise you of at the next meeting. So we have done these settlements in other cities. As we're speaking or as Council Member Dantley posed the question, I circulated it to my colleagues who sit in other cities in the same seat about the use of the money. So I should have the analysis back very quickly. So it doesn't affect the city by leaving that... The potential... The potential use of that money there. And if it turns out when I come back, hey, you know what? The Department of Treasury said you can't use it for any kind of settlement. And it looks like what we are going to... The resolution of this litigation would fall within that definition. So my recommendation would be not to use it because it falls within that definition. That could be not... Or the opposite. Okay. Okay. I'm going to use it because I'm a part of the Treasury. They told me this and this would be allowed for this room. So if you have a lot of time to get back to me by next Tuesday, I can have more clarity on that question. Okay. I think that makes sense. So, Ms. Morgan. So you accepted the friendly amendment? So we have to accept or... I would withdraw my second. That would be me. Then she'll withdraw her second. So non-acceptance of the friendly amendment. Okay. Thank you. So that means that Mr. Morgan's amendment would not be valid for that second amendment. So that means that Mr. Morgan's amendment would not be valid for that second amendment. So that means that Mr. Morgan's amendment would not be valid for that second amendment. was not accepted. Okay. So it's back to the original motion. Okay. Alright. Council Member Brown? This meeting was a mess and with all due respect it was bound to be a mess. Plenty of support on this, but no. Council Member Dinley? While I seconded it, I'm getting a little bit uncomfortable about the way things are getting shimmied. I'm going to be a no. Council Member Huber? No. Council Member Morgan? No. Council Member Tandon? No. Vice Mayor Reynolds? No. Mayor Coolidge? Okay, just for fun, no. How about that? I don't need to count that one. Yeah, you don't even need to count that. Okay. Alright. Alright. So back to the drawing board. I would make a motion that staff brings back each item individually with explanations for each item that was listed before for bringing back each item individually to be considered with the attorney evaluation on the issue with the settlement, as well as bringing back items on items for children, and reconsidering the small business support allotment. Alright. We have a motion. We have a second. Okay. Motion dies for lack of a second. Can I bring up a discussion? Sure. I have an idea. Because I think we're close to getting there. What would it look like if we split the homeless resting area and the park rehabilitation and actually put a percentage on it, i.e. 50-50? And then if we find out, so there's some public certain that the public understands and knows so much is going to be sent on park rehab and so much resting site. If there's left over, you can bring back to us that there's money left over. We don't need it for rehabbing. Or if there's not enough for a resting site, you can bring it back and say we don't have enough for a resting site. But at least there's a little bit of certainty as to where that's going. And then if we get information from the attorney that says we cannot use it as a resting site because park rehabilitation, I don't foresee that being, I think that's still COVID related. I think we're fine there. I think where we're hung up is the resting site. So is that anything that anybody, and then we can change the downtown to all over town and all the other things. So that's one of the things that we've identified in taking out the transitional employment program. I agree with that as well. And I am good with looking into children's activities. Is that anywhere close to something that we can all agree on? If I turn that into a motion? Without saying all that? I think it's in the ballpark. Huh? I think it's in the ballpark. I might disagree with your percentages, but. Okay. And I'm open to suggestion on the percentages. I was just throwing it out there as somewhere to, hopefully get us somewhere down the road so we can get hope at some point tonight. Yeah. So, yeah. Make sure I understood. Nice mirror around us. So you want to separate the fix the park from what we may be able to use for a resting site, correct? Correct. And you want to take that out? No, I'm just saying, give it a percentage. So that means that that's a percentage that's not a that's not a standard that's not a standard that's not a standard that's not a standard that's not a standard that's not a standard that's not a standard that's not a standard that's not a standard that's not a standard that's not a standard that's not a standard that's not a standard that's not a standard that's not a standard that's not a standard that's not a standard that's not a standard that's not a standard that's not a standard that's not a standard that's not a standard that's not a standard that's not a standard that's not a standard that's not a standard to understand where we're coming from and separating the two and then if we find out that we cannot use it because it's part of a settlement from our attorney then it's super easy to just drop that item when they're separated anyways but we can do that anyway is what the city attorney said we can i was just trying to make the motion more clear and hopefully get a second on it and get us down the road i can my motion would be something similar to separating the homeless resting site and the park rehabilitation program and putting a percentage on the the two of them removing the transitional employment employment pilot program and changing the downtown building enhancement to all chico building enhancement it should be eligible to anybody um and there was oh and then having staff look into the possibility of youth activities that could maybe be funded with some of these funds that are left over or reallocated or whatever did i miss anything deleting the next system okay deleting the necklace to homeless on the bmx are you including the attorney evaluating the resting site because because we have all this stuff ahead of us and we're sitting here trying to finagle these detailed motions because we got an all over the place huge pool of a bunch of ideas with no actual planning behind them and i'm frustrated that we're in this position to sit here and say what about this motion what about this we have 10 different things we need to change because we didn't get all the information. We didn't get the information on what is or isn't eligible uses even. Like this, I'm just vocalizing how frustrated I am that we are sitting here trying to finagle motions and we look like all over the place because of the staff report. I'm frustrated. I just had to say that. So I'm just going to step out and defend the staff for a second because the staff can't give us, they're asking for a framework. We're not spending any money and the staff is saying this is the direction we think that we're headed in and I'm trying to think of an example. So let's say the money for the businesses. So if the deputy city manager said, well don't come forward with that until you have an exact plan of how you're going to spend every dollar. That would take you some amount of hours. I don't know what it is. And then the council would say that's not where we want the money to go. So my guess is that's why there's not a detailed plan attached to absolutely every one of these things. We wouldn't be here till like August if that was the case. They're kind of asking do you like this direction. Some of the direction you like, some of you don't. And you've made that clear in your motions. Like it sounds like nobody wants to do the transitional work programming, whatever. But to ask for there to be detailed plans for every little thing when we haven't said this is kind of the direction we want to go in, it's hard for staff to do that. So I'm not sure that's fair. I think it's more so about what is there to be done. We eliminate the detailed plans. That would be a lot. But even just with eligible, I'll say that. They don't need detailed plans. Well is there anything on here that's not eligible except for perhaps, and Vince will get back to us, the money for the resting site. Anything else is eligible or it wouldn't be on there. And well but so so here's the deal. We can leave that on there. If the city attorney says yeah you can't use it that way, okay then we can't use it that way. If you don't leave it in there and it turns out a federal judge says you need to do something and we can use that money, we don't allocate it, it's coming from the general fund. Or there's no point in spending any money on the parks because that's where everyone's going to go back to. If the TRO isn't lifted, don't worry about spending money cleaning up the park because it's just going to get worse and worse and worse. Those are the choices. I don't like them any more than any of the rest of you do. But- there's not 10 different lanes to go down. There's going to be one of two. So was that a second? There's not a motion on the floor. Yeah. Motion. I'll make a substitute motion. Is there a second to Vice Mayor Reynolds? Because if not, then it dies for lack of a second. No. Council Member Hueber, no. Okay. So. Fails for lack of a second. Who? It just failed. It failed for lack of a second. Sorry. Go ahead, Council Member Morgan. I can't believe I'm going to do this. I'll vote to leave the allocations the way they are. Save for two things. Remove the work training program. I think it's fine, but my colleagues don't seem to like it. That's fine. Make the downtown buildings citywide. The only reason I'm not going to bring the youth program into it is I think that should probably come from the school district. And I think the amount of people that will come out for the money is pretty high. That's my motion. Okay. And would you both be willing to accept that we remove on the BMX? Okay. So that means that that's a motion that's not a motion that's not a motion that's not a motion that's not a motion that's not a motion that's not a motion that's not a motion that's not a motion that's not a motion that's not a motion that's not a motion that's not a motion that's not a motion that's not a motion that's not a motion that's not a motion that's not a motion that's not a motion that's not a motion that's not a motion that's not a motion that's not a motion that's not a motion that's not a motion that's not a motion that's not a motion that's not a motion that's not a motion that's not a motion that's not a motion that's not a motion that's not a motion that's not a motion that's not a motion that's not a motion that's not a by Council Member Morgan, seconded by Council Member Huber to approve the preliminary allocations as stated with the changes as noted. Work training program removed. Downtown buildings will be citywide, not just for the B for downtown. The BMX remove the nexus. City attorney opinion at the next meeting on the settlement. Go ahead, Ms. Rube. Yeah, I mean, I actually have been a member of the employment and recruitment program. However, it takes a little bit after this to adjust the amount of time we need for the employment. Okay. Can I make a friendly amendment to my own motion? You can just amend it. Here's my amended motion. The money, I know, let's wait. Mr. Huber, listen, because you're, I second, right? It was just freaking everybody out again. Take the money that was going to be allocated to the work transition program and allocate it to some type of youth program to be determined by whoever may determine it. So we took that out, right? That's a certain allocation. Move it right over there. Everything else goes the same. I'm trying to make everybody happy, which is usually a bad idea. Thank you. Thanks, Scott. All right. Madam Clerk, take the roll. Okay. Council Member Brown. Nope. Council Member Denley. Sorry. No. Council Member Huber. Yes. Yes, I got it. Council Member Morgan. Yes. Council Member Tandon. I do have a quick question for it. So in this motion, are we still keeping the homeless, homeless, resting site just the way it is? Not allocating any percentages at all? Right. With the attorney to bring back information on? But on that note, I want to ask you a quick question. Sorry, Bob. It's in the middle of the motion. Probably better before we're actually voting. Sorry. No, that's okay. So nothing is setting stones. If we need to change the amount going down the line, as per the recommendations, we can change all of those numbers. The whole thing. Yes. Correct. Yes. Yes. Okay. And that was a yes vote. Okay. So Vice Mayor Reynolds. Aye. Mayor Coolidge. Aye. It carries 5-2. All right. And with that, we will, I believe, adjourn. Thank you very much, everybody. Thanks, Scott. Bye, Scott. Bye, Scott. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye.! Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Thank you.
