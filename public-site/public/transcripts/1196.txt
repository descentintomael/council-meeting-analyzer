There's cards on that back table.  Turn them in over here.  My left, your right, to the clerk.  And then speakers are taken in order to receive no cards after comments have started on that  particular section of the agenda.  So, just a side note here.  Person's demonstrating rude.  And boisterous.  Speaking on matters outside the jurisdiction of the City Council or engaging in otherwise  disruptive behavior will be called to order by the Mayor.  If such conduct continues, the Mayor may call a recess requesting the removal of such persons  from the Council Chambers, adjourn the meeting, or take some other appropriate action.  And we will start with the closed session announcement from City Attorney John Lamb.  Mr. Lamb.  Thank you, Mr. Mayor, City Council.  Earlier this evening, the City Council recessed in closed session.  Um.  All Council members were present for closed session.  Uh.  The Council considered items 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3.  Council was briefed.  Direction was provided, but no final action was taken.  That concludes my report. [inaudible]  Yep, there we go.  Okay.  I bet I'm going to be taking longer tonight than everyone else.  All right.  Who do we have here for the Homeless Youth Awareness Month?  No one?  No one?  Who is it?  Eileen.  All right.  Well, we'll read it in the record and then give it to Eileen.  So, whereas the California Department of Education reports there are 246,480 homeless students, including 1,608 K-12 students in Butte County enrolled during the 2023 school year,  and whereas natural disaster and the lack of affordable housing have exacerbated youth homelessness across rural California,  and approximately 25% of youth exiting foster care will experience homelessness.  And whereas a percentage of homeless youth have been physically, sexually, or emotionally abused by their guardians  and are frequently re-victimized and exploited while living on the streets and shelters,  and whereas LGBTQ plus young adults are at 120% higher risk of homelessness when compared to their counterparts  and comprise 40% of the unaccompanied homeless youth population,  and whereas due to lack of stable...  housing homeless youth face great difficulty in accessing, stabilizing, and succeeding in school,  reducing the likelihood of successful graduation,  and whereas the citizens of Chico, California are key to preventing youth homelessness  by acting as mentors and role models for youth,  guiding them towards available resources, productive choices,  and creating opportunities for youth to successfully transition to adulthood.  There be it resolved that I, Andrew Quillage, Mayor of the City of Chico,  on behalf of the City Council,  do hereby proclaim November 2024 Homeless Youth Awareness Month  and do commend this observance to all our citizens.  All right.  All right.  All right.  So we'll move on to the consent.  Consent and agenda.

How many speakers?  You have three?  All right.  Three minutes each.  Vic Sabaro, followed by Joni Jenno.  If you're called next, go ahead and line up behind him in the aisle.  Go ahead and come forward, sir.  Good.  Good evening.  My name is Vic Sabaro, and I appreciate the opportunity to speak regarding safety on our streets,  particularly on Sheridan Avenue and Palmetto.  And I have lived on Sheridan Avenue since 1978.  And how this all came to be is I retired two years ago and was volunteering at Beauty and the Maid Society  and adopted a dog ten months ago.  And I walked this dog approximately about four different times throughout the whole day.  Early, early morning, then right after 10, and then about, oh, 1 or 2 o'clock, and then early, early evening.  I take the dog out of the house.  I take the dog for four walks during different times of day, as I mentioned.  And I have noticed and counted numerous times, numerous times, that there are at least 300 cars per day going down Sheridan Avenue on both sides of Palmetto.  There are at least 500 cars per day going up and down Palmetto.  And many drivers are on their cell phones.  Motorists and other are not stopping completely at stop signs and are rolling through them.  Motorists are speeding down the streets past the speed limit.  Palmetto specifically going 45 miles or more in a 25 mile per hour, per hour, 25 mile zone.  Some are driving on the wrong side of the road, as I've seen going down the other side of Sheridan Avenue.  A, I encourage surveillance cameras to be installed, especially on Palmetto and at the intersections.  B, there should be speed bumps on Sheridan Avenue, as well as white strikes down the middle of the road.  I've seen people going down just thinking it's one way on the opposite wrong side of the road.  Safety should be a number one consideration.  I have had many conversations with neighbors and residents who live on these streets.  And they are willing to sign a petition if needed regarding these safety issues.  Thank you so much for your time. I appreciate it.  Have a wonderful rest of the week and I hope you all got to see the sunset before you came in.  Thank you.  We don't applaud.  We don't boo either.  Come on down.  Joni Jenno followed by Tenille Gates who will be our last speaker.  Good evening. My name is Joni Jenno and I am a State Farm agent on the Esplanade.  And I am here to address the issue of safe space using a building property right next to my business.  In the back row, I have brought some samples.  These are people that I support. These are people that share my views that have a vested interest as well as other neighbors from the Esplanade.  I fell in love with our iconic Esplanade in the early 1980s when my family would travel to Chico to visit my brother who was attending Chico State.  My husband and I made the decision to purchase the property at 1915 Esplanade in 2012.  The building had previously suffered a fire and was left as an eyesore for years.  And I was very happy to see the building.  I had no interest in the building until my husband and I made the decision to purchase it, demo what remained of the structure, and start fresh.  At the time, Enloe Hospital was undergoing their renovation and I chose to model my building in the same fashion,  honoring the historic influence of the avenues and restoring some of the lost beauty to the Esplanade.  I consider it a privilege to own a little piece of the Esplanade.  And I have worked hard to foster a safe, warm, and safe building. hard to foster a safe, warm, and welcoming atmosphere for my team and for all of my customers. The Esplanade has always had its fair share of transients, and over the years, my team The Esplanade has always had its fair share of transients, and over the years, my team and I have had to learn how to communicate with those that felt entitled to use my office as their restroom, snack bar, charging station, print and fax center, etc. We have cleaned up human feces, picked up discarded drug paraphernalia, found a gun in our bushes, dealt with their trash, and we've had to take numerous steps to safeguard  and we've had to take numerous steps to safeguard our workspace.  Recently, my team member was threatened while she sat in her car during her lunch break.  The transient told her that he was going to get her when she left her car  and that he was going to wait for her until she did, and he did wait for her.  Thank God I have a gentleman on my team who is able to intervene  and get my team members safely back into the office.  I installed panic buttons at each desk.  I hosted a workshop for my team on how to de-escalate and defuse encounters  with the drug-addicted and mentally unstable.  The straw that broke the camel's back is when a well-known transient  entered my office with a machete, infamously now known as Machete Mitch.  Within days of that incident, I installed a security door  so no longer can my customers freely come and go as they please.  I cried that day. This was not my Esplanade dream.  I want to be clear that I am not opposed to concerned citizens helping others.  I am opposed when the cost of that help is at the expense of law-abiding, tax-paying citizens.  I am opposed to the increased safety concerns for my team and my customers,  and I am opposed to inviting drug addicts into my neighborhood as well as criminals.  How the city proceeds will be very telling to our community and send a clear message.  Thank you.  Thank you.  To Neil Gates.  Good evening. My name is to Neil Gates.  I'd be happy to give Joni some more of my time because what she said was spot on.  I just learned about this today, actually.  It was at my business that I just opened on 1925 Esplanade,  and I'd like to keep the area nice,  and there are several schools and businesses nearby on Esplanade  that I'm sure wouldn't be happy,  wouldn't be happy,  with this coming into their neighborhood.  And I find it interesting that I find out about something like this by a flyer  and not in the news, online.  It kind of sounds like kind of a shady thing.  But obviously, we have a homeless problem.  We need to find a place to take care of them.  The busiest and most beautiful areas of our town, I don't believe,  are the best spaces to do that.  And so...  I'm sure many Chicoans would agree with me on that.  And I haven't had time to prepare an eloquent speech for you guys,  but I know that myself and a lot of hardworking citizens like me  believe the same way and would like a voice in this as well.  I appreciate your time and your consideration.  Thanks.  That was our last speaker.  All right. Thank you, everybody.  Appreciate that.  All right.  We'll move on to public hearings, of which we have none.  And then our regular agenda.  So 5.1, implementation of free holiday parking in downtown Chico.  We have a report from Brendan Autoboning, public works director of engineering.  There he is.  Mr. Mayor, on the advice of city council, I need to recuse myself.  All right.  I'm going to let you know when to come back.  There won't be much to come back for, though.  All right.  Go ahead.  All right.  Thank you.  Good evening, mayor, vice mayor, and city council members.  Item 5.1 is in response to your direction at the October 15th city council meeting  to implement a holiday-free parking program in all of downtown for the duration of the holiday season.  So for clarity, that would entail November, the day after Thanksgiving to Christmas Eve,  which is a total of 16 paid parking days.  Given the direction, we, as staff,  went back and evaluated different options and came up with two options for your consideration,  ultimately looking for your direction on one of those two items.  The two options we've evaluated include restricting the free parking program to on-street parking,  which includes two-hour parking limitations in the premium zone of downtown.  So, again, on all on-street, but that would not include parking lots.  We would still utilize the two-hour parking limit to enforce time-limited parking,  and issue citations for anyone beyond the two-hour to encourage the turnover of patrons of downtown.  And we've provided a fiscal impact of roughly $28,000 in lost revenue associated with that option.  Option 2 would include all on-street and all parking lots.  For your consideration, the estimated loss in revenue with that item would be just over $58,000.  For reference, on-street parking is currently at $1 per hour.  And the parking lots are at $0.50 per hour.  That concludes my report, and I'm available for any questions.  All right, questions?  You gave us two options here.  I'm curious if you have a preference on them or would advocate for one.  I think in evaluation of what I believe the intent of the council was,  was to encourage patrons to come downtown.  I think option one would be the staff recommendation,  but we wanted to give you another option should your intent be more than that.  Again, the 10-hour parking in the parking lots is a little harder to manage  if we're going to do something different other than just making it free all across the board.  I think from a staff perspective, there is concern fiscally in regards to the parking fund  that has been operating essentially in the red for the last four years.  Since COVID began.  And so taking the less fiscally risky option while providing the on-street parking  that has the turnover and the patron intention, I think would be the staff recommendation.  But again, we're here to implement the council's will.  My only concern is that if people pay for the lots but not for the on-street parking,  it's just going to be really confusing.  And then people are going to, I don't know, get tickets and then be upset  because they thought it was all free.  I want to weigh in on that, Mr. City Manager.  Well, the kiosks are going to be pretty clear about which zones are free and which zones are not.  Might somebody be confused?  Sure.  But it just seemed like the downside of having effectively unmanaged parking in the parking lots  was maybe not consistent with your goals.  Yeah.  Again, as I pointed out in an e-mail earlier,  I think we would lose some amount of parking to Chico State,  at least during the days that they are in,  simply because it would be a lot easier and more attractive to go to parking lots that are free  and effectively completely unmanaged because we have no way of managing 10 hours  when we only enforce for nine hours.  So we have a way of letting people know on the parking kiosk.  We have a way of letting people know.  We have a way of letting people know on the metered spots that take credit cards.  What will we do on the meters that do, in fact, not take credit cards?  They're still coin operated.  Those are not included.  So those won't be included.  Yeah, this is strictly the premium downtown zone is option number one.  So we could inform them right where they pay.  And I think even more importantly is on the app in the downtown core,  it's going to communicate the two hours free versus a lot that's not free.  Yeah.  Because that's a different zone.  And then after the two hour period, could they pay to extend that time?  No.  So two hours move.  Right.  Okay.  All right.  I think that answers all my questions.  All right.  How many speakers?  One speaker, Greg Scott.  All right.  Mr. Scott, welcome.  Seems like all I do is talk about parking.  Well, I appreciate Mr. Albani's staff report.  I think I don't think those numbers are net.  Because of the increase in sales revenue,  but hopefully sales tax revenue would hopefully offset some of that number.  The other thing is premium downtown in the zone.  I think it's 959288.  I believe 287 is the post office.  288s.  The other.  Anyway, and with the new technology, with license plate readers,  I find it hard to believe that we can't chalk the tires in a 10 hour parking lot.  The same way we chalk the tire, digitally chalk the tire in a two hour parking space.  And again, I'm the president of the Downtown Business Association.  So all of downtown is part of my purview.  So I have to stay within my purview.  I love that word, Andrew.  I believe that it would be better off for the city to offer the fruit parking,  including the lots, including all the on street parking.  And maybe with the exception of 290 and 291, which are south campus and second week of December,  I think they're going to be gone.  Students be gone anyway.  The parking revenue obviously is down, but so was every business in town.  So I think we're kind of beating the same dead horse here.  So I, as part of DCBA, our recommendation and request is that you look at option number two.  Thank you.  All right.  Thank you very much.  Can I ask a question, Mr. Scott?  Yes, sir.  Fire away.  I believe you're speaking for the whole DCBA for the most part.  Yes.  Here's my question.  Because I was ready to recommend staff's proposal and go, this makes the most sense.  It wouldn't take much for us to be like, just free parking for the whole month, let it go.  But the people that are going to be impacted, and I think what staff is, they're concerned about the cost.  I get that part.  But you're going to be impacted by the students parking in all those spots too.  And you're saying the benefit outweighs the cost.  Yes.  You think so?  I think so.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Anyone else?  We did mention when it was brought up, or Council Member Morgan mentioned, this can be done as an experiment.  We see how it works.  Obviously, if we allow students to park long term in that, then that impacts the experiment.  I don't know how prepared we are to even assess how well it works.  Because I can see that you make it free for people to park on the street, just like on Saturdays.  People are going to drive around in circles looking for parking.  And they're going to be spending longer looking for parking than they would have been working to earn a dollar to pay for an hour of parking.  I think there's more experimental value in recommendation number two.  But also, I think staff's correct that it's going to have negative impacts and lose us money.  Chico State's in session until what?  December 20th?  Probably.  Campus is closed November 28th and 29th.  And then the winter break is December 23rd through January 20th.  Yeah.  And then we could find out.  I was wondering.  Sean, you probably knew the answer to that question.  I go very rarely now.  But can I ask another question to Mr. Alboni and the skipper?  I'm not making this recommendation yet.  I'm just watching your faces.  So what if we, as a council tonight, say, okay, starting December, whatever, all parking in downtown is free.  Stop enforcing everything until after Christmas.  How big a deal is that?  Just turn everything off.  Wow.  Well, that wasn't part of the original.  I know.  Recommendation.  I'm just trying to go all the way.  Enforced time.  Yeah, you could do that.  But then you'd just be completely not managing the scarce resource that is parking.  But that's the challenge.  And when Mr. Scott was speaking, my thought was to go with staff's recommendation and  maybe next year when we have more time to work all this out, because we kind of threw  this at you rather quickly, give you more time to think about it.  But if the DCBA, I don't know what the chamber thinks about anything, but if the DCBA is saying,  we think it's worth the risk, is it easier for staff just to say, forget it for now, just don't do anything  and see where the cards go, or is that going too far the other way?  Well, I'd be surprised if the DCBA is in support of no enforcement of two-hour on the on-street parking.  Historically, what that means is you're going to have a lot of cars parked.  A lot more than two hours, including employees.  Yeah.  So how hard is two hours everywhere?  Free?  Everywhere.  Well, maybe this is the question.  In the lots and the downtown.  So in the lots, if you made the first two hours free, is there a way to do that with the parking kiosks that operate in those lots to give people a free two first hours?  It's had this yesterday.  And have them pay for the, yeah, I know.  You guys discussed it.  I mean, it's not impossible to do with the technology, I don't believe.  I think it goes back to maybe confusion of the patrons of now we're switching out all the signage to say two hours free parking.  So I think that might be the bigger challenge in that situation.  But operationally on the back end of the software, we would be able to reprogram.  I don't know that we'd be able to do it in time.  But that's something we can find out.  And if that's the will of the council.  I like the two hours free everywhere.  We have a color copier and we have a laminator.  Can we not put that together and make it work?  All right.  We have a motion and a second.  Motion from Vice Mayor Rounds.  Second from Council Member Morgan.  I'm going for two.  Two free hours in all lots downtown.  Okay.  In the downtown quarter.  Okay.  Given our lovely staff can actually make that work, but to the best of your ability.  Well, and that would slice that number a little bit in terms of the long-term parking.  I mean, it'd take two hours out of the long-term.  So it adds something to it, but it'd probably play a number somewhere in between proposal A and B.  Yep.  I could ask you what the length of, yeah, a bunch of technical questions you don't have at your fingertips.  So.  All right.  Further discussion?  All right.  Council Member Bennett.  Yes.  Council Member Morgan.  Yes.  Council Member Tandon.  Yes.  Vanna Verbeck has recused himself.  Council Member.  Yes.  Winslow.  Yep.  Vice Mayor Reynolds.  Aye.  Mayor Coolidge.  Sure.  Motion carries.  Six with one recusal.  All right.  Hey, I'm willing to try.  Yeah.  All right.  Council Member Van Overbeek will return shortly.  And then we'll get to the city's manager's report, which I'm sure is, what, 50, 60 minutes?  Right.  At least.  Your time to shine.  Yeah.  No report.  Oh.  All right.  So reports and communication 6.1.  No report from our city manager.  You got to get back in here before I wrap this meeting up.  All right.  So no city manager's report.  6.2.  Monthly financial reports are attached for information only.  6.2.  6.3.  Final map.  Pending community developer director's approval.  Information only.  Council Member requests.  Pursuant to APMP 1010.  Council Member's request on item B agendized at a future meeting after state and one.  The item would be a majority vote.  The council is needed in order for staff to agendize.  Do we have any Council Member requests?  Not necessarily the next.  We could deal with it on December 4th.  Yeah.  Sure.  Sure.  I have no idea.  All right.  Any?  Going once?  Going twice?  All right.  With that, we will adjourn.  See you Tuesday, November 19th.  If you haven't voted, make sure to do so.  Thank you.
