 Heather Pyle, M.D.: Hello everyone and welcome to today's training session. This session is a peak agenda training group session and our topic is an overview and administration of your peak system and also your Granicus platform.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: My name is Heather Pyle, I am a product training specialist from Granicus and I'll be conducting the training session today.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: You should be viewing my screen, I do have a brief PowerPoint presentation to start off with. If anyone has a moment, if you wouldn't mind just sending me a quick message or  Heather Pyle, M.D.: signal through the chat window that you are viewing my screen and we're ready to go. I do have everyone on mute currently and we'll get some quick instructions and overview of our meeting and then  Heather Pyle, M.D.: we'll be good to go, thank you.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: So this is your first of three or potential  Heather Pyle, M.D.: training sessions for peak agenda. These are group sessions, so all of us on the call today are representing different organizations.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: The purpose of this first session, which we have highlighted here in the upper left is an overview of your peak agenda management system and  Heather Pyle, M.D.: and then also the Granicus platform, which we also refer to as media managers. So we're going to be using our Granicus test platform to demonstrate this information.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: But we're going to go over how to configure a few things.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: And then we'll get started and we'll get started on what we're going to do and what we need to do and what we need to do and what we need to do and what we need to do and what we need to do and what we need to do and what we need to do and what we need to do and what we need to do and what we need to do and what we need to do and what we need to do and what we need to do and what we need to do and what we need to do and what we need to do and what we need to do and what we need to do and what we need to do and what we need to do and what we need to do and what we need to do and what we need to do and what we need to do and what we need to do and what we need to do and what we need to do and what we need to do and what we need to do and what we need to do and what we need to do and what we need to do and what we  setting up new calendar dates, processing and publishing your agenda to the public.  And then from there, for those of you who are using the Granicus streaming solution,  you will just attend these first three sessions. So if you're attending these, if you signed up  this week or other sessions, you will only attend sessions one, two, and three if you are streaming  with the Granicus solution. If not, then you get to join us for session four, which is the peak  minutes training and will be the session at this same time on Thursday, if you can join us,  or maybe you've scheduled it at another time. But again, this disclaimer right down here is  if you are going to be processing your minutes within peak, meaning you are not using our live  stream, those are the people who need to attend session four. But everyone else, you will have a  one-on-one session with your respective trainer to go over that information. So  this is for considered day one.  One of your peak agenda training. So this is for most everyone, maybe your first introduction into  your peak agenda management solution. So today, specifically what we're going to cover, we're  going to start off by logging into your domain. And as I mentioned, we are going to be using a  Granicus test site. So we'll start with an overview of the Granicus platform,  which is also referred to as media manager. So we'll kind of introduce those two different names.  So everyone is familiar with that verbiage. And within the Granicus platform,  also media manager, we're going to focus on archives and administration, some specific aspects from there.  And then we're going to navigate from the Granicus platform into the peak system.  So all Granicus clients have this Granicus platform. And then depending on their solution,  they navigate to other applications such as peak from the platform. So that's what we'll be doing.  We'll navigate there. And then once we're in the peak system, we'll start off with an overview of  the system for peak users. So we'll start off with an overview of the system for peak users.  So we'll talk about creating meeting dates and new items, and some basic information.  And then we'll move into peak administration. So in peak administration, we're going to go over creating new meeting bodies and types.  We'll talk about adding people and users. And we'll go over some of the default information as it applies to when your drafters create agenda items,  what information they'll be able to choose when they're selecting and creating those items and also creating approval workflow processes.  So we've got lots of great stuff to cover today.  I will mention, everyone in this session will get a recording. So we are live. I'll also show you where this recording will be uploaded into your Granicus platform  Media Manager site. So you can access this information and share it with your coworkers or review it in the future.  I am taking questions. So I do encourage you to submit your questions through the chat window.  As I mentioned, I do have everyone on mute. We are expecting at least a dozen people.  people to be on the call today. So we'll try to manage the questions through chat, but certainly I will be able to unmute you if needed.  But since we do have several different organizations represented in this training session today, I do ask that if you have a very specific question about your site's setup or design,  that you would direct those questions towards your project manager or your project trainer.  And if you're not sure, then go ahead and ask and I will direct you to the right information.  But we are trying to keep the questions just all very generally specific to this training because we are going to keep going over just more general aspects of the Granicus platform and your PEAK system.  So I thank you all for your time and participation today. So I'll minimize my PowerPoint.  And now you should be seeing the dashboard of the media manager site.  So I'm going to toggle over to a new window here.  So when you start off with your Granicus solution, your project manager or possibly your trainer will have sent the URL to your media manager site.  So that's going to be similar to what you see here, the name of your agency or jurisdiction, dot Granicus dot com.  So I'm going to be using our Granicus University site, but you will access your site through a web browser.  I'm using Microsoft Chrome. You can use Microsoft Edge or Explorer.  Or you can use Google Chrome.  Or сторонccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccc  on the mobile device sometimes just is not very receptive.  So thanks for those of you who have confirmed  that you can see the screen.  So some of you cannot hear, but some of you can hear.  And then I also did see a note that Kim was trying to log in,  but she's asking for a meeting ID and code.  So they, John, do you have a way to forward her,  your meeting invitation for access?  Because I do know Kim was listed on the roster  that she does have the same meeting credentials  as everyone else.  I'll make a note here that she is having trouble getting in  in case we need to reassign her to a different course.  And again, if she is part of your jurisdiction,  I'll send the recording to you.  And she also does have the ability to listen  to the recording as well.  So please send me a message, John, if need be,  and I'll check back with you  and just tell you that.  And I'll see you in just a moment.  And then Michelle, I heard that you cannot hear,  but it sounds like everyone else can hear me.  So I'll continue on and assume that that might just be  an issue on your end, but thank you for letting me know.  I'll mark that down as well.  There.  Okay, so for time purposes, we'll go ahead and move on.  So if you have not been given the URL  for your media manager site, again, you'll get that  from your trainer or project manager.  They may also have sent you your username or information  to create a password.  The username is typically your first name dot your last name.  And then once you've created your password,  you would enter that here, of course.  And then moving forward in the future,  if you have users who don't work in the system very often  and they forget their password,  they would always use this link right here.  It would email them a link to change their password.  So I'm going to go ahead and log in.  So I'm going to go ahead and log in right now.  So I've entered my username, my password, and I'm signing in.  And this brings me, I'm a system administrator directly  into my Granicus platform media manager site.  And so the name of my site is listed here.  So this would list your jurisdiction name.  And we're brought directly to the home tab  of our media manager site.  Now, as we talk a little bit further in this session  about the users that you're going to be creating  in the system,  we will, those users will all log into the system  in the same way that we just did.  If they're not going to be administrators  or need to reference anything within this site,  I will show you how you can make their login,  take them directly into Peak Agenda.  So it would skip over this specific aspect of your solution.  So we'll talk about that.  Within this site, media manager,  there are some specific details  that we're going to reference here that correlate specific,  specifically with your Peak Agenda Management solution.  So we're going to be focusing on the archives tab  and a few things in this admin tab today.  And then when you work one-on-one with your trainer,  you will be going into some more specific details  within all of these tabs  as it pertains to your specific solution and configuration.  So what I want to point out, first of all,  on this home tab are the upcoming events.  So what you're going to see listed here  are any meeting calendar dates that you have created.  So what you're going to see listed here are any meeting calendar dates that you have created.  So what you're going to see listed here are any meeting calendar dates that you have created.  in Peak for the upcoming 30 days.  So today is January 31st.  We don't have any meetings today,  but you can see that all of the meetings listed here  are for the upcoming 30 days.  And then off over here to the right,  you'll see that some of these indicate that an agenda has not been published.  So that indicates that this is just simply a calendar date within this system  and users are still creating and drafting items.  And then if this agenda has been published,  you will be able to click view agenda next to that,  particular meeting information.  So here on the home screen is your upcoming events.  These are calendar events that have been created in Peak  and it indicates over here whether or not the agenda has been published.  Now each of these meeting bodies are meeting bodies within your Peak system.  So these represent meeting bodies that I'm using in my system.  And each of these also correlates with an archive folder up here in the archives tab section.  So as administrators of this site,  media manager,  it is one of your primary responsibilities to manage the information in the archives tab,  specifically the archive folders.  So you can see the meeting bodies that were upcoming events.  You can see Manny's board or my board of review,  or board of appeals.  Each of those meeting bodies has their own folder.  Now I have quite a few meeting bodies in my system,  of course.  And thank you,  Michelle,  for the update.  I appreciate that.  I'll follow up with you after the meeting.  I'm sorry,  you can't hear.  Each of these individual archive folders represent a meeting body within your Peak system.  So if you don't have any folders created yet,  it will be your responsibility to create a new archive folder for each specific body.  You may have a couple already created in your system by your project manager.  Again,  or you may not have any at all.  Everyone is going to have two main folders.  So one is going to be a folder labeled,  training that your trainer will create for you.  It sometimes it's labeled differently depending on the person.  It might just say training or it might say Peak training,  but the recording of this session today is going to be uploaded into this folder on your media manager site.  So you can see these are different training videos,  but yours will have this recording labeled accordingly here.  And then the other folder that you all will have is the recycle bin.  And the recycle bin is really just going to be for those using our streaming solution or anyone who's going to have this.  Videos associated with their folders.  So if you are not going to use the video or streaming solution,  you may never have anything in your recycle bin,  but it is always there.  Just as an example,  if I select the city council meeting folder,  you can see the information in the folder off over here to the right.  These are all the recorded videos of those meetings.  And if I were to choose to delete one of these meetings,  for example,  if I select a meeting and choose delete the system automatically,  puts that video into the recycle bin.  So now if I scroll down here,  that test meeting I just deleted is in the recycle bin.  So this information is held for 14 days before the system automatically deletes it.  But again, it's only going to be videos that are stored in your folders that go into that recycle bin.  Now, a key aspect of these archive folders is really going to be telling the media manager system what view page,  we're going to be sharing your published agendas and minutes to the public.  So I'm going to open this city council folder.  So I'm just going to click up here and choose edit.  So you can see how this folder is created and how we're assigning those views.  So I've got my city council folder and then below here,  I've got the views that are assigned here.  So my system has several views available.  Yours may only have one default view that was configured by your project manager,  and you may have discussed having some additional views.  And we're going to go into some more detail about these views in just a moment.  But you can have more than one view page assigned to one of your meeting bodies,  and you can have several meeting bodies sharing the same view page.  So for example, I'm going to go back to my archives folder and pull up the architectural review board.  So I'm just going to click edit.  You can see that this review board is also using the same view page to publish information.  So this is the page that your published agenda is.  And as in minutes, this is how the system knows where to publish that information to the public.  So I'm going to come back here to archive.  So again, as administrators, you will be responsible for managing an archive folder,  and you will want to create a new folder for each of your meeting bodies that will be utilizing the peak system.  And I'm going to go through real quick just to show you how to create a new folder.  It's very simple. So I'm just going to click new here.  And then the basic information, I'm going to create a new folder for the library.  And then I'm going to post here and post here and post here and post here and post here and post here and post here and post here and post here and post here and post here and post here and post here and post here and post here and post here and post here and post here and post here and post here and post here and post here and post here and post here and post here and post here and post here and post here and post here and post here and post here and post here and post here and post here and post here and post here and post here and post here and post here and post here and post here and post here and post here and post here and post here and post here and post here and post here and post here and post here and post here and post here and post here and post here and post here and post here and post here and post here and post here and post here and post here and post here and post here and post here and post here and post here and post here and post here and post here and post here and post here and post here  template to select. But for the most part, when we're creating a new folder, we're really just  going to name it and then make sure we choose what view we'd like to assign. So I'm going to use this  past events view page as my example today. And then I'm going to click create folder down here  to save it. So really creating a new archive folder for your meeting bodies is going to be  as simple as naming it and then assigning the specific view page. So I'm going to click create  folder and then you'll see it did move on to another sub tab within the archive folder as  it relates to permissions and then there's also another sub tab distribution. I'm just going to  click through and save these default settings here and then more details will be provided about  that information in future training sessions. So for today we're just keeping it simple and we're  just talking about adding a new archive folder for each individual meeting body that you're  you're going to be using within your system.  And then you can see down here I created,  oh, I already had a library board.  I guess I created another one.  And then here, if I click Edit,  you can see that it's using my past events view page.  I'm going to take a quick pause to see if anyone  has any question about creating a new folder.  And then I'm going to jump over to  the admin section and show you the view page options.  So check my chat window.  It doesn't look like there's any questions now,  but I'll give you a moment and be right back.  Okay.  So continuing on from here, we've talked,  we've discussed the archives tab  where you'll add your folders.  I'm going to move next to the admin section.  And in this subcategories, move on to the views.  So this is where the view pages that we were just  discussing and that we were assigning to our folders.  This is where those options are  created and where those listings came from.  So  I selected the past events view to be used for my library board.  So from here, you may only have one view page listed.  You can create additional view pages.  You can actually have an unlimited number of view pages if you would like.  And we'll talk, you'll learn more about that in future training sessions.  But from here, the key point I just want to make is I'm going to double click  the past events view that I selected from my library board.  And this is going to launch from the past events view.  And I'm going to select the post events view and post events.  And then I'm going to select post events and post events and post events.  My past meetings or prior meeting content are listed below here.  So this is where my archive folder information will be.  So here's the architectural review board.  I pointed out is using the past events view page.  And here's my city council that we identified was also using this view page.  So my library board isn't listed here yet, of course, because these are the folders for prior meeting content.  And we haven't even created any content for the library board just yet.  So this information can be customized and configured in a later session.  I mentioned I am going to toggle back into it opened here in a new tab.  So I'm going to toggle back over back into my media manager administration.  For those of you who might be interested in those customizations, I will just point out to you real quickly.  Under the templates tab here, the default view is template.  So typically the view where your first view page is identified.  So I'm just going to click here and then come up here to edit.  And then you'll see there are some different subcategories.  So this is the template that's used for these following view pages.  So this is the template for my past few events and of course some others.  And the design section here is where you would be able to drill down.  And there are three different steps or categories where you can manage the layout, the content,  the design as far as text and coloring and different information that's listed here.  So for today, just going to give you a quick peek at this information.  If you are the type of person who likes to go in and play around with customizing some things on this view page.  But again, you will get some more details from your trainer one on one.  So again, we were under working in the admin tab.  We went to views to verify our specific view pages and I double clicked my past events view to open up a new tab.  And then we went to view to see what the public will view.  And then if you want to do any customizations of your view pages, that's under the different templates.  And then the default view is usually where your first few page was set up or configured.  And you would click on edit and then go into the design options.  So I'm going to pause just for one more moment. I don't see any other questions.  And this is the point in the session where we would toggle over into peak agenda.  So I will just make one quick point here about the users and group section.  We are going to come back and associate some information here under admin and users and groups once we get to that aspect within peak agenda.  So we will be coming back here a little bit further down in our training session to reference this.  But from now, the process for you to toggle into your peak agenda.  System is going to be from the apps tab up here.  So I dropped down here. You can see we're on the Granicus platform, which is this site that we're viewing now.  And then any other applications that your system may be using could also be listed in this screen.  But for today, we're just going to talk about peak agenda. So I'm going to click here.  This is going to take me directly into the dashboard of my peak system.  And again, if I wanted to leave peak and go back into my media manager system or also my.  Also known as the Granicus platform. I'll go back up to the apps drop down menu and click Granicus platform and it will bring me back to the media manager site back to my home screen.  So as administrators, you're probably just going to be toggling back and forth between these two applications.  But as I mentioned, when we set up users in the system, we can have them log in and skip over this site and be directed specifically to peak agenda.  So this is going to bring me back to the peak agenda.  And then we'll post those on here and post those on here and post those on here and post those on here and post those on here and post those on here and post those on here and post those on here and post those on here and post those on here and post those on here and post those on here and post those on here and post those on here and post those on here and post those on here and post those on here and post those on here and post those on here and post those on here and post those on here and post those on here and post those on here and post those on here and post those on here and post those on here and post those on here and post those on here and post those on here and post those on here and post those on here and post those on here and post those on here and post those on here and post those on here and post those on here and post those on here and post those on here and post those on here and post those on here and post those on here and post those on here and post those on here and post those  within the system. And then the create new tab is a shortcut where you can select to create a new  meeting calendar date or create a new agenda item. So we'll do a quick overview of creating a new  meeting and agenda item just to kind of see how that process works and also cross-reference what  that information looks like to your users and how you as an administrator are configuring some things  in the administration section. So peak agenda is comprised of the four tabs you see up here.  For all users and then administrators will have the admin tab here in the upper right. So only  users who are peak administrators will have this button up over here. So I'm going to toggle back  to the dashboard and just point out the information that will be seen here. So each user as they log  in will see the dashboard. The top two squares are shortcuts into the item section, but it is  referencing that specific user's total number of items created in the dashboard. So if you're  using a dashboard, you're going to want to make sure that you have the right number of items  created in the system. And then if that user is an approver, it would indicate the number of items  waiting for their approval. So clicking on either of these two boxes is going to take the user  directly into the items tab. So I'm going to click on my agenda item square and then I'm brought  directly to the items tab. And then in the categories here on the left, it's now displaying  all of the items that I have created in the system. If I go back to the dashboard and click on items  that need my approval, it takes me to the items tab as well, but directly to items waiting for my  approval, which I don't have any right now. But I can also filter through other items within the  system. So the top task or the top squares are going to take you directly into shortcuts to the  items tab based on the user. And then the four meetings that are listed here are the four upcoming  meetings placed on your agenda. You can, your users will be able to  scroll back to previous meetings or forward to upcoming meetings. And the information that's  going to be indicated here in addition to the date and the specific meeting body, it will include the  number of scheduled and approved items and then also the status of the agenda. So you can see  your agenda's coordinators will be popping up this indicator as opposed to it not being final.  And we'll be working more with the information on this shortcut when we get to session three.  Laura Benziger 14 сторон  Laura Benziger 14  Laura Benziger 14  Laura Benziger 14 If this is the first time you've seen the meetings tab, those of you who are going to be creating new calendar dates or processing agendas and minutes will spend a lot of time in this tab. It is color coded and can be created to look very pretty.  Laura Benziger 14  Laura Benziger 14  Laura Benziger 14  Laura Benziger 14  Laura Benziger 14 It is color coded and can be created to look very pretty. By default here, the column here on the left is an overview of upcoming and some past meetings.  of upcoming and some past meetings. And then of course, the calendar here in the middle is going  to show the current month's calendar. So since we're on the 31st, I am going to move ahead  to February. So here we are on the 31st. And then I just want to point out that when we first came  into our media manager site and we were viewing the upcoming events, which I have another window  open up here, I'm going to go remember these upcoming events, these 30 calendar dates,  these dates and meeting bodies here are, let me toggle back in, referring to all of these  meetings and calendar dates listed here up until the 28th. So this is a cross-reference to that  information. And then over here in this column, you do have the ability to drill down into more  specific details about each specific meeting. So we definitely talk more about this in session  three about the agendas, but I do want to show you real quickly how to add a new meeting.  And where there's going to be some administrator related information that you will be entering in  the system as it correlates with this function within Peak. So to create a new calendar meeting,  you've probably noticed we have a button right here that says add new meetings. You can simply  click right there. There is another way you can create a new meeting. You can click create new  and then click right onto meeting. Either way will get you to the window where you would create a new  calendar meeting. I'm going to click this one for now. So  once you select add a new meeting, this system will give you the option to create a one-time  meeting or recurring meeting. For an example, today I'm just going to create a one-time meeting. So  this list of meeting bodies that of course would be a required field when you're creating a new  meeting is a list from Peak administration. So we're going to be adding a new meeting body today.  Remember we created an archive folder for the library board, but that doesn't exist in here yet.  But for an example, I'm going to create a new city council special meeting.  So once I selected the city council special meeting, you'll notice some information  automatically populated below here based on the meeting body that I selected. The information for  the meeting location, the default meeting type. This is important because this relates to the  agenda that's going to be used for this meeting and specifically the different agenda sections  and the order that they will be in. So we'll be referencing this as well. So we're going to  select meeting type and select meeting type and select meeting type and select meeting type and  select meeting type and select meeting type and select meeting type and select meeting type and And then, of course, the agenda date is definitely an important category or required field. So we're just doing that by clicking on the mini calendar.  select meeting type and select meeting type and select meeting type and select meeting type and  select meeting type and select meeting type and select meeting type and select meeting type and  select meeting type and select meeting type and select meeting type and select meeting type and  or meeting, which clearly is probably not realistic for any of the meetings that you all have.  It may or may not be important for you to change this end time. The public does not see this end  time. They will only see the start time. But a quick note for anyone who is going to use the  Granicus streaming solution, it is important for you to change the end time to reference a more  realistic meeting length. This is going to tell your Granicus encoder how long to expect to be  recording the meeting for. And if you need to stop recording before the time you enter, or if  you need to extend this time, you always can. But we would want you to at least put a realistic  meeting length in this information here by entering a different end time. You do have the  option when you're creating a meeting within PEAK to enter an item submission deadline and cutoff  time. So as an agenda coordinator, if this meeting is going to be on February 10th,  possibly at the beginning of the week, I would want to be publishing my agenda so I can enter the  date and even a specific time that I want the system to stop allowing drafters to be creating  items. And we'll definitely go into more detail about that. Let me know if you have any questions  in the agenda section. But just to kind of give you a heads up, that's definitely a feature that  is used frequently within the system. And then under the description field here, you do have the  option to add a date. So if you're creating this calendar date, to add in some other information  that will be listed on the top of the first page of your report. For example, Zoom meeting  information is very popular to be entered into this description field, you know, or other  pertinent information as far as related to this meeting, such as, you know, if it was an emergency  meeting or something like that. So description, of course, is optional, but that's just some  examples of when you might want to enter a description when you're creating a new calendar  date. Now, from here, there is one less category, advanced settings. And I'm going to click within  here. Everyone who uses Peak does need to set one option here within advanced settings, and that's  going to be the view page. Now, the media options listed in with here, that applies to those of you  streaming with Granicus. So we won't go into those details today. But everyone does need to go into  the advanced settings when you're creating a calendar date and specify what view page.  So if you're using the ! So here's my February 10th meeting, going to open this.  сторон !  сторон !  сторон !  сторон !  сторон  сторон  сторон  сторон  yet, you could potentially leave that view page option off until you're ready. But just know that  is a very key point to creating a new meeting calendar date. You do have to specify the view  page in order to get that event displayed here to the public. So I'm going to go back in.  Pull up my meeting again. So I'm just going back down into my same meeting for the  10th. I'm going to come in here into the meeting details.  And here's where all of the information that I entered when I created the meeting,  advanced settings. And again, it's this view page. So this is a very common setting that  gets overlooked. So we'll definitely talk about this more than once just so to help you remember.  But that's a quick overview of how to create a new meeting calendar date within the meeting.  So it is a very simple process. But there are some default settings that as administrators  will need to set here that we'll be going over in a few moments that are related to creating  those new meeting calendar dates. So I'm just going to pause for a moment to see if anyone  has a question or a comment they'd like to add into the chat window before we move on. And I'll  grab a sip of water. I just saw your question.  Yes, if you're streaming and your meeting runs past the end time, the live manager solution will  pop up and prompt you to extend the meeting or you can manually extend the meeting. So if you don't  extend it, then yes, that will affect anything because it will stop recording and automatically  start uploading. So that is definitely something when we get to that point in your one-on-one  training session that we make sure everyone does understand the implications of that.  So let me know if you need any more.  Okay. So a couple more user tabs just to give you an overview before we move into the  administration setting. I'm going to click on the items tab. So this will talk in more detail  during the drafter and approver training session. So some of you might be joining me tomorrow for  that. But this is basically where you're doing a lot of searching within the system or pulling  up the items. So if you're doing a lot of searching within the system or pulling up the  items that might maybe needed for your approval if you are an approver. So I'm going to you can  categorize or kind of filter in what types of items that you are using that you're looking for  based on all of the items or just those that you've created or you're going to be approving or  previously approved. We'll talk a little bit about this FYI only. This relates to approvers  once we get into administration. But just a quick demonstration on how you can search for items  over here within the search window. Basically, you're just dragging and dropping items that you're  looking for. So you're just kind of drilling down and specific or filtering down information kind  of like you would be if you were shopping online and you were trying to filter down like your size  or the color or things like that. So I'm just drilling down the meeting body, the meeting date.  I can also filter in departments or even by item type. And then that's just going to start narrowing  down our search from here. So again, we'll go into this in a little bit more detail. But just to give  you an idea of what this items tab does or the purpose for it is. And then I also want to point  out that as administrators, again, what departments are listed here, you will be entering those in  administration and also the item types, you will enter those as well. So when the drafters are  creating items, the system does ask for them to specify what type of item it is. And this is very  helpful when we are searching for information in the system. It's a very common category to help  you search through information.  So,  I am going to also just real quick,  create, pull up how to create a new agenda item and run through those settings.  So we talked about, you can use this create new menu to add a new calendar meeting date.  And then if your drafters, they're going to choose add agenda item. Now my system,  did pop off over here to the right, some additional templates for different types of items that I create in my system.  So you may have talked with your project manager about having specific agenda item templates,  or if you're working with an organization, if you're working with an organization,  as well. Or you may be keeping it simple and you may not have any templates listed here. So that  just depends on the configuration of your system. So either way, these are usually labeled pretty  straightforward. So there shouldn't be any confusion about those. And I'm just going to create  a basic template for right now. So this is what it's going to look like for your drafters when  they begin creating an item. So I'm just going to slowly scroll down here so you can get an  overview of what the system is going to be looking for them to enter. So of course, it'll start with  their item title, some other information if needed. And then you'll notice that the system does,  you can choose required fields that have the red asterisk. As it relates to the information here  in the middle, as administrators, we just talked about the item type field in searching. I'll be  showing you in just a moment how you can create these different item types for your drafters to  choose. So the item type field is going to be the item type field. So if you're looking for a  specific item type, you can choose the item type field. So if you're looking for a specific item type  is not determining where the item will be placed on the agenda. It's definitely just making it a  characteristic of that specific item. So also the item ID, we'll be talking about in administration  how you can determine how you want your peak system to number all of the items. You can see  this one is using a prefix and a suffix, including the year. But you do have some different  combinations to schedule for or to set for the item ID. And then we can also use the item type field  here and select items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and  items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and  items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and  items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and  items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and  items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and  items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and  items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and  When we are creating these meeting bodies and the different body types we're using, the drafter will need to choose which agenda section they want to place this item on.  And here's my special meeting that I just created.  And then if I click in here, your drafters would choose which section on the agenda this item needs to be placed.  So we'll talk about how these options are made available to your drafters.  And then just a couple other things down at the bottom here.  You may have noticed this is where they will browse their computer to upload the supporting documentation.  And then down over here at the bottom is where they would click create to create the item.  And then check this box if they want to set up an approval workflow process.  And we're going to be talking about how these approval workflow processes are created in your system and how you manage them as well.  Once we get to admin.  So just to review, when we entered the peak agenda system through the apps tab here in the upper right, we started out in the Granicus platform, also known as media manager.  And then we, from the upper left-hand corner, navigated into the peak agenda application, which brought us to the dashboard.  And then we went through the meetings tab where we created a new meeting calendar date.  And then we went through our meeting plans.  And then we went through our meeting plans for our city council.  We reviewed the items information as far as searching.  We talked about the different departments and item type fields that you will create as administrators.  And then we also did go through when you're creating a new agenda item some of the fields that the drafters will need to fill in and how you'll specify that information as well.  So I'm going to take one more quick pause.  Thanks, Vicki, for confirming your question.  And then in just a moment, we'll move into the admin section.  Okay.  So moving on to the administration portion of our training session.  So this is the peak administration section.  So I'm going to click here.  And again, only administrators and peak will even have this button in their system.  If you don't see it, it does mean that you need to be a peak administrator.  And by default, once you enter peak admin, you are automatically in the meeting bodies section.  So this is listing all of the meeting bodies in your system.  You may only have one or two or you may not have any, but we are going to go over how you can create a new meeting body.  And then the different categories in administration are listed.  So we're going to focus most of our time today in the meetings category, people and groups, and a few things in agenda items.  So that's going to be our main focus.  And then I will just give you some brief information on the last three options here.  So I've selected the meetings category.  Notice I'm still looking at the meeting bodies.  And then if I drill down into the meeting bodies subsection, I'm still in meeting bodies.  So even though you kind of have to drill down, that's always the default section.  So I'm just going to take a look one moment.  Here's the city council special meeting that we created a calendar for earlier.  So I'm just going to come over here and click the pencil and review this information.  And this is also where you could edit your meeting bodies in the future.  So meeting bodies within peak are divided into two different details or sections.  The details that you can see here and also the members who are the office members or even possibly voting members.  So when you're working with your meeting bodies,  you've got those two different sections.  And so for my city council special meeting, if you recall, once I created this meeting calendar date,  the meeting location filled in automatically.  So that's where this information came from.  And that meeting time, that start time filled in automatically.  And then down here is the color.  So I don't know if anyone noticed that the special meeting was this pretty red color on the calendar,  but it is a little hard to tell, but it's outlined in white.  And that's how we know what color we've selected.  These are the only colors that you can choose from within the system are the colors listed here.  Now the information below here, contact person and description.  This is typically going to be for internal purposes only,  but you may be working with your project manager to utilize the description field for something else related to your reports.  But from here, the details are going to be those that specific information that auto populates when the user clicks to add,  a new meeting for this body.  And then from here, you are going to need to manage the members of that meeting body.  And the reason that that is important is going to is in regards to how you're processing your minutes.  And I know we talked earlier about some of you may be processing minutes here within PEAK.  And some of you may be using our Granicus solution.  And in that case, you would be processing your minutes in media manager.  But either way, it doesn't matter when it comes to your minutes, we do need to have all of your office members accurately.  So that's a good way to get started.  So let's go ahead and get started.  And their status would need to be active.  So you can come in and edit some of this information.  So again, a common task that you would have is maybe an office member's term has ended and you need to edit the information here.  So some people will just simply click the trash can and delete that office member.  And then they would just come up here to the top and click add member.  You can do it that way.  Or you can also click the pencil icon and edit the information from here.  So.  And then you can see that you can add a person or a person in the system.  So you can add a person or a person in the system.  Or simply delete them.  I am going to click add member just to show you how that looks.  So I can only pick the name of someone who is listed as a person in the system.  And we're going to talk about adding people in just a moment.  It's required that they have a status.  But none of this other information is required.  So you would, of course, want to indicate if they're voting.  So you would want to indicate if they're voting.  So if they're voting, you can click the checkbox.  You can assign an office rule and put their start and end date.  That's going to be for your own information.  But the system is, it's important to know that they are an active status.  The other statuses are going to be for your own information.  Active is a very important status for all of your members.  That's how the system knows who's going to be included in your voting and on your report.  So we're going to do some examples.  I'm going to create a new meeting body for the library board.  And we'll actually add some members into the system.  So you can get a better idea of what that looks like. But as in regards to meeting bodies that are already established,  you may need to come into the members and then simply edit their information or delete them if needed.  Now, in regards to the meeting type, this is referring to the meeting types listed over here,  which is our second category under meetings.  And the meeting type is specifically related to the agenda and the different sections on the agenda and the order that they're going to populate on your agenda report.  So I'm going to move on to meeting types and show you a couple of examples of this next.  And then we'll create an example meeting type as well. So if you remember, we selected the city council special meeting type.  So if I come over here to my pencil icon, I can edit this and this displays how this meeting is set.  And it does show all of the meetings.  I can edit all of the sections on the agenda.  And it does give me the ability to edit this information.  So because I'm working in administration, if I wanted to edit this specific meeting type,  anything that I changed here applies to all of the agendas that are processed in the future.  But you always have the option when you are working on an individual meeting bodies agenda on any specific date to manage these sections as needed.  So we can delete sections here permanently,  or we can delete sections here permanently,  or we can delete sections as we're working with that meeting and even add sections.  So again, more information that we'll cover during agendas in session number three.  But the key point that I just wanted to make sure everyone understands from here is the meeting types category is where we basically are designing the agenda and the sections listed here.  So we'll go through and add a new meeting type here in just a moment.  Talk about these different fields and titles.  But the last thing I want to mention is the meeting types.  So our meeting types are our meeting statuses.  In your system, you probably only have two statuses, draft and final, that you would associate with your agendas and minutes.  Some of our clients do need additional meeting statuses.  As you can see down here, most likely you're revising agendas or minutes.  And you might use different terminology for that.  So you can see there's all types of different ways you can talk about having an amended or revised agenda.  So if you needed to add any new statuses, you might add a new meeting type.  You're basically just naming it and saving it.  And then checking this box just indicates that it's final.  So if it's a revised agenda, it is still, of course, going to be a final agenda.  So your system should have draft and final.  If you need to add some more meeting statuses, you would do that here.  Notice you could potentially delete some of these if the trashcan is not grayed out, so this one has not been used in the system.  We could remove it, but once you use that meeting status, it can no longer be deleted.  So when you're working in PEAK, if you see any trash cans that are grayed out, that means the record or the field has already been used and cannot be deleted for that reason.  So now that we've kind of had an overview of this meetings section with the meeting bodies and meeting types,  I'm just going to demonstrate an example with using our library board of how you would create a new meeting type and a meeting body within the system.  So I'm going to start with the meeting type and I'm going to create a new type.  So my title, this is going to be my library board template.  Of course, you can name these however you would reference them.  And then the information listed below here. Again, this is information that you would be directed to.  In regards to your by your project manager. But here's where I would choose my archive folder.  That's the library board that I created earlier in Media Manager.  And then when it comes to templates, you may just have one template.  So it's really not going to be too difficult to pick. If you have more than one, again, your project manager will direct you which to choose.  So I've named my body type. I've indicated my folder and template information.  And then down here at the bottom is where I can start adding in and creating the different sections.  I want as part of this meeting body. So I'm just going to click add section and it's going to populate a title field for the section and then an optional standard text where you might want to add additional information.  Your font and your sizing. These are default settings listed over here in configuration.  You do have the ability to use any of these cutting and pasting tools, bold, italics, underlined, of course.  And if you wanted to add any color to your agendas, you can.  So you can use all these text editor fields here. I'm just going to start with a basic one.  So my first section is just simply going to be called to order.  And I do want this to be part of my numbering scheme. So I'm going to check this box.  And then here is probably one of the biggest aspects that causes some people trouble, including myself.  So when it's time for me to save this section.  Okay.  So you can see here we have a little save and cancel and a big save and cancel.  So if I click the big save. I'm not saving this section.  I'm just saving the information about this template.  So I want to click this little save to add the section here.  If you click that big save it it actually takes you back out to your media manager site and kind of puts you in kind of an endless circle.  So I'm going to click add section again.  We'll walk through that again.  I'm going to add another section to my meeting.  This time this is going to be my public comment section.  And this is an example where you might add some more standard text such as, you know, like, please limit your time to three minutes or whichever.  So I'll.  Or any other disclaimers that you might need to add for this particular standard text, you might add some information.  I want this to be numbered.  And again, I'm doing the little save, not the big save.  And now I've added my next section.  So once you're configuring this here, you do have the abilities to go back and edit the information.  Of course, I'll click my little save.  You can use the four point arrows to move the sections around and then you can always use the trash can.  So I'm going to add.  And then I'm going to add one more final section.  We're going to keep this meeting pretty basic.  That's an example.  And again, little save.  So now that I've created this template, I've named it, addressed my templates and folders.  I've identified my sections.  Now it's time for the big save at the bottom.  And now it's added into my meeting type column.  And then I've opened up the meeting and opened up the meeting and opened up the meeting and opened up the meeting and opened up the meeting and opened up the meeting and opened up the meeting and opened up the meeting and opened up the meeting and opened up the meeting and opened up the meeting and  opened up the meeting and opened up the meeting and opened up the meeting and opened up the meeting and opened up the meeting and opened up the meeting and opened up the meeting and opened up the meeting and opened up the meeting and opened up the meeting and opened up the meeting and opened up the meeting and  So of course the body name is a required field.  As we move through here, the abbreviation is optional that's not displayed anywhere.  The default meeting type.  So this is going to be where I'm going to choose my library board template that I just  created.  You do have the option to choose a different meeting type when you're creating a new calendar  date.  This just means it's going to be the default meeting type that automatically populates.  So library board is probably only going to use one template.  An example where you may have a meeting body that could toggle between different templates  is of course going to be our city council.  So you may be creating a new city council meeting but you want to use a special meeting  template that maybe has a different type of agenda versus a regular meeting template.  So I've got my library board meeting name, my default meeting type that I've created  here.  And then that default location.  So that's the information that automatically populates as far as an address or so whichever  information you would place here.  Of course you would enter the time.  And then the details below here, these are going to be, these may or may not apply to  your reports or your information.  Okay.  And we always recommend that you enter how many members will be on this board.  I'm going to have three and then of course choose your favorite color as well.  So the calendar dates for the library board are always going to be this color and then  I'll click save.  So I've created my meeting type for the library board.  Temperament and my meeting body.  And now if I came up to my meetings tab.  Temperament and meeting body.  and wanted to add a new meeting, when I specify that meeting, it's going to pull in all of that default information.  So here's the location I entered, my template, and here's where I could choose a different template if I wanted to.  And then also where I would add in my meeting date, and there's that start time that we added in.  So I'm going to schedule a library board meeting for Saturday, and when I create this information,  I don't know if anyone remembers that you always have to make sure you add a view page.  I chose the pretty teal color for my meeting on February 5th, so now it's going to look like that on my calendar.  I'm going to pause.  I'm going to pause for just a moment, check my chat box, or give you a second if you have any questions or comments.  And if not, from there, then we're going to move on to our people and groups.  Okay, so now we're moving on to the people and group sections, and we're going to focus specifically  on the people and group sections.  So I'm going to click here on people and users, and then touch on the departments.  So I'm going to click here on people and users.  And by default, this is going to show you all people in this system.  And there are two different types of people that you would use in this system or that you would have in the system.  One would be an office member who doesn't need access to PEEC, so they wouldn't need a login or a password or anything like that.  And then you have your main users who, of course, you are going to be assigning.  So if you look at this list here, you can see that some of these users, for example, Charlene here,  the system says she's not a PEEC user, but we've got a link if we want to give her a login.  So Charlene is an office member, so that's why she doesn't have a login.  So anyone that has this typically indicates that they're going to be an office member, and those that don't are users within the system.  And then you can see their username is listed here.  So if I toggle from this people category to just users,  the system actually pulls out everyone who does have a login.  So I'm going to click here.  This lists everyone who's a user in this system, but it also identifies their role, which is their permission level within the system.  So I'm going to do a couple examples of adding a person who's an office member and then also adding a person who is going to be just a user.  So you can see what that looks like as you're adding them in the system and how you're assigning them their roles or their permissions.  I'm going to go back to my system.  I'm going to go to my people section.  And I'm going to add a person.  So I'll click here first.  And adding a person is actually very simple.  You really are only required to give their first and last name and an email address.  So this is going to be an office member.  We'll put John Wayne in here.  And then, of course, the system does require an email address.  Now, since John Wayne is not going to be working in the system,  we don't technically, we aren't going to communicate anything with him by email by entering this person.  So we're going to put our first and last name and our first and last name.  And our first and last name will be our office email address.  But it is required.  So therefore, we are going to put an email address here.  Whether it needs to be a real email address or just a filler in this space, that is up to you.  But, of course, it is required.  So I entered my office member John Wayne's first and last name and his and an email address.  And I'm going to click save.  And so now his name is going to be added to this list.  I'm going to filter this list.  If I click on the name button here, it filters these alphabetical.  And then if I come down here, you can see here is John is entered.  And it's asking if I want to give him a login, which I don't because he's not going to have access to the system.  But what I do want to do is if I've added him as an office member,  I most likely need to go into one of my meeting bodies and make him a member.  So I'm going to show that example with John Wayne.  So we're going to actually move back up to our meetings.  I'm going to open my meeting bodies.  And I'm going to pull up my library.  Where's my library board?  Where'd my library board go?  So I'm going to click the edit button.  And then you remember we entered all of these details when we were creating this meeting  body, but we didn't enter the members.  So I'm going to click add member.  And then this list is a list of everyone who is in the system.  And I started typing John.  So it kind of brought me down to all the Johns in the system.  I am going to check that he is a voting member.  I do need to make his status active.  That is key.  And then if I want to list his role or office or enter a start and end date, I can.  But it does not have any impact on the system or any reports.  So if I wanted him to have one of these roles or if I wanted him to have a different role,  like say, for example, he's a meeting chair and we don't have a meeting chair, you can  just start creating a new name that isn't listed.  Okay.  So you can see that our office is listed.  And then if you click off, it automatically saves it into the list.  So if you want to use this office roles for your office members and one that you want  isn't listed, just go ahead and type one in there and it will automatically save it once  you click off from there.  So I won't enter a start and end date just for time purposes.  So I'm just going to click save changes.  And now you can see I've got John Wayne added into my system.  If you remember, I did tell the system that I do have three office members.  So I would just continue clicking add a member and I would be choosing from anyone in my  system.  And I just definitely want to make sure that I pull up their name and make them active.  So now I've got my three office members.  And if you remember here in details, this is really just for my own information, that  member size.  And they're 14 and 14 and 14 and 14 and 14 and 14 and 14 and 14 and 14 and 14 and 14 and 14 and  14 and 14 and 14 and 14 and 14 and 14 and 14 and 14 and 14 and 14 and 14 and 14 and 14 and 14 and  14 and 14 and 14 and 14 and 14 and 14 and 14 and 14 and 14 and 14 and 14 and 14 and 14 and  14 and 14 and 14 and 14 and 14 and 14 and 14 and 14 and 14 and 14 and 14 and 14 and 14 and  14 and 14 and 14 and 14 and 14 and 14 and 14 and 14 and 14 and 14 and 14 and 14 and 14 and  and I'm still going to type in their first and last name that is required. And now here for email  address, this is when we would definitely want to make sure that it is this person's email address,  because as a user in the system, this is what PEAK is going to use to communicate information.  For example, if this person were a drafter or an approver, if they needed to approve items,  this is the email address the system would alert them to. Now there is a recommended field,  a strongly recommended field that is not required that we would encourage you to fill in,  and that's the department. And the reason that we recommend specifying the department that this  person belongs to has to do with the approval workflows. And so once we move on to the approval  workflows, which is coming up here in just a few moments,  we'll talk about that in a little bit. But first, I want to make sure that you're aware of the  how users in the system, when they're creating items, if they want to start a workflow,  you may have a couple dozen or maybe hundreds of different workflows to choose from.  And it's a very easy way to kind of to filter out all of those options by department. So that's one  way that we filter things out. And that's why we would recommend that you would, when you add a  new user, specify which department they belong to. We'll talk a little bit more about those  departments and how it relates to those approvals coming up as well. So I'm going to go ahead and  I'm going to save this user. So I've added a first and last name, specified a department, and then  entered an email address. I'll click save. And now this brings me back to my all people list. I'm  going to filter here by alphabetical name and come down to Kim. So now this is someone that I do want  to give a login to. So I'm going to click give a login to Kim. And then down below here, you do  kind of have to scroll to see all the options here. The system is going to want me to assign a  request to the system. So I'm going to go ahead and click save. And then I'm going to go ahead and  go ahead and click generate a role for this person. And then I'll click generate login. So this is the  list of roles that are available in the peak system. And primarily, you're going to use one of  these three. So peak admin, of course, has all of the all permission levels and rights. Most everyone  on this call, I assume is going to be a peak admin. Agenda coordinator has maybe medium permission  levels. Those are the people who are going to be creating your meeting calendar dates, processing  your agendas, and also most likely your minutes.  And then drafters are the people drafting the items. And typically, we have approvers  in part of this group as well. You may have noticed that there is an approvals only group.  But a lot of times or most of the time, we do find that most all of our approvers in the peak system  will also be drafting items as well. So in that case, if you have an approver who will also be  drafting, they would get the drafter role within the system. So that's a good way to get the  role and they won't need to post items on the postccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccc  and send her a link where she can come back to the media manager site and create her own password.  So this is the point where I'm going to do a quick toggle back over into our media manager site.  So I'm going to come up here to the apps.  I'm going to toggle back over to the platform.  And we left off, we were here in admin, and I said, here's the users and groups,  and we're going to come back here in just a second.  So here in all these users, as soon as I generated a login for Kim Cook, it emailed her a notification,  but it also added her to this list of media manager users.  So you can see her name populated over here.  So when I created a login for Kim in Peak, it also created a login for her in media manager.  So those two users and groups and people and users speak to each other.  You can see her users.  Her username is first.lastname, and I'm going to click on her name to open up her user profile.  So you see it brought over her email address as well.  She's going to be creating her own password, but as an administrator, you could assign one to her.  We usually just let them create their own.  But here's one key piece of information I want to point out.  When Kim logs in, her default application is Peak Agenda.  So when she comes out to our media manager site,  she logs in, which I'm going to sign out here real quick just to show you.  So when your users come to your site to log in, so Kim's going to enter kim.cook and her password,  she is going to skip over this media manager site altogether and be taken directly into Peak Agenda  and be looking at her dashboard.  Oh, I timed that. I'm not logged in anymore. Excuse me.  Sorry for that glitch.  So I'm going to go ahead and click on the login button.  So again, it brings her directly to her dashboard page.  So I'm going to just review that real quick, how that works with your users where you're assigning logins.  So we started this process of our users in Peak administration, and we were working in people in groups and then people in users.  So basically what we did was we clicked add a person.  And we added in their first and last name and email address and their department, of course.  And then from there, we selected that we wanted to give that user a login.  And that's how we determined  which role they were going to have within the system and then clicked generate login to allow them to create their own password.  And once we clicked generate login, then it also created a login for them in the Granicus platform.  So I'm toggling back here again.  Under admin and user groups.  So it created their login here and it also made the Peak agenda their default platform.  Now you might be creating users that maybe you want to be administrators and if that's the case, you may want their Granicus platform.  You may have other applications you're using to choose from or you may not.  But again Granicus platform is probably what all you have when you log in and then Peak agendas the one that skips overnight.  and it takes you directly there. So I'm going to toggle back over into my peak agenda system.  And I'm going to go back into administration and just point out a couple other things.  In the people in group section, we talked about assigning a department to each user. So this is  where you will manage all of the different departments that are in the system. So when  your drafters are creating items and they're specifying the requesting department, this is  the list they will have to choose from. And when you're adding a new person, then of course you  would assign them to one of these departments. It's easy enough to create a new department such as  the library board or library group, library department.  You could add any other abbreviations or descriptions in these fields if you want,  but that's only for your information. I'm going to click save.  And then of course you can manage these departments by editing them or clicking  the trash can and deleting them if you need to. So editing is really just editing the name of  the department or adding any other information that might be useful for you. So that's the  department there. So I'll pause for one another moment, check my chat box, and then we're going  to move on to the agenda items. And this is going to be our the final section that we're going to  talk about today. I will just make one other quick reference. You probably noticed I skipped over  group roles and access. So those are more detailed information that may or not apply to everyone here.  So if they do apply to you, your trainer will go over that information with you.  Okay, so now we're moving on to the agenda items category.  And this information is going to pertain specifically when your drafters are creating new  items, what information is going to be available to them when they are creating the that new  information. So we kind of pointed out these fields as we're reviewing the create new tab up here. And  one piece of information that they do have to enter when they're creating an agenda item is  the departments, which we just talked about. But I'm going to toggle here under agenda items. I'm  going to select items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and items and  or an ordinance or a report. And administrators can manage these just like you would most  everything else that we've been looking at in PEAK, either by clicking the pencil tab  or clicking the trash can. And then you can always add a new record from here. So  this part is pretty straightforward. Adding in your different item types. Below that is going  to be your item ID. So this is specifying how do you want your PEAK system to identify with a  number all of the new items you're creating. So you've got the ability to have a prefix,  a starting number, and a suffix. You can simply go with numbers and not populate this information.  Certainly if you're going to utilize the year as part of your item numbering, you will need to  make a note to come back into this section. Again, it's agenda items, item IDs, to update that  suffix. And then you can also add in your item ID. So this is specifying how do you want your  item ID. So this is specifying how do you want your item ID. So this is specifying how do you want  or information from there. So this is how we're tracking items in the system. And basically,  it's a unique item number for each agenda item that's created. The drafters cannot change the  item numbers. It's assigned after they create it. It's basically just taking the next item number  in order. So moving on from the item numbers, I'm going to move down to item approvals. And  in regards to item fields and item templates, again, those are the same item fields that we  are advanced applications that don't apply to everyone here. So  if you're using some more advanced features or templates  with your items, those would be discussed one on one. But we're  going to move now to the item approvals because this is that  we do spend a little bit of time on this particular section,  going over how the approval process works in peak and how  you would create these approval workflows. So as you can see in  my system, I have all of these different approval workflows,  this is quite a list. So when we were talking earlier about  filtering for each drafter, what approval workflows they can see  and use, we talked about filtering them by department. So  instead of having to sort through this list of approval  workflows, we could make it so that only people from a specific  department will see that workflow. We can also filter  them so only a specific user can see a workflow. Or we could just  make them available to everyone. So for example, if I click on  this bid workflow here, I'm going to come up here and click  Edit. You can see that this workflow is specified by  department. So only users where that person was created as part  of the buildings and grounds department can see this  workflow. Or if I come down here to Kirsten's workflow, you can  see this is based on user. So only this user will ever see  this workflow when they're adding or creating items. And  then if I go to a workflow that everyone can see, this is the  to a workflow that everyone can see, this is the workflow that  everyone can see, this is the workflow that everyone can see,  I'm going to pull up this global workflow, you can see I don't  have a user or a department selected. So that just means  it's available to to everyone to view it. So there's three  different ways you can view filter what workflows your  drafters will see. And you would basically do that as you are  creating a specific workflow. I'm going to go back to the bid  workflow real quick and just kind of go over a few things on  how this was created. And then we are going to create  a new workflow for our library board. So as we scroll down here,  you can see this particular workflow has three different  stages or phases. So a typical workflow in peak usually has at  least two, maybe sometimes three or four different phases. And so  or depending on how you would like to label them, you can call  them stages. So each stage or phase can have as many approvers  as you want contained in it. So in this example, one of the things  we've seen here is we've seen here on the сторонccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccc  unless you've communicated that with them outside of the system.  Once Seth Kaplan approves this item, since he's the only person in this stage, then it will move down to stage two.  So now both Amy and Rhonda can be reviewing and approving this item at the same time.  So if Amy approves it right away, but Rhonda takes a couple of days,  we are still in stage two and the people in stage three still are unaware that this item exists in the system.  So the system is going to wait for everyone in this stage to approve the item,  and then it will move on to the next stage and notify those people by email.  Now, you may have noticed that the approvers in this third stage, this particular approver, Jay Jones, has an eye above his head.  So that indicates that he is an FYI approver.  So in the piece,  the peak system, there are two different types of approvers,  an approver and an FYI.  And the difference between the two of them is whether or not they're going to be editing and actually taking action on the item,  or if they're just being notified that this item exists.  So all of these other people, they are approvers.  So their responsibility as approvers is they're going to have to review it and take action.  But Jay, because he's only an FYI,  he's not going to be able to do that.  He is just going to get a notice that he can view this item in the system,  but he wouldn't be able to edit anything or even take any types of an action.  Now, there is an exception when we're going through this approval process because only the approvers in the active stage can be taking actions.  However, those of you who are system administrators and for those, you know, anyone who has other permissions,  they can take action or address these approval stages at the end of the process.  So, ideally, we would want each of these individual approvers to be taking their own actions.  But as administrators, you definitely will talk about that during the drafter and approver session.  What permissions that you have to not override, but to take action in their place.  So you do have the ability when you're reviewing these sequences to edit anything.  So another primary responsibility that you will have is you might need to,  if a new person is coming in,  you might need to change out this department reviewer.  So let's see, Vicki, I see you have a question.  So I'll just one more moment and I'll and I'll check that for you.  So I'm going to click the edit tab here.  So I'm going to I can't remove anyone unless I've added another one.  So I'm going to add an approver. And here's where I'm going to pull up.  Kim, who I added. So I'm going to add her and then I can remove Seth.  And then I'll click the green checkbox.  And you can see I've edited her. So you may spend some time in here.  Once you've got these sequences created or these workflows created editing who the people are as people come and go.  You can use a four point star to rearrange the order if you want to rearrange the phases.  And you can even delete an entire phase if you want.  I will also point out that once your drafters selects this specific workflow,  they will be able to edit this information on the front end as well.  So the drafter can determine if they don't think Kim Cook needs to be part of this.  They could remove her and put a different person in this spot or they could decide to edit or delete the next stage.  Or they might want to make Jay a regular approver instead of FYI.  So we'll definitely go into some more detail about the permissions and what all you can do with these sequences.  For the most part today, we really just wanted for you to get an idea of where this information is set up in administration.  So it's agenda items, item approvals.  And we're also going to go through and just add a workflow example.  So I'm going to pause just for a moment here, Vicki, and check your question and see if anyone else has a question.  OK, thank you. So I see your question for your boards and committees.  So if your members want to view the agendas and minutes, most likely what you will be using once you  publish your agendas would be the application.  I legislate and that allows your committee members or your office members to log into that separate application and view the published agenda and actually make notes and bookmarks to prepare for the minutes.  So we wouldn't typically give members of boards or committees access to this peak system to actually come over to the meetings.  We would allow them to use the I legislate application.  For that process.  And in the agendas training that session three, we do usually have enough time to talk about that.  I legislate application. So when you're publishing agendas, how you would get that to your board members.  So please let me know if you need me to elaborate on that question.  And I should I just I guess I do want to remind you that I legislate shows your upcoming agendas, not your minutes, of course.  You could.  Direct them to your view page if they wanted to see their minutes.  But also, I'll just remember I'm going to come back up here to my people in groups.  You could give them a login and then just make their role as view only if you needed.  So if you remember, if someone has a role in this system, so I'm going to click here on users.  Here's where it showed what role they have.  And so.  And so if I wanted to, for example, change, I'll just click on the pencil here.  I can specify that their role was view only and save that.  So hopefully that answers your question.  If you set them as view only within the system.  One other quick thing to point out is that they can see the agendas and minutes they can view them in peak, but they would have to be in final status.  Of course.  So if you're still working on your agenda, you haven't published it or set it to final, but still in draft mode, they would not see it yet until you change that status.  But we'll definitely clarify that some more for you.  Thanks for confirming that that answered your question, Vicki.  Perfect.  So I'm going to come back to my agenda items.  And then the next thing we'll do is as we're kind of getting more towards the end of wrapping things up is I wanted to go through and just add a new workflow from scratch, just so you can see an example of starting from the beginning.  So we've been reviewing this bid workflow and how this was originally created and how you could come in and edit it and maybe swap out the approvers or anyone who's in here.  But now let's actually add our own workflow from scratch.  I'm going to click here.  One moment.  I clicked too many things and I talked too much.  So now I need to go back.  Okay.  So I'm going to go back to my agenda item.  My helper here on the other line might need to tell me why I'm not starting on a new workflow, but that's okay.  We can work with this one.  Maybe it's checked down here.  Sorry, one moment.  So we're adding a workflow.  Okay.  So from here, first, what we're going to do is we're going to.  Oh, it's a glitch.  Sorry.  I have a little ferry on the other end of the line who is helping me today.  And he says my system has a glitch.  So you know what I'm going to do.  I'm going to toggle back out and come back in.  Sorry.  Sorry, this is actually good. So just so you know, if that happens, just come back out to your platform, come back into your peak, we'll go back into admin again.  So what we're doing under the agenda items is we're going to try to create a new workflow under item approvals.  And  it still doesn't like me, but that's okay. We'll  I wonder if I can delete this whole one.  I might  sign in again completely.  Well, I know everyone knows how to get back to where we were in our agenda items.  Oh, I need an owner. Okay.  This specific one keeps coming up for  I'm going to assign this to a user.  So we talked earlier about assigning it to a user, a department or he click clear it would be assigned to everyone. You can add an approval description and from here I'm just going to  Okay, so we're starting here where we're giving our phase a name so I'm just clicking here. You can name it phase one stage one level one, however you prefer it but phases and stages are most common.  And then you're clicking Add approver and you're specifying if you want them to be an approver or an FYI only remember approvers take actions, such as approve or delegate and can edit the item.  FYI is simply just going to receive information only. And you can add as many approvers within the same phase as you want so I can continue adding more approvers in this phase, whichever would be realistic to your system.  And then once I click the checkbox, then I've added from here.  So I've got my first phase if I come down here. I can add another phase.  And add in my proof approvers as well.  We only have  one approver in the next phase, and you may want to put your FYI people in the last phase.  And once I add an FYI remember they'll.  And once I add an FYI remember they'll.  have that  information next to their name.  And then once I've configured all of the phases of this workflow, then I'll click Save.  So just to review that again I'm going to try it one more time.  Okay.  Let me check to see if there are any questions in the queue.  And I'll take one more quick break. And then I'm just going to give you a few pieces of information about these last few options here that we really aren't going to go into any detail.  And then I also want to give you some information about our.  Support Center, and where you can get more access to the information that I provided to you today.  Okay, so from administration we've worked through our meeting bodies types and statuses.  Through people in groups we talked about people and users and also the departments that you've worked with.  So we've worked through the items that you would assign to them.  And then agenda items we went through the item types, IDs and approval statuses.  And then down here we'll talk more about minutes if you're going to be part of session four for the minutes process in PEAK.  We'll go into this then if you're streaming with Granicus, don't worry about this one.  You all probably don't have templates. This is more an administrative, a Granicus administration setting.  And then under configuration here you'll see some information about your.  Your.  Agency address and name. And then there are some additional settings here related to some permissions that you might discuss with your trainer.  Or maybe even like your text editor settings.  This is where the fonts and the size that you were utilizing for those agendas and reports is designated.  So there's some more information in here as far as how your settings are defaulted.  Again, you'll go into some more default and configuration with your trainer at that point.  So now at this time, I do want to give you a few more pieces of information about the support that you have within Granicus.  Here in PEAK, you always have the help center button up here at the top.  So I'm going to click this help center button and this is going to open a new tab in my browser, which takes you to support.granicus.com.  And you can always just go there directly if you want.  In fact, I'll put this in the chat window.  Once you're here.  This does display on this landing page all of the Granicus solutions, but your PEAK solution is down here.  So you'll click here on PEAK and this is going to give you an overview of some specific most commonly asked or frequently asked questions.  You can type in the search box here to search through our PEAK system.  And also you can come down here and sign up to get release notes or review release notes on the information.  So I got to here again when I was in PEAK.  I just clicked the help center and that launched support.granicus.com.  And then from here we did have to drill down into the PEAK solution.  So back to the main page, we had to go here to PEAK.  But I do also want to point out to you that Granicus does have several webinars.  We do send out or update the list of upcoming webinars on a monthly basis.  So from this webinar tab, you can see.  If we had any PEAK webinars coming up, they would be listed here under Gov meetings.  But we also have a library of past webinars.  So if you're looking for more information about your system, you can click here on the webinar library and and search for some PEAK webinars there as well.  So there is one other help section within PEAK.  You may have seen a guide me button.  And.  If you see this guide me information.  It's going to pop up and start walking you through different areas within that tab.  So this is information here.  And if I click next, it's just going to keep walking me through the different settings.  Within this system.  So guide me is contained within the system pops up and give you that information or the help center.  Then it's going to allow you to type in a more detailed question.  And then.  You can see that the questions are going to be answered.  And then you also have the grant.  Support center as well.  So from here, I'm going to toggle back out to the Granite platform.  We haven't been in here for a while.  This is where we started.  And I'll just.  Check to see if there are any other questions.  Take a quick pause before we wrap everything up.  Okay.  So any other comments that you'd like to send over the chat window.  Please let me know.  Again, I appreciate everyone's time and participation.  Great questions during this session.  And as a reminder, the recording of this session will be uploaded to your media manager site.  In the archives folder labeled training, or sometimes it's labeled peak training.  And then once you drill into that folder, it will def it will list the peak overview and administration session.  And if anyone is attending.  Tomorrow's sessions or Wednesday or Thursday.  I look forward to working with you again.  And I appreciate everyone's time again.  Thanks. I look forward to working with you again. And I appreciate everyone's time again. Thanks. Have a great day.  Thank you. Okay.  you
