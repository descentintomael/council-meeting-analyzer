Speaker card announcement. Anyone wishing to address the council on any item listed on the agenda must first complete a speaker card, which can be found at the back of the chamber. Once completed, please turn the card of the city clerk to my left, to your right. And speakers are taken in the order the cards are received. And once the speakers begin their comments, no additional cards will be accepted on that item. We ask that you not applaud any particular item on the agenda or boo as we try to discourage folks from feeling as though their opinions are not welcome. Thank you. Thank you, Mayor Coolidge. The city attorney, city manager, and staff met with the city council in closed session on the posted agenda items. No action was taken and direction was given.

And on behalf of the City and the City Council, we'd like to thank you for your service. It certainly does not go unrecognized in our community. And, you know, there's so much that each of these committees has done and really brought forth to the City. We would not be able to do all that we do without your help and support. And thank you. And, you know, sometimes those committees are as controversial as this Council. So, and have dealt with issues the same way. So we truly appreciate you giving your time and effort and energy. And the community thanks you as well. All right. We move on to the Consent Agenda. All matters list on the Consent Agenda are to be considered routine in nature and enacted in motion. Do we have any Council disqualifications or no votes? Speakers? We have one. All right. Three minutes. James Hutchinson. Those of you who attended the meetings last year know about this time of the year I spoke on several occasions, both times in June and July 5th, when the final recommendation on the on the on the board was to And I spoke about the concerns that were brought forth. I spoke concerns about the direction they were headed in. I spoke concerns about whether they were on top of what was going on. I spoke concerns about alternate methods of finding out drug spreads. None of those things were considered or implemented by this board. Not surprising. Because they didn't want to get ahead of the game. They wanted to follow the leader. And that's what I've accused them of. If you look at the grand jury report that was written after I spoke on these things, have all of you read it, I hope? I'm not so sure they have, to tell you the truth. But that's not new. The grand jury wrote a report about them. They looked at it. They asked them to file on it. If you read that report, you'll realize that, again, we're behind. We're behind. Other places are leading. We're not leading. We're following. We're saying, okay. We prevented this many deaths with NorCal. Guess what? How many people got addicted? Not mentioned here. I'm concerned about the direction this organization is heading. You're not hearing about who's in charge, who's running it right now. You know who it is. You're also not hearing who's the head of the committee that is supposed to be running this, which the police chief is the head of this committee. Because this is all secretive. There's no transparency here. There's no transparency in the grand jury information. I'm right here in front of him. I've read it too many times, in fact. There's a reality here. And that is, why are you approving a budget that is just a rubber stamp? The police chief presents the budget. Not a staff member. Staff member didn't go back and look through the grand jury report and say, hey, have they been meeting these needs? We don't see a report from the outside. We only see the inside. Somebody who's already on it, the police chief. He's already on the committee that runs it. He's already part of that. Is he going to say, hey, you know, we're going in the wrong direction here. Maybe we ought to change this budget. You don't see on this budget who wrote this budget. How many of you in the audience know who wrote this budget? Most of you probably don't. And that's what happens here. There's no transparency because they want to keep it a top secret. This is not the end. This is not supposed to be the district attorney's private police force. Instead, it's turned into it, and we're behind the scene. All right. Thank you. And that was our last speaker, yes. So, entertain the motion. Move to approve. Motion from the Vice Mayor Reynolds, second from the Councilman Moore. When you're ready. All right. Council Member Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness the kind folks who actually received recognition for their commission work. You're by no means held here, so if you want to sneak out, we'll give you a minute to do it. You guys have attended enough meetings for us that we don't want to keep you here longer than you need to be. So thank you again. All right. And as they're heading out, we'll do business from the floor. Members of the public may address the council at this time on any matter not already listed on the agenda. With comments being limited to three minutes or as determined based upon the number of speakers, the council cannot take any action at this meeting on requests made under this section of the agenda. How many speakers? We have none. None. So we'll do zero minutes for that and move on. Oh, did we have one? Excuse me, I wasn't aware of your format to use supply cards right now. Oh, I'm sorry. Did you have an item that's not already on the agenda? I'm sorry, my fault. Okay. I skipped an item. So business from the floor. Okay. We have an additional request from somebody in the audience. We haven't started yet, so sure. So our first speaker is James Hutchinson, followed by Nicole Nava. All right. How many speakers do we have total? We will have four. Four. Okay. Three minutes each. We've got two more out. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right, go ahead. Let's talk about fentanyl for a second. It's not the number one killer in Butte County, meth is. But nevertheless, there's a thing with fentanyl, and a thing you're not paying attention to. Fentanyl right now is not just being seduction of kids with colored candies. It's a cocktail. It's a cocktail mixed with drugs. The latest, you familiar with Trank? Does that ring a bell with you? It should. If you're not up on it, you're having a problem with what's going on. Over a month ago, it was announced by our own government that Trank was one of the big killers. And it's a killer because of this. You mix Trank with fentanyl, and what do you got? You've got two killer drugs. And when you take your Norcap, spray it in your mouth, thinking it's going to save your life because there was fentanyl in there, it doesn't. It does not automatically save your life at all. Trank is a dangerous drug that's been out there. It's another drug that I pointed out before a RAND report that talked about things that start back east and spread this way. This was another one that came that way. It's a dangerous, it's an animal tranquilizing drug. It's for horses. It causes deadly reactions. It's for people with skin. People who use it alone, without the fentanyl in it, have severe problems, dangerous problems. And now it's part of the fentanyl cocktail. And that's what we're getting, cocktail after cocktail. Norcap is no longer the solution to all overdose situations. A number of cases, it will not have any effect. We have no way to measure for it. We have no way to test for it easily. And we're not ahead of it. If you're not already talking about this, if you don't already know about it, you're not ahead of it, you're losing. It's here. It's already been announced. It's already been seen. We've already seen it. Three days ago, NPR ran a nice little piece on it. It's a wonderful radio piece, but the research was good. And they talked about something I talked about to this council about. It's called measuring what's in the waste. And what you do, and I brought it up, I brought it up at the time, was you measure for other drugs in the waste. It doesn't identify the exact place where the drugs came from, but it tells you what district these drugs are being used in. And if you have this out there, instead of waiting for people to die, instead of waiting for deaths or near deaths, instead of waiting for people to get addicted to highly addictive fentanyl, and Trank is pretty addicting too, so where are we? What have we done? We're behind again. And I keep trying to make this point, but you don't get it. Our next speaker is Nicole Nava, followed by Sash. Good evening, council. Nice to see you all. I'm here to talk a little bit about Measure H. I know you've already marched down the path a bit on that, but I did hear some things out and about that concern me a little bit, so I just want to circle back and make sure that everyone is on the same page. With what the public asked for, which was of course roads number one, which I'm hearing that is, and that's great. Public safety, hurray for the police department that got some more much needed funds to be able to retain staff. I'll put a pin in that item because what I'd like to say in addition to that is that we did have those vacancies, and I believe it was reported out on the chief making note of it, and I would really love to see us get some traffic patrol. The accidents are not good. I know that. We're having fatalities. It's scary. People matter. So we need to do better in that regard. Everyone knows it's a free-for-all and takes full advantage of that and don't think through consequences. So that's something. We had a very scary incident happen to a female up in Upper Park, and it was a sexual assault, and that is also not okay, and we do not have enough park rangers. There is a lot of parks to cover, a lot of acreage, and the couple that we have, we have a lot of parking spaces, trivalently, but that is not enough. I would love to see you fill that up to capacity. To me, five people, and I've talked to a lot of people, five is good. I mean, optimal to me would be like seven, but five would be great. We need to keep things safe. We need to keep, you know, code up, and you can't have enough people to be able to jump out of their pickup and warn people, hey, that's not allowed here. Hey, I need you to slow down. You know, hey, you're going the wrong way. We need attention to that. And then Upper Park gets really thin. So I think there's some opportunity there. The parks is another area where we're going to put funding, and I think that's good and important. It is our little crown jewel, as we always say, along with our downtown, and there are some rehab things, I think, that are long overdue, so I really hope we stick to that and that that can get done more quickly. I think you're going to take flak in the paper in other places for things, and I would love to see that. I would ask that you try not to sway from the mission that the public gave you with some negative Nellies, because I think if we improve those things, other things will follow. I don't recall hearing a big charge be to put those funds toward housing, and I heard a tale that that might be a thing, and to me that is not for the city. We were dealing with infrastructure. We're way behind, and I hope we can keep our nose down and stay on that. And I concur with the other gentleman. There's a lot of issues with drugs and things. There's overdoses. Having more police would be great. Having behavioral health, have a 24-7 mobile crisis unit, would be great to partner with them again. Thank you for your time. Our next speaker is Sash, followed by Ken Robinson. Good evening, Council. Speaking of circling back, I'm going to really circle back. This is an article that is just a summary for the abstract of a journal from Virology Journal, June 5, 2022. Adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccines and measures to prevent them. Recently, the Lancet published a study on the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines and the waning of immunity with time. The study showed that the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines and the waning of immunity with time. The study showed that the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines and the waning of immunity with time. was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was recommendations, frequent COVID-19 booster shots could adversely affect the immune response and may not be feasible. The decrease in immunity can be caused by several factors, such as N1, methyl pseudoneuridine, the spike protein, lipid nanoparticles, antibody-dependent enhancement, and the original antigenic stimulus. These clinical alterations may explain the association reported between COVID-19 vaccination and the shingles. As a safety measure, further booster vaccination should be discontinued. I'm just going to read that again because maybe somebody missed some of these points. Recently, the Lancet published a study on the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccine to help lift the immune response to the immune response to the coronavirus. COVID-19 vaccines and the waning of immunity with time. The study showed that immune function among vaccinated individuals eight months after administration of two doses of COVID-19 vaccine was lower than among the unvaccinated individuals. Lower. Think about that. Our next speaker is Ken Robinson, followed by Devon Jones. Yes, I'm Ken Robinson. I own 931 West 5th Street. That building's directly across the street from Depot Park, the Depot Park disaster. I've talked to a couple of other landowners and managers around there. They have told me that promises have been made by the city that have not been kept. You probably think I'm coming here to talk to you from an economic perspective, but this is a family and personal issue. I've got Rich and Jacqueline Hartman. You may know Jacqueline. They work days, nights, weekends, trying to get a business to work there in that environment. On the corner is poor Gilberto and Carla. Trying to run Mijalisco. Can you imagine trying to run a restaurant across from that? Also tenants in my building, Paul Hendricks. Paul's trying to support his family. Got a one-year-old daughter. It's about people. My main concern there, however, is for my son, who is also a tenant there. I'm concerned for his health and his safety. The crazy, the crazy, the crazy, was going on was going on was going on was going on was going on was going on was going on was going on was going on was going on was going on was going on was going on was going on was going on was going on was going on was going on was going on I was told that I have not heard it verified that there were 84 people Encamped in that park and when they went there to deal with them the population had bloomed to over a hundred It's a massive health and safety problem. Please keep your promises Thank you Devon Jones followed by Paul Hendricks Hello everyone, my name is Dijon Jones All right, sorry, my name is John Jones I was born August 11th 1990 my dad went to prison in 1997 Which left my mom to raise us by ourselves at the age of 15 my social worker said that she would put us put me back in the house of my mom I said in one month I'm gonna go out and kill as many people as I can before I kill myself and I did on September 18th of 2005 at 1 Oh 4 a.m. Went to Walmart and stabbed an innocent person in the face 17 times and chopped her nose off I was released after serving 13 years 10 months 31 days to Chico California I became the outreach director for Associated Student Government Well, I did my job while maintain a 4.0 I was hit with the pandemic. I'm a savant but I did most of my time in solitary confinement on level 6 in Redonion Redonion, Virginia My parole agent came into my house and took my phone on concern of my school Was concerned because My school had said that I had recorded a police check And I was not able to get to the school I was in the middle of a training activity which I had not Kelly Munson had called me and the rest of the Associated Student Governors to the school Being that I was primarily primarily relying upon transportation Once the school had stopped that I drove by myself and got lost once I rode there My friend Anson Burkhoff the technology director said Dijon what happened and I told him I said let's not waste too much time Let's do it Instagram live cover what we need to cover Which was the two thousand five hundred dollars we funded towards two projects of painting a mural that reflected overcoming in 2018 fire and overcoming the challenges of the pandemic After that, I had a one o'clock appointment with Bob with real Clark and then From my Instagram live my friends said to come to the football field so that I can get them on my way there as I went Down to 18 flights of steps. I've been to corner past the kinesiology department. I've seen 40 to 50 police officers In training I told inspector Jones that I was on my way to the football field However, still the next day he said someone sent my poor agent and and the state police to take my phone for a week Eight days and my teachers said John with the full point. I can go to any major university There's on the microphones actually in the podium. So if you talk much in the time So I became homeless because I withdrew so I can save my future education and so I got off parole and I did not know that I would become homeless by losing my financial aid And I'm thank you Thank you Our last speaker is Paul Hendricks Yeah, I am co-owner of terrain Park climbing center located at 931 West Fifth Street directly Across the street from Depot park and Strip Strip Strip Strip Strip Strip Strip Strip Strip Strip Strip Strip Strip Strip Strip Strip Strip Strip Strip Strip Strip Strip Strip class, okay? We are more for this community than you can even imagine. So having to call the police several times a week, it's really, really frustrating. I have to literally physically go into the street and flag them down because they have stopped responding. They don't want to talk to us anymore. They have nothing to say past there's nothing we can do. So what can we do? I can come here and I can talk to you, okay? It's just out of hand. I'm seeing other places around town, you know, clear up, things are being done, and nothing is being done. Every single day, it gets bigger and bigger. It is literally exploding out into the streets. Do yourself a favor, drive by the park one day, see what we have to deal with. It smells like urine and feces for an entire block. The trash is overflowing into neighboring streets. Monthly, we are cleaning up charcoal. They are having fires all the time, okay? We've talked to the fire department, trying to clear this up. Why? Why are they able to just burn stuff? Needless to say, it's really frustrating. We love having this climbing gym. We love supporting the community. We love everything that we've built, and we just hate that, you know, our people have to deal with this. Nothing that we've done, but everybody now is having to deal with it. We have no answers for them. We have no hope. So, we just would like to figure something out, let alone the people that we have to deal with, you know, coming in, asking for who knows what, bathroom, just coming in to scream at us, our employees. You know, we employ students who have to now deal with this incredibly disgusting situation. Thank you. That was our last speaker. All right. Thank you. We'll move on to public hearings. Item 4.1, final protest hearing on the proposed modification of the existing CMD A16 Northwest Chico Specific Plan area, and I believe we have Mr. Adepone from the report. Yes. Good evening, Mayor, Vice Mayor, and City Council members. Item 4.1 is the final protest hearing for the modification of Chico Maintenance District A16 at the Northwest Chico Specific Plan area. So, at the June 6th meeting, was the initial hearing. With your approval of that, the final protest hearing was scheduled and ballots were sent out in accordance with the Proposition 218 process. So, might need a little help from the City Attorney and City Clerk's Office, but essentially, ballots are sent out. If we don't receive more than 50% of those ballots back in protest, that allows for the City Council to approve the resolution and move forward with the proposal.

All right, do we have any speakers on the item? We do not. All right. So now we'll call for any final ballots to be turned into the city clerk. All right, and we have no ballots turned in entirely? No. All right, so with that, we'll close the public hearing. Obviously, tallying the ballots will be pretty easy. So if you can make the formal announcement. We have zero protest ballots. All right, so at this point, then we adopt the resolution, correct? All right, do I have an entertain a motion? Move to approve. Second. A motion from Vice Mayor Rounds, a second from Council Member Bennett. I think it was, yes. And that's a resolution of the City Council of the City of Chico, California, declaring the results of the property owner protest ballot proceedings and confirming the annexation of the Heritage Land Department's annexation territory into the Chico Maintenance Assessment District Number 816, the diagram and assessments related thereto, overruling all protests concerning the assessments and ordering the levy and collection of assessments commencing fiscal year 2023, 2024. When you're ready. Council Member Bennett? Yes. Council Member Morgan? Yes. Council Member Tandon? Yes. Council Member Van Overbuyck? Yes. Council Member Winslow? Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds? Yes. And Mayor Coolidge? Aye. Carries 7-0. All right, PR God's Own Investments, investing tentative subdivision map, north side of Eaton Road, East Hicks Lane, and north of the terminus of Silverbelt Road. And I believe we have a report from Tina Wilson, associate planner, there she is, welcome. Thank you, Mayor Coolidge, Vice Mayor, and Council members. This item 4.2 is for a general plan amendment, pre-reviewing service and service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service I did get one comment that was forwarded to the Council having concerns regarding the project, and there was one, as noted in the staff report, one comment from the public after the Planning Commission meeting as well. Other than that, we do not have any additional public comments. The project is an appropriate subdivision in the location along Eaton Road. It is to create 17 lots, a new public street that would be a cul-de-sac with full public improvements. The applicant is not requesting any subdivision modifications. The reason the item is before the City Council is because of the general plan amendment and rezone from RS-20 to R-1 for zoning and then the very low density residential to low density residential. And that concludes my presentation. I'm here if you have any questions. All right. Thank you. We'll start with questions from Council. Thank you very much. Thank you. Appreciate it. All right. We'll open the public hearing. Any speakers on the side? We have one speaker, Ben Ekstrom. All right. Three minutes. Welcome. Good evening, Council members. My name is Ben Ekstrom. I'm a builder, a businessman, and a family guy. I am not opposing the subdivision's proposal to have a public building in the area. I'm in the building industry, like it. My concern when I looked on the tentative subdivision map is the median going down east on Eaton Road. That directly impedes my traffic on 472 and 478 properties where I have rentals in my personal residence. So I don't think the general plan is out 100% on that, but didn't know if they can stop the median to still allow access for 472, 478. And that's it. All right. Thank you. And with that, we will close the public hearing. Further questions from Council? I'm curious about the answer to that. I was going to say, did the staff address that? Yeah. Tina? Hardeman. Mr. Hardeman. Yeah. Unfortunately, I'm not super familiar with that exact location, but we can certainly look at that. Obviously, Eaton Road is an archipelago. It's a 40-year-old roadway. So controlling access is important. And so we evaluate that on all projects and make sure it's consistent with kind of the larger circulation of the surrounding areas. So we can certainly further evaluate that and see if it's possible. Okay. Maybe you guys can have a conversation. All right. With that, we'll entertain a motion. Move to approve. Second. Motion. Motion from Vice Mayor. I'm just looking at the resolutions I have to read. No, it's fine. I don't mind reading them. You only have to read the ordinance title. Oh, just the ordinance part. Okay. Yeah. All right. And a second from Council Member Tannen. Sorry. And that's an ordinance of the City of Council of the City of Chico amending the zoning classification from RS-20, suburban residential, 20,000 square foot minimum lot size to R1, low density residential, identified as APN007. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. Good evening, Mayor, Vice Mayor, Council. I'm back again on kind of short notice. So you may remember at your last meeting, the Council considered an item to amend the Municipal Code, which would result in the Planning Commission assuming the responsibilities of the ARHPB. And during your deliberations, you gave direction to staff to obtain community input and identify ways to streamline the ARHPB process and to reduce costs. However, given that the current ARHPB only has three of its five members intact and ensuring a quorum is available to facilitate their meetings has become a challenge for staff, we're requesting the Council approve the ordinance that would have the Commission assume the responsibilities of the ARHPB and provide staff approximately four months to work with your direction and proceed and come back. That time will allow us to review the code, engage the development community, draft a proposed code change. Because it's in Title 19, we'll need to go to the Planning Commission, and at that time we can return to the Council with what we think is the most important part of the plan. And that's what we think would be a more thoughtful recommendation. So at this point, staff is recommending that this is an interim measure that allows the PC to make sure we have more robust and facilitate the meetings and the duties of the ARHPB, but that we come back again per your direction in approximately four months, if not sooner, meeting your objectives and your direction. So tonight, staff's recommending you hold a public hearing and introduce the ordinance to amend the Chico Municipal Code by reading of its title. All right. Question? The reason we only have three members of the Architects Review Board is because while we received applications, we didn't select out of those applications any, we didn't make any appointments out of the applications we received, right? That is true. I can't remember even how robust the applicant pool was, but yes, you did not make appointments to the ARHPB. Yeah, I don't know if you would recall, we did have applications there to fulfill the board if we had chosen to move forward with them. I don't recall. I believe we had some, yeah. And then just one more thing that just came to mind as reading this is we have not just one, but two alternates in the Planning Commission that can serve as members, are designated to serve in the ARHPB board. That is correct, and that's how we've been functioning. One of our three members of the ARHPB is often away on business, and so I guess I'm just suggesting it's a constant challenge, and then bringing the Planning Commissioners in. I'm not saying we haven't been able to limp along. Mm-hmm. Okay. So at the moment, we're not doing that. As of yet, we haven't been unable to be quorum any time, or has that actually happened? No, I think we have had some problems making our quorum, yes. Okay, thanks. All right, further questions? All right, so we'll open the public hearing. Any speakers? We have two. Three minutes. First speaker is Sue Ellen Rollison. Good evening, I'm Sue Ellen Rollison, pleased to be here tonight, and I'm concerned about the Architectural Review and Historical Preservation Board becoming a subcommittee of the Planning Commission. We may be at risk at losing the expertise and the emphasis of the board members on the unique architecture in the historical buildings and neighborhoods in Chico. The change in the ordinance will allow the Planning Commission to appoint three of their members to hear the architectural and its issues. Witnessing all of your hard work as we all recognize we all share equal opportunities as we all share equal opportunities as we all share equal opportunities as we all share equal opportunities as we all share equal opportunities as we all share equal opportunities as we all share equal opportunities as we all share equal opportunities as we all share equal opportunities as we all share equal opportunities as we all share equal opportunities as we all share equal opportunities as we all share equal opportunities as we all share equal opportunities as we all share equal opportunities as we all share equal opportunities as we all share equal opportunities as we all share equal opportunities as we all share equal opportunities as we all share equal opportunities as we all share equal opportunities as we all share equal opportunities as we all share equal opportunities as we all share equal opportunities as we all share equal opportunities as we all share equal opportunities as we all share equal opportunities as we all share equal opportunities as we all share equal opportunities as we all share equal opportunities as we all share equal opportunities as we all share equal opportunities as we all share equal opportunities as we all share equal opportunities as we all share equal opportunities as and historical preservation subcommittee meetings will not be recorded or broadcasted. They will be held on the first and third Wednesdays, 4 p.m., as needed. So if there's public controversy on some particular issue, it could be handled by the full scope of the planning commission meeting. So citizens, neighbors, we need to be vigilant to attend the subcommittees and the planning commission on issues that are important to us. I understand that the Architectural Review and Historical Preservation Board came into existence in the 1970s sometime because certain buildings and neighborhoods were being threatened. The city and council can go through with this change, but it may need to be revisited if we see harm to our unique city and its neighborhoods. So be on watch, people. Our next and final question is from the City of Chico. Our next and final speaker is Melinda Vasquez. Good evening. As an artist and member of the City of Chico's First Art Commission, I value the importance of the Architectural Review and Historic Preservation Board. For this reason in the past, I frequently attended ARB meetings. I've been a member of the City of Chico's First Art Commission since I was a child. I was truly impressed how these licensed and credentialed architects, painting contractors, and interior designers could skillfully guide sometimes mediocre projects, project proposal, into great ones. Their combined professional experience and skillset ensured that every project was aligned to our city's codes and guidelines. Unfortunately, the city has been unable to meet the requirements of the city's code and guidelines. The City of Chico and many Council members have historically shown a lack of respect for this commission by disregarding their professional recommendations. Perhaps this accounts for the current state of the lack of applicants. This attempt to streamline the process of architectural review by consolidation of the ARB and the Historic Preservation Board, with the Planning Commission, will only destroy the integrity of a proven methodology. Thank you. That was our last speaker. All right. Close the hearing. Entertain the motion. May I speak? Yes, sir. Mr. Ritt. I'll make this short. I made it perfectly clear how much I value the Architectural Review and Historic Preservation Board and how sad it is for me to see this change. And I would love to vote no, but I'm not going to, because I had a conversation with a person I respect very much, and I think it's best for the city and for us to move forward. It's clear that the Architectural Review Board is going to morph into a different type of configuration. And I think that that is sad, but it's going to happen. So I am going to support the motion because we need to move forward as a city and as a community. And that's all I have to say. All right. Further comments? All right. Seeing none, entertain motion. We have a motion from Council Member Morgan. Okay. I'll take it. All right. Second from Council Member Tandon. And that's an ordinance in the city. Council of the City of Chico amending certain sections of Title II of the Chico Municipal Code, designating the Architectural Review and Historic Preservation Board as subcommittee of the Planning Commission. Council Member Bennett. Yes. Council Member Morgan. Yes. Council Member Tandon. Yes. Council Member Van Overbeek. Yes. Council Member Winslow. No. Council Member Reynolds. Yes. Mayor Coolidge. Aye. Carries 6-1. All right. So move on to the regular agenda, Item 5.1, Proposed Ordinance Amending Chapter 5.42, 19.75, and SR 2 of the Chico Municipal Code to Authorize Cannabis Backgrounds as Authorized by the Chico Police Department. We have a report from Management Analyst Angie Dill. Good evening. Good evening. Good evening. So the Chico Municipal Code currently requires LiveScan, which is a fingerprinting system for backgrounding to be completed for cannabis business owners and their employees. In order to utilize LiveScan for cannabis purposes, the City must obtain clearance from the Department of Justice and the FBI. The City has submitted multiple applications to the DOJ and the FBI to obtain clearance beginning back in August of 2022 and has been rejected each time. According to DOJ personnel, the FBI started heavily scrutinizing all cannabis resolutions and as a result, are denying resolutions from cities all over. The City's cannabis consultant has also noted that they have worked with 30 different cities regarding these resolutions and none of the cities have been successful in obtaining this clearance for LiveScan for cannabis purposes. This ordinance would remove the requirement from the code to LiveScan as a means of backgrounding for cannabis. And allow the Chief of Police to utilize LiveScan for cannabis purposes. The City has also made a request to the City to utilize a third party vendor to background cannabis business owners and their employees. The background being performed by the third party vendor can pick up the same criminal history as a LiveScan would, as well as additional factors where fingerprinting is not required. Any questions? Questions? Thank you. Do we have any speakers on this side? We have no speakers. Is that right? Do we have one? We do. Oh, we do have a speaker. Let's see. James Hutchinson. All right. Three minutes. Last time there was a major plot issue was an appeal of a permit process where they were talking about the money and time effort they put into it. I look at this, what you have printed out here. And what I see is. I see that. That it says no cost. There will be no cost higher than what we're paying right now. Who's paying the cost? You're telling me that the fingerprinting system costs the same as doing a physical background check. Exactly. It costs the same. You know, if you can't write it right. There's a cost. You know it. I know it. You're not talking about it. It's not here. It's not in the resolution. It's not what was written. red here? We don't know what it is. You're asking to approve something you don't have a cost for. Where is it? When are you going to show it to us? Or is this going to be another one of those hidden things? Well, we just pass it back to the drug people and they can pay for it. Already complained about the stupidity of the way you're setting your fees. You can add more to those fees now, more cost. And in the meantime, guess what? The black market people are going to be laughing because the higher the cost, the higher the tax, the better their sales because they can market it cheaper and directly. THC is approaching 90% in a lot of pot crops now. THC numbers are being falsified. In a CalMatters article, there's a wonderful piece about how, hey, look what's going on here. We've got companies saying that we're not going to sell it. We're not going to sell it. We're not going to sell it. Well, our product has this level of THC and they don't. They further tested them. Found out they didn't. So what's happening here? We've got enough problem trying to enforce the regulations you've got without saying this is a no cost thing. Your THC regulations, have you really looked at them? Have you really looked at what the cost is? Have you looked what's happening to teenagers throughout this country on higher THC levels in the 1970s? I'm 20 years old. Pot's out there for me. But that pot was 7% THC. That pot that the kids getting their hands on now at a lot younger age is as much as 90% hallucinogenic. It invokes a number of problems. It invokes problems such as chronic vomiting is one of the things that addiction causes and a lot of use of getting it. Vaping pot, a direct thing. You say, hey, don't take these pills because it might have fentanyl in them. Sure. Vaping pot at 90% THC and see what you get. Think about it, folks. What's the cost? That was our last speaker. All right. Entertain a motion. Sure. Motion to move. Second. Second. Second from Council Member Bennett. I'll give a 10. Sorry. Okay. And that's an ordinance in the City Council of the City of Chico, California amending chapters 4.5.42, 19.75 and SR 4.42 of the Chico Municipal Code to make minor updates to the commercial cannabis permit process requirements and authorizing the City of Chico Police Department to utilize third-party background check vendors when deemed necessary. When you're ready. Council Member Bennett. Yes. Council Member Morgan. Yes. Council Member Tandon. Yes. Council Member Van Overbeck. Yes. Council Member Winslow. Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds. Aye. Mayor Coolidge. Aye. Carries 7-0. All right. Item 5.2, ratification memo of understanding Chico Police Officers Association. We have a report from Director of Human Resources and Risk Management, Chelsea Cubits. Welcome. Thank you. Good evening, Mayor, Vice Mayor, members of the Council. I'm here to speak to the Council. Before you this evening is ratification of our Chico Police Officers Memorandum of Understanding. We sunshined the draft contract two weeks ago at the June 6 Council meeting. Some of our key highlights for the contract, it is a three-year contract. This first year, we will have an additional 15% increase on July 2nd. In year two, we will have a 2% increase, and then in year three, we'll have an additional 2% increase for general salary increases. We have removed the language for limited re-opener, which means this contract, in general, is good for the entirety of the duration of the contract without coming back to the table. So, it does save some time and energy on both CPOA's part and staff's part. We have increased the uniformity of the contract. We have increased the allowance from $900 to $1,300 to help keep up with inflation and cost of uniform equipment. And then we have also rolled back our CalPERS contributions that we have asked our CPOA members to contribute. We were scheduled to go up to 9% employee contribution as of July 1. We have rolled back 6% so that we are now at 3% total employee contribution. So, we have made that contribution on top of what is required by law. The fiscal impact for this contract over the term of the contract is approximately $1.9 million. And I am happy to answer any questions that you may have. All right. Questions? Thank you very much. Speakers? We have none this time. All right. Entertain a motion. Move to approve. Second. I have a motion. from Vice Mayor Reynolds, a second from Council Member Morgan, and a couple of seconds after that. Council Member Bennett? Yes. Council Member Morgan? Yes. Council Member Tandon? Yes. Council Member Van Overbeek? Yes. Council Member Winslow? No. Vice Mayor Reynolds? Aye. And Mayor Coolidge? Aye. Carries 6-1. All right. Let's see. Thank you very much. I think you're the next speaker as well, but we'll move on to Item 5.3, Amendment to the City of Chico, Budget Appendix B-1. All right. So again, before you this evening, we have a two-part amendment to Appendix B-1. During the last Council meeting on June 6, Council authorized the pay increase for our City Clerk position. And so administratively, we are going back to reflect our B-1 budget as required by CalPERS to May 1, 2023 with the increase in pay for our City Clerk position. The secondary piece to the amendment of the B-1 budget is for our Police Academy trainee position. After reviewing our CPOA contract and appropriately adjusting salaries to market value, we realized that our Police Academy trainee positions were significantly under market value. And as we were sending our trainees out to Police Academies, we were losing them to other agencies because the other agencies were paying more competitively. So what we have done is increased the Police Academy trainee pay to 15% below Step 1 of the CPOA and officer entry level pay. We will service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service welcome everybody speakers we did not all right entertain motion second we have a motion from councilman morgan and the second from council member tan spreading them all around all right when you're ready council member bennett yes council member morgan council member tandon yes council member van overbeck yes council member winslow yes vice mayor reynolds and mayor coolidge carries seven zero all right and we are going to just take a short break and then we'll be right back urban forest master plan long-awaited public works director eric uh i'm saying i'm going to start now he's in trouble mr you have 40 seconds no take your time mayor vice mayor council thank you for the opportunity to speak to you again tonight this is i will go quick this is a uh further refining um of the urban forest master plan by the internal affairs committee at their june 5th meeting internal affairs committee members spent some time on this discussing there was robust discussion a lot of public input and then some further refinements that we could just go through rather quickly the first one starts and these are further refining the action items of the master plan the urban forest master plan some of these are minor and some of them are complete strikeouts the first one is is 2f uh we're going to put promote rather than enforce there 3b plant 500 street trees annually if feasible was the addition 3k strive no net loss of canopy cover and then on 5e we struck the cross-reference the method of measurement cross cross-reference that looked at action item 7d and then we also struck 5f g and h that had components of adding the canopy cover and urban forestry goals in the general plan during a routine general plan update and then the next strikeout at the internal affairs was 5i 5j is also struck there you'll see some that aren't highlighted that are struck those were from the original internal affairs and council meeting we didn't want to completely remove those from the document then that is that would change the next one we're going to go through number sequencing so we wanted to keep that just for reference only once this is finally adopted by council tonight we will go ahead and remove all of those and then re-sequence the numbers so 5i was struck which was explore the development of a private tree ordinance to protect trees on private property from there we consolidated some of these that had to do with floodplain and storm drain planning and references and just consolidated most of those into 5r and then also added a method of measurement that encapsulated some of that consolidation from the others we're getting close here um also here's 7f we added the method of measurement on 7f and then struck uh 7h this was a another consolidation of continuing to ensure a city arborist is directly involved in reviewing new development designs project permits and removal applications to ensure best uh agricultural practices are being instituted and so we just added that to the method of measurement to consolidate some of those action items that were somewhat repetitive and that is it i can answer any questions at this time the recommendation is from the internal affairs committee as council to adopt the further refinement of the urban forest master plan all right questions from council no questions thank you mr cuffs thank you can use your time for a future all right uh speakers we have 13. all right uh 13 three minutes each our first speaker is susan chudi followed by miranda k so so so good evening council so so chico deserves a robust and actionable urban forest master plan the plan should include specific measurable and time-bound components to ensure a thriving city canopy for decades to come, as well as protection from climate change and the inevitable rise of intense heat days. In a time of unprecedented, life-threatening, and costly climate events, Chico must act decisively not only to maintain and sustain our urban forests, but to increase its canopy from 36 to 40 percent. Which, in the original draft, the Urban Forest Master Plan has one of its actionable goals. The Urban Forest Master Plan is the result of countless commission and committee meetings, input from citizens, stakeholders, and experts, two highly professional urban foresters, and collaboration with a third-party consultant specializing in urban forest management. A little over two months ago, that plan was submitted to the City Council for approval. A month later, it was approved with a few revisions. In last-minute proposals by City Councilperson Van Overbeck, the Urban Forest Master Plan, triggered by 11th-hour letters from the Chico Builders Association, have resulted in a significantly weaker plan. Peppered with language like encourage rather than enforce, and instead of identifying measurable goals that one uses, the language of if feasible. All the input from citizens, stakeholders, experts, and a hired consultant is being discounted at the behest of a special interest group. This kind of governance is irresponsible and discounts the voices of the citizens, and the citizens of Chico who served on committees and represented the greater Chico community, to provide direct input into the language of the UFMP. In this critical time, when we have the opportunity to make a lasting difference in the health and sustainability of our forests and our community, catering to the short-term profit of a special interest group will only harm our community. We urge you to reject the request of the City Council for approval, and to be prepared to respond to the request of the City Council. We urge you to consider the revisions proposed in the last Internal Affairs Committee meeting, and support a strong Urban Forest Master Plan for the health and well-being of the Chico community. Thank you very much. Miranda Kaye, followed by Robin McCollum. If you can line up in the aisle if you're the next person, so we can limit the time between speakers. Hi, well, my name is Miranda. I have some background as I plant trees in the community. Last year in December, I planted 14 trees among 100 trees. Last year with Hooker Oak Elementary School, I planted with their garden class, and I planted trees with every single student on that campus. And here's a note that I just received. Uh, maybe a week ago, two weeks ago. And I'm gonna read it for you. Dear Butte Environmental Council, Thank you for planting so many trees on our campus at Hooker Oak Elementary School. They are now growing quite beautiful. Uh, that was quite a project in December. Burr. Also, thank you for the lovely tree book, The Magic and Mystery of Trees. That was a fun surprise. We enjoyed working with the tree lady, Miranda. Thanks for making it all so fun. On behalf of the Hooker Oak Garden Club, we will post your notes on we post on as we on as we post your as we on your we post on phone as we post on on on Good evening, Councilmembers and staff. I'm looking forward to you folks approving the amended plan and regret some of the changes that were made, but it is an adaptive management plan, so we'll find a way to do things that will be acceptable to all parties, and I think that's the goal. The intent of the urban forester when he was drafting the plan was to make it inclusive and transparent, so following those ideas, then we should be able to go forward without mandates in many places, and one vehicle for that would be cooperative meetings between developers, folks that have an objection or a concern about trees on their street or whatever, especially in the context of a neighborhood. The more people we can bring in and get involved in the process, the better. I had suggested after the nature center debacle a couple of years ago that we have a training for park staff that would bring in the community as well, and I'd like to see that go forward so at least we could recognize the difference, for example, between native and non-native trees, the ones we want, plants, the ones we want to keep, the ones that are invasive and doing harm. And with that, going over into Bidwell Park, which is part of the urban forest, we need a full-time crew for Bidwell Park, including tree climbers, tree workers. The large trees require some weight reduction and so forth to stabilize them so we don't lose half a tree at a time and thereby essentially the whole tree. This is a conservation by preventive maintenance. So with that, I look forward to... more meetings with the public under the auspices of the urban forester that will help us get around any kinds of disagreements that we have in the community so we can work towards our common goal of a beautiful tree-covered forest including things like parking lots, etc. Thank you. Patrizia Hieronymer, followed by Bill Monroe. My name is Patrizia Hieronymer, and I am the Executive Director of Butte Environmental Council. I came to Butte Environmental Council as a student, as a grasshopper, in this Urban Forest Master Plan work session, but richly facilitated with due-debt planning. It was to gain insight, from community, from developers, from foresters, from people who work with trees, from people who love trees, and a lot of people who just came to see where they could plant a tree in Chico. Some wanted to plant trees near their houses, because they're homeowners, and some in parks. It's true, everybody loves trees. Do you know why they love trees? Because trees keep us cool. They provide shade. Beck recently got a grant from the Office of the City of Chico, of Strategic Partners and Community Relationships, something like that. It's a new development in the state of California. They're giving grants out for extreme heat, to educate people about the warnings of extreme heat. You know what helps with extreme heat? Trees. They provide shade. And at the end of this convening in Sacramento, where they asked all of these community-based organizations what they would put in a time capsule for the next 30 years, I said an acorn. Because in 30 years, an acorn becomes a tree, and provides shade for the community. So this is what we're doing here, tonight. We are planning for 30, 40 years from now. This is the general plan. Developers have come forth and said, please don't put restrictions on us. Are they too costly? Are they too complicated? I worked in architecture. It sounds more like a feasibility plan, because every language in here, is not a strategic master plan implementation. At all. And that's okay. I'm just trying to figure out what we're trying to do here. If we're trying to provide shade in the future for the citizens and community of Chico and Butte County, then we would, of course, plant as many trees as possible. Because that is the goal, to keep people healthy and alive. And that's the goal of the state of California, to give money to people who want to do that same thing. We talked in the internal affairs committee, and we said, hey, wouldn't it be great if we came together and showed the state that we could partner, and financially do it right the first time, and not have to go back and make costly mistakes and redo it? That's the goal. So I'm asking you, please, please, do not adopt these soft languages and fuzzy interpretations. Just keep the urban forest master plan as it was intended, by the community, by the people who believe in it, and by the future of these kids who write these letters. Because we all need trees. Especially in Butte County. Thank you. Bill Monroe, followed by Marty Dunlap. Hi, Bill Monroe. I live on West 4th Avenue. Hello, Council. And I know very little about trees. I do know that the original plan was great. And the adjustments of it, kind of dumbing it down to an aspirational document, is a terrible idea. If it isn't set in stone, we're going to plant 500 trees, it ain't going to happen. My wife and I have this electric car. And we charge it at Electrify America. The Electrify America says that it will deliver at 350 kilowatt speed. I've never gotten a car. I've never gotten over 220 kilowatt speed on that Electrify America charger. I called Electrify America, and they said, well, it says up to 350. So I said, well, why don't you just say it gets up to 1,000? It was just an aspirational thing that you can probably, maybe you could get that. And so that was disappointing. And this change is very disappointing. It needs some teeth in it. It's just to do something good. And also the trees that are planted should be native trees, trees that are adapted to our area. They don't need a lot of irrigation. And they can pretty much take care of themselves. It's like the trees that you see going up the hills above Chico. They don't have anybody coming out and pruning and watering them. They're just there. And we can have trees like that. And thank you. Please, please, please don't adapt these new changes. Marty Dunlap, followed by Katie Thoma. The operative words in the grant awarded to the city that compels development of an urban forest master plan are climate change investments. The plan needs to keep focused on those three words. Investing in mitigating the effects of current and future climate change. As Mr. Morgan is aware, having taught program coordination, a program or plan is an orderly arrangement of parts or action items of an overall design or objective. The stated objective under guiding principle three is to expand the city tree canopy to 40% over the next 40 years with the intent to mitigate climate change. Whenever a plan is established, directives are formulated to meet the objectives of the plan. If words are introduced into the action items, such as encourage or promote rather than require or ensure, the directives contained within the plan become unclear and lose focus. It is critical when establishing a plan of this import that the directives are straightforward and clear to future lawmakers, planners, developers, and the citizens. When a phrase such as when feasible is introduced, it is also necessary to include more detail on what that means. What are the conditions to be considered when weighing feasibility? Chico does have the enviable title as the city of trees. This is not simply for aesthetic purposes, but rather for the citizens to have a tolerant quality of life. In the Sacramento Valley, where temperatures in the summer frequently reach 110 degrees, a well-established tree canopy is a must. A tree canopy can mitigate those temperatures by 15 degrees. In addition, an established tree canopy increases water retention within soil, facilitates the exchange of carbon for oxygen, minimizes the speed of wind at the ground level, and maintains habitat for other species. Under 7.8 of the plan, the involvement of a city arborist to review new developments, permits, etc., has been moved from an action item to a method of measurement. This seems odd to relegate such an important inclusion of staff from an action to a measurement. As sworn city councillors, you have two duties, the duty of care and the duty of loyalty. The duty of care is to do your homework, come prepared to the meetings, and make prudent decisions. In this case, ensure that the Urban Forest Management Master Plan meets the requirements of the grant. The duty of loyalty extends to loyalty to the entity one represents. In this case, the city council. This loyalty goes beyond those who have interests in commons as yours, such as encouraging development within the city. Your loyalty is to approve plans that provide for the long-term quality of life for all. Please be clear about the impacts of words that can confound the directives of the plan. Don't let our city trees become parched cities like Fresno and Roseville. Thank you. Katie Thelma, followed by Jared Geiser. Thank you, Madam Chair. Good evening, Mayor, Vice Mayor, and Councilmembers. My name is Katie Thelma. I'm the Executive Director of the Chico Builders Association. The Chico Builders Association would like to acknowledge and thank city staff for the work in developing Chico's urban landscape. In the last 23 years, Chico Builders Association members, who are residential developers, have planted over 44,000 trees. This does not include trees planted in parks or any other open spaces in their developments. One of our members, who is affiliated on the commercial side of development, recently stated that in the last 10 years, he has planted over 10,000 trees on his project. That's one member. 10,000 trees over 10 years. The development community is doing their part in Chico, the city of Chico. Thank you. Thank you. Jared Geiser, followed by Grace Marvin. Good evening, Council. Good evening, staff. My name is Jared. I'm with the AltaCal Audubon Society. AltaCal's mission is to promote the awareness, appreciation, and protection of native birds and their habitats through education, research, and environmental activities. AltaCal is concerned that the actions taken at the June 5th Internal Affairs Committee meeting will weaken the action item for the Chico Builders Association. This is a part of the plan that will be part of the urban forest master plan and results in a degraded urban forest in the future. Chico's urban forest is vitally important for the birds living in our area, both year-long residents and seasonal migrants, and a large number and a diversity of trees is essential for bird habitat quality in this fine city. A healthy urban forest allows birds to live in habitats that might otherwise be compromised by development. It's important to note that climate change not only threatens all of us in this room and every resident of Chico, but also two-thirds of the population. We need to mitigate emissions for the betterment of the birds and for the people of Chico as well. The urban forest master plan needs to be proactive and firm with its goals and targets to ensure a healthy urban forest with adequate canopy cover. Pertinent issues such as biodiversity loss and climate change are too severe to leave Chico's urban forest's vitality up to chance. The June 5th IAC meeting changes made at the behest of the Chico Builders Association weaken the plan and threaten the future of the urban forest by changing the soft language from ensure to strive for, enforce to promote, and adding if feasible to tree planting goals. The soft language causes the urban forest master plan to lose its teeth, jeopardizing the goals and targets of the urban forest master plan and ultimately the health of the urban forest. Weakening important tenets of this plan at this stage to cater to special interest is subverting the democratic decision making process. Extensive community input was conducted to shape this plan. AltaCal is one of many local stakeholders that participated in the community engagement process. We are also working with the Chico Builders Association. This public engagement process is described on page 28 of the urban forest master plan. One of the principles listed is quote, empower to place final decision making in the hands of the special interests. Oh sorry, I misread that. It's to place final decision making in the hands of the public. Delaying the final approval and altering this plan to appease special interests is contradictory to the community engagement principle of the urban forest master plan cited above. The urban forest master plan needs to be strong enough to ensure protection and enhancement of the urban forest. Weakening it sends a message to the City of Chico that you're willing to let the urban forest deteriorate if budgetary priorities differ. Chico residents and birds crucially need a large and healthy urban forest to survive a warming climate. We ask that the City of Chico prioritize the needs of the community and the ecosystems and reject the last minute changes proposed by special interests. Thank you for considering our public comment. Quick mention to action items 5.f and g that were mentioned up here regarding eliminating and incorporating this plan into the general plan. I just wanted to say that I think there's a lot of value in having consistency among your planning documents. Thank you. Grace Marvin, followed by Lori Monroe. Greetings. Just to let you know, I'm still conservation chair of the local Blue Oak group. And I want you to recall that Chico was chosen for the filming of the Sherwood Forest in the Robin Hood movie in the 1930s. So, the UFMP, the urban forest master plan, not only should stay in place as approved in a recent city council meeting, but our city should be investing in the implementation of that plan heartily. The City of Chico is rightly proud of its tree heritage, its status as a USA tree city, and its nickname the City of Trees. But in order to live up to this heritage, we need sound policy, the commitment of resources, and science-driven decision-making to support and grow the urban forest. A robust urban forest master plan must be at the core of this work. People have asked what resources are available to support the UFMP. In a recent city council meeting, city staff estimated that there's $424 million expected in revenue. So, 1% of the new revenue, or $240,000, should be invested in our urban forest. The plan specifically states that the city currently employs 8.25 full-time equivalents in tree management, which is significantly lower than the average number of 11.8 for cities of comparable size. This, by raising the staffing level comparable with other cities, would positively impact the health of our current trees. It will also help meet the goal of growing our canopy instead of accepting a net loss. We must not take our urban forest plan for granted. We must intentionally invest in it. 1% of the expected new revenue is a good start. Your earlier approval of the UFMP should stay in place. Thank you. Lori Monroe, followed by Julian Zenner. Mayor, Vice Mayor, and City Council, I'm just a regular person who had some extra time this week to look over the changes that were suggested by the last committee that reviewed this master plan. And I just gotta say I don't like it. I like the way the wording was before. It had more teeth to it. It showed that the city was interested in maintaining the tree canopy here in the City of Trees. And I ask you not to accept the changes that have happened. Julian Zenner, followed by Bryce Goldstein. Good evening, Mayor and City Council members. The Chico Builders Association believes that the current municipal code is sufficient to create a substantial canopy. We disagree. Given our warming climate and increase in population, the Urban Forest Master Plan is a carefully and democratically created document. One that encourages shared standards for our urban forest and looks to increase our tree canopy from 36 to 40 percent over the next four decades. Given the tremendously positive impact of trees in terms of carbon sequestration, cleaner air, increased shade, cooler temperatures, and aesthetic value, we need the kind of robust standards articulated in the Urban Forest Master Plan with shalls and not may. The plan states new development must properly plan for trees. It goes on. A canopy cover change analysis was conducted using aerial imaging from 2005 to 2020. The analysis identified the largest gains and losses of canopy cover. The Northwest Chico neighborhood experienced a 14 percent decrease in canopy cover as a new residential development replaced an orchard. In contrast, the Foothill Park neighborhood experienced a 10 percent increase in canopy cover attributed to the trees planted in an area that had largely been grass and shrubland. This analysis indicates the importance of city planners to develop strategies and guidance for home builders to preserve trees when possible and ensure neighborhood plans incorporate trees in a manner that will help achieve a high level of canopy cover. The municipal code does not increase the percentage of our tree canopy. The citizens of Chico deserve the leadership, vision, and robust accountability of an urban forest master plan as originally approved. Thank you. Bryce Goldstein followed by Karen Laszlo. Good evening. My name is Bryce Goldstein. I just got back to Chico two hours ago, so I'm pretty tired. I was spending over a week visiting friends and family in other cities throughout the state and the country, which was a great privilege. And one thing that I love about traveling is that it makes me realize all the things that make Chico so unique. Driving up through the Central Valley today reminded me that we know we're home when we get to the beautiful, lush, towering urban forest and the sign that says City of Trees. As a member of the public and as a board member of the city, I am very proud to be workshops to help shape the urban forest master plan. This has been a long process culminating in a plan, at least previously, with strong, tangible actions to maintain and enhance the urban forest that makes our community the city of trees. So I found it deeply concerning that toward the very end of this process so many changes have been made to water down the plan, especially by removing actions that would ensure is going to increase extreme heat and drought in Chico. Trees help reduce the urban heat island effect and they provide shade and clean air and they're beautiful. In the face of climate change and our aging urban forest, our city council needs to be leaders here, putting our community first above profits. We need to be doing more to ensure that we protect this beautiful tree canopy, not less. I encourage you to vote to reject these changes and accept the urban forest master plan as it was previously presented. Thank you. And our last speaker is Karen Laszlo. My message is to the people behind me and watching this meeting on TV. Imagine for a moment a glass of the finest Cabernet Sauvignon wine. Then imagine that glass of fine wine poured into a glass of water. The result would be a glass of extremely watered down fine wine. This is an analogy for the current urban forest master plan as proposed by the city. The current version of the forest plan was watered down twice at two internal affairs committee meetings. And it was done that just to appease the local community. And I think that's a great thing. And I think that's a great thing. It was going to be hard to approve as we all agreed on as we all agreed on as we all agreed on as we all agreed on as we all agreed on as we all agreed on as we all agreed on as we all agreed on as we all agreed on as we all agreed on as we all agreed on as we all agreed on as we all agreed on as we all agreed on as we all agreed on council meeting i don't think you should be voting on this plan because you're a developer and this plan was watered down just to appease the local developers all right thank you all right that was our last figure yes yes all right all right remember motion second the motion in a second okay council comment yeah go ahead let me get my piece i mean so we've seen a couple iterations of this plan now and some of the um the expressed motivation has been to avoid curtailing private property rights there but what i see in these changes is that we're shying away from making commitments um simply and i'm going to look at one policy that's kind of been alluded to but i think some of the details have been lost because the original action 3b said we'll plant at least 500 more street trees than are removed annually by the city this carried a double cash sign next to it which meant that it was not an expensive policy it was a medium policy nevertheless in the first internal affairs committee we changed that to plant 500 street trees annually now not guaranteeing that there is a net gain in street trees overall and then at the following internal affairs committee meeting we added the term if feasible to that so that we are saying something more like plant up to 500 trees part of the rationale given for this is that our trees could suffer from some kind of disaster that would make it um it would overburden the city to maintain this this commitment and my response is that we absolutely are susceptible to disasters and that's exactly why we need to adopt a plan like this we can't expect that certain species and even families with trees can be wiped out by the city and that's exactly why we need to adopt a plan like this we need to we need to we need to we need to we need to we need to we need to we need to we need to we need to we need to we need to we need to we need to we need to we need to we need we need to we need to we need to we need to we need to we need to we need to we need we need to we need to we need to we need we need to we need to we need we need to we need we need to we need extremes that will only become more severe after all of us pass on from this world. But people will be living in Chico with the legacy we leave for them and the preparations we make now so that Chico continues to be an inhabitable quality, if you prefer, place to live. So my recommendation is that we do nothing and we leave in place the plan, which is already a compromise, has already been submitted to CAL FIRE, and when it was originally presented by Mr. Gustafson, was ascertained to be feasible in its entirety. All right. Mr. Nelrick. So I am the chairman of the Internal Affairs Committee, and Mr. Winslow is one of my colleagues as is Vice Mayor Reynolds. So the Internal Affairs Committee reviewed this on May 1st. We brought it back to Council. Council suggested some additional input. So we had another meeting in May. And we are back here with what I think is a balanced, a good and balanced plan. Well, I want to put this in some context. So Chico has today a large and robust urban forest. We have earned a Tree City USA designation from the Arbor Day Foundation. Last week, we found out that we have earned the Tree City USA Growth Award, which we've received for the last four years. Thanks to the great work of Public Works and our forestry department. We are only one of 12 cities in California to earn this award, and that's because our existing rules work and are sound policy. So my goal in Internal Affairs in reviewing this plan was to strike a balance between having a blueprint for continuing to do the good work of the city, and then continuing to do the good work that we already have done with our urban forest, make it larger and make it more robust. It isn't just about planting more trees. It's making the trees healthier. Anybody that's walked in Bimble Park can see that. But in a way that doesn't impose an owner's regulatory burden on our citizens. And that means no further infringement on private property rights. It means no retroactive regulations. And it means nothing that's going to increase the cost of housing. We have a major housing problem in this town. We do not have a forestry urban canopy coverage problem. So anything that was going to increase the cost of housing, we took out. And so I strongly recommend, I think we struck a good balance here, and I recommend that we approve it. Vice Mayor? I just have a couple of quick comments. When this was brought to us, we have over 114 different items that is being presented to us. And we made changes to approximately 10,000. So I don't feel like we completely destroyed and took away an entire plan. I love the fact that this is a starting point, and as was pointed out, is an adaptive plan that will be reviewed and gone over every single year. And Chico, right now without this plan, we're already at 36%. And we're trying to get to 40. You know what Sacramento's at? 15. We're killing it up here. And we're doing great without this plan. So this is a start. It's adaptive. We're going to move forward. We didn't butcher it. We didn't kill it. And from what I can tell, we got one builder in town that's already doing double what our stated goal is. So we shouldn't have to worry about much. All right. Just one quick point. I mean, I can count 17 different policies that are amended just in this, and this is the second iteration of changes that have gone on here. And this one, 3K, did say ensure no net loss of canopy cover. And we have changed that to strive for, meaning that we are accepting within the bounds of this plan that we have a 3K. So we're going to have to do a lot of work to make sure that we have a net loss of canopy cover. So how is it we maintain a goal of increasing our forest canopy cover when we can't even hold an action that says that we will not have it decline? I disagree, respectfully. All right. I have a couple of questions for Mr. Gofferson. So Director, how many trees have we planted each year last year? Or how many trees did we plant last year? The first section of the grant. The first category of the grant was to plant 700. So it varies, you know, depending on development. Development helps out quite a bit. They plant a lot of trees depending on, you know, what level of development or the landscape development plan is initiated. But it varies, you know, from several hundred to close to a thousand at times. So how hard has it been to get to that 500 number each year? It could be done. It's a challenge at times, but it could be done. Okay. It's an achievable goal. Okay. All right. So we had a motion, yes? Second. So I'm going to make a substitute motion that we approve the plan with all the changes with the exception of three. So I'm not guessing. I'll get a second. But we're still going to do it. With the exception of, I think, three. B. Thank you. Leaving out the words if feasible. All right. And my motion dies for lack of a second. So I'll move on from there. All right. Thank you. So. Yep. Okay. Just one minute. So that was Morgan and Vandenberg. Council Member Bennet? Yes. Council Member Morgan? Yes. Yes. Council Member Tandon? Yes. Council Member Van Overbeck? Yes. Council Member Winslow? No. Vice Mayor Reynolds? Aye. And Mayor Coolidge? No. Carries 5-2. All right. All right. Moving on. No items posted after the agenda. Number 6. Reports and communications. The following reports and communications items are provided for the Council's information. No action will be taken on items under this section of the agenda unless the Council agrees to include it on subsequent agenda. We ask that the Council consider the item. City Manager's report, Mr. Storzman? No report. I almost said Storzman. Supposed to be Storzman, my apologies. I'm moving too fast. Council Member request pursuant to APMP 1010, Council Members may verbally request an item be agendized at a future meeting after a statement about the item would be a majority of the Council is needed in order for staff to agendize. Do we have any Council Member requests? I have one. Sean, you have your own? All right. This is a very minor thing. I was recently, I had the opportunity to talk with the Gridley City Council Member Catalina Sanchez, and then she asked me if Chico had a proclamation for June being Pride Month. And I said, well, I don't think so. And I looked at the agenda and I noticed that it wasn't, it was not here at all. And so she made, she put that on the agenda and successfully passed that in the Gridley City Council, a proclamation making June as Pride Month, which is pretty common throughout the country, just to show a little bit of support for our LGBTQ community. So I'd like to request a discussion on making June, issuing a proclamation, making June Pride Month for Steve Chico. All right. Is that a motion? Yes, that's a motion. Second. Who is the second? Me. Council Member Bennett? Yes. Council Member Morgan? No. Council Member Tandon? Yes. Council Member Van Overbeek? No. Council Member Winslow? Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds? No. And Mayor Coolidge? Aye. Carries 4-3. All right, any further Council Member requests? Okay, item 6.3, draft calendar of events is informational only, we'll move to adjourn. Please note that the next meeting is not Tuesday, 4th of July, but instead Wednesday, 5th of July at five o'clock. And we will see you then. Thank you.
