 Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you. to work with for the past, I don't know, it's been a very quick turnaround of time, maybe months or so. So I always like to start by saying thank you and Angie by saying thank you because I don't think it will be a huge improvement. I don't think it will be a huge improvement. I know that Mayor Reynolds, you said we were already so close behind. I will get those minutes back. Okay, so the plan today is, she's already done with this, and I already talked a little bit about kind of where I'm from, what she will say.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  college and have been teaching for a number of years, which will probably become somewhat  obvious throughout our process today.  Here's our timeline for today's exercise or workshop.  We'll do some introductions, which we're already in some of, some expectations.  We'll spend about the next nine minutes with media and some of that, and then we're going  to open it up for our time for public comments to be made.  When that is done, we'll come back together and I'm going to walk us through a very brief  exercise on why, so the importance of the why that we're doing, and then talk about  what strategy.  And you'll notice that as I do this work, I'm trying to do a little bit of instructions  that are all kind of on the same page, have the same understanding of where we're coming  from, where we're going.  I think that helps to, I think it leads to some better outcomes.  And then we're going to break at noon for lunch.  As I said earlier, even if I am mid-sentence, we are still going to end at noon.  We're going to end at noon for lunch, and we'll take a 30-minute break for that.  We'll come back and we'll finish up our time.  We'll do a visioning exercise.  We'll walk through some...  We're working on your audio.  It's really...  I think it's going to be back from the microphone.  Is it this one here?  I can turn this off.  Yeah.  This is on.  I don't think that's on.  Testing, testing.  Not on.  Okay.  No, no.  In the afternoon, we'll come back.  We'll do a visioning exercise, walk through the strategic choice framework, and that's  really where the work starts to take place.  What are we doing?  What are we going to focus on?  What are our big initiatives and our focused strategic goals that we'll walk through, and  then we'll do a goal-setting exercise, and we'll adjourn promptly at 3 p.m.  Okay?  So here's some ground rules.  I always like to kind of make sure that we all have a firm understanding of where we're  headed.  So everyone participates.  Everyone's voice matters.  I like to say leave some preconceived notions and assumptions by the wayside.  I think some of us walk into an exercise like this, especially if you have past experience  with a strategic plan, you think it's going to go a certain way.  And I always find...  If I can lay those by the side, sometimes it leads to some surprising outcomes, and  I hope that's the case today.  My thought is that how we approach the work today may be a little bit different from what  you've previously experienced, and in fact, I hope that's the case.  Some of the language and the verbiage that we use, you may not at first glance think  necessarily applies to this discussion, but I'll try and make a connection to how and  why it does.  And so I think if we can kind of just say, let's have an open mind in this discussion,  I think our outcomes will be even better.  There will be some items that we'll probably need to place in what we'll call the parking  lot.  We'll address them, but it might not be appropriate at the time that they come up for us to do  so, so we'll have to make a note of that.  And then what's really important, I like to right-size expectations.  I have a personal motto in my life to set my expectations low, and I'm sure to supersede  them.  So if I say we're going to accomplish 17 things today and we do four, then it's been a massive  failure.  But if I say we're going to accomplish three and we accomplish five, then it's been a success.  Right?  So it's okay for us to not accomplish everything today.  One of the things that I told all the council members, the city staff, city clerk, deputy  director in our conversations is I am not done with this process until I am told that  I am done.  So we will continue to work together to accomplish what needs to take place in this strategic  plan.  This is your workshop, and because of that, collaboration and cooperation are key.  So Mayor Reynolds, you've already described kind of the process and the meetings that  took place, so I appreciate you.  There's your two minutes back if you've already explained all those things.  I don't have to do that, so I appreciate that.  Expectations.  You have, and I think all of you in the audience have as well, a worksheet that I've typed  up.  And Angie and I frantically got printed out this morning to make sure that it was readable.  We are not going to come up with seven to 10, 15 strategic goals and objectives today.  That can't be the goal.  We have a very limited amount of time to work together.  So what I would say is our success looks like somewhere between three and five strategic  goals going forward.  And the time frame we're going to look at them, and this will make more sense, we'll  do an exercise after lunch.  We're looking at the immediate need.  We're looking at the short term, so a two-year time frame, and the long term, which really  isn't that long, but the four-year term.  The thing that's important as we walk through those kind of steps to get to the immediate,  the two, and the four, we don't get to the four unless we get to the two.  We don't get to the two.  We get to the immediate.  And what we're doing here, what I appreciate about how this is structured is that we are  having a discussion that ties directly to budget.  That's really key in this process.  And so often, I will work on projects like this, and it might be an afterthought that  budget comes up, but it's not the leading force to the discussion.  And so I think that's a really key component, and I appreciate that, that that's how it's  been designed today so we can actually tie our goals to budget as we go through that  process to then put before us.  And effectively, effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively  effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively  effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively  effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively  effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively  effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively  effectively effectively effectively effectively  effectively  effectively  And so that's the beauty of a conversation like this is we get to collaborate and we get to compromise and cooperate.  A founder of my company, Brent Morrison, likes to say in follow-up to this comment, he says, however, you can make all the people mad all the time.  And I hope that that's not the case today.  So with those introductory comments, we'd like to now open it up for public comments.  And I think we'll have some direction there and we'll come back together and we'll finish out before we go to lunch.  Thanks again for having me.  All right.  So this is time for public comment.  Be sure to fill in your send in your speaker card since we're doing this in the beginning.  Just want to give everybody an extra second.  If you want to get a speaker card in, go ahead and do that now.  And then I will turn it over to Miss Presson to do we have any speakers?  We do.  We have three so far.  And then if anyone else wants to address, obviously, they can get it in.  We'll bend our rules just a hair today.  Okay.  And I'll go ahead and call the first.  Two speakers, Bob Mulholland, followed by Charles with whom.  Bob Mulholland here.  Just your comment about the budget.  I would make pre-burning a top budget.  Under this Republican controlled council last week, our sales tax has gone up 12 percent.  Sewer fees have been doubled.  And last summer, I guess the city manager decided to argue for a payback.  And then we got the park park, which destroyed for hassle.  So I would urge a five-year freeze on the top management salaries and pay packages as well as at Los Angeles City Attorney's Office.  If we don't have money to cut a few weeks, there's a problem here at City Hall.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Charles.  Thank you.  North State Shelter Team's managed campground proposal accommodates 12 unsheltered locals.  It is drawn from successful programs to address our shelter crisis one step at a time.  According to the data, typically, crime goes down or is unaffected by similar programs.  I would say safety is one of our number one goals.  You want a safer Chico?  Have a safe place for more people to be at night and you will have safer streets.  The managed campground is for unsheltered local people who pass a case manager's interview  process, a background check, and sign a participant's agreement.  They are participants in a program without residential rights, and so eviction can be  a quick process.  After four years of meeting with the city manager, we have a new program that is  a step up in the game.  We are aware of many unsheltered people, many of them elderly women, who have an income,  just not enough to rent a room.  Participants would pay a monthly fee to have a safe and secure place to sleep at night  that would be a stepping stone to getting their lives back together, to get back with  their families or back into subsidized housing or some other chat program.  It's too shocking.  It's too shocking to expect people who've been out on the street to go right into one  of the big managed, one of the big shelters that we have now.  Over 100 people each, it's intimidating.  Just doesn't work.  Under reported story number 21 for Project Censored, nearly half of unhoused people are  employed.  Leaving someone on the street, according to a university survey, costs us about $14,000  a year.  That's the amount of money that we taxpayers pay.  The cost at Opportunity Village per person is about $2,000 a year that the participant  pays.  I would say after safety, wise use of taxpayer money is a valuable goal.  And right now, we can use some work in that regard, I suggest.  North State Shelter Team has studied managed campground proposals in San Diego, Portland,  Denver.  San Rafael, Culver City, and Seattle.  And we have letters of support from eight other local nonprofit organizations.  We can have safer streets with less to spare and save money doing it.  Thank you.  Thank you, Charles.  Ken Smith followed by Patrizia.  Good morning.  Ken Smith here representing Chico Firefighters 2734 as the president for the last 10 years.  I'm a member of the Chico Firefighters.  I've been working really hard to emphasize exactly what our consultant opened up with  about this being a very specific strategic planning process towards the budget.  And we just want to make sure that we're here available to you to express how much of an  immediate need Engine 1 downtown is.  We don't have a pumper downtown.  We've got a pump.  We've got effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively  effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively  effectively effectively effectively effectively  effectively  to try to come up with a plan to implement engine one as a pumping engine at your downtown fire station.  It's an absolute void that is monumental.  We have such a high-risk profile down here with the college and the old VIX  and the downtown, you know, unprotected downtown structures.  We run simply just the ladder truck, right?  We've all had conversations about its job tasks and its capabilities.  Bottom line is we don't have a water pumping fire engine at station one.  Let's keep it that simple.  We put three bodies on there, and we're running engine one, truck one.  We're ready to fight.  That's the bottom line.  So I'm really excited about this whole strategic planning process.  I've just been part of a bunch of them.  Sometimes it's hard to break down those biases before you start really.  You're thinking outside and listening to other ideas.  But by the end of the day, with any strategic planning process I've been in,  it's always been successful at the end when we all work together and move forward.  So I appreciate it. Thank you.  Thank you, Ken.  Patrizia is our last speaker.  Thank you very much.  Sorry, Patrizia Hieronymus, Executive Director of Butte Environmental Council.  Hi, Bryce.  There.  That's better.  I think I can see everyone.  I'm coming to you today as a constituent who was raised in Oroville, California, here in Butte County.  I moved around a lot to try to find some relief from the drought that I grew up in and ended up in the Pacific Northwest.  Now I'm back.  And I get to lead an organization that's a nonprofit.  And as you may or may not know, funding is dire right now in our current circumstances.  And I implore you to look at this budget responsibly.  And invest in Butte County.  And I mean that in the simplest of terms, in our urban canopy, in our waters, our air, our soils.  We got to go on a tour of groundwater-dependent ecosystems yesterday with Audubon California and the Nature Conservancy.  And we're looking at interbasin modeling and streams and rivers.  And this is what we have to protect here in Chico.  Our tributaries are legendary.  We have one of the last spring run Chinook salmon runs here at Butte Creek.  And I just implore you to look at this.  And I implore you to spend as much as you can investing in what makes Chico special in Butte County.  And that's our water.  And just take a loving embrace of everything that we have and pour everything that you have into it.  That's my one just constituent request because we know how vital it is.  And we have seen what's happened when we dropped that water table down.  And we don't want that to happen here.  And that's why I'm here today is just to come.  And ask you to just remember the land, air, and water.  And invest, please.  Thank you.  Thank you.  She's our final speaker.  All right.  With that, I will turn it back over to Jeff.  And we'll get a little bit of work done before we head into lunch.  Well, thank you for the comments.  I appreciate the opportunity we have to speak, to be vocal, to share.  I appreciate the opportunity that's provided for our folks from City of Chico to do that today.  This is a little bit smaller print here, but I'd like to start a process with this Dilbert cartoon.  You'll notice that while this is very serious work that we're doing at the same time, I try to bring some humor because I think that that helps to just make things more enjoyable.  And you can see this says, make your report consistent with our strategic plan.  I just told, what's our strategic plan?  In response, it's a secret.  Are you serious?  Are you saying you don't trust me?  I don't think it's a coincidence that most employee sabotage is done by employees.  How can I do my report if I don't know the strategy?  Okay, okay, I'll let you glance at it.  Time's up.  That's not enough.  That's the warranty for your chair.  Really?  I've been managing to this for years.  And so there's a couple of shuffles that come with that.  Why do I do this?  Because I think so often, if we're honest about it, this is how, maybe not this extreme, but folks do manage to a strategic plan that's akin to the way we do it.  We have a guarantee for a chair.  We have these ideas.  You've probably heard it said that hope is not a strategy.  We hope that things will become better.  We hope that we'll see improvement.  We hope that these things will accomplish.  But if we're not planning strategically, then it's nothing more than just hope.  And we want hope.  We need hope.  Hope is essential.  But I would argue it's not an either or.  It's a both and.  Let's hope and let's plan.  So I did a strategic plan earlier with another governmental organization earlier this year.  And some of the constituents that we spoke with had some questions.  And some of the constituents had some really great comments.  And I want to share this one with us as we launch into where we're headed the rest of our time.  And you can see this on the screen.  This is in the handouts that you have.  And I'll read this for you.  It says, having a strategic plan is a great way to check priorities and progress.  Remember to always plan the work and work the plan.  Everything cannot be a high priority and an immediate need.  Having goals is always a great thing to strive for.  But taking into account the resources and funding available, make priorities real and attainable.  At the end of our time, we're going to flip the header of this slide.  We're planning the work.  And as we leave, we're going out to work the plan.  It has to be both.  And so I love, I wish I could say that I was responsible for this quote.  I'm not.  Someone else who's very invested in their government agency had these very wise words to share.  And I think it's helpful for us to think about.  As I mentioned, I teach at Butte College.  And as someone who's spent the last 20 plus years in the academy, I can't help but do some teaching when I'm in the middle of a pandemic.  And I think that's a great thing to do when it comes to a process and a project like this.  In fact, I had a strategic plan that I conducted last year.  And the board chair told the president, we liked the results, but we didn't like the consultant.  And I was waiting for the why.  Okay, so why is that?  And he said because he was far too academic.  And I thought to myself, guilty as charged?  If that's the worst thing I've ever been called in the day, then I think I'm okay with that.  But I want to do a little bit of instruction and teaching.  So we all are on the same page and understand what it is we're trying to accomplish today.  So Porter, some years back, wrote a book on strategy.  And he looks at these three different areas of what strategy, these generic strategy areas can be.  We look at cost leadership.  We look at differentiation.  And we look at focus.  And on its face, you might look at this and go, what does this have to do with us today?  We're a municipality.  We're a city government.  We're a city council.  But I think these three items here have everything to do with what our goal is in the conversation today.  If you take cost leadership, everything is public.  And so you just heard a number of comments about budget and where funding should go.  And so we think about how are we leading as a council, how are we leading as an entity, a municipality for the city of Chico?  Knowing that we have a responsibility and accountability to the people of Chico to use our funds wisely.  So it is very much a strategy to think about how do we provide cost leadership to the community.  The second piece here.  So this is a little bit more of a !  And then the third area we want to look at is focus.  And I think it kind of builds off of the second area of differentiation of we need to be laser focused on what's most important.  You know, I know that I was reading through on the city council website.  I was away for a number of years.  Born and raised in Chico but left to live in Los Angeles and in the state of Colorado for close to 20 years total.  Came back three years ago.  And since being away, I've been much more in tune with what's happening at the council level.  And really interested in the work that y'all are doing.  And looking at the district team and realizing that while the district are, you were voted in and you represent the district, this conversation is looking at the focus of the entire city.  The community of how we serve and we service best the city of Chico.  And so while you look at these three things and maybe they could be applied to business, absolutely, I would argue that they 100% apply to the conversation we're having today.  If you take it on this next slide, you'll see the strategy is a creation of unique and valuable position involving a different set of activities.  And the conversation that we need to have today, I think that starts where we go is figuring out what of these three categories is it that we are covering.  Are we serving the few needs of many customers or in this case citizens?  Are we serving broad needs of few customers, again in this case citizens?  Or are we serving broad needs of many citizens in a narrow market?  Okay.  So we're going to start with the broad needs of many citizens.  And as we talked about in our conversation, you'll recall, especially council members as I asked questions, what's the one thing that's most important to you?  And do you believe that something needs to be given up or sacrificed or compromised in order for you to get that one thing?  Strategy requires us to make tradeoffs.  We have to figure out what is it that we want to do and in return we sometimes have to figure out what is it that we can't do or we shouldn't do.  And then of course strategy involves creating fit amongst, in this case, the literature says,  companies but in your case the organizations, the entities, the councils, activities.  What we're being asked to do, does it fit within our purview?  And so I want to provide just some foundational ideas of making sure that we're approaching things properly to get to our desired outcomes.  Some of you may be familiar with Peter Drucker, some in the room as well.  I worked at the Drucker School for a number of years down in Los Angeles.  Drucker was considered by many to be kind of the grandfather or the godfather, if you will, of modern day management.  Drucker was doing things beyond what other folks were doing at the time and now graduate management schools are taking credit for what Drucker was doing 30, 40 years ago.  And he asked these questions in a book and I brought a copy of it here called The Five Most Important Questions You Will Ever Ask About Your Organization.  And the questions are here and I want us to be thinking through these questions.  In fact, if you look at the handout that was given to you, these questions are on the final page.  Because these questions are crucial to the overall conversation as we think about it.  And I want us to think about our strategic goals going forward.  What is our mission?  What is it that we have been called to do?  I asked each of you, why is it that you first, in the first place, why did you run for city council?  Why did you want to do this work?  And each of you had a very unique answer, as I would imagine that you would.  A number of you had a very clear impetus.  Like there was this one moment that said, this is why I ran.  Because of X.  So what is the mission of the council?  And what do we know in some ways?  In fact, I'm going to show you a slide here in a little bit that I don't know if it's necessarily specifically the mission of Chico,  but certainly what's on the home page.  We'll then look at who is our customer?  In this case, we could look at this, who is our citizen, right?  So it's the city of Chico.  What is our customer value?  Again, what do our citizens value?  And then what are our results?  What are our desired results in this whole thing?  And as we're doing today then, the question, what is our plan?  So as we prepare for our break for lunch, we have 30 minutes left.  I want to spend some time talking through this.  And I know that this print is very small.  And so I apologize if you can't see it, but I'm going to read this for you.  And then I'm going to go through a couple of other slides.  We're going to have a brief discussion that will lead us into our 12 o'clock lunch.  Some of you may be familiar with this.  Simon Sinek, he wrote a book and he has a TED Talk.  Oftentimes you can just watch the TED Talk from a lot of these folks and it saves you time from reading the book.  This is a good book, but I would say just watch the TED Talk.  And he talks about the why.  And you can see this.  He says, every organization on the planet knows what they do.  These are products they sell or the services they offer.  So some organizations know how they do it.  These are the things that make them special or set them apart from their competition.  But then he goes on and says, very few organizations know why they do what they do.  Why is not about making money.  That's a result.  Why is a purpose, a cause or belief.  It's the very reason your organization exists.  And I heard very clearly from each of you as we had those conversations that you have a why as to why you're sitting up there in the dais.  Why you're doing the work that you're doing.  The question then we have to look at is what's the why of the council?  What's the mission of the council?  Is there agreement upon that?  Because I think in some ways the answer is yes.  We want to see Chico flourish.  We want to see Chico thrive.  We want to see Chico thrive.  We want to see Chico healthy.  All those different things.  And I can throw those ideas out.  But ultimately I'm not on the council.  You are.  And so the discussion that we want to start with today is what's our why?  I want to give you one more thing to think through here.  Simon Sinek goes on and he gives an example of Apple.  So I don't know how many of you have an Apple phone, watch, iPad, computer.  I don't know.  Go down the list of all the things that are available.  I can go down the list of the things.  In fact, I did this morning thinking through everything that I have in my house.  And I am sad to say beholden to the almighty Apple in my family.  He goes like this.  He says, let's talk about Apple.  He says, why?  The purpose.  This is a question that says what is your cause?  What do you believe?  In Apple, the answer is we believe in challenging the status quo and doing things differently.  The how is the process.  Specific actions taken to realize the why for Apple.  Our products are beautifully designed and easy to use.  And then what?  The results.  What do you do?  The result of your why.  Where is the proof?  And in Apple, at least when he was writing the book, the answer for his why, for their  why, was we make computers.  But they no longer just make computers.  They make phones and watches and tablets and everything else that we have talked through.  But what is unique and important about Apple is their why stayed the same.  Their why has been consistent throughout.  So I have a question.  So I have there in front of you, the first page, you have this, these three concentric  circles, the why, the how, and the what.  And I want us to briefly talk through what this looks like as far as what's the why of  what we're doing.  What's our purpose here?  Maybe jot some notes down.  But I'd love to hear from you.  So we have just out loud.  So I know that you probably talk through these things.  But here we are in a strategic planning session.  I want us to talk about our why.  What's the purpose of what we do here?  And how will that then inform the conversation we have going forward?  So we have three concentric circles.  And I want us to talk about the why, the how, and the what of what the council is to  do for the city of Chico.  So maybe jot some notes down.  I will say that this is the first time I've done a strategic plan that's been recorded.  So it's a little awkward in that there's folks potentially, in fact, my mom said, what time  is this session?  And I was like, oh, it's so early.  But take some time and jot down some ideas.  What's the why?  What's the purpose of the council?  I'd love for you then to share out so we can kind of have some uniform understanding  of what it is that we're doing here today.  So I'm going to start with the why.  And then I'll inform the rest of our conversation.  So take maybe three minutes.  We won't have any background music.  And then I'll call us back and we'll share out.  END END  END  END  END  END  END  END  END  END  END  Just take another minute or two.  All right.  I apologize to those in the audience who can't see what we're writing here,  but I promise you we're writing things down.  Okay.  So, counsel, what are your notes?  What are your thoughts?  What did you jot down?  What's the why, the purpose?  What are the goals of the city council?  Do you want all of them or one?  Just throw them out.  We're going to write them down.  Because, again, what we're doing here is we're building a case,  as we think strategically about what goals are there.  We have to tie it back and say, well,  does that fit within the framework of our purpose as a council?  Okay.  I came up with, I'll start.  I came up with like four.  I said my why is our constituents, our businesses, our quality of life,  our community.  Our future generations.  Great.  And our parks and beauty.  And if you can't read what I write, that's okay.  My handwriting is so bad.  When I was seven years old, none of you care about me.  I don't tell the story.  Anyway, I wrote down a list of who I wanted to invite to my birthday party.  And even at seven, I couldn't read my own handwriting.  And I couldn't remember who I wanted to come to my birthday party.  So, I apologize.  And if you're on the list,  people that are supposed to be invited to my birthday party.  So, anyway, that's all.  So, I can read this now.  So, these are great.  Thank you.  And you said parks and beauty.  Yeah.  What else?  So, in a broad sense, the way I look at this,  we make decisions for the betterment of our community,  starting with safety.  And I think that's a great point.  And I think that's a great point.  I wrote down access to housing, safe transportation, and high quality of life.  And that our city should invest in what makes it unique, sustainable, and joyful.  You said unique, sustainable, and joyful.  And joyful.  And joyful.  Beautiful is also an alternate term.  It's alternative, but I love that there's two.  There's things.  One is beautiful.  And also it's joyful.  I appreciate that.  So, I think the why needs to be simple.  OK.  I mean, you look at apples it's a simple sentence.  And my view of it is that the role of the city council is to optimize the quality of civic life.  OK.  Period.  And then the rest of that stuff is the how.  Great.  Mm-hmm.  Love it.  Thank you.  Appreciate that. What else?  These are all great.  What I love about this is so much is built in.  So we have the conversation.  We go, this, this, this, this.  And then we have the let's simplify.  Let's tear it down.  But then we also want to look at where we have common language.  So I've heard now at least three times quality of life.  So our goal at the City Council is to enhance, to optimize.  I love the word optimization.  Optimize civic quality of life.  What a great mission to have.  What else?  I put to address citizen resource gaps in transportation, service, accessibility, safety, et cetera.  Because I know I can't think of it all right now.  And I also put strives for unbiased opportunity for all residents to access municipal services.  And also be guided by the people who are closest to the roadblocks at hand.  So I think that's a great thing to do.  Any else?  I landed on the future generations piece.  We want Chico to thrive further into the future than we can imagine now.  Like making decisions that impact people a hundred years down the line or more.  That's great.  Future generations.  Say that again.  .  We can imagine that.  We can imagine that.  Yeah.  We want Chico to thrive, you know, have optimized civic life, those terms, further into the  future than we can imagine right now.  Great.  Keep the public safe and secure.  Okay. [inaudible]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  And so we look at this, and just off the top of my head, I'm going to go back through this, and we're going to revisit this again in the afternoon.  Because this will inform the conversation.  Again, what are those goals?  So we talked three or four of you, quality of life.  Three or four of you, safety.  Three or four of you, accessibility.  So we want opportunities.  Even some of the comments that were made, how did that impact the future?  We want these resources to be available for future generations.  So when you look at all of this, I hope that you hear, I hope that we hear such commonality in the discussion.  I think so often you have this, again, the commonality, let's leave kind of preconceived ideas out.  We think that in politics, we have to have these divides.  We have to have opposition.  We have to have people that we are opposed against, rather than let's work together.  And I think what we've just done in this whole case right here, it's very short.  I mean, so.  Seven minutes.  But this is a great case study that says, hey, look at the things that we have in common.  And how can we work together to accomplish them?  And maybe you have some difference as far as where we head with that, how we do that.  But if you look at simplicity, public safety, accessibility, quality of life, all those things get into it.  And we want Chico, and I can think about this personally, as someone who is now in his mid-40s, grew up here.  I had an amazing childhood growing up in this city.  And I left with no kids and came back with four kids.  Why is this process so important?  Because all of what you just talked about, I wanted to say it for my kids.  In fact, to add something to your point, I want my kids to have a better experience than I have.  So I appreciate this, and we'll come back to this.  I want us to spend a couple more minutes, unless there are other comments that we want to be made.  This is not just something we're going to fly over and be done with.  Any other thoughts before we go on?  Yeah, I think it's important to differentiate between quality of life and quality.  Quality of civic life.  People can interpret quality of life as, I want a nice place to ride my bike.  Civic life encompasses, is a much broader concept.  And it applies to everyone.  Will you elaborate on that?  Yeah.  Yeah, so I think, so first of all, we're talking about the things that the city council can't control, right?  So what can we control?  And this is when we get into the how, and I don't want to get, but things like, well, safety, infrastructure, the texture of life.  So the park and the downtown, the things that make Chico special, right?  And as opposed, to me, quality of life is an individually focused concept.  Quality of my life is different than what you would think of, Addison, maybe.  Right.  Whereas civic life implies you're thinking about it holistically for the whole community.  Okay.  That's great.  Yeah.  You're thinking about a micro versus a macro, right?  So individual quality of life leads to the potential macro level civic quality of life.  Is that fair?  Good.  Something that makes me think of, too, that maybe is missing from the conversation, but we agree on, is that civic life does involve the community.  And so community engagement is part of that.  And it's really that we're a democratic society.  And while we want things to be good, we want it to be good in a way that everybody participates in it being that.  And, you know, mentioned, like, accessibility.  But accessibility of, like, co-creating our future.  Yeah.  I think it's worth listing democracy or something on there.  That's great.  Yeah.  And I love this idea of co-creation.  I never want to do things on my own.  I think we're all better together than I am.  Yeah.  And effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively  And right there in the top left, we see this.  It says, a safe place to live in the family,  an ideal location for business, and a career place to live.  We talked about a lot of these things already.  Those were mentioned.  So I wanted to be safe.  We wanted to be a place for businesses,  our constituents, a career place to live, individually,  but also .  And so as we make these decisions going forward,  this is going to be the front and center of our conversation.  Oh.  I think I'm going to want to proceed.  I want to skip ahead to this.  Because I told Dale that I was going to have this slide.  So I jumped ahead a little bit.  So strategic planning can be done  a number of different ways.  And so I appreciate the candor that was shared  in these interviews that we had.  And one of the things, Dale, I hope it's OK,  our conversation, I told you I was not going  to have spot analysis of this.  So strengths.  We have strengths.  Weaknesses.  Opportunities.  We can do that.  But it's just not applicable in this conversation.  This is such a different, unique, much like Chico,  is a different, unique place.  This discussion that we're having the next three hours  now has to be different and unique because it fits  within the community that you all serve.  That's different and unique.  When you look at a spot analysis, which we're not doing,  don't worry, you look at the strengths, weaknesses,  and the things that are existing currently,  and you plan according to that.  Why are we doing this?  We're doing this because this is a strength of ours.  Or we're doing this because this is a weakness of ours.  Or we're doing this because there's an opportunity in front of us.  We're doing this because there's a threat that we're facing.  This only tells part of the story.  And that part of the story is the here and now.  When you look at SWOT, that's the first part of,  and everybody likes to come up with these acronyms  and these fancy little phrases like gap analysis.  So what's the gap analysis?  This is where we are, where we want to be,  how we feel in the gap.  So the gap analysis, you use that,  is you take a SWOT, but then you apply the SOARs.  The strengths, the opportunities, the aspirations, and the results.  What's really important in a strategic planning process  is we look at the aspirations and the results.  It goes back to this question here that Drucker asked.  What are our results and what is our plan?  We all know that there are things that we want to accomplish.  I asked you those questions.  The time you're done within your term,  I think all of you know TBD as far as what the future looks like,  but we know there's time still left in your current terms.  And so what do you want to accomplish?  What do you want to accomplish as a whole in this council,  in those time frames?  Again, we look at 4, 2, and we look at 0 and 1.  We have this aspiration of what success looks like.  And we talked about that individually,  what success looks like.  Today is when we're actually meditating the plan.  So you have these aspirations.  I want this to be accomplished.  What does that look like?  Then we have to figure out how do we accomplish those realities.  In the afternoon, we're going to walk through,  after we do what I'm going to call a visioning exercise,  and have you actually envision,  kind of think through what does Chico look like  four years from now, two years from now,  zero to one years from now.  I'm not saying let's create this utopia by any means,  but I'm saying let's create this utopia by any means,  but I'm saying what are your desired outcomes?  If we look out in the future and we say we've accomplished  X, Y, and Z over the next, like I said,  zero to one, zero to two, zero to four years,  is that what success looks like?  So if we say our desired future is four years from now,  we have to then work backwards in order to accomplish that.  Because as much as we're saving a budget for the next fiscal year,  we know that things don't happen overnight, correct?  You have a plan.  You say, I need to accomplish this.  I wish, I think we all agree,  we all wish that Bruce Road happened overnight.  But it takes a while.  In fact, it takes a long while to do it right.  And so we want to go through that process  and think through what does that future look like  and how do we work backwards?  So we're going to break through much here.  Actually, we're going to end a little bit early if that's okay.  But the bulk of our discussion will take place  in a few minutes.  I'm making more time for that after lunch.  Here's what I'd like you to do.  I know you've already written this down,  but on that worksheet that I gave you,  if there are things that you want to hone a little bit  on the why of the council,  I ask you to kind of wordspin that a little bit.  But more importantly,  I'll give you a preview of where we're headed.  I want to step in through,  and you'll notice this from the Chico State campus,  today besides tomorrow.  As a Chico State grad myself, 2003 alma mater,  I looked at that statement and I said,  I love that statement until I realized  that I don't necessarily fully agree with it.  And that's not a mock against the university that I'm in,  I think it's only partially correct.  Today doesn't necessarily decide tomorrow.  Today informs tomorrow.  So the decisions that are made today  will have impact, they'll resonate,  they'll have a ripple effect into the future.  And so I'm glad actually that today doesn't decide tomorrow  because if I make a terrible decision today,  I then have tomorrow to rectify that decision.  But certainly it's something that informs my tomorrow.  It informs the future that we all envision  and we want for the city of Chico,  for future generations.  I think as you said,  to thrive even more so than we ever imagined.  So we'll come back,  I want you to just in your mind be thinking through that.  Again that timeframe,  four, two, and zero to one years.  What does success look like?  And I want us to then frame the conversation this afternoon  around those three ideas.  And what are our big, we'll call them big rocks.  What are these three to five strategic goals  that we'll walk away with?  And if we're being especially aggressive  in our conversation today,  and I don't mean that in a bad way,  but we're going to feel bad about it,  we will attempt to come up with those goals  and the objectives.  So it's just, it's one thing to come up with ideas.  Like this is great,  we want to do all these different things.  But then the question is how?  Right, keeping it at the center,  why we do them,  what is it we're doing,  and how do we then do these things?  Because here's the thing,  I should have said it again,  and I didn't.  Again, I'm glad today is inside tomorrow  because I forget things sometimes.  Just like right now, actually.  This can't be just some ethereal,  pine sky, philosophical,  theoretical conversation that ends  after we've talked today.  This has to be a living document,  a guiding principle document that says,  I think even in the interview that's being done,  we're going to put it on the side of the chambers.  And it's going to be the thing that we look to  and say these are our priorities going forward.  It gives us a framework,  kind of a lens to look through and say,  does what we're attempting to do fit within  those priorities right now?  And if it doesn't,  why is it going to talk about it?  It doesn't mean we shouldn't,  but we have conversation,  we can reference back to what was said  and what's been told to us in that process.  And the project we're working on.  I tell every client I work with,  all this is is a document that's going to sit on the shelf  and never waste each other's time writing it.  This can't be just that.  It has to be something that's living,  maybe not breathing,  but certainly alive,  and directs us into the future.  I think if we have that mindset,  we're going to have a very successful conversation.  And I think we'll get even a little bit closer  to that in the future.  Our future generations will thrive more  than we can ever imagine.  So, I'd love to have you see one of the great  proof of your good.  Okay.  It's called 1225.  And then we'll begin the conversation.  Okay, thank you.  All right, that was quick.  And she can tell me why it's not going to work  the way that I want it to.  Or we can have those conversations and say,  have you thought about it this way?  And I think that's the sign of actually  a really good, healthy relationship.  You can have an open dialogue like that.  So, as we move into this afternoon's session,  I want us to, maybe not five years,  but certainly think through,  what does the future look like?  And so, I asked you just to give a little bit of thought.  Four years, two years,  and then an immediate zero to one years,  especially as we set budget for this next fiscal year.  I also, before I'll head there in a second,  I also will say, I'm used to doing a process like this,  and I was talking with some folks in the audience  over the lunch break, and we'll sit down at a table,  and we'll table together, and it's a,  maybe you could say a warm environment,  one, the temperatures, but two,  there isn't kind of the separation of desks.  And so, I realize that sometimes this isn't the most conducive  for kind of that more, I don't know, warm conversation.  So, given that reality,  I think we've already had a warm conversation.  But just, I like to call out the awkward,  that sometimes it's not as maybe user-friendly  as we'd like it to be.  So, I hope that we can, even though it's being recorded,  there's people watching, and there's folks sitting on the sides,  and there's all sorts of people engaged,  I just want us to, in the next three hours together,  really engage in conversation,  kind of let our hair down a little bit,  if you feel comfortable in doing that.  It's okay to laugh, I'll tell some jokes,  they're gonna be bad, they're not gonna land well,  I promise you that.  But every now and again, maybe one will.  But if we want to really accomplish things,  that's, I think, the attitude and the approach we need to take.  So, maybe you already thought about this,  but I want us to take time right now,  and I want us to actually have a discussion  about what Chico's goal is,  what Chico looks like,  what's her desired future?  Oftentimes, if I'm doing a project like this,  I would ask the question,  what does success look like?  And I think that's a form of a question  that we could ask here.  If you think about, in four years from now,  given all that we've discussed,  all the things that we believe is our purpose as a council,  what we want to accomplish for the city,  the combination of what we should do  and maybe the things we have to say no to,  what is the desired future for you,  what does success look like in four years?  And I want you to work backwards from that.  And then I want you to think,  okay, so that's in four years.  Jot that down.  And then I want you to do the same exercise,  but think through two years.  And the reason I'm doing it in these increments of two  is there's a number of you that your term ends in two years.  A number of you, your term ends in four years, right?  So it just kind of makes sense for it to go that process.  You can write that down on the back of the handout.  But then in the immediate,  what's most pressing right now?  So we have a budget, what is it,  fiscal year starts July 1.  So July 1, budget's approved.  And we're talking about things that are going to that very budget,  the things that were even public comment made  as far as things that they're asking about and asking for.  So what's the immediate that you'd say,  in the next year, I hope that we can accomplish X?  And then what do we need to do to work backwards from there?  But I want you to have this picture  of what your individual desired future is.  And then I want us to come back together  and talk about it.  So it is 1236.  I'd like us to take seven minutes to do that, okay?  So at 1233, I want you to share out.  So think about your desired future for four years from now,  two years from now, and zero to one year from now, okay?  And a lot of discussion.  As we all talk through these things, I'll jot them down.  And basically what we're doing is we're looking at,  just like we did with the Y, here's what I'm hearing,  here's where there's agreement, and that's where our focus is.  So four years, two years.  So Jeff, I have a question.  Are you looking for conceptual things  or more specific things like we're going to fix the potholes?  Yes.  Okay.  And you'll notice I'll be a little bit vague  because I want you to come up with how you hear that question.  So it could be conceptual and it could be specific  because what we're going to go into  is likely going to be a combination of both, right?  We have a conceptual,  but then we have to get into the nitty-gritty.  We have to get into the nitty-gritty  and figure out what's the actual technical work  that needs to take place to make that happen, okay?  Great question.  Thanks for clarifying.  So now it's 1237, so we'll come back at 1245, okay?  So that's eight minutes from now.  Four years, two years, zero to one years.  END  END  END  END  END  END  END  END  END  END  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you. I want my 10 year old grandkids to be able to ride their bikes in the Bidwell Park safely and not not me have to worry about them.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you. And that will only happen if we get the homeless people in shelters. So in four years they'll be 14? Sorry? In four years they'll be 14? Yeah, but I have a six year old. Okay, so I'm going to put grandkids.  I have a utopian vision to share I put the city will build upon existing projects that we know  work to mitigate disasters and increase our disaster resilience I put flood risk mitigated  through floodplain restoration projects like we see in verbena fields that would also reduce our  groundwater deficit and also expanding upon our controlled burns which we also do burns  we already have the goats reducing fuels in lower park and we have fire breaks  but there are plenty of grants out there that I think California  California  would love more cities to jump upon  what else so I've got go ahead  it might might be good for other ones to like go in a line or something I don't know  um okay uh okay so I have a little  list people can afford to live here and pursue their passions downtown is thriving with local  businesses uh there's a lower age of first-time home buyers on average lower rate of pedestrian  and bicyclist collisions more students walking back to school sorry I should read slower  I want to get all these so whoops  okay so affordable housing downtown thriving uh lower first-time homebuyer age  okay  younger age first time perfect um lower rate of pedestrian and bicycle collisions  or safer streets too vision zero just be bold you know vision zero is a fine way to summarize it  but not everybody knows what that is um more students walking back to school okay  sorry I have a lot of these I don't know you didn't limit the numbers but I'm going to go with the number one  uh-huh  um  this is your time right  all right uh more of our streets in the core of the city are rehabilitated or repaved  I should have written these shorter yeah fix the potholes  okay the next one's Katie kind of got these lower risk of wildfire and flooding  okay um sustained urban forest health  higher civic engagement and transparency  and I think Tom got my last one of homelessness solved  four years let's go  okay all right  okay  okay  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  thank you that'  s union  north star to determine your  course and talk about some of  those details later I have safe  streets and parks and safe  neighborhoods and thriving  businesses and premier education  and ample housing and  recreational opportunities.  I think it'  s really hard to boil things  down in some ways.  I agree with all the policies  and priorities that are  identified here.  We talk about controlled burns  and we face a challenge of  wildfire risk and in four years  we want to feel like we have  addressed that challenge so much  so that other communities look  to us for answers.  We have a challenge of danger on  the street whether it'  s from homeless people or from  car traffic and people getting  killed on the street still.  We want to look back in four  years and say we significantly  addressed this problem and other  communities are looking to us for  answers.  That'  s something about policy making  approach in general.  I'  m thinking by July 1st we have  an idea for how we'  re going to go forward to  address these challenges in a  substantial way.  In two years we'  re going to be fine-tuning  based on our experience in the  last two years and in four years  we'  Again you just laid out what  the hope is in this exercise.  We want it to be built upon but  we have to start with what the  four-year north start, this big  macro idea looks like and let'  s build into the micros of  actually how we do that.  Knowing that we don'  t get to four years without two  years and without one year.  We have to start somewhere.  Obviously you'  re already doing the work but  now we'  re getting it more.  What we'  re doing is we'  re taking the funnel in a lot  of ways.  My drawing is going to be  worse than my writing so my  apologies but you get the idea.  We'  re throwing it into it.  This is not where we end though.  Where we end is down here where  we kind of squeeze things out  and say here'  s our focus.  We'  re already seeing that there'  e lots of synergies around what'  s being talked about.  The question will continue on  for four years but the next  question is what'  s different in two years?  I think what you just kind of  got at was we'  re going to fine-tune it so we'  can get to that four-year  time because we have to work  backwards.  We'  re going to have to work  re going to have to work  We'  re going to have to work  s it going to look like?  What else?  One thing I don'  t know it was explicitly  said yet but I'  m sure it'  s on everybody'  s mind is it'  s like being an affordable  place to live.  Sometimes we talk about that  in the past tense.  It used to be affordable or  it'  s kind of we'  re losing it.  I think in four years it'  ould be nice to say that'  s something we just have.  Anything else?  I had downtown is in progress  and it'  in four years?  Yes. It better be.  In progress.  We're not talking about what the streets and roads  are going to look like.  Whatever is envisioned  for downtown, it's actually happening  in four years because we've got to apply for grants  and get due all the public speaking.  So we're talking about the downtown thriving.  It's going to be a different style of here because this is  the reimagination  of the downtown. Yeah, it's going to be redone  because we have to do the sewer and all that.  So my vision is in  four years that that's happening  because I went from the zero to four.  So the other one  is businesses are thriving and growing.  And that's not just in downtown. That's all of Chico.  Especially downtown.  But all of Chico.  And city spending  slash budget  continues to  be  in balance and  with good reserve.  And amazing staff running  those departments.  However you want to put that.  But we've made great progress there.  I would want it to be in four years that we're doing as well, if not better.  So budget  continues to be in balance and continue  to deploy retention.  Yes.  Anything else?  I have one more.  I put arts and culture hub of the north state.  I'm not ambitious, but we could be it.  I'm putting it down here at the very bottom of it  as least proportionate.  I understand.  Do you want to go there?  Great.  So that four years,  what I hear from you,  those are all very realistic  in a lot of ways.  I don't think anything, you know,  I was imagining coming in with my kind of  ideas of examples of what, you know,  I want to, you know,  what could we all,  in fact, me personally,  I want to, you know,  I'm not basically a soccer stadium.  We're going professional baseball team.  These things are way outside the scope, right?  We're not going to talk about that in this conversation.  But what's going to talk about here,  these are very realistic.  And what I appreciate all the more  is it's not even, we need downtown to be done.  We're being realistic about our timing.  It takes a long time.  We have to acknowledge.  So even as we get into what are these strategic priorities,  we, in order for downtown to make progress,  you just talk,  we need to talk about the objectives that need to take place, right?  We need to run grants.  We need to work with X, Y, Z organizations,  collaboration, we need to get contractors,  all the different work that takes place.  That's the need to create.  Those are the specifics in getting to this idea  of the conceptual reality.  But if we don't have one without the other,  I don't think we have the right target to focus on.  So that's great.  Now, that's four years.  Very realistic goals, I would say.  I didn't think anything was out of language there.  Is there anything different  and we'll come back to what you said  as far as tweaking into the fine tuning,  that you'd say in two years,  it's different than these four-year goals?  But it wasn't just a four-year aspiration.  It was a two-year and a zero-year.  So what does two years look like?  Is there any difference there?  And if it's a given or not,  but I want to give time and space for this.  So I'm not sure if there is a difference,  but I would hope that we're on the road to four.  I mean, we should be making progress.  We're not there with many of those different aspects,  but we should be making progress  and that's really what you should be seeking,  in my opinion.  Yeah, I struggled just slightly with the two years  because it felt like one year makes sense.  We can only do so much then.  We're just getting started.  Four years is the vision.  Two years, one thing that I wrote  was that we're securing grants for these things,  like the arts, bikeways, parks,  wildfire resilience.  Yeah.  I think we're well on our way.  I'm going to go home now.  And this conversation is,  I'm not going to go on network,  so I'm still not good for the long haul.  But that's the conversation we have to have  and I want us to have my vision about this.  Yeah, so I think in the two year timeframe,  we will be part of the way to our four year goals.  But also there are some things that are priorities  that are threats that we have to deal with.  So for example, our flood control structure,  which is sort of under the,  that's an imminent threat.  So the things that are,  more immediate are going to get dealt with before,  because we can't do everything at once,  are going to be dealt with before the things  that are less threatening.  That's right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So I had, in order to get to the four years,  under the two years,  that we would be working our economic strategic plan.  And going back to year one,  you're going to hear in a minute  that we have an economic strategic plan.  That we have air service.  Because air services helps bring businesses.  Yeah.  And Chico State is growing.  And we're seeing higher enrollment,  because that goes to economy also.  They have been growing, but growing even more.  Continuing to grow.  Continuing to grow, not-  Getting even back to where it was.  Yeah.  I know a lot of the metrics that we're looking at,  whether it be New College or Chico State,  they're looking at getting it back to X number, right?  So as you talk about, it is growing, but continuing to grow.  I think that this is exactly,  and I keep saying think,  I don't think I know,  this is exactly what I'm hoping will take place,  because this does build on, right?  So air service is important,  because it allows for a thriving business environment  in ways that we don't have currently.  Potentially, right?  Same with CSU Chico.  So if family can't get up to Chico easily,  they may not want to send their children to Chico State.  So this is exactly where we're kind of building blocks  to get stuff for your plan,  where I'm hoping,  and I didn't put any much forewarning on this, in fact,  I think we might just,  we're all curious to know where we're going today.  So some mysteries.  So I appreciate that you're all playing along.  It's working out just perfectly so far.  I have one last one.  That Warren is done,  and proper secession planning has been implemented.  Secession?  Secession, post Warren.  Post Warren, okay.  So Warren's gone.  It's, no, it's done,  and we've planned ahead of time,  and that's being implemented.  Okay, so we're self-directed in our strategy.  Huh?  Like we're self-directed in our strategy.  We are, yes.  We've done a great job,  and we've done the hard work,  and we've had the conversations,  and we're moving forward.  What did you say about the piece that's,  we're self-directed?  We're self-directed in our policy on homelessness.  And yeah, and actually, I mean,  I think it's kind of like, sounds flowery perhaps,  but in two years,  if homelessness was not the most,  like the hottest political topic,  I think we'd be doing a good job.  I'd like to see that.  Yeah.  Great, thank you.  For my two-year goals,  I put things I feel like can be achieved  without necessarily having policymaking  even take a part in that,  and I mean cultural shifts,  not only going back to community engagement  and being as involved with our residents as possible,  but also the way that we connect  with other cities and other counties.  I think there's a lot of recognition  that what Butte County does will in turn affect Yuba,  and what Chico does can affect Biggs and Orland.  And I just hope that all of those elected officials  can be in communication,  not only in a structured official way,  but also in communication in a leisurely way,  because we want to be knowing what each other's cities  and counties are going.  Sure.  And I think that's what's going on.  So how about some North State collaborative resource?  Yeah.  Or collaboration,  or maybe increase in collaboration?  Yeah, increase in how often  and how much we're communicating with each other,  even in incremental small ways,  I think can be achieved in two years.  Great, thank you.  I have a couple more if you're done.  Okay.  Planning efforts are in progress.  For transportation corridors  and for meeting our housing needs,  we have planning efforts in progress,  but furthering those towards our goals.  Solid funding, continued funding,  but perhaps more for our capital project needs  for repaving our roads.  Better and more local and inter-regional transit  in partnership with BCAG.  So like connections to Sacramento  and to the Sacramento airport especially.  Yeah.  Okay.  Great, thank you.  Other things?  Two years.  So we're starting to whittle down a bit, right?  So we're at four to two, but we have to again,  and it's not like we're a private group,  paying for it too, and you've already done that,  so this is great.  You know, it's interesting, I'm just thinking this,  like one of the things, and I can't remember who said this,  but this idea of having other communities look  to Chico as a leader.  We're already seeing that some of the disaster recovery,  obviously, you know, and we,  the fact that these things took place are of course devastating,  but the fact that we can turn our response,  especially working in Paradise, this current area,  the campfire, and now having these other environments,  communities look to Chico, and we're seeing that, you know,  we're forced to call help, whether it be in Maui,  or down in Los Angeles.  We hate that we've had to go through it,  but we've had to go through it, and it's not stronger.  We can be a leader, and it's possible.  So I think we already have examples of looking,  of seeing what that looks like, where things are coming to us,  so we can capitalize on the work that we've done,  and lead the way.  So, you've already said this, but to get to four,  we'll go to two, we'll get to start.  So this is where the real work takes place, right?  We say, okay, what do we want to do?  We say, okay, what do we want to do?  In the next year?  Keep in mind the two-year plan, the four-year plan.  What is it that we must focus on in the next zero to one year?  So in the immediate, the short term, right now,  that will then set us up to be successful,  come the longer term, to a four-year measure, right?  And some of this, I think it goes without saying,  but I'll say it still,  it's not going to be completed in four years, right?  We're going to be in progress,  and we're going to be in progress still  in a lot of these projects.  But what's the saying, when's the best time to plant a tree?  Twenty years ago.  When's the second best time?  Today.  Right, we have to start somewhere.  So that's the idea.  So should these trees be planted long ago?  Perhaps, but we have an opportunity right now  to plant the trees today.  Right, now they will grow, but if we keep putting it off,  they're never going to grow because they were never planted.  Right, the idea that I haven't won the lottery, why?  Have you ever bought a ticket?  No.  Well, there's your problem, right?  We've got to start somewhere.  We've got to start somewhere.  So, what are your thoughts?  What are your thoughts?  What are your thoughts?  What are your thoughts?  What are your thoughts?  So, I had, trying not to put any specific department,  but attract and hire staff, allow leadership to attract  and hire the staff needed to have quality leadership  and all positions filled.  Not calling out that we need more in our,  fire department and other places and we need new fire station  and things like that.  So, anyways, but in all staffing,  I know there's been a shortage on the second floor  that we can't get certain things done in building  because they don't have the correct people to check plants.  So, like, at all level to make sure that we're giving staff  what they need to be able to hire.  That we begin the Warren, if it's not succession planning,  whatever you want to call it, what life post-Warren looks like,  begin that planning.  So, I think that's what we need to do.  I think that's what we need to do.  A communication plan slash transparency,  optimizing our new PIO that we have to the best of her skills  and abilities.  And creating an economic strategic plan.  That in four years will be thriving and growing from.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  talking about the strategic plan for the city, I think  one of the most important things that we have is an  economic strategic plan that directs  the decisions that we make and how  we grow the economy in Chico, which  goes down to the airport and planning  and roads and roundabouts and all  the other things that go underneath that.  Thank you.  So,  this is a hard one because  in 2020  there was an inflection point. We had a shift  in the  philosophical  orientation of the city council  and that  will continue until at least  2026. And so  a number of things were put  in place and have been in  motion over that period of time. And  they center around three things.  Safety, infrastructure  and what I call the texture  of quality, texture of life.  And so safety, you know, we had a police department  that was melting down. We fixed that.  We've identified a threat  with the flood control system.  We had  one of our leaders  in the fire department talk about the need for  some enhanced fire protection downtown.  Infrastructure,  the sewers downtown were supposed to be  replaced in 1983. They were put in  in 1908 and been neglected.  So that's prompted  the revisioning of the downtown  because we have to tear the streets up so we might as well  rethink that.  Roads, we have a 10-year road construction.  So, I mean, it's just  continuing the things  that we started  and I think we're  on a very good track.  And I would add  Bidwell Park needs some love.  Can I make a comment about  strategic economic plan?  So,  having been involved in  locating, deciding  where companies locate  other locations  or where they locate,  a lot of it just gets down to  where do the people running  it want to live?  I mean, you know, yeah,  you've got to be near  your raw materials, you have to have proper  transportation, you've got to have a labor force,  all those considerations. But then it all gets  down to, do I want to live there?  And that gets back to the  quality of civic life.  So you've got a great place to live.  Including people who run  and own companies are going to want to be  there for that reason.  And this kind of, wherever  you go in the world, the culture is defined  in smaller towns, not in big cities.  Big cities have the same hotels, same  Italian food around the world.  It's towns like Chico that  and so we need to get  that quality of life  back because we've allowed it to degrade  over the past,  particularly in California over the past  40 years or so. And that's  shifting and you can see it at the state level.  Because we exist in this river  that's flowing along, if you will,  and we can make some decisions  but we're  very impacted by what the state decides  to do and you can see that's what's happened  in the state because Gavin Newsom wants to be  president. And the process of backtracking  on a whole bunch of stuff that they've been doing  for 40 years that wasn't  and wasn't working.  So what you're saying  then is one bill on the next.  Yeah.  If you have a great place to live, people are going to want to be there  including people who own and run businesses.  So you can have all the plans you want  but if you don't get the  homeless people out of downtown and the parks,  they're not going to come here.  I agree.  I totally agree, Tom, that  it needs to be, Mr.  that it's  absolutely somewhere you want to be  but I think I'm more talking  if I'm looking to relocate my business  or I'm looking to  open a second location,  how friendly are we in the business  environment? We just heard  for instance of somebody who  bought a lot and built the exact same  thing in three different cities  and kind of told what his  experience was in each three of those cities.  I want to be the easiest and the  best city at that, not  the most difficult and the worst and the highest  fees. So as people  are pulling their permits and  I'm not saying we were the worst,  don't get me wrong, but  if that's the case, what do we need to do  to fix that? So I'm just, I think the economic  strategic plan is making sure  when somebody is looking to relocate their  business, are the access roads  in and out of where they want to put  that industrial whatever it is  the best that we can be.  So that's more what I  was thinking. And of course then all your  employees that you bring to work in  that business that you want it to be great  because we have a great quality  of life here.  It's definitely not even worth it.  So we have to have both in order for them to be successful.  And so those are the things that we get  into the tech travel.  What needs to take place in order to have that?  To your question earlier.  Yes.  So this is a great  start. What else? Zero to one years.  Some things that I think we're already  kind of on track for just based on the things  we've voted on together as a council are  decrease in  blighted abandoned buildings  which is towards our  effectively effectively effectively  effectively effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively And I think that ties into the mayor's recommendation of the economic planning planning ahead for smart growth so that we can have consistent tax revenue from our developments and make sure that we're investing in infrastructure wisely through that.  effectively  funding from our developments  and make sure we'  re investing in  infrastructure wisely through  that. Staffing was already  brought up for things like  planning code enforcement  homelessness and community  engagement.  I'  I mentioned as far as a  long-term vision the safe  streets, safe parks, safe  neighborhoods, thriving  businesses, premier education  ample housing and recreational  opportunities that was the  bigger macro and those are the  long-term goals. I think you  have to be honest about this  and you also need to realize  and we need to be honest about  this you'  re talking about  contingency for recessions or  whatever but Eisenhower in his  wisdom said plans are worthless  planning is everything and that  is so true. We'  ve all been  through that where you plan for  something to happen and then you  have the dam crisis and then you  have the campfire and then you  have covid. You don'  t plan for  those things but you have to have  s where leadership comes in  and I really want to commend our  staff and their leadership led  by mark sorensen because he has  that vision they have that  vision they understand the long  term and short term but also the  flexibility and the ability to  adjust to these different  dynamics. It'  s great that we  have plans but let'  s also remember we need to be  planning for things that are really not something that we see on our radar. That'  s life that'  s reality in butte county right now and our reality in chico.  That' s a great reminder in fact I have a slide to look at  probably you can see as you go through the printout it'  s not as  succinct as the  Eisenhower quote with the idea that we should not  create a strategic plan as a prophecy.  We know that there'  e only certainty in life is uncertainty.  And so as we are planning for  I love that you put  I put it shorthand but we should be planning for a possible  recession.  Now could we plan for  a recession?  Is this a good  future of the pandemic  that took place in 2020?  Probably not.  So there'  e lots of people  who have lost their  but you have to plan and anticipate at least these days especially given  especially what we see in butte county there'  e going to be it'  s not one thing it'  s next.  And remember D-Day that massive operation they were landing on the wrong beaches. Everything went wrong in the plan. That fell apart completely. But ultimately we had to  make sure that  succeeded, that leadership  succeeded and the overall plan  succeeded because of that.  That' s good.  What else?  To echo some of the points that Mr.  Van Overbeck and Mayor Reynolds touched on  as far as economy goes I think  diversify, diversify, diversify  as far as industries go.  In any  town or any city there'  e always going to be those core businesses.  Where we'  re getting a lot of those tax revenues from.  But it'  s always a dangerous place to be to  have to rely on just one or two industries.  I think my perspective coming from the  suburbs of San Diego, you know every  single store is a chain  probably owned by the same six parent  companies and that'  s something that' s really special about Chico that I think  draws a lot of people in.  And then secondly the zero to one year I put  the city council  itself is flexible in  creating a  always being creative in our solutions and  are willing to make compromises  to at least kick start a project.  And I think I put that for the zero to one year  because that'  s how I feel the current city council is  functioning now.  I'  ve seen a lot of flexibility from my  coworkers and when I'  m envisioning the next year I just really  hope that we can continue that.  d like to see us this year take  some really decisive direction on a  couple of issues that are typically  conflict ridden.  We always try to strike a balance.  We always strike some sort of balance but I want to see us  give some really straightforward guidance.  And one is about street safety and even  if it comes at the expense of how  fast people are used to driving around.  And we don'  t have to wait until we spend  $10 million to tear up a road to make sure  the kids can ride their bikes safely to school.  And parents can be comfortable about that. And the other is we'  re  going to have more housing opportunities throughout the city even though  things are going to change and people are going to be uncomfortable with that.  And we'  re going to continue to hear that. But I think the direction that  we want to give from the council and I think this is generally well felt is that  we really want to lean hard in favor of increasing housing within the city.  Thank you.  Anything else?  This is not one of those speak an hour forever hold your peace because we have an hour and 42 minutes left.  So we can continue to have the conversation and we will.  So we'  re going to revisit this.  We just talked about it.  We can do a couple things.  We can break right now for  10 minutes and finish out the rest.  Or we can go for another 30 and take a break.  What'  s your preference?  .  Okay. Good.  So if we need to break.  Yeah, yeah. Just let me know.  And I'  m going to go to the next one.  We're going to talk about the !  And then we're going to get down to the nuts and bolts of how do we make this happen.  And you've already heard these things in some ways.  But again, let's go back to the teacher and me.  When we talk about strategy, there's a number of things we have to keep in mind.  So every organization must operate in an environment that's marked by competition, structural forces, and uncertainty.  We already talked about these things.  So the competition is that we have a number of people.  We have a large city.  What is it?  You know, population I'm sure.  I've always wondered as an associate professor,  I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to decide as I drive into Chico and I pass the welcome to Chico sign,  is somebody literally there every time a baby is born just adding another number to that?  I'm sure that's not the case.  But that's always been my thought.  And then I come on the other side of Chico and the number is different.  So I'm not really sure which one it is.  But let's just call it 110,000, okay, for round numbers.  But everybody has different priorities.  And so there's this competition where we may not say, well, what's the competition of Chico?  We're not a business entity or a nonprofit even.  And at the same time, there are a lot of people who are interested in Chico.  And there are lots of competitors that we face, right, surrounding communities, to your point,  as far as ease of perhaps building projects or businesses.  And so thinking through what is the competition.  But what we just heard is we want to make sure that we're the easiest city, municipality,  and we want to collaborate with our partner and community, our neighbors.  So now in Los Angeles, and you've referenced San Diego,  your neighbor is literally on the other side of a street.  Here in Chico, being more right,  we have some distance between us and Orville and Paradise and other places.  But still, folks are making choices.  Do they want to live in Chico?  Do they want to live, do they want to open a business in Paradise?  Things of that nature.  So competition is definitely there.  Structural forces.  And of course, as we talked about, this idea of uncertainty.  Every organization must make choices that fit together in a holistic, consistent way  in order for us to succeed in that environment.  So you've just all laid this out.  Basically what I'm doing is I'm,  I'm reading back to you the things you've already said,  which tells me that either you saw my slides ahead of time,  which you might have, that's okay,  or these are already on your mind as it is,  which is another great point that we are in this together, right?  This idea, like, if we get to four, we have to go to two, we have to go to one.  But in order for those things to take place, we must go through these steps.  These realities might, must take place for us to get from year one to two to four, right?  They build on each other.  We talk about an economic strategic plan, what needs to take place.  It's the conversation that we just had between the two of you.  It's not either or, it's both and.  We must have air traffic, right?  We must have an airport.  We must have quality of life, civic life, right?  So there has to be an attraction.  So they have to fit together in order for that to be successful.  And then these choices, these are the essence of what we're talking about when it comes to strategy.  So, I told you I'd do some teaching.  And with that, you have to read books.  And I'm not going to read them all.  I used to not like reading books and now I love reading books.  And when I was in graduate school, I read every single page of every single book.  And I can say that I read every single word on every single page.  I'm pretty sure my kids don't do that, nor do my students.  Nor do I anymore these days.  But I really like to bring examples of kind of where do I get my resources,  knowing that it's not just me coming up with these wild, you know, haired ideas.  So one of my favorite strategy books is a book called Playing to Win, How Strategy Really Works.  And the authors give us a framework that I think is really helpful for us to talk through how do we then come up with our strategic goals in this conversation.  And you can see them in front of you.  You can see them up here on the slides.  But there's these five realities that we need to explore.  And in the strategic goals framework, they say strategy is defined by an integrated, iterative set of five choices within a particular macroenvironmental context.  So, Council Member O'Brien, this idea of the macroenvironmental context.  We're talking about this macro, but it spills into the micro as we've just discussed.  So, and again, I mentioned earlier that the language may not be completely applicable in this conversation.  But we'll use some replacements.  So what is our winning aspiration?  Okay.  So let's just look at that.  What do we want to accomplish?  We already talked about a lot of that.  We have page after page after page of what success, if you want to use that terminology, looks like.  In the long term, the short term, and the immediate.  Then the question comes into play, where are we going to play?  You already know your scope of kind of purview and where you have oversight and all of that.  You know where those kind of areas to play are.  But this gets to more than just location.  It gets to what are the areas of focus, right?  What's our strategic goals?  And so you would say, if we're going to play, if we want to, this is what we aspire to.  This is where we must play.  And then this idea of how do we win?  Okay.  So maybe that's not the right language.  But let's replace that with how will we know we've been successful?  And that's what we just laid out here.  So if we know that I want to accomplish this, and this is a space that we have agreement, we have collaboration, we have buy-in, we have insight, we can go back to those five most important questions.  And if they're addressed, who's our customer?  What is our customer value?  Right?  So we're on the large macro level.  Let's take it down to the micro level.  Then we know what success is going to look like as we think about strategy.  And then this idea of what capabilities must we have.  Who was it that said, I think I wrote down here, something along the lines of a strategic communication plan.  Was that you, Mary-Rose?  Yeah.  So how do we communicate?  How do we have an engaged community in the City of Chico?  How do we have even more transparency than we already have?  How do people know what's going on?  These are the capabilities we're talking about.  Transparency, communication.  Having our new, I don't know if she's here, the PIO, as you mentioned, right?  So those are the important capabilities.  And then we look at, okay, so in order for all that to take place, what management systems are needed?  So processes and people.  So we talked about staff.  Not only do we need to retain staff, because we have good staff, we need to hold onto them, but we need to attract staff.  Which is not something that's, it doesn't operate in a silo, right?  So we need to attract staff.  And sometimes that means having people move to Chico.  And I will tell you, as someone who does, in addition to strategic planning, I do executive recruiting.  Finding people to move from some of these larger metropolitan areas to a place like Chico is a challenge.  For lots of different reasons.  It could be housing.  It could be pay.  It could be the position.  It could be the organization or the lack thereof.  So what management systems do we need?  Again, processes and people.  So if you look at it, much like we've talked through, we walked the other way.  We worked from zero to, or four to, two to one.  We're looking at this.  This is a waterfall effect.  What's our winning aspirations?  This cascade.  Where will we play?  How will we win?  What capabilities must we have?  What management systems do we need?  And then, of course, we go back to what's our mission?  So what's our why?  Who's our customer?  What do they value?  What are our results?  And what are our plans?  So you've probably heard it said that if you don't know what you're aiming at, you're never going to know if you hit the goal.  So now's our time to focus in on that.  What are we aiming at?  So if these things take place, let's start with zero to one and work the other way now.  We know what we're desired future looks like, and we can kind of hone in on that.  But what needs to take place in the here and now?  We do that by way of making smart goals.  So in these are, you can see this in front of you, the colors are kind of not great.  Sorry about that.  That's what I could find.  Specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and timely.  And so here's where those comments and ideas come in.  I think Council Member Goldstein, you said, I don't know if this is the how or the what.  But this is where maybe it matters all the more.  And where I will actually say, is it a smart goal?  Is it specific?  Is it measurable?  Maybe it's specific and measurable, but is it attainable?  Maybe it's all three, but is it relevant?  And is it timely?  And so not just timely, but we would then want to tie markers to it and say we're going to accomplish X by way or by this certain goal.  And effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively  What I want to do here is I want us to look through again this idea of the four year.  Every homeless individual is housed and given the necessary treatment.  Now that's a, I'm kind of giving you a snapshot of that.  You said you want your grandkids to safely ride through Bidwell Park.  So in order for us to get you a six and a ten year old, I'm assuming, grandkid, or you  have a six year old now, ten year old then, there's a lot that takes place over the span  of a child's life in those four years.  There's a lot that takes place in the span of Chico over those four years.  We want the city to build upon and look at the things that are working to mitigate risk.  Use what's working, being utilized already.  Let's not recreate the wheel.  I think a comment that was made by Councilmember O'Brien is we've already had some, or maybe  it was Councilmember Van Orbeek, there's been a lot of great movement.  Let's not recreate things.  Let's pick up what's already been done or let's capitalize on those things so that we're  not revisiting and coming up with them as though they're a new idea.  Because sometimes they're not, right?  That's not the best use of time.  Affordable housing, lower rate of pedestrian cycle collisions.  I think I wrote this down right.  More students walking back to school.  I just put fix the potholes.  Wildlife flood reduction, higher civic engagement.  And somebody just said, let's just, we want in four years the homelessness issue to be  solved.  So as we look through these ideas, again, we go safer streets, safer parks.  There's a lot of safety here.  If we were to walk through and go, these are our smart goals.  In order to get to that desired outcome, we first need to decide what that desired outcome  is.  So as we look at this, let's go back to the zero to one.  We want to attract and hire staff to have all positions filled.  We want to begin the planning of a post-warren reality.  So I think, Council Member Winsley, you said self-directed plan, correct?  Communication plan, transparency, PIO, create an economic strategic plan.  Bidwell Park needs some love.  You've already been dealing with this with the blighted buildings.  That's actually a word that I've never really been aware of until I read the newspaper this  morning.  So now it's been reiterated.  So I appreciate a lesson I even got there.  More arts programs, street safety.  So what is it now?  As we kind of boil it down and say, these are the things that we need to do.  These are specific.  What is it that you would say, again, let's throw out all these ideas.  What are the, let's go top to you, and we've already talked about some of this.  What's the number one thing, and we're just going to go around, that we need immediate  focus on to get to those desired futures?  I think we've already heard it, but I want you to actually go around and say, I want  to focus here because what we want to do is this.  We want to go through a democratic process and we want to say, okay, so here's where  I have five of these.  I have four of these and I have three of these.  Right?  And effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively  effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively  effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively  effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively So I think I heard I don't think I know I heard homeless. I heard safety. I heard business.  effectively effectively effectively effectively  effectively effectively effectively effectively  effectively  effectively  econ  development.  I heard arts.  I heard  streets,  infrastructure,  potholes.  What have I not captured here?  We talked through a lot,  but the things that are specifically  mentioned by you, what's not on this list here?  I think it's the  textural stuff.  The quality of the park,  the downtown.  Once you  deal with mitigating the threats, what are  the things that make Chico a  joyful  place to be?  Quality of the bike infrastructure,  if you're a bike rider.  You know?  Disaster  resilience, like wildfires.  I think you're going to go there.  You were already writing it when I thought of it.  So, flood fire mitigation.  Sure.  Any of them, really.  I think you covered it.  Okay.  To me, so many of these things are all  wrapped together when it comes to economic development,  safety, homelessness, but housing.  Oh, yeah.  So, what should we separate out then?  And what can we include in it?  Because here's what we want to go through this process.  We want to say, okay, let's focus on these,  let's call it six things total.  And what's separate?  And then we get down to, okay, where do we draw dollars from that?  How do we make it happen?  Let's actually go through, in the last part of our time here,  we'll go through, we'll come out with, okay,  in order for that to take place, this needs to happen.  This needs to happen.  This needs to happen.  And here's the beauty of this.  Like I said at the beginning, we're not going to finish everything.  Okay.  And so, what we're coming up with right now is our best,  our brains are already tired.  It's the afternoon.  We just had lunch.  We revisit this.  And we continue to hone this.  We get to where it's specific.  And we send iteration after iteration until the council says, yes, that's it.  That's the focus.  We have ad hoc committees.  Whatever that looks like.  I don't know how the process would necessarily go with this situation.  But my commitment, again, is that we work on this until we're done.  We figure out what's the plan of,  and you have in front of you the three to five goals.  Right now we have more than that.  But you just said some of these fit together.  So if they fit together, let's not again have them be separate.  Let's figure out what's going to be part and parcel so we can really specifically focus  the goals on something else.  So Jeff, don't we need to prioritize these?  I mean, in my mind, you have to deal with the threats first, which means that safety  is number one.  Yep.  And safety breaks down into two.  the fire, flood, and personal safety.  So, yes, we do have priorities,  but we need to agree what's first and large  our most important focus.  And we put it in practice.  So this is the most important thing.  This builds on this.  That's one approach we need to take.  So I'm going to agree with Tom as well.  I think you have to have priorities.  And the fundamental thing that a government agency provides,  whether it's local, state, or at the national level,  is safety.  Safety comes first.  Safety is foundational.  It really allows everything else to be built upon.  If you do not have a safe foundation,  we've seen that throughout California  and parts of cities or whole cities  that have been destroyed because they're unsafe.  Safety is paramount.  That comes first.  Police, fire, and infrastructure.  Yeah, and I like to emphasize  the infrastructure aspect of that.  So it seems like we've come down to...  Because...  So if you've got, let's call it safety,  business economic development, and quality of life.  Let's just, like, for an example,  I'm not saying it is those.  But to me, homelessness falls under safety  because safety of the unhoused individuals  and safety of the rest of the community.  So to me, that's a safety issue for both.  Quality of life, I think having amazing arts  is a quality of life.  Being flood and fire resistant,  is going to allow us to have a good quality of life.  And a good streets and infrastructure.  So it almost, you know,  under business and economic development,  if we don't have the right streets and infrastructure,  then we can't grow our business and our economy the right way.  So it kind of seems like we're, to me anyways,  that's how I kind of see that list.  Yeah.  Sorry, in addition to that,  I immediately saw arts and economic development  right next to each other.  And I'm like, well, those go extremely hand in hand.  And if we're looking at economic development  and businesses without focusing on the arts  in some capacity,  or looking at art projects without thinking about them  from a business perspective,  we're missing something.  So Jeff, I mean, so to me,  quality of civic life is the overarching vision  of the kind of place we want to live in.  And how we get there is safety,  and what else we have, you know,  economic development, arts.  But it's not a goal in itself.  It is the result of doing these other things right.  Perfect.  Yeah, that's great.  Thank you.  So the answer is yes.  This is the process.  This is the hope.  Like you wake up, you put it in a program  that you hope the conversation goes this direction.  Because this is what we're talking about.  We have to have the overarching.  So that's, again, if you want to go,  to have a discussion about this,  if this is the priority,  but it sounds like we're moving in those directions.  If this is the overarching,  we have to have boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.  So I'm hearing, let's look at this.  So this idea of quality of life,  so quality of civic life, okay.  Is anybody, any of you say,  I don't agree with that?  Say it one more time.  Is anybody disagreeing that quality,  quality of civic life is of the kind of prim and importance here?  Everything then falls underneath that.  That's, in many ways, it's a catchall,  but it's an important catchall.  Because that's what all of this builds towards, right?  And we're saying that we have a goal.  The next four years, we want to see X, Y, and Z happen.  That's great, but we want to work towards,  to be a work in progress towards some of the things,  say, restoring quality of civic life,  renewing, or just creating in general, right?  We all have different experiences.  We've seen these different kind of stages in the life of Chico.  And so we have to perspective how we might define that.  But we all agree that quality of civic life is a real important aspect.  Unless I hear any dissent, but I have had so far.  So are we okay with that at the top?  I think it's a good summary.  Okay.  I can always move it.  Because here again, this, and it goes back to the early on conversation this morning,  the why.  Why are you all here?  Why are you doing this work?  Because you all have the goal to pursue, to develop, to create a quality of civic life  that makes this place attractive for employees, for businesses, for families, for students.  I mean, go down the list.  And if we work through all of this, and this is the preeminent why,  for why you show up every other Tuesday, I think it is, and why you sit in all these  other meetings, and why you came on a Wednesday in the middle of the week to sit through a  four-hour strategic planning session, is because you all have the same interest to develop  a holistic, thriving quality of civic life for the city of Chico.  I'm just going to put Q-O-L, civic life.  And we know that means quality of civic life.  So if this is our major goal, what are our priorities to make that happen?  Thinking through budget cycle, upcoming fiscal year, building on zero to one, two years out,  four years out.  I was going to expand upon that and say safety from ongoing and immediate crises, because  that can encompass.  It can encompass homelessness.  It can encompass climate disasters.  It can encompass disasters from other threats.  Okay.  So this is, I think, we could say just safety.  And we could have this as kind of a parenthetical, because safety is in response to we need to  prepare for and make a place safe for any of us.  So it could be, and I hear what you're saying exactly, but I think that if we just have safety  as the goal, then we look at, okay, so if that's our goal, that's strategic goal number  one, what are the objectives to respond then to safety?  You may want to say a safe community, because there's many aspects of that community that  need to be factored in when we talk about safety, safe schools, safe neighborhoods,  those types of things.  So a safe community, I think, encompasses what we are trying to accomplish as it relates  to safety.  I hear you.  Does that sound good?  So I think in terms of physical safety, so it's fire, flood, and what the police do,  and personal safety.  So are you looking for specific things?  I can give you some examples.  So for instance, fire.  We've all...  We've had too much experience with that here.  The single number one threat we have for fire is in Bidwell Park.  If we get a fire going there in the summer and everything dries out.  So we're pursuing two things.  One is we're spending more money on vegetation management to clear out the underbrush, and  we're going to forbid homeless people from camping, because then they build fires, and  the fire department has had to go out and deal with that.  And as it relates to personal safety...  The number...  The most dangerous thing you can do in this town is either get on a bike or in a car and  drive on our public streets.  We killed 10 or 12 people every year in traffic accidents in the city limits, because we only  had...  We didn't have a full-time traffic officer for budgetary reasons.  So we're putting in place not only more traffic officers, but a red light camera system, which  is in the works.  So those are specific things to address immediate threats.  That's perfect.  And I want to go there.  But I want to say something.  So we're trying to get our priorities as far as the top three to five, and then what  you just listed out, those are what we need to do to make that .  But the encompassing thing we're trying to accomplish is a safe community, which includes  all those things.  It is.  Absolutely.  So we want an overarching strategic goal that says a safer or a safe community.  That's what we want to phrase it.  So if we look at this, we look at a document, okay?  The document is being referenced.  We're going to put it on the wall, or where it is, at the dais.  And you can say, we're going to put it on the wall.  And effectively, effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively  effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively  effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively  effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively  effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively We're going to focus our attention and our budget on creating a safe community.  area. Right? And so  this is, I'm hearing from all of you,  this is strategic goal number one.  This is the priorities, no matter what.  Is that correct?  And again, we'll get into the specifics of the objectives,  but if this is our overarching  goal number one,  we landed on a safe area.  And so to me, it seems like  business economic development has to be  number two, because if we don't have  thriving businesses that are paying taxes,  that are paying for our  staff and our streets and our roads and our  infrastructure, then we  can't create the safe  community.  Yeah, I'm kind of struggling  to see how we're going  to tile this down in really firm ways.  We can jump to these examples like  Councilman Van Overbeek gave of things that we're doing now,  but you can't wrap  things up in so many different ways. And so I have our general  plan here. It's our 2030 vision. That's  five years out.  And there's a lot of emphasis on sustainability,  which can be seen as like we're  altruistically towards the environment or something.  But also, it's about sustainability of public services  and us being able to maintain in the long run  these things that cost a lot of money, but  keep us safe and keep our quality of life  strong. And I feel like we could be  wrapping all this under that  in a certain way, but  at some certain points, it's just about verbiage. I'm not sure  I have the answer to what to do there,  but I just thought I'd point that out. Sustainability  goes back to having a  strong economy and business  economy and arts economy, too.  And that's why I do like that as an  overarching term, because we're not just  talking about sustainability. We're talking about  usually when we're talking about  sustainability, we're only thinking about the  environment when that in turn  extends also to  downtown being sustainable  and thriving and our economy  being sustainable.  So one of our business  leaders in town says,  look around. Anything you see that  was built was built because of business.  And I think  after safety, we have to have a thriving  economy, a thriving  economic  environment.  As the mayor said, I think that has  to be number two, because  number one, the foundation is safety.  Businesses will not come where it's not safe.  Once it's safe, you create that environment,  then they come in and do their thing, and we  have to have that thriving economy  as well. Yeah, I mean,  of course, you have to have a thriving economy,  but there have to be some foundational elements.  And I would  argue that once you make the place safe,  you've got to make it work, which says infrastructure.  The roads can't be  full of potholes. The sewer system can't  be on the verge of breaking.  All the infrastructure  stuff that we're in the middle  of  doing,  that has to be,  the town has to work.  And not only public, but private.  We've got some real issues with  power costs now because of PG&E.  Are there ways to deal with that?  And we're taking some  steps.  But I think infrastructure  is, and that was neglected here for a decade,  and there's been a real focus.  The other thing I want to inject  is we have a  superb city staff.  And so we have the ability to  execute on this stuff, which  is not normal.  So my position  was safety includes  police, fire, and infrastructure. That's all  inclusive in that, Tom, from my perspective.  That's why I kept that as a single item.  I think  there are several different aspects of infrastructure  though, and I was thinking about the terms of  sustainability and how we need to make sure  that our sewers and our streets are  sustained financially, which  also ties into the economic development  and the staffing.  I would say sustainability is more of  within that combined larger, overarching  quality of civic life goal.  But yeah, I'm seeing  infrastructure being in both of these, not  necessarily just in safety.  And that's okay.  Keep things complex and try to simplify things.  A lot of my conversations with people,  like quality of life here,  what are the biggest issues to face people,  and about economic development too, is about  affordability more generally.  Council Member Ben-Obrecht mentioned power costs,  housing costs is usually the one that is up there,  but it's also things about  managing our infrastructure means we need to have  contractors locally with workers who can  afford to live here. And I see that as  especially something that is somewhat  tangentially within our power to affect  economic development is affordability.  We've got to be high on our list.  Thank you.  Related to that, I was  thinking about the three different lots  that a developer was developing, and I  think one of the main reasons why Chico  was seen as harder to develop and was  the higher costs of land. And of course,  you know, that's a whole issue. But also  the cost of housing and recruiting  workers could perhaps be a disservice to  some of our businesses that might want  to thrive here.  I really love this conversation. I think it's the right conversation.  And I keep saying the same thing. I don't want to do that.  I know it's the right conversation.  But when I hear this idea, you know,  I appreciate the plan.  It's interesting to say, I see it almost as a viability.  So are we viable short-term and long-term?  And so are we sustainable?  Right. That speaks to the environmental aspect.  It also speaks to the economic aspect.  Right. You talk about the triple bottom line.  We're talking about people, profits, and plans.  We're talking about all three of them.  But that gets into this idea.  We're talking about long-term viability.  And so we're building for a long-term viable future here  at G-Build that does not discount or not include any  of the aspects that you just talked about.  And so perhaps, if I can offer viability,  it might be not necessarily more accurate,  but maybe more apt for it to use.  And sustainable business includes all the issues  that I've discussed.  I'll throw it out there.  But what do you think about that?  I like it.  So if we do viability, are we talking viable community?  Are we talking or just viability overall?  Because then that means we're going to include business  and environmental development.  It's going to include environmental.  Sustainable.  Yeah. All of those.  All of the different things that we just talked through.  Then we have goals and the objective.  I'm sorry, the objective fit under long-term viability.  Long-term viability is, to me, by doing all those things,  we're going to be able to do that.  We're going to ensure we have long-term viability.  And every decision that we make should be going back to that.  Is ensuring the long-term viability,  because that goes back to the grandchildren,  goes back to the everything that we talked about  in the beginning of why we're doing this.  It's for long-term viability.  So I like that word.  Yeah, I agree with that.  I think being sustainable is part of, you know.  We could make a lot of really bad short-term decisions,  and the city has done that in the past.  And some staff currently recognize  that very strongly.  Very acutely.  But we have to keep an eye on the future,  and it's not going to be something  we will necessarily benefit from.  We may, but it's those people down the road  that you have to think of as well.  That's right.  We're talking in many ways legacy issues here as well.  Right?  So things that may take place beyond our time,  whether we have a council or just current  or at the same time, right?  That long-term viability, for some of us,  we may not think that way, but it's throughout.  So we have to be thinking long-term.  So if I just put long-term viability,  is that a good catch-all for strategic carway number two?  Okay.  So if we go say, so some of these have been included in that.  Is there a third?  And like I said, if I said we were going to do 17  and we came up with two, you'd be like,  man, that guy was terrible.  But if I said we were going to do one and came up with two,  you'd be like, man, that guy was terrible.  So that just doubled what you're hoping for.  So if we do two, that's great.  But if we do three, we want to make sure that it's specific,  measurable, and tangible, relevant, timely,  with those objectives that they have.  Or can we make an argument that these are the two most important  priorities and all of this falls under it that creates the future  that we want to see here at the State of Chicago,  both today but also more importantly in the long term?  This might fit under another umbrella.  I just want to throw it out there.  Having a thriving core.  I think we all saw the study attached to the  Downtown Chico Business Association,  the assessment thing.  And having a thriving downtown and a really strong core  is integral to so many of those things on the right-hand side.  I just don't know how to encompass that in one word.  I think like talk about the park as the jewel of Chico  and us that we really like this area and we attract people  to this area because of the beauty of our natural surroundings.  And there's some way to wrap all that up.  Like I see this safety, long-term viability,  it's like bread and butter.  And so now we want to like, it's like what's our jam on top?  And there's downtown aspects, the arts, the aesthetics,  the park, the beauty.  And I think we all feel like we should always keep that in mind.  And that's what we see about Chico is being good.  It isn't just that we're like a safe box to live in,  but that it's a beautiful place.  Yeah, and you just touched on this,  but the fact that our park overlaps with the city,  the downtown is super unique.  We have, you know, one of the largest urban forests  in the United States and that's really special.  Yeah, that's great.  This morning you said it's a unique, special, beautiful,  and some even said joyful place to be.  Mm-hmm.  Not a great say about the place.  Can we just put goal three, fun?  So I want to expand on something that Councilperson Hawley said  about the importance of the downtown.  I'm not sure it belongs here, but it, since you brought it up,  the university is a major driver economically for the town.  It's the major driver.  And that and one of the major employers.  And because it is unique in the state college system,  California state college system,  we have a downtown right next to the university there.  They border each other.  So the perception is,  the perception of the quality of the downtown  and the safety of the downtown impacts the ability of the university  to recruit.  And so this isn't just the, you know, sort of generic,  we need to restore our downtown.  It is critical to the future of this town that we have a viable,  interesting, safe downtown.  So I'm agreeing with you.  Thank you for bringing it up.  I appreciate that.  Thank you.  So how are we then, how do we do this,  how is this something that we have a real,  yes, this is.  I think it's more than just downtown.  Yeah, I think it's more than just downtown.  I think downtown is, of course, the core of the thing,  but I really want it to reflect whatever,  however we say that in a few words,  that this is about, like, vibrancy of downtown and our whole city.  If you want to identify the core,  I've always said the three jewels of Chico,  Chico State, our downtown and Bidwell Park.  Those are the three cores of Chico.  If you think about Chico,  you always think about those three things, always.  Thank you.  And they're differentiators, which is really important.  I would add Sierra Nevada, but.  I think they're doing all right for themselves.  What comes to mind for me is a thriving core.  When we say the word core,  I think people usually know what we're talking about.  We could say, like, thriving community core, I don't know,  or vibrant.  And in some ways,  I like the words that have been taking place here,  but mostly what's most important is what's underneath it.  What's underneath this goal?  This is the catch-all.  This is our focus.  But then the objective is, okay, so what does that mean?  So you could just say a thriving core.  And someone might look at that and go, what does that mean?  Well, one, it gives an opportunity to talk about it.  The mayor's been, if you will.  Maybe it would take longer than a minute to do that.  But also, this is how we're focused on it.  These are the most important things to us.  This is what employers tell potential employees.  If you come to Chico, you can not only experience the beauty,  the flat borders of not just lower, middle, and upper park.  I saw somebody describe riding their mountain bike in another park  as riding in their own Grand Canyon,  which I thought, that's a bit of a stretch,  because the Grand Canyon is, of course, the Grand Canyon.  But at the same time, this individual saw it as his personal Grand Canyon,  his playground.  Not many people would say that about a park.  There's something special about that.  So if you put a thriving core,  then, you know,  we literally put our mind where our mouth is  to say we're going to support that thriving core.  Define these three items, if you will.  We have four, if you see any of that.  They're going to arrive.  So what can we as a community,  what can we do to support these three?  Then you have your objective to spell that out.  How about protect and grow the core?  Protect and grow the core.  You know, I still, I feel like it's not just the core.  It's like the connection of the rest of the community to the core.  And the fact that we're like a compact city,  but that we have natural surroundings,  which are not in our core,  but it's just like a mile that way.  You get into some orchards,  and we have these greenways that run through,  and it's the connectivity of it all  that together conveys the sense of place  that we like about Chico.  Yeah, I won't die on this hill,  but the word accessibility did come up  in the beginning multiple times.  So a thriving and accessible core.  But we can shorten that more.  Yeah.  Maybe say prioritize the core.  And that encompasses all that we've just discussed.  I think I'd go a different direction in my opinion.  Like I've talked to business owners in District 7  who want the council to consider more than just downtown.  And I like that we're talking a lot about downtown,  but I think I want to make sure that we're looking at the things  that we really love about downtown,  how to make downtown great,  and expanding those things to the rest of the city  as much as we can.  And so I would focus on a word like community  or something to that effect.  We have talked about community engagement  in a different perspective, more of transparency.  But the more thriving our core is,  perhaps the more engaged the community will be,  the more protected the park is,  the more engaged the community will be,  the more, you know, you think long term,  you think about the student population that comes to Chico State,  we want to give them a reason to stay in Chico  when they come as students.  So now we're talking about, again, it's long term viability,  but we've protected the core.  And really, as you say,  Chico State is the major economic driver for the community.  It's the core.  Right?  So, and without it, we've seen the ramifications  of a dip in enrollment.  We're still, I mean, they obviously are working their way through that,  but it impacts the community.  And it's not just Chico.  So I don't think that what we're saying actually,  there's no division here.  It's just we want to have something that we can capture that,  and then the so what do we do with it now  spills out the objectives.  So it could be protecting,  all these bright things, but we just have to agree on something.  You're selling me on it. I like it.  Well, it's a way to encapsulate it all.  And, you know, we're talking about beauty and aesthetic value  and these, like, things that we like.  I'm looking at, like, the overall vision for Chico in 2030,  and the last line is,  above all, Chico is a place we're proud to call home.  And there's a lot of mentions of sense of place, you know,  which is a really neat term,  but also it's, like, sense of what sort of place.  I do think that in the last several years,  Chico suffered with that a little bit.  There's been a lot of, like, self-flagellation,  some shaming of Chico, you know,  for these issues that we have, disasters that we've had.  And I do think we want to try to, like, recover that, like, pride of place.  And there's something to be done about it.  Downtown and Biddle Park, these are things we talk about  when we talk about the pride that we have in our place.  So that's the one option there,  is just, like, enhancing that pride of the city that we're in, the place.  Again, I don't want us to necessarily get so hung up on how we capture it,  but I do think we have something that we agree on.  Do we all sort of agree on the vibe of, like, a thriving community core?  That sort of thing.  Or protecting what makes Chico Chico, right?  There is a, like you said, a vibe, a sense of this community.  There's a lot of things that make that up.  And people live here because of that.  I live here because of that.  My family's here because of that.  And protecting and building upon that,  what that exactly looks like wordsmith-wise, I don't know.  But I think you get what I'm saying.  Yeah.  There's something very unique about this place.  It is somewhat difficult.  Why do you love it so much?  I just do.  And you can't necessarily put it into words.  And if someone forced you to do so, it becomes very difficult to you.  And we end up having a 20 minute conversation about how do we describe the thing we like most about the place that we live.  Well, there's a unique culture here.  It's different than other towns.  And so I came here full time, you know, roughly 10 years ago.  And so I could see the differences.  And I think a lot of that evolved as a result of our history, but also where we are.  You know, we're close to the mountains and we have this gorgeous park.  So we got a lot of people here that are very outdoor oriented.  They want to ride bikes, mountain bikes, road bikes, whatever.  And so all those things are intertwined.  But getting back to the three elements that Mike, Brian defined that differentiate us,  it's the university and the downtown and the park.  And because they're differentiators, that's leverage.  So we make what's good better.  And that impacts everything positively.  Yeah, I agree with that.  It doesn't mean that we ignore the rest of the community.  Absolutely not.  But those three things do drive a lot of, like I said, what makes Chico, Chico.  And I think building upon that, not ignoring everything else, but I think building upon that allows everything else to build as well.  For sure.  So for that third one, just so we can get to the next park, can we call it downtown park CSU for right now?  And then we can wordsmith like how we're going to capture that later.  Because I think we're all in agreement that that's what it is.  It doesn't mean Park Avenue is not important because there's huge investment going on down there and there's huge things happening there.  But just to get us to that next step, it feels like maybe we call it that until we figure out that exact.  And then we also have to remember, this is the city's strategic plan.  So we can only, the decisions that we make can affect what happens at Chico State, but we're largely not in charge of Chico State.  But a thriving downtown helps with Chico State.  So they are intermixed, but we need to remember this is our strategic plan and what are we going to do to ensure that we're protecting those things and the park.  And the beauty of this is it's recorded.  So if someone says, well, what about us?  We have on record that we said, no, we're not ignoring the other aspects.  Right?  We're targeting the specific things that we're saying, what will have the biggest impact?  So there's lots of things we could focus on, but we actually want to discuss what has the biggest impact on the largest population so that we can carry out the strategic goals that we have assigned.  So we as a council said this is the most important incident that we have to create a higher and better quality of life for all in Chico.  So we have these three.  We didn't take a break.  We're going to take a break.  We're going to come back and finish it up.  Are we missing anything that needs to be on the list of our strategic priorities, strategic goals, how we kind of phrase that?  I think this captures most everything, if not everything, that we're going to talk about.  But if it hasn't, I want to make sure we get that on paper so you can think about that.  It feels like there's probably a place within each of those three goals for all the things we've talked about.  That's right.  Absolutely.  Good.  It's 2 o'clock.  Are we going to give it a six minute break?  All right.  Or an ish?  So come back no later than 2.15.  How about that?  And we'll finish out objectives.  And I, if I'm nothing else, I'm timely and we'll be done at 3 p.m.  Okay?  All right.  2.15.  All right.  Yep, he's right here.  All your name tags hidden back here.  That's right.  You sat there intentionally so the cameras couldn't see you.  All right.  2.15 on the dot.  We have a hard stop at 3 p.m.  And as I mentioned this morning, there's a likelihood we won't get absolutely everything accomplished, and that's okay.  But we want to give it our dead-level best, right, to get everything we can.  So over the break, I wish I could say this was original to me.  I have to give credit where credit is due.  Jen McCarthy suggested here for number three, protect and enhance our primary community assets.  What do you think about that?  I like it.  All right.  Let's go with it.  So I'll give you a chocolate later on or something like that.  So perfect.  Good.  All right.  So that said, now we got to figure out what do we do with this.  Okay.  So what's going to be included?  If our overarching here is quality of civic life, okay, this is our big idea.  Then we've said that our top three strategic goals, priorities, however you want to phrase them, are a safe community, long-term viability.  And again, we can define what that means with the objectives.  And then number three is to protect and enhance our primary community assets.  This is where we get down to it.  How do we do that?  And so in the next 43 minutes, we want to talk about the objectives that we have for these three.  These are our big rocks right here.  The question is how do you eat an elephant?  One bite at a time.  And somebody asked me, I put this up on a slide before, they said, why do you have an elephant bathing in a cup of coffee with a cookie next to it?  And I said, I don't know.  It's the one that came up when I searched for how do you eat an elephant.  So we're going to go with this picture right here.  And we're going to talk about what bites of this elephant need to be taken.  Okay.  So I want us to take some time.  And not a lot of time because we want to have a discussion about these items.  But I would like you, on the worksheet you have in front of you, knowing that these are our three goals.  Again, safe community, long-term viability, protect and enhance primary community assets.  I want you to write down how do we do that.  And maybe write down just one or two.  Maybe three at the most.  What are the key objectives?  So the deliverables that actually carry this out.  Because just having these three ideas, that's nice.  I want a safer community.  I want it to be a long-term viable community.  And I want to protect the gems of Chico.  So you have safety crossed out and you have something written underneath it, which I can't read.  A safety.  Safe community.  Oh, safe community.  Okay.  Sorry.  So we had safety, but we talked through this really long time.  Do you want us to come up with goals for each one of these?  Or sorry, things for each one of these goals?  Or just kind of all ideas?  Come up with individual objectives.  Okay, great.  Jeff, do we get to grade you at the end of this?  I hope so.  Okay, you get an A for deliverability.  You get an F for writing.  That's pretty good.  Pinmanship.  Pinmanship.  Pinmanship.  Yeah.  I used to make fun of my dad because he has terrible handwriting.  I was like, I have beautiful cursive handwriting, and now I have this disaster.  So that's fine.  So yeah, I'm not sure anyone writes worse than me, but you may take the cake, my friend.  So what are two and three again?  I cannot even make high...  A safe community, long-term viability.  Okay.  And protect and enhance primary community assets.  I'm not sure how this turned into the routine with my handwriting, but I'm okay with it  because we're getting great results.  So we'll be fine with it.  So take...  Let's take six minutes, if you can, if we can get it all down and start it.  Is it all right if I type mine so that you don't have to read my handwriting?  I shouldn't be typing all along.  Does Bryce have bad handwriting?  If this camera's not working, then we're in trouble.  No, I just am faster at typing.  I'm going to write it down here, but like I said, if it doesn't make sense to you, it'll make sense to me.  Probably the worst one.  I won't ask you to do it.  I'm going to write it down.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Being on equal opportunity,  councilmember, I will say fire  first because they do come from  the police side.  Fire, police, infrastructure and  policy that support those  entities.  Okay.  We will support policy next week.  Does that work?  I thought what you were looking for  are things that are more specific.  We are.  Okay.  For fire, and my district is on the east side,  so fire is a constant concern.  But in my mind, the biggest risk is that we have a fire in  bidwell park.  So there's two aspects to that.  Vegetation management in the area.  And then the fire in bidwell park.  But also keeping the homeless out of there so they don't start  campfires, which has been a problem.  So that's fire.  The flood thing is really important, but the county is  dealing with that.  So it's their responsibility.  But we're going to get impacted, so we're on top of it.  But it's not a budget impact for us.  In terms of personal safety and police, I think the biggest thing  we can do, and we've made huge strides since the  beginning of this, thanks to the chief, on traffic safety.  And so we have four and a half traffic cops now.  We need more.  But that's better than half of one.  And we have a red light camera system in the works.  Because accidents happen at intersections, right, for the  most part.  Good.  So you're right.  We are wanting specifics.  These are overarching.  This is where we're going to take our work.  And we're looking for a broad idea.  We're looking for a uniform kind of agreement to say this is  important.  And then we're looking at so let's even get more granular  and specific on this.  So I think this is a really good process, Jeff.  And I think it's important that I know we have a hard stop at  three and other people probably have commitments.  But I think we need to take enough time if we have to get  back together again or however you want to do this, or the  mayor wants to do this, that we run this to the ground and we  put a bow on it and we've got a finished product.  Thank you.  Thank you.  We still got 30 minutes.  So let's power through.  So if we're getting specific, then, you know, we have PD, we've  got traffic safety going.  We can argue whether or not we need that more.  We had an instance two weekends ago, I think it was, or last  weekend, where every single fire apparatus that we had was tied up  at a unit.  Meanwhile, a code, red, blue, whatever it is, was called in on  the other side of town and we had nobody to respond.  So that's a good thing.  But that's a specific that we need to directly address.  Do we have enough fire for the size of the city that we have and  we're responding to?  So staff department capacity, engine one, we kind of have  Engine one slash, yeah.  So making sure that we're right sized for the population,  preparing for what the future looks like and growth and all  of that.  Correct.  And you're right, we need to get more granularity.  We're going to really take this down the ground.  It's those specifics where the question that has to be, is this  the place where we have the specific granularity, especially  we need to allocate this from here, there could be, right?  So far it could be something that's done, however the process  works, but that's where we need to get to is identifying those  specifics.  So I suspect you're wanting us to identify the macro again for  us to then prioritize the micro.  That's right.  Yeah.  I think that's what we're going to do for hand writing help  and to make ideas and concepts more succinct.  Anything else here on a safe community?  Council member Van Overbeck already touched on homelessness,  but I just want to reemphasize that, that we need to have a  multifaceted approach to homelessness.  Okay.  Thank you.  Thank you.  So I want to clarify what I said about the homeless earlier.  You wrote that they be housed.  So what I meant when I made the comment a couple hours ago was  that it is not their choice to camp in our public spaces.  They must be compelled to either go to the shelter, get treatment,  or go to jail.  Okay.  Those are the choices.  So effectively effectively effectively effectively  effectively effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively This might end up falling into a different category, but I was thinking of yeah, this might fall into goal number three, protect and enhance primary community assets, but protecting our urban forest and bid well park is a safety conversation because we have seen  conversation because we have seen extreme heat building and building and building every single  summer and that is one of the few spaces that a lot of our community who don't have access to  air conditioning can go to cool down so if our urban forest and our lower park are at risk  that also takes away a safety element as well  anything else all right let's turn our attention then to long-term viability and this was a catch-all  for all the things you remember we talked about we'll go back and look at it we talked about  business development we talked about environmental sustainability all those  things within that so if this goal is to take place what are our objectives to carry this out  um  comment  um  so i'm going to say i agree with that and this is maybe a subset of that  sound financial policy we almost lost our city because a lack of that and you can't have  long-term viability without short-term viability and it begins with sound financial policy  so i'd like to change that because we do have sound financial policy to  maintain  or sustain sound financial policy because we're doing a really good job of that now well and don't don't suggest that i'm not saying that tom  no no i didn't mean to i'm just saying that needs to continue because it's not effectively going to be that way in 10 years unless we make that a continued  priority Prioritize? Continue, C-O-N-T. Put a check next to it.  podem !  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  is a steady investment in streets and roads.  I got another.  Land use reform.  I was going to say smart growth,  but I feel like those are likely the same thing.  You can put it in parentheses next to it.  Yeah, in parentheses, smart growth.  Which, well, sure.  To me, it means growth that, you know,  has long-term benefits to our city  instead of, you know, investing in streets and roads  to nowhere that won't recoup their tax revenue.  An extension of...  Following our general plan.  Follow our general plan.  An extension of infrastructure investment  can also include...  Accessibility.  Ensuring that our infrastructure  is safe for multiple modes of transit.  Support downtown and support the university.  Very critical.  And that fits under that now, so...  Last one.  Last one as well.  Okay.  Others?  Okay.  I want to add, I...  So, we need to look at housing,  our housing policy.  And so, as alluded to with smart growth,  um...  So, there's really two aspects of this.  And Addison and I co-chair a committee  that's dealing with growth and housing.  You know, one is to see if there are any code changes  that can be made to facilitate infill development.  And we've identified some.  And the other is we need to increase the supply  of developable land because we're underproducing  the single type of housing that people prefer right now,  which is three-bedroom, two-bath homes.  We're not making enough of them,  which is why...  The price is going up.  So, we really need to look at housing.  And those are the two basic things the city can do.  I mean, what the city can't do  is create affordable housing magically  because we don't have...  There are market forces and cost of labor materials  and all that stuff.  Good.  Thank you.  I appreciate that.  Anything else?  Thank you.  Third goal.  Protect the hands of primary community assets.  Attracting and retaining a workforce  while also attracting and retaining  a diverse array of businesses.  Okay.  So, we have three.  We identify three elements.  The park, the downtown, and the university.  And my colleague, Mr. Bennett,  called out the university under viability in downtown,  which is exactly right,  but it also belongs under  because those are two of the three.  And so, we need...  So, specifically, what we need to do...  And again, this is happening  with new leadership at the university  that's really excellent.  And he's trying very hard to work with the city.  But as the council,  we need to make sure  that we have a downtown that's attractive.  And then, with Bidwell Park,  it just needs a refresh.  So, we're in the middle of repaving the roads.  We're going to rebuild the pool at one mile,  which is failing structurally.  But there are a number of other things  that we can do to enhance the park.  And we're having conversations  with public works on how to do that.  So, again, that's another example  of things that are in motion.  So, in some ways, it's stayed in course.  In other ways, it's created a course.  I think it's...  I think there's some new things.  I think we can do some things with housing  as it relates to protecting our asset.  I mean, I think we're doing the right thing.  As it relates to safety,  I think we're doing the right things.  We just need to keep doing them  and stay focused and not get bored  and look for something new and creative.  So, along with those three that we, I think,  all agree on,  one that I think is very important to all of us  and for everyone in this community,  our neighborhoods,  we need to prioritize neighborhoods.  Because if you don't feel safe where you work,  where you recreate,  where you educate,  or where you live,  quality of life suffers.  Quality of civic life suffers,  and neighborhoods have to be a priority as well.  Where people live,  that's one of the most important aspects of civic life.  Can I ask you to elaborate  on some of how you see that playing in?  Because we're talking a lot about the core, too, in this.  I think where people live,  that's a pretty important community asset.  And we have looked at different pieces of that,  and it's a broad puzzle,  but just looking at safety on our roads.  You brought up some things I think were very sound.  We looked at stop signs and internal affairs.  That's a neighborhood issue as well.  All those things.  Traffic safety that Tom had brought up  and commended the chief for.  Those are all aspects of neighborhoods.  The infrastructure.  Obviously if your house is flooding,  that's a problem.  So neighborhoods have got to be part of that  community asset discussion in my opinion.  We'll go back here where we look at  they, let's see.  The  The  The  They fit together in a holistic, consistent way,  and work to succeed in that environment.  This is what we're talking about from a strategic standpoint.  So it fits here, it fits here, and it fits under safety.  So these things are not, we're not creating these siloed goals and objectives.  This is all happening, and it has to happen,  it has to be teaming together.  They have to be operating with use in order for us to pursue  and achieve the higher quality of civic life in Chico.  So it doesn't, it's not a bad thing, it fits here, it fits here, it fits here.  In fact, if you go through and you do a SWOT analysis,  which we're not doing today,  oftentimes a strength can be a weakness.  It's the same thing with a question you ask an interview,  what's your biggest weakness?  Oh, I just work too much, I'm too committed, I'm a workaholic,  and it won't stop.  That's not a strength, that's a weakness, right?  But we turn it into a strength.  And so too can an opportunity.  It can also be a threat, and vice versa, a threat to an opportunity.  So it's okay to go here.  In fact, I would much prefer they are,  because what it does is it reintegrates the importance of them  and why they need to be a strategic focus.  And that's what we're doing, so I appreciate that.  I have two.  One is kind of already mentioned,  restoration and enhancement of parks and greenways.  So in some ways what we're talking about here,  but we're talking more about,  are there any greenways, parks, and kind of...  Yeah, and I do like to expand it beyond just Pitbull Park,  because more people live near other greenways too.  And, yeah.  The other I put is visual enrichment slash big art projects.  I have in mind something like, you know, we talk about downtown a lot,  and I think that is probably the key place to concentrate this on activities,  but you should be able to stand anywhere in downtown  and recognize that you're in Chico.  I had support the arts online, so good.  So we haven't, I don't think we've moved CSU over to here,  but what I had written down is to support CSU in their endeavors.  I want to be sure to stay in our lane.  They have their own goals and they have their things,  but we want to support them.  And to potentially look at new opportunities.  So, for instance, if they want to expand and do something out at the,  you don't have to write this down, but out at the farm, for instance,  we want to support them in their endeavors to continue to do things  to bring more students, but we don't want to take on their burden.  We need to stay in our lane and take care of the city  and just be a good partner.  And that gets into this collaboration and against the Ministry of Communication.  So we start to communicate what it is that our partners are doing.  So how can we not just create things, but we can enhance the things  that are at different rates by partnering with them.  Say, hey, look at what's happening.  At one of the jewels of our community, we're excited to partner with them.  That's good.  Anything else?  Affordability.  I know that that's a larger topic.  It's hard to address that specifically in the budget,  but I think that's a theme we need to be aware of when we're talking about  preserving and enhancing our community aspects,  because that helps keep our workforce here.  And the transportation improvements.  I know that's something we've said in both.  The other ones.  But making sure that our city stays bike-able and walk-able.  OK.  So more in line with Mayor's comments on CSU Cheek in particular.  I think just like strategic partnerships with community organizations  and all sorts of people that are already doing work  and being able to make little investments that can really complement  and enhance that and leverage that.  That's great.  Yeah.  Folks who are doing this work, how do you come alongside and support them?  And that creates an exponential impact.  It's great. Thank you.  Anything else?  Did we get wildfire resilience in there?  I think we touched on it with greenways probably.  It was definitely here.  Okay, cool.  And again, like I said, we're not putting a stamp on this.  We're done with it.  This is a new product, so we can make edits.  But what we have thus far, the commitment that all of you have made  to be together for the last two hours and some odd minutes,  or three hours, I want to say,  gets us a lot closer to the focus of where we're heading as a council  to best create the overall quality of civic life here in Chico.  So I want to really quickly go back over this.  And I want to talk through what these look like.  We started here a safe community.  We have a long-term viability.  And then this was a placeholder, which I appreciate Mayor Reynolds saying.  Let's just call this what it is, a recommendation on the right to refer  to as protecting enhanced primary community assets.  That gets us into three really, I think, well-thought-out, developed,  honed-in strategic goals that will impact both the short-term, the mid-term,  and definitely the long-term.  Because what you have accomplished in our time together has not just said,  what's here in front of us, but what's the impact down the road?  And this will continue on beyond four years,  but the start that we have here is a very powerful and impactful one.  So we go over here and we look at then what are our goals?  What are our objectives to carry them out?  And I want to just read through them once again.  And then we'll send follow-up.  We will engage and talk through what that looks like to get even more granular.  So we'll go over here.  We'll talk about the goals that we can have time to come before us and say,  okay, now is how we're going to allocate dollars for the budget process.  So we talk about safe community.  Vision zero, infrastructure, staff department capacity focused on areas and things  that are similar to potholes, roads, conditions, Engine 1 specifically,  supportive policy leads to the proper staffing of police and fire,  resiliency having to do with wildland management, flood management,  specifically the Invincible Park and the urban forests.  We'll talk through traffic safety.  We'll talk about the safety, multi-faceted approach to homelessness.  Okay?  And with the clarification that what was said earlier does not specifically mean  that they can set up a traffic safety .  We then go over to goal two, which is long-term viability.  Economic strategic plan.  Sound financial policy continue.  It's in place.  Continue. Stay the course.  Steady investment in streets and roads.  Land use reform, parenthesis, smart growth.  Follow the general plan.  Infrastructure.  Accessibility.  Support the downtown and the university.  Explore housing policy.  The things that the city can do.  What's the purview?  Code changes and supply of land that can be built.  Okay? And then we come to goal three, protect and enhance the primary community assets.  Attract a workforce and diverse array of businesses.  Downtown that's attractive.  A big old park, increasing and enhancing the roads, the pool, but other aspects of that.  Going back to the urban forest and the importance there.  The creation of well thought out neighborhoods to have safe communities where people live.  In fact, there's some, as a side, there's a book written over here called Wellbeing.  And it looks at five elements of well-being.  Maybe you saw this. It looks at financial, it looks at career, it looks at physical, it looks at social, it looks at community.  And people always ask when I talk about it, what's the difference in social and community?  Community gets the very fact when you talk about where you live.  Do you feel safe where you live?  And each of those five elements have a direct impact on the other four.  And so when your career well-being is low, it drags down the other four.  When your career well-being is high, it drags up.  When your community well-being is high, you get the idea, right?  So these are vital and crucial to the overall protection and enhancement of primary community assets.  Then we talked about restoration of parks and greenways.  Visual enrichment and large art projects.  I love the statements.  You should be able to stand anywhere, whether it was downtown or at the university, and look around and say, I know that I'm a chief.  There's something unique.  There's something new for me.  There's something to enjoy about it.  Support CSU in their endeavors and look at new opportunities to partner, getting down to this idea of strategic partnerships.  Let's not recreate things that aren't in place.  Let's capitalize on those that are through partnerships.  Transportation, of course, and then affordability.  So you have accomplished a lot in a very short amount of time.  A project that oftentimes I will spend two days on.  We did this in three and a half hours with a couple of breaks, some time allowed for public comments.  And this is, I guess, what I would say the hope of what we've accomplished, knowing that we're not going to get our grand reno in ten hours.  But certainly, we're so much closer right now than where we started.  So let me just say really quickly.  I'm so grateful for this.  I'm so grateful for the support you're engaging in this process.  Perhaps what I'm most grateful for is that you trusted the process and you trusted me to lead us through that.  To say, I don't know where we're going.  There's some mystery around here, he said.  There's some enigma.  What's happening here?  And yet, I don't know, I have hours of work to pour through to communicate back to the council and say, look what we did.  At the beginning, I read you this quote.  Except you'll notice that the top is different this time.  It was plan the work, which we've done, now it's time to work the plan.  So having a strategic plan is a great way to get priorities and progress.  Remember to always plan the work, and now we're talking about work the plan.  Everything can be high priority, and we need to be having goals, always a great thing to strive for.  Taking into account the resources and funding available, make priorities real and stable.  So we talked through ways to keep this health in one bite at a time.  And we'll get even more specific.  And so maybe it's a larger bite when I become the middle.  And those middles eventually consume the entire health.  I love that it was in the paper that Mayor Reynolds said, we're going to put it on the wall.  We talked about that too.  Because it creates a sense of accountability.  Which, I can go back to the areas of strategy.  We talked about cost leadership, we talked about municipal and city leadership.  We looked to the council.  We talked about the city staff.  We talked about the council to lead this community.  The city staff looks to the council for the directives that are given to carry out policy.  Things of nature that impact people like me and people like the folks that live next door to you.  We have to be accountable to each other.  And what I've gotten at this time is that there is a desire and drive to do just that.  So I appreciate that because it is accountability that is the glue that ties with the results.  As I mentioned, if we're just here to have an exercise, we just waste four hours of our time.  But I don't think we're wasting any time.  We've got this really important outcome.  It's a great thing to do.  You, was Eisenhower quoted earlier?  So, and this is my last thought and then I'll leave you with a couple of minutes for any comments from the mayor or other questions if we have time.  Our founder wrote an article some years ago.  This article titled, Don't Treat the Security Plans As Cops.  He says, ensure stakeholders understand the purpose of your security plan.  Make sure you plan goals and time frames that are not merely crowd pleasers.  Encourage your culture of feedback and thoughtful consent blessing.  And think of your security plan as part of the meaning of life.  But if, or maybe I'd say when, the next uncertain act takes place in our community, we must be able and willing to pivot.  And to make adjustments and to collaborate and communicate how we are going to move forward when things don't go according to plan.  But it's not a matter of thinking.  It's not going to go according to plan.  It's not a matter of planning.  I said it from the beginning in the one-on-one conversation with the staff.  I reiterated over and again the quality of staff that we have here at Chico.  I'm proud to call this place home.  I'm proud to be here at the council.  I'm proud of the staff as we are because together I think while hope is not a strategy, we have great hope for the future here at Chico.  So, I don't have to put this up here, this idea of disagreeing today.  Because I think we had a great three minutes.  But we're aware of what this priorities have to be.  But sometimes if we're going to work together, we would say, I may not fully agree with that, but maybe it's a longing.  We were born together in that.  So, I think I'm grateful for that.  So, what's next?  I will put all this together.  I'll send it out from Sydney to Debbie.  Copy and Angie will have a conversation to talk about if there's no meaning, to get more granular, to cut some of our family regs quite.  And we'll talk through what that looks like.  And then, we'll talk about the future.  And then, I will put together a document as was mentioned earlier.  There will be one that's public facing and one that's internal.  With some specifics.  It won't be, as the kids are saying these days, TLDR, which is too long to read.  I don't want to give you a 27-page document because you don't want to read that.  But something that's very succinct.  And I'll probably send it to Council Member O'Brien to make sure that I've communicated properly with the Senate.  And knock on my own hand, I'll type this for sure.  So, final thoughts before we end our time.  Mr. Van Overbeck.  Good process, Jeff.  And I think the part I liked about it was there were no surprises.  I mean, I think to one degree or another, we all have similar priorities.  And what you did is clarify and distill them for us, which is very valuable.  Thank you.  I just want to thank you as well, despite the handwriting snafu.  You did an excellent job.  And I appreciate the distilling as well.  And really, there was a little mystery at first.  Certainly, I understand where you're going with this and setting up the macro so we can determine the micro.  I appreciate that.  And that helps us to formalize our goals and objectives, particularly moving into budget season.  So, thank you for that, Jeff.  I would also like to thank the board.  I would also like to thank you.  I've been through hundreds of strategic planning sessions.  We had to do it every year for the shopping center.  And we did SWOT every year.  I never want to see SWOT again.  And I thank you for not bringing that before us.  You did a great job.  I think this is a very, very valuable process.  So, I thank you for that.  I had fun.  Thank you.  All right.  Well, I will wrap it up to say thank you for giving us your time and all your effort and everything that you've done for us and being prepared and taking all the time with staff to get us here.  My goal, if my co-counselors are willing, would be that we would do this in January of next year.  So, we're doing it much before budget season.  And it becomes an annual process where we check in at the first of the year.  How did we do on what our goals were last year?  Where are we going for this year?  And it would become an annual review.  And then once we have your report, then we can bring it up and have a conversation about, okay, do we want to drill down even further from here and do maybe it's only a couple-hour workshop or an hour workshop again.  So, I appreciate you staying on for that.  And unless we have anything else, I'll adjourn us to our closed session on the 1st, either at 5 or 5.30.  Not sure which that's going to be yet.  Followed by regular council at 6 o'clock right here in the chambers.  All right.  We're adjourned.  Great job, everyone.
