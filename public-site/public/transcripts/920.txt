 So our first item is 1.1, Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag. You may now rise and salute the flag. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. All right, please have a seat. 1.2 is roll call. May we please have the roll call? Chair Goldstein? Present. Commissioner Derrimetti? Here. Commissioner Howlett? Here. Commissioner Ober? Here. Commissioner Rensink? Present. And Commissioner Scott? Present. And Vice Chair Arum Law is absent today. Thank you, Marcy. And thank you to everyone who has joined us, whether by computer or by phone. Please note that your connection will be on mute for most of this meeting, but we will allow public testimony, during each item on the agenda. At that time, you can let us know you wish to speak by clicking the button on your screen to raise your hand. It looks a little like a hand by the attendees list, or by dialing star three on your phone pad during the public hearing portion of the item. Please remember to minimize any background noise when it's your turn to speak, and we will try to have this meeting follow the same format as if we were doing this all in person. Thank you. Um, item two is the consent agenda. And it looks like we just have approval of the minutes on the consent agenda. Do we have discussion or motion for approving the consent agenda in minutes? I believe we have approved the agenda. The minutes? The minutes, excuse me. Mm-hmm. Do we have a second? Sure, I'll second. Thank you. Do we have any discussion? Seeing none, let's take a vote on approving the consent agenda. All in favor, please say aye. Aye. Aye. Um, any opposition? Any opposed? Any abstentions? Seeing none, um, the consent agenda passes. Three, business from the floor. Members of the public may address the commission at this time on any matter not already listed on the agenda with comments being limited to three minutes. The commission cannot take any action at this meeting on requests made under this section of the agenda. Do we have any business from the floor? Any questions so far? Let's do this by just unmuting everybody. Oh, Danielle, Delia Fernandez has raised her hand. Delia, would you like to address the commission's business? I know. It's a little hard to hear. Is there some background noise? Yeah. Perhaps we should come back to this person. Okay. Unless anybody else is hearing more than I am. Let's try Calla Horton. She found the raise your hand button. Calla. Calla. Okay. Does anybody else have business information? It sounds like there's probably none at the moment. And I'm guessing our speakers tonight are probably mostly here for the hand-dised items. So I think we can, unless there's any other people, we can move on to item four, public hearings. So in our public hearings section, Okay. we have a couple of items. And the first of which is 4.1 use permit 19-12 Elisha Court Apartments. And yeah, yield to staff. Thank you, Chair Goldstein and commissioners. This is a request to construct two multifamily residential apartment buildings containing a total of eight units on the southeast corner of Cohasset Road and Elisha Court. The site is designated office mixed use on the general plan land use. The site is designated office mixed use on the general plan land use diagram and is zoned office residential with airport overflight zone B2 overlay. Multifamily residential uses are allowed in the OR zoning district with an approved use permit. The site is vacant and undeveloped with a gross lot size of 0.64 acres. The residential density for the project is calculated at 12.5 dwelling units per gross acre, consistent with the allowable range of 6 to 20 dwelling units. The project is estimated to be a total of 6.5 dwelling units per acre for residential development in the OR zoning district. Wait a second for the PowerPoint to come up for you guys here. Additionally, the project's density would be in accordance with changes to the Butte County Airport Land Use Commission density standards and does not exceed the average gross density of comparable surrounding uses within 300 feet of the project site, which is calculated at 14.4. The site is designated office mixed use on the general plan land use diagram and is zoned office residential with airport overflight zone B2 overlay. The site is designated office mixed use on the general plan land use diagram and does not exceed the average gross density of comparable surrounding uses within 300 feet of the project site, which is calculated at 14.4. The proposed buildings would be two-story structures having a finished height of approximately 28 feet, well below the maximum height allowance of 35 feet for main buildings in the OR zoning district, as well as the neighboring R1 zoning district. Next slide. Thank you. Additionally, the project's density would be in accordance... Oh, I'm sorry. Lost my place here. The buildings are situated in an L shape and utilize the minimum street side setback from Cohasset Road in order to provide a 41-foot setback from the nearest single family residence to the east. The main entrance courtyard would be oriented toward Alicia Court. The transition between the proposed multifamily units and adjacent single family residential uses on Alicia Court, would be further mediated by a large and well landscaped courtyard and parking area as seen on the next slide. The architectural review board reviewed the site improvements and architectural details associated with this project at yesterday's meeting and recommended that the planning commission adopt a resolution to approve architectural review application 1917, subject to the recommended conditions. Please refer to the memo from staff dated September 17, which parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler details the board's recommendations. The next slide is the three additional recommended conditions from the Architectural Review Board. Several letters from the public were received with comments on this project. Staff has provided individual responses and prepared a memo to the Commission which addresses several of these concerns. In regard to parking, the project meets all applicable parking requirements set forth in CMC Chapter 1970. Two-bedroom multi-family residential units are required to provide 1.75 spaces per unit. With eight units proposed, 14 spaces are required plus one guest space for every five units for a total of 15 required off-street parking spaces. Access to the proposed new units would be taken from Alicia Court, a local road intended for limited mobility with higher access points. Cohassa is classified as arterial road intended to provide the highest level of mobility over the longest uninterrupted distance. CMC Section 1970.070 limits the number of access points and states whenever a property has access to more than one road, access shall be generally limited to the lowest volume where the impact of new accesses will be minimized. Next slide. The site is located on the well-traveled Cohassa Road corridor which has several large apartment complexes amongst the pattern of primarily residential but also commercial and institutional uses in the area. While adjacent neighbors are zoned OR and R1 through low density residential, parcels nearby have a wide variety of dense residential and intense commercial zonings. Last slide please. The project is consistent with several general plan goals and policies and with the city's objective design and development standards. Staff recommends the planning Commission adopt resolution 2012 approving the project subject to the recommended conditions. That concludes the report from staff on this item. I can take any questions. DR. parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler! DR. parler parler parler parler DR. DR.! DR.! There's, I think, two guest bike parking spaces. So my question is, first of all, if that seems like a sufficient number of bike parking spaces. And I had that question, and then I saw that it also says there are resident bike parking storage areas in their patios. What would that look like? I couldn't find more info on that. Yeah, each unit is equipped with a private outdoor space that's gated and has a bicycle parking area. There's also a guest bicycle parking area central to the site. Okay, so is it like a central resident bike parking area? Yeah, just for guests and anyone else who may be coming and going. Okay, good to know that there is designated bike parking for residents. I wasn't sure. So thank you. Yeah. Yeah, I think that answers my question. I've got a couple. So, Dr. Talk to me about the new conditions, number eight and number nine, starting with the parking lot full light. It becomes a smaller floor. Sure. So we, like I mentioned, have had several letters submitted from the public along Alicia Court. The remainder of that street is occupied by single-family residences. The direct neighbor to the east, that entire neighborhood, is actually equipped with solar. But in order to not impact the solar. The solar arrays on the nearest neighbor, conditions seven and eight were recommended by the board, would relocate the parking lot shade tree either more north and closer to the Alicia Court street frontage or be replaced by a carport, which would provide the same shading of the parking area and not be an obstruction for the solar arrays. Has the applicant been made aware of this change? Or did he have any thoughts? In terms of the parking or doing a carport area? Yes, we did discuss this. This was recommended with the board's recommendation yesterday. The applicant is aware. And I did put this slide up just so all of the public members who might be participating today are aware of these conditions. So is he leaning toward moving the tree or doing a carport? We did just leave some flexibility in there. And then I guess, and then on number nine, I think the question is, It seems pretty wide open. Is it up to staff or were there certain suggestions that. That was a specific suggestion from one board member, board member Thompson, who felt that more consistency could be achieved in the architectural design. The proposed buildings do use stucco and wood siding, which is consistent with the remainder of houses on that street, as well as the dental office approved across the street. At one Alicia Court. Board member Thompson specifically was looking for something. Like an enhanced entryway or portico, but she noticed was part of the architectural motif of the neighborhood. And so that would be from the, is this on the buildings or coming into the parking lot? We kind of wrote that condition to be a little bit more flexible for the developer. Board member Thompson said he didn't want to design the project. But would like to see enhanced consistency. And so we left that. I'm going to work with staff on that then. Excuse me. He'll work with staff on that. Yes. Okay. Do we have further questions for staff? So Kelly, I get with number seven, then does that take care of all of the concerns with solar array and. To staff's opinion? Yes. The building, like I mentioned is over 45 or 41 feet from the property line, even further from the adjacent residents. The, if we want to bring up the site plan again, the house next door has their solar kind of central, right? You can see kind of the outline of the adjacent residents right there. And it would be mounted at the peak of their roof. So the building being only 28 feet tall would not obstruct the solar. So the solar. The solar is mounted at the peak, the top peak of the neighbors building. Okay. Yeah. All right. Okay. Thank you. Yeah. That related definitely to that. Excuse me. So that's existing solar. They have solar on their house on the. Existing solar. Right now. Do we know, I don't want to, I also don't want to over engage or do the designing, but if the, if the developer, if the solar chose to do the carport, is there a standard height for, for that that would just, we would just know and the neighbor would know because it is not to exceed or because of the standard height is X, then there's the assurance that if that's the route that was chosen, that the definitely solar wouldn't be impacted. I'm not entirely sure if there's a standard height for a carport, but I would imagine it wouldn't be much taller than the fence line and definitely shorter than the roof line of the adjacent. Residence. Okay. Thank you. Further questions for staff. I also forgot to ask if we have expert a communication. If anybody wants to disclose that real quick, if there is any none from me. All right, then we can I believe move on to the public hearing. Do we have public comments on the item? I know we have received some from staff through, from the public. I see we have the architect and project developer in the panel queue. Great. Let's have them up first. Greg Pites. Would you like to address the commission on this? Hi, can you hear me? I am. I'm Greg Pites. I'm the architect for the project. I also was the architect for the homes. Well, this entire project was, was the product of a client of mine from 20 years ago, but this project obviously was a response to the need for housing in Chico. The current owner has tried for years and years to attract a professional office. Type use, but the demand for that in Chico just doesn't seem to attract people who want to build there. So when the opportunity came to do multifamily housing, which is a lot of stone, given the current circumstances, it seemed like the more fitting this property. I think you've all read the staff. Response to the questions and concerns that the neighborhood has had. I feel like the project has addressed just about everything that you can do. As far as the location of the buildings, none of the living space like living rooms, kitchens, dining rooms. They're all on the ground floor. The buildings are situated away from the single-family residential uses. The backyards are situated away from the, single-family residential uses. I acknowledge that it would be a concern to have a large shade tree next to your solar panels. I think that can easily be mitigated either with adjusted landscape plan or with carports, as was suggested. I discussed the architecture of the buildings with the, builder with the owner of the property, who also is a contractor. Our suggestion would be to perhaps change the roof lines of the buildings to be a hip roof instead of a gable roof. They have a lower profile, aren't as vertically tall, gable end walls, and adjacent single-family residences have hip roofs as well. So in response to number nine, I think that would be a very good solution to Mr. Thompson's comment regarding the architecture. I don't have any other comments. Great. Thank you, Greg. All right. So we also have the landscape architect on the line. It looks like, are we going to hear from Brian? Okay. So, Okay. So we also have the landscape architect on the line. If not, we can move on to other public comments. Hi, Brian. I'm just here to answer questions if anybody has questions of me. Thanks. So do we have questions for either of these applicants? I do. Yeah. Great. Ken has a question. So just to confirm, looking at the map here, it doesn't have directions northeast south on it. So I can't refer to that. But when you turn off of Cohasset Road, onto Alicia Court, and you're then going down Alicia Court, the project site will be on your right, correct? I think so. Okay. Then the very first house on the right, adjacent to the project site, is that the one that has the concern about solar blockage? Okay. Is, is the current plans building or the current landscape design going to significantly block the solar access, if you will, to the skyline when this project is in? I know the buildings are associated, situated on the opposite side. But what about the landscape? And it looked like a couple of trees were planned to go in along that property line there, or along that side of the road. So I think that's the one that's going to be in the property line. Staff, do you want to answer that? Or do you want me to answer it? I believe that the board was comfortable moving the one parking lot shade tree towards Alicia Court, and therefore would be of less impact to the neighboring solar. Okay. And I don't recall seeing the exact orientation of where the, that lot's solar panels are in relation to this project site. But moving that, that tree is the principal obstruction of the solar access, if you will, correct? Yeah, that was the concern. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Do any other commissioners have questions for the applicants? John? I guess just a quick one for Brian. If it is moved toward the north, into that northeast corner, that large shade tree, do we have any, how far away do we have to stay from the PG&E box there? Is that a major concern? Or is that, what does PG&E feel about that? I think that what we're talking about is moving that tree three stalls to the north, so we don't interfere with the tree that's already there at the entrance of the parking lot. So it would not be a concern getting close to the PG&E box. So three stalls. Okay. Thank you. Yes. All right. If there's no further questions for the applicants, let's see if we have any public comments. Thank you, by the way. Doug? Bruce McCray, you're on. You have a little bit of background. background noise if you could sculpt that. Yeah. Bruce? We hear you, Bruce. Go ahead. It says . So that's where you can type stuff to. Bruce, you're not coming through. Clearly. Can you start again? I don't know. It says that there's low bandwidth on this connection. So I'm going to. Is there a way for participants to type a comment in the chat box? I have no problems connecting. Yeah. It looks like there's a chat box. We're having difficulties here saying that. parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler! parler parler parler parler parler parler! parler parler! parler! parler parler! parler parler parler that we can read, if that's allowed. We might have to move on to the next public speaker, since it doesn't seem like we can hear you. Yeah, we can always come back to you, Bruce. So let's see who else is on the line. All right. Now we're going to go to just the attendees, and let's go down the list. Callahorton, you're first up. Would you like to address this item? To the commission? Oops. Callah, you're unmuted. Callah, would you like to address the commission on this item? Hearing no response, we're going to move on to Corey Olson. Corey Olson, would you like to address the commission on this item? I'm thinking if folks don't raise their hands, it might make sense to just... All right. Move on. Corey, can you address the commission on this item? Yes, please. Can you guys hear me? Mm-hmm. Okay. Again, I'd like to thank the city for allowing us to have public hearings like this. I covered most of my concerns yesterday, mostly regarding parking my solar panels on the western-facing roof, also with privacy and headlights shining through. I remember letting people know that they were allowed to park on the property side of my fence at night when people are pulling up to park a lot. Also with traffic, especially during emergency situations, given the one-way-in, one-way-out nature of Alicia Court. I'd like to note the example property given on the slide on Lupin has two outlets, both on Cohasset and Eaton. You will find, also in regards to the dentist's office that's currently in construction on the north property on Alicia, you will find no one on our street objected to that measure when it went into operation. It was presented a couple of months ago. As the property owner next to this project, I did not and would not have purchased my home in 2017 knowing that this project would be considered. I'd also like to state these objections knowing full well the housing crisis that is faced in our community right now. However, cramming apartment complexes into every tiny available lot won't make Chico a desirable place to live in the future. That is all I have to say. Thank you for your comment. Do we have other speakers? I think we do. I'd like to get back to Bruce McRae, who has raised his hand again. Let's give this a shot, Bruce. You're unmuted. Thank you very much. I do have just a little quick comment. This project was designed by the city standards that existed in 2006 and 2007. They provided narrower streets and higher density. They felt that they could... They could isolate and help the neighbors by putting commercial property on the busy streets. As we move forward with that, and I wanted to just clear up all the questions on the CC&Rs. I've been in business for 43 years and done a half a dozen subdivisions, and we always had CC&Rs for the neighbors to protect against each other. We're leaving boats and motorhomes and doing things like putting up a garage. A garage. Personal home businesses and that sort of thing. And these CC&Rs on this piece of property, the first condition was the general conditions excluded lots 1 and 24 from these CC&Rs. And when it specifically dealt with commercial and item 9 on the CC&Rs, it stated 9B that any commercial activities on lot 1 and lot 24, it stated 9B that any commercial activities on lot 1 and lot 24, it stated 9B that any commercial activities on lot 1 and lot 24, were permitted by the city of Chico were fine, which is what we advanced on. So the concept with all of this and the fact that there's probably three times the normal office space for rent and normal and a housing shortage, we moved to this as helping to solve that situation. In a time in our society when more and more people are moving into apartments permanently as a way of life and this is a nice attractive small unit and you're not dealing with the big mega mega unit kind of atmosphere and so we're proud of doing that and helping that shortage. Now the design we tried obviously it's been repeated in a number of times over by Greg and Kelly and other folks that we've done everything that we thought we could do to minimize the impact on the neighbors. We discovered that hey there's a basically a hip roof pattern in that subdivision and we would propose to put a hip roofs on these both buildings and that'll bring them down in appearance. We would suggest that we would go with more horizontal sidewalks, parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler first parler first to degrade their lifestyle. And this is just here under these rules and regulations since the day that they were put there, and we tried to do the best we could within those rules. And we will certainly do anything we can help by moving a tree and reducing the light and anything else that we can help them be more pleased and happier to live with us. I would reserve at the end if there's anybody that would have any questions, because I want them to completely understand that we're not bad guys and that they're not bad guys and that they understand everything that's going on. So come back to me if you can or need to. Thank you very much. Thank you for your comment, Bruce. Glad we got to hear you. Me too. Mike, do we have any other folks with their hands up? Hands raised. Yes, I want to try Cali Ward. I had something on mute that just allowed her to hear us. Okay. Cali Ward, would you like to address the commission on the side? I think she said the next item. Lisa McKay, would you like to address the commission on the side? There you go. There is one caller calling in on the phone. You are now unmuted. Would you like to speak? Caller. Caller. Caller. Caller. Hello? We can hear you. Go ahead. Hold on. Let me get my other one off. I'm sorry. There we go. I was on both lines just in case. Hi. Thank you. This is Mindy Honey. I tried to raise my hand too. I wasn't sure if that worked. But I just wanted to speak and address on behalf of almost all of Alicia Court, our concerns. And I know there's some more hands raised. I will probably tell you the same thing. A lot of us attended last night's meeting. And we acknowledge that or they acknowledge that there's a lot of concern. And one of the board members last night actually drove on our block and visited our street and noticed that every house here was a single family house, one story. Therefore, the apartments that they are trying to build does not match our existing block of a two-story building that they're trying to do. So it's not matching our neighborhood. And strictly in the CC&Rs, that's what they are trying to do is match within our neighborhood. The biggest reason we are concerned also is our safety in an emergency. We're in a cul-de-sac, as you know. Adding eight more families within this 22 current residents with a dentist's office would significantly impact getting out. And as you know, fires are more and more prevalent up in our area. So we're trying to do that. And we do understand there is a housing crisis. And like Corey said, packing eight units in this little area is less desirable for the street and not safe for the residents, even though it may have been approved. We do not feel safe having eight more people, eight more residents in our little cul-de-sac here. You can see around, there's maybe a two-story building across the street of Lupin. That has, you know, that's built in 1970. It doesn't really mimic the surrounding street. We are also just, you know, we're not a, we want to also work with Bruce as well. So I thank you for your concern, Bruce, with us as current residents moving things. But again, the impact is having these eight more families on this small street. So having one more person. I think that's a really important thing. Lisa parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler! parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler! parler! parler parler parler in fact decrease so again i urge you guys to oppose current projects and you know we can work together and you know try to find something that's more suitable for that corner lot thank you thank you for your comment mike do we have anybody else yes yes delia hernandez would you like to address the commission on the site hi i'm delia hernandez i'm also a resident on alicia court i did want to reiterate what mindy said i am in agreeance in addition 15 parking spots the average family has two vehicles there is no off-street parking uncle hank is the one that's going to be parking in the middle of the house it um the next street over would be lupin which would also not have any parking for guests as it is on garbage days it's kind of a challenge making sure that there's no cars parked on our street um i've actually been skipped because of that situation um there was a car parked too close to my garbage can uh i understand the only other place that maybe guests would turn to would be turning to alicia court i know we were also compared to the other buildings uh cameo and also off of lupin um cameo maybe a cul-de-sac as well but it had a much larger street um access to it um as well as lupin is a through through street alicia parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler! parler! parler Mark Truhe. Would you like to address the commission on this item? Yes, thank you. My name is Mark Truhe. I'm currently building the dental office immediately across the street at 1 Alicia Court. I've worked with Greg. He actually did the design for my building, and Brian did the landscaping for the building. My big concern, again, goes to the parking issue. To me, fundamentally, like our last speaker said, most of these apartments are going to have two cars for each of the apartments, counting 16 cars. Currently, there's 14 spaces for the parking, not including any guests. My fear is they're going to end up parking across the street in my lot on a consistent basis, and fundamentally, it just doesn't seem like there's enough parking. And it's a recurring theme I'm hearing from all the residents on Alicia Court. When I was looking at building my building, I talked with the residents to say what kind of impact, what are we looking at. And again, there was no objection to my building being built because I wasn't impacting them. I was taking into consideration how many cars am I going to have, how many patients am I going to see on a regular basis, and planned accordingly. Unfortunately, I think the apartment building itself is sufficient, but the parking is not. And I think that is one of the fundamental problems that most of the residents have. And I would just like to see that one maybe looked at a little more closely before we allow this project to go forward. Thank you. CHAIRPERSON WONG. Thank you. CHAIRPERSON WONG. Thank you. CHAIRPERSON WONG. Next person is Corey. Corey, can you hear me speak? We had Corey Olsen speak. CHAIRPERSON WONG. Yeah, this is Corey without a last name. So they may be the same person. I don't hear any noise coming out of the speaker though. You only get one speech. CHAIRPERSON WONG. Correct. We have the next speaker, Kay. CHAIRPERSON WONG. Thank you, Chair. CHAIRPERSON WONG. CHAIRPERSON WONG. on this. Okay. Hearing noice, we'll go on to Cody Grunwald. Cody Grunwald, would you like to address the commission? Yeah, good evening. Can you hear me? Very good. Well, first of all, thank you for taking the time to meet with us today to hear out all of our concerns. Obviously, you know, anything I have to say is everything my neighbors have already said, but I think that really there's just, you know, a lot that needs to be addressed with this project. The space was meant for an office. I would definitely, you know, agree with Corey's point that I also would not have bought here if I had known that there was going to be a large apartment complex squeezed into such a small plot right at the end of my street. I think the apartments are far too big for the space that exists, and the parking is just ridiculous. I mean, to think that there's not going to be extra vehicles, visitors at any point in time. Beyond that, I've lived in apartments before. You know, people have more than one vehicle. They have boats. They have motorcycles. They have things that they'll park, you know, and without extra space to put all this, it's going to end up on our street. Beyond that, of course, there is the issue of getting out onto Cohasset, which is already an incredibly busy street. It can already be incredibly busy to get out onto that street in a non-emergency situation. So, you know, factor in something along the lines of a campfire, and we'd all be in a lot of trouble here. Beyond that, the additional eight proposed units are going to bring a lot of extra traffic onto Alicia Court. A lot of the families here have small children, and that could potentially be a safety concern that I feel hasn't really been addressed. Beyond that, by all means, I'm concerned about the home value. You know, I've lost the home value here. Again, these are nice homes, and I don't want to lose 20 percent of my equity. There's been, I think, countless negatives. Again, I'm kind of beating a dead horse here. I think everything's pretty much been said. But one thing that really kind of irked me last night is, you know, the council, the architectural committee last night said something along the lines of they didn't want the proposed buildings to disrespect the neighborhood, and they proceeded to say that they've designed these buildings with the minimum requirements in mind for about every single issue they could possibly use for minimum requirements, and, you know, making comments along the lines that this is about as good as it can get. I personally felt disrespected by that right off the bat. So I just would like to say I've, you know, strongly concerned, I'm strongly concerned, and I would really encourage you to, you know, vote against this project. I really just don't think it's been well thought out. This is meant for an office, and that's what it should be. That's about all I've got that hasn't already been said. Thank you. Thank you. Okay, the next speaker is also on the phone. All I can see is part of your phone number. It starts 570. Caller, would you like to address the commission on this item? 570, caller? Mike, could we go back to that other Corey? I don't know if you saw the chat box come up, but he said he did wish to speak on the item. Yes, I was, I communicated back to Calla and Corey L that we'll circle back to them at the end. Thank you. You're doing a great job, by the way. You sure are. Thank you. Jeremy, Jeremy S., would you like to address the commission on this item? Yes. You're very quiet, Jeremy. You have to speak up. We're going to be hearing you. Yeah. Okay, we're going to move on. Thank you. If he's calling, would you like to address the site? I need to be clear for the next one. Kathy L., would you like to address the commission on the site? No, thank you. Thank you. Ronnie Bank, Barks, would you like to address the commission on the site? I'm here to review the following project. I'll come back to you in a little bit. Michael, do you have a question? Yes. parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler! parler! parler parler parler! parler parler parler! parler! parler parler!!! parler parler parler parler parler parler parler Thank you. Jess Coakley, you're unmuted. Would you like to address the commission on the site? No, thank you. Chris G., would you like to address the commission on the site? So we're back up to the top for Calla Horton. You're on. Calla, would you like to address the commission on the site? Calla Horton, you said you wanted to speak. In the chat. No? All right, let's give Corey L. another shot. Corey L., would you like to speak on the site? Yes, can you hear me? Yep, we can. All right, so I'd just like to say I concur with all the other residents of Elisha of what they've said so far. Also, something I'd like to point out is pretty much no matter what you do to that building, it's going to stick out like a sore thumb. You could probably take a four-year-old, ask them the game that they play. Which one of these things doesn't belong? And within a second, they'd say that building. It's two stories. Nothing else here is two stories. And from all the research that I've done, it's actually not .64 acres. It's .4 acres. So we might need some clarification on that. So there's some misinformation there. Also, you'll notice, too, in the neighborhood that every single family home in this neighborhood has two dedicated parking spots. But now you're saying that that apartment complex is only going to have one dedicated parking spot. So how do you do that? parler parler parler parler parler parler parler! parler! parler parler parler parler! parler! parler parler parler parler!! parler parler parler parler!! parler parler parler not exempt 24. It does exempt it into using it for an office use. However, this is a residential use. And last night, the ARB acknowledged that the project has received more opposition than any project they've seen in years. It's extremely disappointing that so far really no meaningful compromise has been made with our concerns. Moving a tree is not enough. This project will have an immediate and permanent impact on the 23 residents and the dentist office, and our concerns should be addressed to reach a mutually agreeable solution. And as noted by the ARB, the buildings are not in keeping with the existing neighborhood pattern. The ARB noted that the buildings proposed should not disrespect the neighborhood. At present, we feel that they do. It's not an apples-to-apples comparison to assert that there are two-story apartment buildings across a five-lane street or on Lupin. The buildings that we're talking about are the single story buildings that are built in the 1970s and not visible from the existing Alicia homes. Alicia court, including the homes and dentist office, have a very specific architecture. They're all single story. They each have a portico at the entryway. And based on that, the project does not meet item D, maintaining neighborhood compatibility and context sensitive design. It just at this point disregards it. We ask that the massing be reduced to a single story building of comparable size. The project is in violation of the CCNRs, which require that any residential dwelling is at least 1,200 square feet and has a two-car garage. And 24 Alicia is not exempt from that. Last night, the city planner said that the CCNRs are not addressed by the city, but another employee said that the city would not intentionally approve a project that violates the CCNRs. And these should be honored in the interest of the 23 parcels and to avoid any undue conflict. Thank you. parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler!! parler! parler!! parler parler!!! parler parler!!! parler parler parler parler! parler!!! property values, yet it's a well-known fact that multifamily, especially of this density, has a significant negative impact on property values. This would mean the equivalent of taking 20% or $80,000 out of each homeowner's pocket and $1.8 million off the city tax rolls. We ask that the density be reduced to mitigate this impact. We've also been told that the fire marshal approved the exit from the street as sufficient. Multiple families are telling you that we do not feel safe adding this level of density at our exit, yet this concern has been repeatedly dismissed. And in our new normal of fast-moving fires, a 36% increase in density will potentially lead to trapped residents, and we must be vigilant. And we are in support of a residential development proceeding. However, it should be done in a manner that's acceptable to the existing residents. The current project does not represent the greatest good for the greatest number. And in the best interest of the existing and future residents, I urge you to reject the use permit at this time until an acceptable solution is reached. And I thank you for your consideration and finally being able to hear me. Thank you. Did everybody get a chance to speak? I saw Mike has asked in the chat box. I believe that that's everyone. I just sent out a message asking for anybody who didn't get a chance, if they really need one, and I don't hear any response right now. All right. Well, thank you all for your comments. Is there anything that the applicant would like to give like a rebuttal to if that's allowed? Yes. I would. Go ahead. Hi. I'm having done this in about six or seven subdivisions. I'm fairly used to the kind of difficulty. It is for everybody to see a change in the way they have lived and projected themselves. And I'm sorry that they have to take this out as whatever they can find with cherry pick facts. But the bottom line to this is it will be an improvement to that neighborhood. The traffic is at the end of the street. It will not be down the cul-de-sac. It's a little disingenuous to those of us who develop that. I'm sure that somebody who has a two-car garage and a two-car space to park four cars at their house would holler about somebody parking somewhere else. And so we do the best we can to help and improve it. And I have realtors who could also say that it does improve their property value to get rid of that lot, bare, naked, and ugly as it is. So that is just... I'm sorry. I'm sorry for the rhetoric that we have to understand that these people really are a step. And I'm sorry for that. And we want to do everything in our power to make this look as good and be as amenable to the neighborhood as possible. And I think we have done that by changing some trees, some lights, and some roof to make that work better for everybody. And thank you very much for your time. And thank you for listening to me as well. Thank you. Can I ask a follow-up question? It's okay. Bruce, this is Commissioner Scott. Just wanted to ask looking at a couple of the comments were about the entrance and exit off of Cohasset. Was there a particular reason why this was designed without an entrance or exit off of Cohasset? It's not allowed by the city. Off the main traffic. It was not allowed. That makes sense. That was helpful. Thank you. Question on that instead. Would there be a lot of. Did you hear that Mike with the feedback if that was an office space, the city have allowed the entrance and exit. No, I could answer that. No, as well. Okay. Yeah. Did you have something to add to that? So, if we can let the speaker go for clarification, any use that would be on this property, the would have to come up. The traffic would have to come on to Alicia court. Okay. Okay. Thank you. Great. I have a question for staff or the applicant. Just refresh me, please. What's the amount of parking spaces per unit or total for this project? The parking requirements require 1.75 parking spaces for a two bedroom unit. So there are eight units. That's 14 parking spaces required for the residents. And then one guest parking spot per every five. That gives you 15 required parking spaces. And they are meeting that threshold. They are providing 15 parking spaces. Thank you. Do we have any other questions for the applicant before we move into closing the public hearing? All right. I believe we can close the public hearing now and move on to commission discussion. We can discuss or start with a motion. Madam chair. May I add something quickly? Of course. So just before you conclude your deliberations, it's worth noting that this project is subject to the housing accountability act as well, which means as a proposed housing development project, if it meets all of the city's objective standards, which I believe staff has said that it does, then the only way that the city can either deny the project or approve the project with a condition that it is developed at a lower down payment rate, is through the housing accountability act. Yes. parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler that really supported that, can staff speak to that at all? I think I would defer to Matt Johnson to speak on the traffic circulation safety issues. Oh, okay. I didn't go to the ARB meeting yesterday, but Kelly said that there were questions on that, so I did a little bit of work here. So the subdivision was approved in 2007, I think, and it had 22 single-family residential homes and a .397, so it had two .397 office residential uses. So what I did is I took a look at the trip generation, and from a traffic standpoint, we want to look at the peak hour in the evening. It's far more traffic than it is in the morning. So the 22 single-family residents, they generate about one peak hour trip per unit, so that's 22 trips of which, let's see, and the multifamily, it has .56 of a trip generation, so it generates four. So we have a total of 26 peak hour trips at the intersection, and we have a total of 26 peak hour trips at the intersection of Cohasset and Alicia Court. So based on the fact that most of the city and the town is to the south of that development, not much is up north, although they could turn right, go north, and then out Eaton, what I did is used a traffic distribution of 25% to the north and 75% to the south. So during that peak time, exiting, going west, westbound on Alicia Court and turning on Cohasset, we would have two cars turning right, and we would have seven cars turning left. So that's a total of nine cars in a peak hour, one hour time. So that's one car every 6.5 minutes, so not a whole lot of traffic. So coming in, we have 25% of the traffic coming in from the north, which amounts to four trips, and from the north, we have about 1.5. From the south, we have 13 cars making a right-hand turn in. So between those two, that averages one car every 3.5 minutes. So as a total, that's about, let's see, 26 cars in an hour, so that's one about every four minutes. We do have a continuous two-way left turn lane on Cohasset for safe left turn movements. The question as far as the traffic is, is that a good thing? Well, if it was an entrance or a driveway access on Cohasset Road, you are correct. Engineering wouldn't allow that. Like Kelly said, I think it was Kelly, we want to minimize the amount of turning movements or conflicting movements on high-volume roadways. If we did end up putting a driveway on the Cohasset side, because it would be a short couple that would just be a driveway, because it would be a short couple that would just be a driveway, people would really need to slow down going north, almost come to a stop, and then take a right-hand turn. Well, you really have a lot of susceptibility at that point to a rear-end collision. And then cars coming from the north wanting to turn in left, you know, they're crossing two lanes of traffic, so you have a T-bone situation. So we really look to minimize the driveway access points. You know, something similar we've talked about before, everyone likes to have a driveway access point. Everyone likes the Esplanade in and around the hospital area. They hate Mangrove. Well, what's the difference? Well, on Esplanade, we have nice controlled access points with the cross streets, with the numbers. On Mangrove, we have a two-way continuous left turn lane, and then every property has a driveway. So there's numerous opportunities and conflicts for turning movements and potential accidents. So anyway, like I said, an eight-unit apartment, it's really only generating, what did I say here, four trips in the peak hour. So that's, it's not a substantial increase. I think 85% of the traffic at that intersection is generated by the single-family homes, and only 15% new trips would be related to the eight-plex, so. Thank you. Matt, quick question. Go on. Yeah, why the difference between the apartment, the eight units there getting less credit or less trips than the houses? That's based on studies. We use the trip generation manual. I think they're like on the 12th volume of that over the years. It's studies based on the international traffic study, and they determine trip generation rates. So typically with single-family homes, the only thing that's going to happen is the apartment is going to be more than one week old. And so there's trips in the morning because people go to work or take their kids to school. Or if kids are old enough, they're driving and they drive themselves to school. So that kind of accounts for a lot of morning trips. And then evening trips, it's the same thing. People are coming home from work, kids coming and going. Apartment complex generally have people that aren't using the roads as much during that peak hour in the morning, in the peak hour in the evening. Their trips are more evenly distributed throughout the day. So the peak trip for the apartments, like I said, I think it's .56 as a generator. I can't argue with the study, but from a practical study it doesn't, I don't see that. Okay. All right, thank you. I have a question for staff. Given that this property is owned office residential, wouldn't it also be allowed on that project property that looks to have about a 123-foot frontage along Alicia Court to be divided into three single family units of approximately 41-foot frontage along Alicia Court, which would be very similar to the frontage of the other properties. Would that be allowed? We have a couple different standards that come into play. We have to meet a minimum lot width at the frontage. We have to meet a minimum lot area, I believe, of 4,500 square feet per lot, as well as a minimum density. So I believe that if you were to just plop it as is on the parcel, one single family residence would not meet the minimum density for the zoning district, which is, I believe, about a hundred and twenty-five by a hundred So the maximum is six and the maximum is twenty doling units per acre. So for this property, this lot that's roughly a hundred and twenty-five by a hundred and fifteen, you're saying we could not put three residential homes on it with roughly three frontages on Alicia Court, similar to the frontages of all the other properties on Alicia Court? I have the small lot subdivision standard kind of in my mind, which would be the smallest width, I believe, is thirty-eight feet. That's correct. So I think our regular standard lot width is greater than that, forty-five or something? Right, so in my development, the lots are either thirty-eight or forty-two feet wide, and they're a hundred and five deep. So if it were developed as part of the rest of the subdivision, as a small lot subdivision, you could have that thirty-eight foot lot width as your minimum. And that's correct. And pardon me, that parcel is large enough to hold three single family lots to build three single family houses, correct, that would front Alicia Court? Yeah, that's true. The lot's a hundred and forty feet wide, and the adjacent lots are forty-five feet wide by a hundred and twenty-three. So if we take three times forty-five, you wouldn't get your six, you may get your six thousand on the corner. But when this subdivision was developed years ago in 2007, at that point in time, obviously it was just one piece of ground. Yeah. I actually had split zoning, which it's kind of hard to deal with that because they show a split zone on the GIS map, but no one really knows exactly where those are. So when the subdivision was created to be in conformance with the general plan at that time in the zoning, they just took a reasonable depth back from Cohasset and said this is OR and the balance of it is R1 subdivision. And so are they saying that that's roughly about a fifteen foot setback off of Cohasset, is that correct? The setback for what? For building ten and the side of building eleven. Oh. If I'm reading the plans right, it looks like about a fifteen foot setback. Well, I guess... You can answer the questions on the setback for apartments. Okay. Well, what I'm driving at here is my house was built in 06, that exact same time that these houses were built within a year plus or minus. And the lots are all thirty-eight to forty-two feet wide. And ninety-five to a hundred and five deep. It looks to me, according to these numbers on this map, that this property could hold three housing units that would front Alicia Court. And that, to me, would seem to be in perfect alignment with the neighborhood, given the fact that the Alicia Court lots are already the most dense in that area. And if we put eight apartments on the end, that's even upping the density there from what it was on Alicia Court. For me, I would be...my preference would be to have three houses built there. But seeing that that is not going to be done, the next closest thing that I could justify in my mind is if building eleven was swung around to overlap building ten, or expand building ten from three to five, I could go with seeing five units on that, which isn't quite double what three houses would be. But I'm having trouble coming to agreement that eight units on that corner, even though it's within zoning laws, but again, we're given a range, and that's pushing the far end of the density. I just don't think that matches that well with the residents on Alicia Court. Based on the density range, it looks like we could have more units. Is that true? That is true. Yes, that's correct. Under the OR zoning district density range, although the real limiter here is the airport overlay and the surrounding density calculation, they could go up to 14.4 dwelling units per acre, and we're at 12.5. Perhaps another unit. But by right, where there, as zone, and I know there were some comments made that the homes would not have been purchased if they had known it was zoned this way. The zoning has not changed. The zoning has consistently been office residential, correct? That's correct. So by right, under office residential, the range with the airport overlay is the minimum they have to build is six units. So in order to come to us to do three units, they would have, that would be... It would have to be rezoned. Yes. Yeah, Tony is correct. Commissioner Scott. Thank you. Okay. I do have to say I'm a little disappointed nobody mentioned how great Cohasset Road is now. So I do appreciate the... Matt, you should have dropped that. I'm a little sad in the traffic count study, but I drive it every day, and it is amazing now. So thank you. Well, a couple of years ago, we did that Cohasset Road, and now we just finished up the Esplanade. So we're working on Bruce Road. So, you know, the hopes are we can get several of those large-scale projects where that really makes the rideability nice. So I have a few comments. I'm kind of disheartened by the attitude towards building these apartments when, as Tony has mentioned, that's what's been planned. It sounds like, I mean, maybe somebody's realtor wasn't honest with them when they say that it was never allowed that they could build housing there. And maybe, yeah, so I don't know what happened there. But there are apartment complexes across the street, across Cohasset. It seems like a very normal use for the area, so I don't see this as like sticking out like a sore thumb to the neighborhood. And it sounds like the architect or the applicant, has been very sensitive to what the neighborhood wants as far as the architecture and the design of the apartments. Of course, we are in a housing crisis, as people noted. These apartments, they fit the zoning and the general plan. I don't really see any way that they don't. As somebody mentioned, there's the issue of evacuation and fire safety. And that, I don't quite understand that comment, but that's why I asked about it, because that is a hazard for this area. But to me, it seems like the main hazard there would be turning onto Cohasset Road, where everybody else is already feeding onto. And I don't see how eight apartment units on the corner would affect that. But of course, I'm sure the city is doing their due diligence, and they're doing their due diligence. And making sure that this neighborhood won't be a hazard. Again, the objections to putting the apartments in this neighborhood, to me, honestly, I understand objecting to something that you feel isn't right in your neighborhood, and maybe you were sold a false promise. But this supposed loss in home values due to an apartment complex, I don't see evidence to back that up. And I worry that that's coming out of a general prejudice against sharing people's neighborhoods with low-income housing. That seems to be prevalent in our society. So, yeah, that's my comment on that. I don't see an actual issue with approving this project the way that it is. I can offer a couple of comments also. So, the first thing I want to say is thank you, Mike and staff. And especially thank you to folks who were patient through the technology challenges we had. This is a hard way, a hard environment in which to have a conversation and to have people feel like they're being heard and their perspectives respected when you're not sure that your voice is literally being heard. So, I want to make sure that we acknowledge that people were patient and worked very hard to participate in this process. And when you're already feeling that your concerns are needing to be aired and it's a challenge to get them out there, that's very, very frustrating. And I understand that. And I also applaud staff for being patient and making sure that we circled back to people and make sure that everyone was heard. So, I feel at the core of this, at the root of this is that our job as a commission is to make sure that standards are being met. And if they are, then without seeing a project that clearly in one facet or another falls outside of the regulations and the standards, especially with some of the limitations on, as the attorney pointed out, in terms of density requirements, I don't know that there's anything in front of us that really is an avenue to rejecting this project. It seems that it meets all the requirements that we are charged with evaluating. And when a project does meet those requirements, I think that it's our responsibility to approve it. I do understand the neighbors' objections and their challenges. And I think that's unfortunate. But I think in this circumstance, the commission's role is pretty well defined and is somewhat limited. And so, it's unfortunate that we have people who are unhappy with this project. And I would sure hope and I would certainly expect that Bruce and the neighbors would continue to work through it. And maybe there are other kinds of work that could be done there. But that's really not the purview of the commission. So, again, I feel like the path that the commission has in front of it, the choice that we have is pretty well prescribed. And I think that it's fairly clear where this project lands in terms of the purview that we really have. Thank you, Rich. Agreed. I mean, it's really hard to hear so many people voice concerns and feel like, you know, we can't make everybody happy. And also, I wanted to echo thank you to staff for all your work, especially in making sure that people can participate because this has been kind of an ongoing challenge. So, I'm glad that it's been working out tonight. Yeah, I do agree with you, Rich, that the project does fall within all the parameters that we have to approve this. I guess the thing that's really going to force me to go ahead and vote for it is the fact that these lots were zoned office residential before the units were built on Alicia Court. And I know in my case, when I bought my house, I really looked at the area around a few blocks out that hadn't even been built out yet. And I specifically bought a lot so that I wouldn't end up adjacent to a future store or commercial strip or apartment complex. And as unfortunate as it is, I'm not going to be able to do that. But it seems to be unfortunate as it seems to be for some people now, which it is. I think that we have to follow the plan. I've always been a big believer in our plan. I support our plan. But this seems to be an example of how important it is when you're buying a property to really think about, you know, if I want to be here for 10 years, what's it going to look around me like in 10 years? and if the area is not already built out around you, then you kind of are just going to have to wait and see what comes along that follows the rules at that time. If this had been rezoned to office residential after the units on Alicia Court had been built, I'd have a real problem with that at this point. But I am going to reluctantly have to approve this project because it does follow all of the rules and guidelines as I understand them. And as unfortunate as it is for some of those individual property owners, you know you've got to do your due diligence when you buy a property about what's going to be around you. I'm sorry some folks are upset with that. Same. All right. Further discussion or motion? If not, I'll make a motion. I'll move that the Planning Commission adopt the findings in resolution 20-12 and approve the project subject to the recommended conditions. I'll second. Question regarding the motion? Should we make note in the motion that item 789 in Kelly's memo today be included as part of the conditions? If the Planning Commission feels those additional recommendations are appropriate, you can add them to the conditions of approval. I'd like to amend the motion to include items 789 from the memo of 917 from Kelly. I'm comfortable with 7 and 8. And I would be okay with 9 if we were more specific. I think we've gotten in trouble with having vague language. And I know that's what was suggested. But I think we have a higher due diligence to specify that a little bit more. Well, I think the two items that were mentioned, we should have the applicant switch the buildings to the alternative roof and go with the hip roof rather than gable and to increase, to use extensive siding along with the stucco to match the existing neighborhood. Existing neighborhood, yeah. So 7, 8, and then 9 with those additional. Okay. So I just need to say I accept the amendment? I accept. Okay. Does the person who seconded need to accept? I still second. Okay. Yeah. Those are acceptable. I should brush up on my rules. Great. All right. Is there any further commission discussion on this? I think I'd just jump in and say I'm not in love with this project and I'm maybe, Ken, that's kind of what you were referring to. I don't, it's not what I would ideally pick for that. parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler! parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler! parler parler with this project is it has been zoned office residential. It is zoned office residential. If this applicant was coming to us and asking to change the land use designation to allow this project, that would be an easy decision. But we have to, the burden for us is we have to take an application that's been submitted and if it meets the requirements of what that land use is, we cannot just overturn it because we don't like the project, because the neighbors don't like the project, because there's some flaws in the project. We have to do our due diligence and make sure that it fits the conditions of the land use and it does. So that really ties our hands. I agree with you, which is why I said I reluctantly am going to have to approve this project because it does. It does exactly what you say. Very well said, Tony. Yeah. Yeah, I agree with Tony. Also, what Ryan spoke to earlier, you know, the state issues and regulations we have to abide by there. Is there a safety issue? You know, the traffic potentially, but when I drove it yesterday and a couple days before, I could see it, but not to the extent to overturn it. Yeah. All right. Seeing no more discussion, all in favor, please say aye. Aye. Aye. Any opposed? Any abstentions? The motion passes. Thank you all. And we'll be moving on to item 4.2, the plan development permit 20-02 and master use permit. 20-06 Mountain Vista Plaza. Before you do that, can I just say, and I know this is a new format for us, but kind of with the chat etiquette, just watching, this is a public hearing and when our chair closes the public hearing, when you chat, it's like you're yelling at us when the public hearing is closed. Thank you. So I'd really appreciate you to just use the chat when the public hearing is open during your time. If you need to schedule time. Yeah, I really, I appreciate you saying that. I forgot. It's a little distracting. We can see it and you've had your time to speak. In an ideal world with as much time as possible, we would have all of the discussions with everyone, but got to keep things moving. Sorry. Okay. So the next item we're here for today is PDP 20-02 and use permit 20-06 for Mountain Vista Plaza. This is a request to construct a three building neighborhood commercial complex totaling approximately 20,650 square feet as part of a previously approved planned development permit. The use permit associated with the project is to allow for a drive-through use intended for a coffee shop or similar business. The 1.9 acre site is located at the northeast corner of Eaton and Floral Avenue. The site is designated neighborhood commercial on the city's general property. It is a commercial plan land use diagram and is zoned CN for neighborhood commercial with the airport overflight traffic pattern and planned development overlays. Next slide, please. The buildings would be in a triangular orientation around the site with the vehicular entrances on Floral Avenue and Biscayne Bay and the provided parking to the center. The project would provide 101 parking spaces, which meets the city's parking requirements should the commercial spaces be leased as predicted. However, the applicant is requesting as part of the PDP a 10% reduction in required parking in the event the space is leased entirely as retail with no office uses. The proposed drive-through would direct traffic into the parking lot and around the south and east sides of Building C. The proposed drive-through would provide enough stacking capacity for approximately 11 vehicles, satisfying code requirements. Screening of the drive-through use would be achieved through landscaping as well as the three-foot-tall brick wall to match building style and color. To further reduce impacts associated with the proposed drive-through use, staff is recommending an additional condition that menu boards and speakers are located on the south end of Building C. The proposed buildings are one story in a modern style, utilizing high-quality materials with distinguishing elements on each building. The color scheme proposed for the project would include a variety of complementary, bright colors and pastels, and the design would create a sense of place. The design of Building A would also address the street at the intersection of Eaton and Floral. Roof lines would be varied and interesting, with distinguishing elements on each building. Additionally, there would be an impressive outdoor space for dining and other uses. The project is consistent with general plan goals and policies and with the City's objective design and development standards, as detailed in the report. Specifically, development of the project would result in the creation of a neighborhood serving center that would enhance the commercial services available at this junction. The project would implement the overall vision and specific zoning of the original PDP by placing key retail and other commercial uses at this strategic nodal intersection, helping to turn a subdivision of houses into a more complete neighborhood. With that, staff recommends that the planning commission adopt Resolution 2013, approving the Mountain Vista Plan Development Permit and Master Use Permit subject to the recommended conditions. Thank you. Could we go back to the elevation that had, I think it's actually maybe the landscape plan that has the drive through. Okay, yes, thank you. So on this. Okay. So the drive through, all the traffic from the drive through will be on the site, correct? Yes. And so the 11 cars queuing are within the project site? Correct. Just to point out, the City's code requires six, a capacity for six vehicles to be stacked in a drive through. So it's almost double just in the drive lane. And then if there are any additional traffic backup, it would be in the parking area, not onto a public street. Okay. And I think the applicant could probably address this, but the flow of traffic, what is anticipated as you leave? I know it seems natural that you would go on Biscayne, but if you go to Biscayne to Floral, then you have to go further north and then make a U-turn back. Yes. I will probably have Matt Johnson speak a little bit to the overall circulation on site, but Floral would be a right out only. Okay. And the Biscayne Bay would be, you'd be able to turn both left or right. Okay. Thank you. Can you tell me more about the bike parking? I believe we added a condition to require a couple more bicycle parking spaces to satisfy the requirements of our code. Do you know how many that brings it up to? I saw six on the line. Okay. And how many are on the landscape plan? I want to say 10. I'd have to double check our report, but I think my memory serves me correct. It would be 10 required. Great. Okay. And those are still all over by Floral Avenue, none are by the buildings? The site plan would give us probably a better indication of that, but I believe most of them are parked on Floral Avenue. Okay. Yeah. I was looking at the site plan and thinking. As a person who bikes a lot, that it might be inconvenient to have them all over by the road and not nearer to like, say the building C. And I was wondering if it would be possible to have a condition of approval for either more bike parking or adding some to building C. I think that would be reasonable. Okay. Good to know. Thank you. Excuse me. The intersection. Okay. So, if you're coming out of the proposed complex on Biscayne Bay with Gallatin Gateway, that's a four-way stop sign, correct? Yes. And if you're coming out of the proposed complex, you can go straight, you can go right. Can you make a left turn at that four-way stop coming out? Yes. Okay. Thank you. A couple of questions. First, I would agree with our chair's suggestion of additional bicycle spaces, parking, particularly over on with building C since the existing bicycle rack seems to be so far away from that. So, I would agree with that and support that. But I wanted to go back to both the traffic flow and maybe a more foundational question about the drive thrift. So, Kelly, you cited existing code or Title 19. I'm not sure where this is and that's part of my question is where is this information located for the public to know what does regulate when a new drive thru can be part of a project at all and any parameters around what that kind of a drive thru looks like. You mentioned the number of cars that can be queued up, for example, but there must be other parameters. Are there other regulations that the city has in place? And I think there are probably many people in the community that aren't aware of what those are. What are the parameters in which we can or maybe are permitted not to approve a new drive thru? Sure. So, the use permit is required generally for all drive thru uses, particularly in the CN zoning district. We have design and development standards such as screening and minimum width and speed. parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler said that any drive-through use would require a use permit. Okay. That was the only mention. Okay. And so any new drive-through as a part of a project like this gives me pause. I think that there are lots of studies in terms of, you know, greenhouse gas emissions and things like that, that drive-throughs are, and there are a lot of communities that have taken the action just to not allow them at all. So I struggle with that as part of this project and wonder what those conversations have looked like. But as long as we're talking about that, the specifics on this one, I'm curious about the flow. And, Matt, this may be for you. I just assumed until I saw this version with the arrows that the actual flow would go the exact opposite direction, that as you came in off Biscayne Bay you would do, and the bold out might now make that difficult, but, you know, a very hard left into that drive. And so any queuing, you know, people waiting to get to the window would be back along the back sides of those buildings and in that long drive so that they would in no way interfere with pedestrians, bicyclists, people looking for parking. I just assumed that that was a flow. I don't know if that's a, if there's what the rationale for it going this way and if the other way is not possible or if it makes sense one way or the other. So I'm curious about that. I believe that with the stacking, although they provide more, then the requirements, if you want the other direction with it, you'd likely see your menu and speaker boards on the side of Biscayne Bay and any additional stacking vehicles would obstruct that in out onto Biscayne. And if I may add also the convenience of having the driver's side pick the food up. Of course. Sorry. Of course. I see that. So I guess my general, my general hesitation about the drive-through being part of this new development still stands. I'm not, but if it's, you know, if it's an approved use, the use permit maybe is notwithstanding. Maybe that's where we have that discussion of whether it's a good idea to be adding a drive-through of any kind. But I do understand the traffic flow now. Thank you for that. To clarify the bike parking conditions, I did find that section. It says four more diaries, diagonally placed. I already forgot it from the other bike parking. So does that just mean across the parcel or can we, I guess we can maybe modify that condition to specify something. I believe you're correct in assuming it just means diagonally across the site, but we could clarify. Okay. And I, yeah, I guess we'll get to that after the public hearing. Specifying. I had a question. I had a question about the bike parking too. Where, where would the additional parking spots be on the site plan? I see the six capacity one over on the floral Avenue side. That's the only bicycle parking that they have proposed and we're requiring additional four spaces. So the location. Is that what you were getting at? Price could be debated. I guess. Sorry to interrupt. Clarifying that it's not on here. To me, it would make sense to have bike parking. Near the coffee shop. I mean, that's just my logic with it. And there's, I see there's an area. I'm not sure between just to the. Top of the coffee shop. Kind of like a little bump out between the two parking spots. Kind of on the diagonal right there. I'd have to look back on the plan and see what landscape is there, but that might be a possibility for. The additional bike parking. Yeah. The outdoor dining area is also going to be on the East side of building. Yeah. So, on that side would make. Right there little sales there sales over it on the. It looks like Kelly, there'll be a restaurant on the most Easterly part of building B. Okay. As well as some retail uses. And that's the only outdoor dining area is building B on the East side. I believe in our conditions, we're allowing them to have up to two. Restaurant uses and the other would be a mix of retail and office uses. And both of the potential restaurant uses would have outdoor dining areas. Optional or yes, I guess I see a little space on building C on the North side to clarify. Is that available for outdoor dining? We should probably just kick that to the developer. I'm not entirely sure. Okay, great. So, I'll ask the question. I'm not the developer this question, but I just wanted to check with city staff. Is there any regulations that would have prevented. Building a and building C being swapped in the site plan. I could maybe just think of some design considerations, nothing in the city code that I can think of. Okay. All right. Yeah, I wanted to take a little bit of time because Kelly had also said there were some questions. If the ARB meeting yesterday, so I wanted to take a little time and talk about. The length of time and the amount of engineering effort that's gone into this area. So, I have the conditions of approval of the original subdivision and we saw them up there. It's subdivision and PD PDP 0 1 12. So, what that adds to. That actually means that the original application was submitted in 2001 and it was the 12th subdivision that year. So, that's quite some time ago. So, they prepared at EIR and took a lot of input as far as developing the subdivision or developing the plan for approval. That approval actually didn't come until July 17th of 2007. So, there was actually six years worth of effort put into those which, you know, you've seen that on Oak Valley and Merriam Park and a lot of the other large scale developments. So, the project, like I said, was actually approved in July 17th of 2007. And one of the conditions of approval, number 15 said a traffic circle shall be constructed at the floral east, the floral avenue Eaton Road intersection. Okay. So, that intersection subject to review and approval of building and development engineering services. So, actually the plan for that intersection was conceptualized 13 years ago, a long, long time ago. That given the high volume of traffic on Eaton Road and floral, we needed to have traffic control device there that would be sized properly and designed properly to handle those flows. And we had a consultant years ago that had looked at Eaton Road all the way from the eastern part of town through Foothill Park all the way over to Highway 99 and talked about putting or the possibility of putting in roundabouts at the various intersection. A few years ago, it came before you, Amber Lynn subdivision. It's a large property on Eaton south side of town. It's a large property on Eaton between Burnap and Morseman. It's about ready to start work and we have a similar situation there where with that subdivision development, we're getting the necessary right of way at least to consider putting in a roundabout. So, like I said, this subdivision itself was approved in 2007. It included the roundabout. So, one of the things that was done. Okay. So, one of the things that was part of the approvals is Biscayne Bay on the east side of Biscayne Bay and its intersection with Gallatin Gateway. There was planned to have 13 townhomes on those lots. So, in I think it was 2017 also. That came before the city to change those townhomes. So, we moved from a single-family home to single-family residential because there was a high demand for single-family residential. And it seemed appropriate from the city's standpoint in the fact that typically with townhomes, we have two-story homes and we always run into that. You guys run into it all the time. Well, I have a two-story home looking in my backyard. So, we were, the city was very supportive of that. And the planning commission supported that conversion from townhomes to single-family homes. And I can tell you that those 13 residents that have been built in that area, they're all single-story. So, there was a real benefit to the neighborhood with that. And also that change, there was a realization that, you know, there's going to be quite a bit of traffic associated with the commercial development here at this intersection. So, we actually made Biscayne Bay. We made Biscayne Bay wider than we normally would. It's wider than our typical standards to account for that traffic. Because, you know, we always talk about traffic calming. Well, if we have narrower streets, it creates friction. Well, in this case, we don't necessarily need friction in slow. There's going to be a lot of pedestrians and bicyclists associated with that. So, we wanted to have a little bit wider street to provide a better, a better relationship or environment for those competing interests. So, with regards to the roundabout at Eaton and Floral there, if you look at Building A, I think it's Building A. Yeah, Building A. We met with the developer and worked, well, right across the street, we were building the East Side. And we had the Eaton Ranch Apartments. And they have a similar corner in the fact that if the city, well, the city is putting in a roundabout there. Given the fact that we have apartments that exist right now that we can't disturb on the West Side, the majority of the roundabout is kind of shifted. The center of the roundabout is shifted to the East. So, it dramatically affects not only this corner, but the corner to the South, where we have the Eaton Ranch Apartments. The Eaton Ranch Apartments itself and this, we worked approximately six months' time with the developer, our roundabout consultant, our traffic department, to find out and determine the exact right-of-way needed for the improvements. We're planning on putting in a two-lane roundabout at that intersection. And both the Eaton Ranch Apartments that are being built, and the improvements that are approved, or would be approved for this development, they'll actually put in a good portion of those improvements for the future roundabout. Now, I'm told by my boss, the Director of Public Works, and he had communication with Mike Solley that, what did it say? We're in the process of finalizing that roundabout design over the next years or so, but intending to move forward in the near term with a capital improvement project to construct the roundabout. So, typically a lot of the capital projects, they're way out in the future, but we're actually looking to install that intersection maybe in the next year or two, so that would be a real benefit. So, like I said, we've spent a lot of time and a lot of effort in developing what's needed for the traffic on there. So, one of the initial points of discussion, when they were designing the site plan for this project, is, hey, we'd kind of like to have access out on Eaton Road, similar to the item that we just went through. There's lots and lots of volume on Eaton Road. We don't want to interrupt that traffic. And of particular interest, we have a bus stop that's located, so when you're looking at the south part of this site plan, there's kind of a belly in the road. That actually is a bus stop. So, we're not going to take out a bus stop to put in a driveway. That's just the way it is. So, the site plan itself doesn't really show that well, but where Biscayne Bay on the north connection to Floral, there's a median right there now. We're going to make a median cut to serve Biscayne Bay with full access. So, in other words, coming south on Floral, you can make a left into Biscayne, and then leaving Biscayne, you can make a left out on Floral. Now, there was some discussion, I guess, with the ARB yesterday, and we've already been through this with the developer, that, hey, we'd kind of like to cut the median again opposite that driveway. Well, you end up cutting that median opposite the driveway, and then you have to have left turn storage in, and you're just increasing the number of conflicts, and it would be really dangerous, plus the fact that if you did put a cut there, you can see from some of the dashed lines that those traffic movements would interfere with the stacking and the flow going southbound around that roundabout itself. So, yes, we're happy to put a driveway there, but it's going to be a ride in and ride out only. There was some discussion. I think I was told that maybe we should do away with the driveway on Biscayne there and only have the driveway access off Floral. Well, we don't want to do that. In other words, when we look at these neighborhood serving commercial areas, we want to make it as convenient as possible for cars to come in and out. We don't need you getting down on Eaton or getting down on Floral to come into this center. The Biscayne connection and the intersection to Gallatin Gateway and the entrance to the subdivision, it's natural for local traffic to go back and forth and bicyclists and all of that. So, like I said, we actually spent about six months working on this design and this site plan before it actually was submitted to the city for AR and our meeting tonight. So, I just wanted to go back and forth. I wanted to give you a little background on the time and the effort. Hey, back in 2007, it was envisioned that we would have a roundabout here. And 13 years later, you know, we're following in those same foot tracks and providing that. So, this design fits exactly with our traffic operations for this area. So, anyway, just wanted to provide. And, oh, Rich, on that. That drive-through on just the north of Building C, you can see just to the south or to the right of that arrow, there's kind of a cross-tatched area. Obviously, that's a highly marked yellow crossing there for pedestrians and bicyclists. So, it'll be aware of drivers going through there that they can see that. So, anyway, and that was one of the things also is having the all-way stop that you asked about, Ken, there. Yeah. The traffic engineer felt that that would be the best solution. That way we can get, you know, foot traffic and bicycle traffic safely across Biscayne Bay and into the neighborhoods. Yeah, I thought that was really key and a good design element of this project that all of your residential traffic coming from Gallatin, from all those units, won't have to take Biscayne to either Floral or Eaton to get into the project. I thought that was a great four-way intersection there to cut down on that bleeding into Eaton and Floral. So, anyway, that gives a little background. Been a lot of years we've been working on it and finally come to see it to fruition. We're really excited. Thank you, Matt. Yeah, and those apartments, they're coming along pretty nice there on the southwest side of Floral and Eaton. And part of those improvements, we discussed that before, is they're actually going to make the final connection on Mariposa on up to Eaton. So that'll give us another through north-south collector roadway in that vicinity to help disperse the traffic. That Mariposa, that's going right by or through, there's a little utility power plant area right there that's going to be going right by the west side of it. PGD substation. Yeah. Yeah. So that's nice. Thank you. All right. Do we have further questions for staff or should we move into the public hearing? All right. Let's open up the public hearing and hear from the applicants. Good evening. Hello. So my name is Matt Galloway. I'm an architect for the project. And it's an honor to have this opportunity to sit and talk through the project with you. As Matt Johnson stated earlier, this has been a long time in coming. And we've had the honor of working with Public Works pretty extensively over the last four years from my standpoint. Making a lot of requests in terms of maybe trying to alter some of the options at that intersection and having heated debate as to why we can and why we can't. But it was very clear at the time that this project was done with some pretty clear intentions and pretty clear and resolute design standards in order to access it. So we worked hard to work through those and presented a project to Chris and Pete a year and a half, two years ago. And at that point, we worked through some of the design standards. And kind of put the project out to market. Start getting some input back from realtors and potential clients. And it was interesting because initially some of the realtors said that this wasn't really a good opportunity from a marketing standpoint for a drive-thru. Lo and behold, when we put this out to potential tenants, the first tenant said he would love to have a coffee shop but would only take it if it had a drive-thru. And since then, several other folks have said no. And the other food users have said the same thing. So we then went back to the drawing board and took a look elaborately with a number of different ways about how a drive-thru might work. And queuing obviously is a big condition. And the method in which queuing occurs without flowing back into the roadways at all. And really what ended up happening is given the nature of the site, the only place really to put the drive-thru was on Building C. And given the direction that you, with the best design practice, really the only common sense design practice is to have drivers interact with the drive-thru. This method was the only direction that that could work through. And still utilize options for the other buildings. So we had looked at a number of different options, explored a number of different things. But really this is the most common sense for the building. So first parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler!! parler the nature of the traffic counts there. Staff just could not support that. Finally, I did want to touch base. There was a number of questions about bike parking. I have to apologize. There's an omission on our drawings. It has always been our intent to provide parking at the entrance of each building. And we have plenty of opportunities both at Buildings B and Building C to provide that bicycle parking. So that's an omission on our part. Staff pointed that out to us. We originally provided an ARB application probably four months ago that had to be updated into the PD application. And in the course of us making that transition, bike parking at Buildings B and C was omitted with no problem including that. And we'll adhere by staff's recommendation for that to happen. Honestly, the nature of bike parking, we're not going to be able to get a bike rack that's three and a third. So we are going to be over-parked from a biking standpoint just inherently with the way the bike racks work. I did hear several people talk a little bit about pedestrian access that I'd like to talk about. It was a very important component to us to make sure that we had pedestrian connectivity from the public way to all buildings. And additionally, we see that Gallatin Gateway crossing really as kind of a natural place to collect a lot of people from within this subdivision. So we designated this diagonal pedestrian path. It's accented with both bollard and low-level pedestrian lighting to get pedestrians through a parking lot without really having to walk between parked cars. So that strong diagonal line that goes through the middle of the site is acting as a great pedestrian collector. The last question I had was pertaining to Commissioner Scott's question about reversing Buildings A and C. It was interesting because that's not something that we had really entertained. Given the city's desire to put a roundabout at the location, Building A seemed to really want to address the intersection and the future roundabout. So it's a more square building with a very grand patio on that corner. Another thing to keep in mind with this site is that we have some grading issues. So at that corner in particular, the elevation of the grade is a little bit higher. It's a little bit higher actually than the roundabout. And it seemed like a perfect way to present some site walls and some grade differential in through there to enrich the site, but also separate that patio just a little bit from Eaton and Floral Roads to give a little bit more sense of separation from the road and the trafficway. So that was really kind of the driving component behind Building A and trying to maintain that patio and that active culture out on that corner and have that presented to the public. So that's really the main reason why we're doing this. And then the other thing that we're doing is we're I would like probably to defer a little bit of time to Keith from Rose Anderson, our civil engineer, and talk a little bit more about traffic because at last night's architectural review meeting, that was a pretty big concern. We, as Matt said, we have been through a lot of explorations and studies with that. I'd like to keep that. Maybe touch base on that a little bit more. Are we and Matt, maybe the traffic engineer will speak to this, but I understand that this is designed based off of constraints that you have been working with. And I know Matt Johnson will not let us do this, but if you had your druthers, would you have had access off of Eaton or Floral? And would that have designed this property differently? It would have. And we did request both. In fact, at one point, we were having some compelling requests to try and get emergency vehicular traffic on to Eaton, even with the concept that we would pay for relocating the bus stop. But even the traffic counts on Eaton, and now that Eaton is connected at the other end by Wildwood Park, it just doesn't make sense to introduce those cars. And staff has really convinced us of that. It doesn't make sense to introduce our on-site cars into that traffic flow. It's too dangerous. And really, the designing principle behind the overlay here is to have traffic calming by having an access off of this game day. Keith should speak to that as well. But I think at this point, we're convinced that it doesn't make sense to bring that traffic off. We did succeed a little bit. In our arm-wrestling efforts with Matt, and that we can get a right turn, right in, right out onto Floral. Initially, we wanted that to pass through. But when we saw the designs for the roundabout, we abandoned those thoughts. It does help alleviate some traffic onto this game by having the right turn right out onto Floral. Sorry, Keith, if I stole all your steam there. I'm just a dumb architect speaking civil here. Thank you. I had a question. So with the bike parking, did you say that it was accidentally or purposely omitted, the parking by the buildings? I didn't catch that. It was an honest accidental mistake. It has always been our intent to have bike racks at each building. It only makes sense to do that. And we have plenty of room to do that. In the process of converting this drawing from an architectural review board package to the planned use, development, we just omitted those. And we intend to get them back on there and have absolutely no problem adhering to the condition from staff on those. Okay, thank you. Good, good. All right. Shall we move on to the next speaker? Good evening. This is Keith Doleo. Can you hear me okay? We can hear you. Good. So as Matt said, I'm the Civil Engineering Director. I'm the engineer on the project. And really I plan to give a little bit of a history of the project from sort of the large projects from the beginning to where we are today to give you the picture. I think Matt Johnson sort of, he did that. He did a pretty good job of that. So I will speed that up so you don't hear it all twice. But I've got a little bit of information here for you. So as has been said, the applicant is long time Chico Builders Epic Homes. And they are the same builders that were involved with this entire project of Mountain Vista and Sycamore Glen. They built single family residential houses. They built the houses on the other side of Biscayne Bay. And all the houses out here east of Floral Avenue. And this is them working on this project also. So like Matt said, Matt Johnson, the project started a long, long time ago. Application was submitted in 2001. And really that process, it involved a lot of study. There was six years of work that went into that. And all the reviews, making sure all the uses were compatible. There weren't impacts to the neighborhood. Including the traffic. And that all was approved. And including this commercial piece. And like Matt Johnson said at the time, a special request that was made by the builder was the road width on Biscayne Bay. And they had a special request and got it approved to have Biscayne Bay be 34 miles long. And it was 4 feet wide from face of curb to face of curb. And that was unique because the city standard was 2 feet less. So they actually had planned that the road should be wider to handle any traffic impacts. So after that, the EIR was approved and the standard map was approved. We can jump ahead. And Matt Johnson mentioned this also. So this area again went to Planning Commission in 2017. At the time, it was to change 13 townhomes to single family residential. And that went to the Planning Commission. It was approved. The Planning Commission found that there were no substantial changes. That any potential impacts were addressed. And there weren't any significant impacts at the time. So then that brings us to the current project. And as was said, there's been a lot of work that has gone into this. And I can tell you there was a lot of back and forth and meetings with the City of Chico with engineering and traffic. And as has been said, we tried looking at driveway locations, access, and how the traffic was going to work with the project. And with the future city's capital improvement with the roundabout there. And really what came out of that was the constraints that the project was facing. And that is the Eaton Road access wasn't feasible. There's the bus pull out there. Eaton Road is a high speed, high volume road. Too many traffic conflicts there. The city wasn't willing to have an access point there. The other thing that came out of all that work was the Floral Avenue access. The driveway from the project Floral Avenue. Similar as Eaton Road, a lot of traffic there. There's traffic movements, a lot of things going on there. And having it be a left turn out of the driveway southbound on Floral Avenue wasn't acceptable. So then that brings us to today. This is the site layout you have in front of you. There's been a lot of effort put into this. And I'm here to answer any questions that anyone may have. Thank you. Do we have any questions for him? All right. Looks like we can move on to the next speaker. We do have a landscape architect. Brian, if you'd like to address the commission. Thank you. One of the concepts that architect Matt Galloway brought up to me, to the architectural review board last night, was that he designed the buildings with a residential there in mind to fit into the neighborhood. And I brought that, attempted to bring that concept into the landscape as well. We've got more of a layered look in the landscape for density. It's less of a look that you would find in a building. It's more of a big box retail and more of a look that you would find in residences. I worked extensively with Pete of Epic Homes. And in all of his projects, he's always taken a great care in how the aesthetics of the projects come across. One of the other things that Matt did was do brick treatments on the buildings. And for that residential feel. And so I brought that brick into the landscape as well in several places. One of them is at the corner of building A where Matt described that that building overlooks the roundabout. It overlooks it because there's a retaining wall along there. So that's going to be built out of brick there. And the other place where we used brick wall work is in the drive-through. And we've got two places we're using the brick wall work to block the headlights. One of them is facing Eaton and the other one is facing towards Biscayne Bay. So that's the concept that I wanted to just talk about was residential feel to the project. And after that, I'll just answer any questions anybody has. Thank you, Brad. Questions? All right. None yet. And we can move on to other speakers. Okay. We also have next we have Chris Giambolli if you'd like to address the commission on this. I'm not sure you can get that vocal, but we'll see. Okay. No. Hearing none, can you hear me? Yeah, we can hear you, Chris. Go ahead. I don't have anything to say other than if there's more questions. Uh-oh. Okay. parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler for people to eat and where they're going to be out there. So having outside area for them is also, you know, this is a walkable area that we've designed this commercial center for, and we have lots of rooftops. That's one of the reasons why it's taken, we're building it towards the end is all the rooftops are now there, and it's got parks, linear parks, that actually lead to it that have bike paths that we've put in and that lead to the area. So COVID has actually added quite a different flair to the retail and restaurant area, and it's pretty important to be able to lease out. All these buildings were designed with the idea of taking architecture from the 400-plus. We've built a lot of houses that have been built, and the design is carried through to the project. So if there's any questions to me, that would be great, or after people take comments, I can ask again and be fine. Cool. Thank you. All right. Next speaker. Okay, Madam Chair. We have two people that have asked that they're previously submitted, and they're not yet submitted. So we'll have the submitted comments be read into the record. They have some sort of vocal or audio issues tonight. And then we also have eight potential speakers, and at your pleasure, we'll proceed. Thank you for that. That also reminds me. Did you say eight? Eight potential. Okay. All right. Did you get the email earlier? I think it was only a couple of hours before the meeting. There were many public comments in an email, and I just want to make sure everybody saw that. I didn't have time to fully peruse all of it, but I saw some of the issues addressed. So thank you. But anyway, we can go on. Kate Post and Lisa McKay have requested if we could read their comments in lieu of them speaking because they have audio issues. Mm-hmm. They're saying. Kate did submit a letter, correct? Yes. That's what she has asked us to read. Okay. So I believe you received in the email today eight different letters of correspondence. As of before the Architectural Review Board meeting yesterday, we only had one letter. So all of these did come in. Within the last 24 hours. I'm just going to read off the names of the letters that were forwarded to you for anybody on the line to know that their comments were received. So we have Tanya Beltramo, Jamie Morrison, Kate Post whose letter I will read, Kathy Lepinen, Lisa McKay, Ron and Kathy Jones, Shannon Hester, and Tim Morrison. Great. Thanks. So Kate Post said, Hi, my name is Kate and I live within a few hundred feet of the proposed PDP 2002 and use permit 2006. I am writing today to oppose the modification of the use permit to allow a drive-through coffee or similar establishment. Erratic increased traffic from a drive-through cafe is not conducive to the walking and bike friendly neighborhood that currently exists and the developer claims to be aiming for. Allowing this use permit is not conducive to the walking and bike friendly neighborhood that currently exists and the developer claims to be aiming for. Allowing this use must be deemed necessary and justifiable and demonstrated to be of greater quality or community benefit. The proposed modification of the use permit to allow a drive-through coffee business is neither. Drive-through coffee shops in Chico regularly have overwhelming traffic that spills into major roadways causing drivers to make dangerous maneuvers. She cites 2393 Cohasset Road, 1055 Mangrove Ave, and 196 Humboldt Avenue. I believe those are the Dutch brothers. Additionally, even those in shopping centers stack up into the parking lot, making it unsafe for pedestrians and other drivers. See 851 East Avenue. There is no reason to believe the proposed Mountain Vista location will be any different. These drive-through properties have a blatant disregard for the safety of pedestrians, bikers, or other drivers, and it is absolutely not appropriate to place a drive-through coffee shop in a suburban neighborhood. In fact, the evidence that this type of drive-through is typically placed on major thoroughfares and in large shopping centers is another example of how inappropriate it is to consider for the Mountain Vista project. Inviting customers to drive and park is vastly different than encouraging consistent vehicle traffic with a drive-through. I would welcome and regularly patronize a traditional coffee shop. However, drive-through coffee does not benefit the immediate residential area, as the proposed parking lot defies... Uh... ...the design funnels traffic through the adjacent neighborhood via Biscayne Bay and Gallatin Gateway, and encourages others to use Eaton and Floral as a major thoroughfare akin to Mangrove or Esplanade, rather than one that is nestled among single-family homes and apartment buildings for more than a mile in both directions. This seriously endangers my neighbors and me and negatively impacts our quality of life, not to mention our property values. If the creation of a neighborhood serving center, as expressed in Section 1 , is currently the goal, a use that encourages people to walk slash cycle and does not add dangerous traffic and further hamper pedestrian cyclist safety is what should be pursued. I urge you to reject the proposed modification to Use Permit 2006. Thank you. The second letter from Lisa McKay says, hello, a neighbor at Sycamore Creek neighborhood that lives near the proposed commercial development site. Lisa McKay parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler! parler parler!! parler parler!! parler parler parler parler parler!!! parler parler parler parler parler!!! parler! parler parler characteristics of the proposed development would not be detrimental to the public interest, health and safety, convenience or welfare of the city. Many of the Sycamore Creek residents are very concerned about the safety and welfare of the residents living at Biscayne Bay and Gallatin Gateway. Due to the island on floral that prevents left turns, many drivers will travel through Biscayne or other streets in the Sycamore Creek neighborhood rather than through floral if they wish to go a direction other than north. The entrance exit placement on Biscayne Bay rather than Eaton is also problematic as it directs the traffic to take a right turn through Biscayne Bay rather than the main street, Eaton. There are usually cars parked on Biscayne Bay as you approach it from Eaton which presents a hazard with increased traffic on this street. The plans also indicate additional parking could take place on Biscayne Bay further restricting vehicular flights. To rectify these issues, there should be an entrance from Eaton instead of routing through Biscayne Bay. I am requesting the Planning Commission review the concerns of vehicular traffic through the neighborhood to protect the safety of the families in our neighborhood. While we were sitting here, I also did receive four additional letters. Ronald Jones at 6.11 p.m., Derek Ammitt at 6.51 p.m., Robin Howard at 6.51 p.m., and Andrew Stewart at 6.30 p.m. Are we going to read those? Sure. Yes, they haven't read them yet. Can we do public comment first? Sure. Just because those people have been waiting here. Yes, that sounds like a good way to do it if no one is opposed. Perfect. Next to speak is Jeremy S. Jeremy, can you address the Commission? Yes. Can you guys hear me okay? Perfect. I just wanted to introduce myself and let you know that I am here and I am able to field any questions regarding the drive-thru for the use of the proposed coffee shop. Jeremy, they did not see your earlier comment that you sent into the chat. We're not reading those during the meeting. I am a local restaurant business owner. I am a local restaurant business owner. I am a Japanese boss who is here in Chico. I have been in the restaurant business for 27 years and also have an additional coffee shop, milk prep business located inside In Motion Fitness here in town. This will be an additional location to that. We will pretend as a commercial kitchen slash coffee shop with the drive-thru. Nowadays with COVID and with no kind of end in sight, having a drive-thru, it can be a great way to get fresh meals made daily from our local farmers. Everything we have is going to be from the county so people can just drive in and pick up a lot of needs to need for grub hub, for door dash and middlemen to be touching those products. Is that the end of your comment? Yeah. I just wanted to let you know that I am here. If anybody has any questions or needs some clarification on to the information, send it to me. I will try to get through as to what the business would entail. Great. Thank you. Yeah, if there are no comments to the speaker, we can move on to the next. Okay. The next speaker is Pete Giappone. Pete, would you like to address the Commission on this item? It doesn't sound like it. Okay. Next is Kathy L. Kathy, would you like to address the Commission on this item? Hi, thank you so much. This is Kathy Lepinen. And, you know, I spoke yesterday at the design review board, and I don't think that I have too much more to add to that. Other than I did have a question of the gentleman who said that you were looking at removing the portion of the island that would keep us from turning left out of Biscayne Bay on to floral. Is that correct? We're seeing a nod. Go ahead, Matt. Yeah, there's an existing median that blocks Biscayne Bay, so we'll be removing a section of that with this development so you could turn the Biscayne Bay and floral as full access. Lefts, rights? My question then would be if we can remove that for Biscayne Bay, which the residents, as far as I know, don't actually need, could we instead remove? The section across from the driveway to allow the commercial people, even the commercial businesses, to turn left? No, we wouldn't consider that because the median that's opposite the driveway, it would have an effect on the traffic operations of the roundabout, and it would be serving only somewhat the development. The opening at Biscayne Bay is neighborhood serving for all the homes. Okay. To the north and to the east. Thank you, Matt. Was there a traffic study that was done recently? Because I know that floral is very busy to the south of Eaton Road, but most traffic coming north on floral turn onto Eaton Road. So to the north of Eaton Road, floral is not very busy. Just a point of clarification, this isn't so much of a back and forth, so if you want to summarize your comment and we can address it. Okay. When you're done. Okay. Thank you. So I think that one of the other things I did want to say is when we bought this property, we did know that there would be commercial property. And, you know, in general, I think that this neighborhood is excited about this project. And we love the builder and have been very impressed watching this neighborhood grow. So I don't. There was a comment made yesterday about did these people know when they bought. That that would be commercial. And the answer is yes, we did. But we did make an assumption that given that there are two busy roads next to the property, that there would be egress from the property onto those roads. Thank you for your comments. All right. Any follow up to that or shall we move on to our next comment? All right. All right. Next. Commenter. Okay. The next commenter is Ronnie Barks. Ronnie, do you have a comment for the commission on this item? Yeah. I'm a resident of Sycamore Creek. And as was mentioned before, we knew that there was going to be a commercial there and we were very excited about that. But the drive-thru portion is probably where I'm most concerned. And I do realize we talked a lot about bike parking and all of this. But having more cars or an 11 spot drive-thru for vehicles doesn't seem to kind of be consistent with being a bike-friendly commercial area. Also, most of the vehicles that would be passing through there will most likely make a right onto Gallatin than right onto this thing. I'm not quite sure. I understand there's been a widening of the road. I see. But is there any consideration of speed bumps or anything like that? Because we do have driveways right there. Also, one thing to note is as you come down E.C. Road westbound, it's very difficult to see around the corner into Biscayne Bay. The people pulling out of Biscayne on taking E.C. past the bus stop would have a difficult time judging vehicle speed. And having vehicles traveling at about 30 miles an hour. So, I would be surprised if the speed limit pulling into Biscayne from westbound would be coming in at a high rate of speed into that very first 50 residents right there on Biscayne. If they were to use the Gallatin four-way stop entry. I'm not really quite sure if that's been taken into consideration, that there is a difficult blind spot right there. Especially with the egress of the frontage road that E.C. has there as well. So, I would just say the idling of the vehicles and the drive-through right there. 11 cars potentially, you know, making noise all day long. Neighbors right across the street. And I just don't find that conducive to the neighborhood. We were looking forward to a coffee shop. But we could actually come up and enjoy not having a vehicle that's driving to work or going to town to pull in to get coffee to idle. And admit, you know, greenhouse emissions. And then come through Biscayne Bay to exit. It just doesn't seem conducive to the neighborhood. And I would stop at E.V. That would be quite a bit of money to live in this wonderful area. Thank you. Sorry, a lot of things to point out. But I have my notes and try to take advantage of my time. Yeah, appreciate your comment. If you're done, we'll move on to the next speaker. Mike, who do we have next? The next speaker is Robin Howard. Robin, would you like to address the commission on this item? Yes, please. So, again, you know, I agree with what Kathy just reported and some of the other letters and speakers. And we were aware of this development. And actually, I will say I'm excited about it. I think it's beautiful. And I think it's been well thought out. Again, for me, it really has to do with the main entrance being off of Biscayne. Thank you. I'm not proposing or even suggesting that you close off that entrance. I think it's fine that it's there. I think that traffic coming from outside of the area, the surrounding apartments from all directions, not being able to exit appropriately is my main concern. And I know that you've said you just can't do it for the floral out of the exit, you know, out of the current exit. But, you know, Biscayne is not that much farther down. So I really don't. I don't understand that completely. And I really wish that you would think about that a little bit more. The other thing I think that I had is I had heard that they decreased or asked for a decrease in number of parking. And last night there was mention that, you know, the workers within the within the development would park on the street. That is not necessarily something that I would be looking forward to as well. I know there was a suggestion. That maybe someone make that illegal to park on the road, which then, you know, inhibits a lot of other things. Family and friends coming to visit. And then the other thing was that the delivery vehicles, making sure that deliveries are made from the front entrance of the businesses and not the rear entrances to remove parking of those larger vehicles on the Biscayne Bay as well. And so those are my main concerns. I am in support. I for me, whether it has a drive. Through or not is not an issue for me. It's more about the it's going to drive traffic to that Biscayne Bay. And that's my biggest concern. Thank you for your comment. Next is just just you have a commission. Thank you. I'm a resident of the West Older side of 411. Now. And the developer already did a did us a disservice. With the linear park stretching up floral Avenue, which is a park only in name and otherwise a glorified sidewalk. If you truly care about the neighborhood and good planning, I hope you will reject this permit and recognize that a drive through only serves outsider traffic, not the pedestrians and cyclists of our active neighborhood. This seems to me to be a clear safety issue with unnecessary drive through and environmental issue with unnecessary idling of cars. Including the. The I don't think there's any community benefit by putting a drive through that is better served in the urban thoroughfare in a suburban neighborhood. Thank you so much for listening to our concerns. Thank you. Thank you. parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler! parler parler parler yes shannon do you like the dress of commission on the site so i'm on there how do i do it last chance to speak now or the video god damn shannon if you'd like to speak uh i don't know you can chat or uh those might be disabled let us know somehow but otherwise i think it might be time to read those other communications from the public kelly do you normally have your email on i mean if it was different circumstances and those people emailed after the meeting started not that i'm opposed to reading them but i'm just wondering like it's not usually i don't have my computer or any comments received after the start of the meeting that we did read all the comments that we received during the architectural review board meeting to the board so it's kind of your call i guess yeah i'm open to hearing them i thought that during covid we had been reading people's communications during the meeting that were written just because it's hard to show throwing the kitchen sink at our options and giving people multiple ways to engage with the planning commission we feel like speaking and it allows for the q a but if they're sending in comments then we want to have a parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler first first!!! the developer stating that he had talked to people on Biscayne Bay and heard no concerns about this project. This is erroneous. Nobody we have spoken with, OR Street has spoken with anyone about specifics of the commercial development. Many of us have been asking EPIC staff for about 13 months with no information available to us. Two, the developer has apparently suggested the people frequenting the restaurants and coffee services to park on Biscayne Bay. This is a 34-foot wide street curb to curb. The minimum parking space in California is nine feet. The law requires three feet clearance between bicycles and traffic and you need to follow three to four foot bicycle itself for the bicycle itself. After parking on both sides the reasonable space for bicycle traffic is $1,000.00. There is only 10 foot for two direction auto traffic. This is not sufficient for safe traffic flow and people will be seriously injured many times, maybe even fatally. Be advised there are many children and adults riding bicycle on this street. Please review this. It might be written slightly better than I read it but it's a little difficult. Much of the traffic will exit on Biscayne Bay side of the complex. Way too much traffic on this small narrow street. It will result in parking in front of existing homes, preventing any parking of visitors to residents. That's just not right. Kind of a problem some homeowners around the college have had to deal with for years. Please advise me of your decision. Feel free to contact me at information Ronald Jones. I do have an email received from Robin Howard although I do see that she is an attendee. I'm not sure if we... I wouldn't give people the choice option. Did she speak already? Okay. Then we've heard from Robin Howard. If there is anybody who didn't speak at the meeting but emailed that's when I would give them the chance to be read. Do we have others? I have an email from Derek Emmett. My turn. Go for it. Okay. Derek writes, Dear Commission, This is in regard to item 4.2 on your agenda. I am a resident of the affected neighbourhood and staunchly oppose this project. According to the plans before you, they are asking for a drive-through, particularly drive-through coffee. This area is a densely residential area with already high traffic volume. When the apartments open, traffic will more than likely be limited. The traffic will likely double in rate and speed. Allowing a commercial area with high traffic business will only attract drastically more traffic and speeds. This is a dangerous idea considering the bike paths, routes kids take to and from school. Kids in this area will not be able to walk, bike to school because of the amount of traffic and their speeds. Also, there is a dense single family residential development area directly behind the proposed location. I respectfully request the project be denied at this time. At the very least, I respectfully request the size of the project be reduced in size by half, as well as prevent a drive-through business. Also, a stipulation on hours of operation between 7 a.m. and 9 p.m. The reason behind our stipulation is to reduce the probability of crime and encourage hours of rest for the neighbourhood the project is in. Once again, thank you. This project is squarely in the middle of a densely residential area where kids play, walk, bike to school and families live. Please think of the families and kids before ruling on this project. Has there been a traffic study on this project? Thank you, Derek. I believe we just have one more email and that's from Andrew Stewart. He said, good evening. I'm a resident of the Sycamore Creek neighbourhood and just recently found out about the proposed plans for the area of Floral and Eaton. The greatest thing is that the area is not in the area of Floral and Eaton. I'm just concerned that I see is regarding a main entrance to the corner development from the neighbourhood itself and not from Eaton or Floral. There are many families with young children and pets and unnecessary traffic speeding through the neighbourhood creates a dangerous situation. Also, with regards to the proposed drive-through coffee shop, I believe there are more than enough of those style places scattered around town. The residences of this neighbourhood would prefer and recommend something a bit more neighbourly in the sense of a sit-down style coffee shop slash breakfast or brunch location. Thank you. The quick get a cup of coffee and go type facility will only contribute more to the first issue I've presented. Also, is this really in line with the council's vision? This town has prided itself on community and support for small business owners trying to keep the large chains from taking over. This isn't what this part of town needs and certainly isn't good for the residents in and around this complex. Thanks. Thanks for reading this. Alright, so that's all of our public speakers. Yes. And did we want to, or do any of the applicants who are present feel the need to rebuttal anything that's been said or clarify before we close the public hearing? If not, alright, if not, let's move on to closing the public hearing and discussing this. So, Commission discussion. Well, I'll go first. Okay. So, I'm very much aware of the concerns with the interface between pedestrian, bicycle, and vehicular traffic. But I'm also very impressed with these plans. I think a lot of thought and consideration has gone into how the flow is going to be managed between traffic, pedestrians, and vehicles. This just looks to be an excellent project that is in line with more of our general plans. parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler intersection in Eaton are going to allow folks to get up to very much speed, at least not like they do on Eaton and Floral right now, which already run at a pretty good clip because I commute through this area nearly daily, so I'm fairly familiar with the existing traffic flows. Also, that intersection of Floral and Eaton has been long planned to be a major intersection between major arteries serving these neighborhoods, so I think the architect, Matt Galloway, and the other folks have done a great job in balancing the concerns of neighborhood, traffic, aesthetics, density, just really looks like an excellent thought out project. Thanks. Thanks for that, Ken. Yeah, in general, I think that this project is, you know, it fits the general plan. It's good to have a community commercial center for this suburban area. I know some people on the north end of town, and I've looked up, like, hmm, what kind of food can I get around here and realized, whoa, there's nothing. So that, to me, this fills kind of a gap in that area in a way that's consistent with the other developments. I do share some of the neighbors' concerns about the drive-through, especially the language necessary and justifiable. I don't know that that's necessary. If this was being built in my neighborhood, I might share some of the same concerns about it encouraging people from all around the area to drive into the commercial center and, you know, use that as kind of a passing thought. Yeah, first off, first off, first off, first off, first off, first off, first off, first off, first off, first off, first off, first off, first off, first off, first off, first off, first off, first off, first off, first off, first off, first off, first off, first off, first off, first off, first off, first off, first off, first off, first off, first off, first off, first off, first off, first off, first off, first off, first off, first off, first off, first off, first off, first off, first off, first off, first off, first off, first off, first off, first off, first off, first off, first off, first off, first off, first off, first off, first off, first off, first off, first off, first off, first off, first off, first off, first off, first off, first off, first off, first off, first off, first off, general plan is for having communities that are connected by multiple modes of transportation. And that's something that I'm really passionate about. And drive-thrus don't encourage that type of transportation and land use. It won't encourage people to walk to this commercial center from their house or bike. It's a fuck-up on an arterial. Pardon? Can we mute the comments while people are speaking? Yeah. So anyway, those are just my thoughts if other commissioners would like to follow up. Well, I mean, I'll echo that. I'm not inclined to approve the use permit for the drive-thru. Everything else about this I'm extremely excited about. Echoing Ken's comments, I do hear some of the concerns about transportation. parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler! parler! parler! parler I think that this has done the best job that it can. I think that I agree. I applaud Matt and Keith and all for what they've done here. I'll say one other thing. When I first saw the footprint of this, I got really excited because it looks an awful lot like where a ballpark could go to me. So I got really excited. I thought, geez, that could be really cool, but that's obviously not what this is about. So I have some pretty serious reservations, partly because of some of the comments from the public, but partly just because of, I agree with what Bryce has said, that I'm not sure that I see this as necessary or essential, the drive-through specifically. It seems like the project works just fine. And in fact, originally was designed without that particular element. So I would be inclined to not support that particular use permit, but everything else about this, I feel pretty comfortable with. So I think John and I were both on the commission when this came forward on Biscayne. And I remember the comments on having those homes facing a commercial development. We knew that this was going to be commercial, at least two commissioners, maybe three, knew that this was going to be commercial in 2017. So that's not a surprise to me. But I think it's a good thing. I definitely, we have also seen several drive-through permits come before us, use permits come before us in our time on the planning commission. I personally don't love drive-through. It's something that's always my own preference. I do feel like, and we didn't hear this tonight, some of the arguments that we have heard in the past have been really compelling. parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler! parler parler parler! parler! parler! parler! parler go into a restaurant and pick up coffee, there is a benefit there. So I don't think I like this project. I support this project. I am glad to hear the constraints on the city. I'm not an architect. I was a little bit surprised by the design and the egress to having that context was helpful. But I guess I would not be opposed to the drive-thru. Yeah, I remember the conversation we had when this came up before, too, Tony. The drive-thru part, I'm not a fan of drive-thrus either. I just don't like to use them, but I prefer to walk to where I'm going to go or drive and park. I think the design of the drive-thru, I think, is about as good a job as they could do. I know I have not voted for them before because of problems with queuing and particularly, I remember one, there was a problem with a bus stop being located very near and there were some safety issues with it. I think the way that this one is engineered, it appears to be about as safe as it can be. My big concern with this has to deal with the potential off-site parking on Biscayne. I'm a little concerned with that. And I heard the one person in the public comment talk about safety, if there's cars parked on Biscayne, people on bicycles, pedestrians and stuff not being able to see very well. That, to me, is a concern. And I don't know if it's one within our power to abandon parking on the project side of Biscayne. And number two, I don't know if people in the neighborhood would want us to do that or not. I mean, I'm sure they use it also. So, it's, when I see a project like this, one of my biggest concerns is is there enough parking to fit the potential uses that are there? And I trust our city staff has taken that into account. However, we don't know exactly what these uses are going to be. And we don't know what, let's say, we opted not for the coffee drive-through, how will that impact parking for the coffee shop? How many more potential parler spots could that need? As much as I don't like drive-throughs, I do know that it's a reduction in the number of cars that actually stop and park. So, I mean, it's kind of a catch-22. But my biggest concern with the project, and I do like the fact that there's a bus stop right there, which is great. I like the fact that I think it's the safest traffic pattern in terms of ingress and egress. I know it's concerning having that big ingress and egress off of Biscayne and Gallatin right there. Any traffic calming measures that possibly could be used there, I would highly, highly encourage those. Those little, you know, they have out in front of Chico High, those sidewalks that when you step, they flash and these types of things. I think if we're going to really have the type of foot traffic and bicycle traffic that this project is going to have, I think it's going to be a great thing. And I think if we're going to have a lot of traffic calming measures that this project could encourage, I think any type of safety and traffic calming, public safety, pedestrian safety things would be really great at that intersection. So, I'm not crazy about the drive-through, but I see, again, I see those for some of the reasons that Commissioner Scott said in terms of people that cannot get out of their cars or they have kids, those types of things. I understand that. So, I mean, at this point, I think I would support it with the drive-through. Knowing that there's probably a mixed bag of people that would also like to use that, and I also appreciate the concerns of the public that don't want to necessarily see that type of use in their neighborhood, but this is a commercial use. It is allowable under the plan development, and so I think I'd be kind of leaning towards supporting it as is. Thank you. Thank you. I think another mitigating factor in favor of this particular drive-through, so I know a few years ago we allowed a drive-through, I forget the business, but it was on Mangrove across from the Safeway right next to the cemetery. And there was only about two or three spaces that would fit in line before you were backed right up onto Mangrove. And I know that that was a serious issue. Yes. Yes. traffic and safety concern because you know you're jetting down mangrove at 40 miles an hour or so and if you're not quite paying attention the cars have stuck out that's a real issue whereas in this particular design if it was to back up it's going to back up into the parking lot it's not going to back up on the floral or eaton or biscayne and so i think just by the the nature of this particular design uh that i don't think the driveway is going to be near as big a safety concern as say like the one starbucks across from bank of america on mangrove and or cohasset and that's just on the other side of the freeway there does that when they're constantly real close to to back and into those i don't think we're going to see issues of that significance with this particular design you! my turn um i second just about everything that said i'm not a drive-through fan but i think this one's done better than about anything i've seen in the city i think the project in general um is it looks like it's going to be good for the neighborhood and so my concerns were the same as what the neighbors said i've just john mentioned one about the uh having the blinking lights i don't know what the proper term for that is but for pedestrians to across the the street there at galaton and in biscayne i also wondered if it's possible to maybe on the uh project side of the or maybe both side whatever of this game to do like a two-hour parking um or something like that to uh keep people from parking and when they're working in the project for eight hours or whatever um i have three parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler parler and then the other thing whether some speed bumps might also slow people down so just a couple suggestions there I think might alleviate some of the concerns for the neighbors Thank you Yeah I appreciate the desire to mitigate potential concerns or safety issues for pedestrians and bicyclists kind of as a mitigation for these concerns over the drive-thru Yeah I would probably support that but what can we do to ensure that happens Is there a way that we can put that as a condition of approval that we'll have more safe crossings or other features Can we see that site plan again really quick Sorry Okay Yeah Yeah Yeah That's my fault I left my packet at home I'm thinking of the one off of East I didn't want to say the exact user The common! parler parler parler parler parler parler parler! parler!!! parler parler parler! parler! parler parler parler!!! parler!!!!! I'm sorry. Yeah, because we had significant concerns with the high school pedestrian traffic coming catty corner across that intersection to visit the Safeway Center and then the other businesses there for lunch and whatnot. Can we add, I'm sorry. Can we add a condition of approval regarding parking times on the project side of Biscayne? Yes, no? Yeah, I'd like to see what Matt thinks. There's different codes in play. And I think we're more into the public works wheelhouse on parking. So I think the problem we'd run into on that would be the fact that, okay, we know we have parking meters in different times downtown here. So we have parking meter specialists that go around the city. We want to take care of that. So this is kind of a discussion we've had with Merriam Park. We have an isolated location that has two hour parking four or five miles up that way. Who's gonna enforce it? Who's gonna enforce it? Yeah. And the problem is if you, because we've been involved in these parking discussions for years and years and years, like with the Mansion Park and the one around the Memorial Hall, and the fact that if somehow we would enforce that, you're limiting that to two hours. Well, rather than parking there for two hours, they'll just park down Gallatin Gateway four or five houses where they could stay all day. So what you end up doing is you displace spots and move them over to homes where there's really not the impacts adjacent to this commercial property. So I also think that the narrowness of that street, when it's parked is gonna be a natural calming effect anyway for traffic, because it is gonna be narrow and that'll force people to go slower just to be able to pass two ways on the Biscayne Bay Street. One thing, John, when you talk about bicycles too, if you go north, you're gonna have to go north. Well, north of Biscayne Bay, that's where we have the linear park along floral there. And it has a dedicated type one bicycle path. It really doesn't stand out on this drawing, but that actually is the same along this frontage. We haven't narrowed it down to the five foot sidewalk. So we have a continuous north-south bicycle trail there. And what we're trying to do is we're trying to make sure that! One thing you don't see in this drawing also is we're actually widening the floral avenue frontage of this property to provide two northbound lanes. Well, we have a lane drop at Biscayne Bay. So you would be in the left lane, if you wanted to continue to go to the north, you'd be in the right lane, slowing down to turn onto Biscayne Bay. So there is added capacity there from a safety perspective. And the fact that if I want to go further north, I'm going to get in the left lane because that's a continuous. I move over to the right, I have a free right turn lane there. So, you know, you're kind of eliminating some of the susceptibility for rear end collisions on that. So, like I said, I don't know if it shows out that well on here, but we do have that extra wide north-south bicycle connection across this property. Across there, okay. Thanks. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Well, I'll make one more pitch on my thing about the drive-through. So I understand what the fellow commissioners have commented. Certainly as drive-throughs go, I have no problems with safety on this one. That was not my concern at all. Certainly as drive-throughs go, this is a very safe layout. Likewise, I think that, you know, it's awfully hard to speak against something that, you know, that is by some measure in response to the crisis of COVID and fires, but clearly those are, you know, we all assume and hope are pretty short-lived incidents. They, you know, fires may come back, of course, but in the environment we're living in. But those are, you know, those are things that happen periodically. They're not a, you know, I don't think a permanent part of, you know, a decision for whether we approve something or not. So I understand. You know, safety on the one hand and convenience, particularly in this particular climate, those are arguments, but I don't find them either particularly compelling. For me, the more compelling argument is whether, you know, we should be approving drive-throughs, particularly when they require a use permit in this case, at all because of very important, you know, anything that we can do as a city to address climate change. And to have any kind of small impacts that will help eliminate some greenhouse gases, I think that we should do. So I clearly hear what everyone's saying about, you know, safety, et cetera, but that's not the reason that I oppose that. And as we've talked and as I've heard from, you know, the applicant in terms of how essential this really is, which does not sound essential at all to me, as a key part of the project, I say, you know, I think it's important to do that. I support everything else about this. But this is a really, I think, a key opportunity to say, we're going to try to make a change here and we're going to try to maybe do the right thing. So I love everything about this with some of the other traffic things we've already talked about, but I don't think I can support it with the drive-through in place. I agree, Rich. I have trouble finding the drive-through necessary and justifiable, something like if this was a, you know, a discussion about whether like a housing project was necessary and justifiable, I would be much more willing to say necessary. A drive-through, that's, I just don't see that. But the project itself, like the commercial area for this neighborhood on this vacant lot is necessary and justifiable, but I don't know that I can, in good faith, vote for the drive-through. Well, you know, we do have a growing retirement population in town. We do have disabled folks and having access in a vehicle is a significant life impact for some folks in terms of the choices that they have to patron businesses. And, you know, you're always balancing needs, but there is a population of several different demographic make-ups that very much desire drive-throughs and the accessibility and the convenience that they provide. So there are two sides to every story and usually a third one. Yeah. I do, I appreciate that our city has been forward thinking in requiring a use permit on all drive-throughs. So what we're hearing tonight allows us to have the discussion of how we balance that. Okay. So regardless of what the project would be, where the project is, the very nature that it has a drive-through, we would hear it as a use permit. And that's the stop of do we really, how do we want to balance out the need in the location. So I think that requirement is allowing us to have this discussion among the commission and that's really great. And I wish we could be able to do that. I think that would be a unanimous vote. But if we're not, I think that shows that having the use permit requirement is beneficial. Thank you for that. Also just to clarify for my own knowledge, this drive-through, it's only allowed to be a coffee or smoothie place, right? Am I getting that right? Oh, sorry. Am I not audible? Oops. Okay. Sorry. The question that I was asking was, is this proposed drive-through only allowed to be a coffee or smoothie venue, something like that, right? There is a condition of approval that specifically says that. Okay. Just wondering because it seems that there are, you know, I don't want to speak for anybody who doesn't have the ability to walk or bike places. Like some people do need to drive in cars to get places and have trouble getting out of their cars. Okay. And I see that. I just would think that there are a lot of other options for drive-through coffee. And that doesn't quite, to me, make this necessary, just to clarify. But I do think that is a really valid argument that, you know, we can't just prevent all people from accessing things via cars. I had a question about the conditions of approval for the drive-through permit. I'm trying to think. I'm trying to think if we've set hours on those before. I think we have in the past. I mean, it's in terms of impact on the neighborhood. It's not something that I would want, you know, at 11 o'clock at night or, you know, later, much later than, you know, 10, 11 o'clock at night in terms of, you know, it is potentially loud. Although I love the landscaping diagrams that Brian submitted I think are great. I think that will go a long way to helping with some of the, you know, unavoidable issues with car engine idling. There's a lot of greenery there. It'll help with the noise. But I feel like I'm okay. I said I'm going to support it, but I think we should put some parameters on the conditions of approval for the use permit in terms of hours on the road. You know, it's going to be time to adopt the rules of operation. You know, maybe potentially other factors, too. The queueing, I think, is manageable on site. And it being a use permit, if there are issues with it, we can take those to heart again and revisit this use permit if it is a really, if it truly, truly is impacting the neighborhood. So that, to me, it's not an all-or-nothing. decision we're making with this. It's reviewable by us, I assume by complaint or by if there's issues with it. Madam Chair, if you like, you can add, it's common to add time restrictions. I was just talking with Kelly. We were thinking if he wanted to add a restriction for the drive through operations, you know, one option could be six in the morning to 10 at night. And that would be a condition of the use permit for the drive through. What do we have citywide? I'm sorry, I can't remember. Mike? Yeah, right now, unless the use permit automatically authorizes something different, businesses which are located within 300 feet of a residential district, which this is, are limited. They require use permit approval if they want to operate outside the hours of 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. So those are already baked in to the operating room. So we're not having restrictions on this site. Okay. For all commercial uses. Yeah. I mean, I'm okay with that if that's what we're using. And that sounds reasonable to me. People work different schedules and, you know. And that 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. is without a condition of approval, correct? You need special use to operate between the hours of 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. Otherwise, those are closed hours. Right. So 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. through the day is good. Yeah. But I don't want to. I mean, I don't. I don't want to color anybody else's input. I mean, if other people have different ideas or something you think is more effective, then definitely speak up. I don't feel strongly about the hours themselves. Does anybody else have input? I don't know if the city knows anything about the hours that are most profitable or the busiest for these drive-thrus. Is it possible? Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. knowing that she's going in at 7 p.m., that having a coffee shop open would be beneficial. If they're already allowed to 10 p.m., I doubt that there's going to be that much later than that, but still the later hours do help. Public safety. The coffee shop can be open, but not the drive-thru is what I'm... All right. Okay. What next? Oh, I had a question about the conditions of approval for, once again, the bike parking. Does staff recommend that we clarify condition 8 at all to specify any more detail on the bike parking, or should we... I guess I'm just looking for guidance on that to make sure that it gets done the way that we had envisioned. I had a question, if I can talk after yours, too, Bryce. Yeah. In the report, it mentions bike parking is going to be uncovered, yet there is a suggestion in code that it could be covered, and I was maybe wondering what some of the reasons are why it says... Yeah, right here. Bicycle parking would not be covered. Bicycle parking would not be covered, and protected from the elements as encouraged by Design Guideline 2.1.31. But as conditioned, condition 8 would be an adequate quantity. So I think we should probably set a number of bike parking, and I would personally like to see some of it be covered. Hoping it's going to rain here sometime again soon. Yeah. That's a good idea. And it does specify... Oh, yeah. In condition 8, it says prior to issuance, et cetera, at least four bike parking spaces in an appropriate location diagonally across the property from the proposed bike parking shown on the plans. And yeah, I just have concerns with that. It's... The way that I read it, an additional four bike parking spaces to the six that are shown... I don't know if it's shown on the plan, but I think that condition should be changed to specify at least 10 or whatever we're proposing. Which condition number is it? It's 8 on Exhibit I. And we could add to that that a certain number be covered. Question, Kelly. Mr. Galloway mentioned about that they've amended it on Building B and C, the bike parking. How many spaces for each of those did they mention? I believe their bicycle parking requirement was 10, but if I understood Matt correctly when he was describing it, they'd be like racks or rows of four. So you would at least, again, correct me if I'm wrong, but be looking at at least 12 on the site because you couldn't get three and a half out of a rack. We got a thumbs up from him. Okay. Yeah, I mean, in the concept, I saw the bike parking with space for six bikes, and then he verbally told us that there would be more by the buildings. So I think if you wanted to specifically say the project should provide 12 bicycle parking spaces, and if you wanted to request that a number of them be covered to be more consistent, just on the design guidelines, we could add that to the condition. I would even up it to 14 because there's the six existing plus four buildings B and C if I'm doing math right. Yeah. But then I don't know how many we should say should be covered and how that would work. I don't. Yeah. Do you have ideas, John? Well, I kind of like the way that you said it, Kelly, in terms of where, and I think Mr. Galloway said he wants, you know, dedicated bike parking, in front of each building. So I think it's just a matter of how many spaces. And then the covering, it would be great to have, if there is a central bike parking spot, like on the plan, it does have that bike rack capacity, the sixth one that's on there. If we're still going to go with that, if that's still part of the design, that would be great to have that covered. I agree. And then potentially the diagonal bike parking may be adjacent to the buildings, probably would not have to be covered. Yeah, I would agree with that. So how do we go about modifying the condition? You could just state it in a condition that says the six bike rack capacity as shown on the site plan would be covered. And, at least, to me, that is close enough to the restaurant that that would probably cover that. And then maybe, how many total spaces did you think would be adequate? I was saying four per building B and C. So I guess that's, so we could put, total. Yeah. I mean, so four, so four at building C and four additional at building B. Yeah. Yeah. Is that okay, Kelly? Yeah. Sure. I mean, if it works with the whole, I don't know if they come in sets of four, the bike rack itself. I'm not 100% sure. Okay. I mean, we could say the, you know, at least two spots per building, assuming that they have a one rack with two sides. Yeah. Yeah. If you've had, like in the artist, the rendering that they had, those, the big loops, have two of those loops at each, in front of each building. Yeah. Or, I mean, we, yeah, this is getting really into the details. I don't know exactly what's possible, but ideally I would say space for four bikes at, at least at each building. So 12 bicycle parking spaces with half of them covered, or are we saying 14? It'd still be up to 14. 14. We reduce it to only 12. Okay. Are we counting the six separate from the building? So the six covered ones on the left side of the diagram, and then four uncovered spaces per building B and C, for a total of 14 bicycle parking spaces. So of the three groups of bicycle spaces, you're suggesting that we cover the one mainland of six by building A? Yeah. And the other two groups, building C and B, would be uncovered? Mm-hmm. I, and I might be wrong, but I'm assuming that it would be easier to cover the freestanding one than the ones that'll probably be kind of up against the building. Yeah. Yeah, that makes sense. I think that makes intuitive sense too, if you have, I'm just picturing that covered parking being people who are working there. Yeah, that's what I was thinking. And so you'd want to keep it uncovered in front for patrons. Yeah, exactly. That's exactly what I was thinking, Tony. All right. Well, then I'd like to, uh, propose a motion. I move that the planning commission adopt resolution 20-13, approving the mountain vista plan development permit, PDP 20-02, and master use permit UP 20-06, subject to the attached, and add a condition 10, that the bike rack by building A be covered. Condition 10? Or do you mean condition 8? Or am I mis- Well, I, I was, I was adding. Oh, okay. A condition of approval. We have nine, correct? No, no. Sorry, I lost the page. You're probably. We have 12. 12. Okay, so this would be a number 13 then. Okay, so condition number eight says prior to the issuance of C of O, applicant shall install at applicant's expense at least four biking, uh, bike parking spaces in an appropriate location, diagonal, uh, from the property. And you want to add a separate condition? Well, we could either piggyback it on to eight. Yeah, we could change that from four to, um, eight. I was envisioning changing number eight. Okay. But if you have a better idea, I'm open. Also, we did have another recommended condition to put the speakers and the menu boards on the south side of that building C. So if you would like to add that as a condition, we can do that. Yes, sure. Okay. Okay. So, so are we modifying condition eight then or or adding a new one? You have a preference can. No. Okay. I would say probably modify condition eight so that it's not redundant or, you know, confusing. Okay, great. So we have a motion. Do we have a second? I'm sorry. Do we also need to put in the hours for the drive? Through or not? No. Okay. All right. I'll second. Thank you. Okay. Do we have further discussion? I'll start with saying I'm kind of conflicted because of the things that I've mentioned. I mean, I'll also say that while my vote will be no, it's exclusively on that one item. Everything else about this project. I love as we've discussed. And as we've refined it, it's a good project. It's, it's well thought out. It's well done. And, and I fully support everything about it except the drive-through. So my vote will be no only because of that one element. Yeah, and I, I will probably vote the same and I think it's good that we have a diversity of opinions, but are still working, working together and able to, you know, discuss these and come to a conclusion of some kind. So, so that's, you know, I was saying I'll probably vote that way. We haven't called the question yet. Have we? Or I mean, are we ready? Call the question. Okay. All in favor, please say aye. Aye. All opposed, please say nay. No. So that fails. Oh. Were you a no? Dennis? Dennis Wilson-Bell. Any abstentions? So three to three. We're not going to vote. How much did we, we had Commissioner, maybe no. And then myself and Commissioner Ober. Okay. So my, can I ask the question then? Is it possible to, to separate these out and vote for the use permit separately from? Yes, we can. So I'd, I'd move approval of the project. I don't, I don't have the numbers in front of me. I apologize, but, and we can, we can perhaps deal separately with the use permit, but I would move approval of the project minus the use permit. We can easily strike the, the findings out of the resolution for the use permit, but the, the conditions do not appear to be separated specific to one or the other. Uh-huh. So we would have to kind of go through them one at a time and speak to which ones apply or don't apply to the plan development permit. Yeah. Yeah, we, let me add to that. Thank you, Mike. We can, we can sort out which ones apply to the drive for, and which ones don't apply to the drive through, and that's, staff can do instead of making you go through this. Right. Mike, what I'm getting at here is you're modifying the plan development permit for these commercial uses, and that's how we're able to kind of separate this. That's part of your action. The use permit is pretty simply for the drive through, and that's kind of a separate action too. So that's why we're comfortable with that, and we can sort of, sort through the conditions, and we'll bring those resolutions back. Okay, I have a question on that though. If you bring those resolutions back and we have a full commission, do we have the option to vote on the use permit for the drive through again? No, what we, what we're going to do is take the direction from the planning commission to do our jobs and sort the conditions out for you in the final resolution. Yes. So we wouldn't, we weren't going to bring it back. Okay. I mean, we'll just get those resolutions completed. So we would modify what you have before you so that the drive through conditions are omitted from the commercial findings. And what I guess what I'm saying is we'll do two resolutions. Yeah. We'll do one for the commercial and one for the drive through. Yeah. Sounds good. Yeah. And, and, and yes, that sounds fine. Okay. The findings are the same in both cases. So we wouldn't. I think my concern was, do we do this, the same public hearing that we just had again, if we come back with two resolutions, because I've been here where we've had a tie vote one night and it's flipped when we added a another commissioner. Yep. We're, we're, we're, what we're talking about is not bringing the resolution back. What we're doing is taking direction now to complete the resolution. So we're going to, we're going to separate the vote on that. Sorry. Do we need to vote on that now? Do we know what we're trying to do? Yeah, we're not. What I'm saying is we don't want to bring the resolutions back. Right. And so, it would just. Sorry. Sorry. Would it go to the council without? It is. No. It doesn't need to unless it's appealed. So we wouldn't, you would take direction and then just go forward. We wouldn't see it again. No. Unless if you want, we can put it on consent on your next agenda. But what I'm suggesting is if it's a simple matter of separating the vote and doing two resolutions allows us to do that, and move through this without resulting in a tie, then we can do that. All right. It sounds like coming down to approving the whole project without the drive-through is what it sounds like to me. Yeah, that's what we would like to do. I think we're just kind of caught up in the process of it. I'm still not sure. Like, are we, I guess people are discussing, but my impression was, we could approve like the development permit, but not the master use permit. Is that, I'll ask when they're done if that's the case. I want to suggest that if the commission wants to approve the project without the drive-through, Yeah. you may be able to just adopt the resolution tonight and say we're adopting the resolution tonight, sans drive-through, no drive-through. Okay. The original conditions of approval for Mountain Vista say this site, in order to be approved for anything, needs to come back for a plan development permit and a master use permit to dictate what all uses occur. So those two things both need to be secured by the applicant to build anything on this site. Okay. And you have a resolution that does that except for it adds a drive-through that it doesn't sound like the majority of the commission will support tonight. And so, So that's option. Thank you, Mike. So, so we could basically have a similar motion to be, to what we said before, but adding, without the drive-through, or do we need to add that as a condition? Just say without the drive-through, we know what not to approve on building plans in the future, and what to look for. Everything but the drive-through. Yep. Okay. Who would like to make the motion? I'll make that motion. I'm not sure how to state it as a motion, but, I'll second that motion. Do we need to say the words out loud? Okay. Can we do it all over again? Yeah. Can we all say it? Can we talk to the attorney in the room? Yeah. Can the city attorney, like, spoon-feed us the motion so we can, Rich can say it? So, and I, maybe I can save that time. My intent is for, is my motion would be to approve the project, with the exception of the drive-through component. Yeah. Yeah. Um, and I'll leave it at that. If that, if that, if that works, because that's definitely my intent at least, and that, we'll see if it gets a second, but if, if that is clear enough for staff to then move forward, um, then, then I always would be comfortable with that as a motion. I, I don't think it would hurt to include in that motion that you're directing staff to remove the drive, the conditions that are in front of us applicable to the drive-through from, from the, um, from the conditions of approval and to replace it with a, that there's no, or I guess staff will, will take that with your intent. Yeah. So, so, so my motion is to, um, approve the project, um, without the drive-through and without the conditions, um, that are related to the drive-through component of the project. Happy with the coffee shop? I'm sorry? Happy with everything else as far as I'm concerned. If that works, for you, I'll second the motion. Yeah. Yeah. I think we need to amend it though to add about the bike thing again. Did we? Because, because the other motion failed. I think the intent was only the conditions that were related to the, um, drive-through, the other conditions that we established. We, we should clarify that, I agree, we should clarify that the, the prior conditions related to the bike. So I, I'd say that we amend the motion to, uh, uh, item eight of the conditions of approval to specify that, that the six, uh, existing, uh, bike spaces as shown on the, uh, site plan be covered and buildings, uh, B and C each have four, uh, parking, uh, bike parking spaces. Absolutely. I accept that amendment. Yes. And wasn't there another, it had to do with signage? Then eliminate condition 10. We, yeah. There was a, there was an additional condition from, that was recommended from architectural review that I would, that I don't think was added. Yeah. So, uh, conditions of approval number 10 regarding the drive through. And then what we were going to add as 13 regarding the speaker and menu boards would be struck. Oh, okay. Good to know. Thank you. Yes. All right. So, um, yeah. And I, do you approve the amendments? Yes, I do. And I do too. So, all right. I think we can take a vote now, unless there's further discussion. All right. I think I just say, um, I will support this motion reluctantly. I think our prior decision, um, seriously hinders the business potential and that, um, site being developed, um, that w our decision, um, it was mentioned by the applicant that, um, that spot being filled was contingent on having a drive through. Um, so what the reality could look like is, um, that not being built out or that space being built out and being vacant for, um, a long time. And we effectively, um, made that decision. So it's hard to support this decision knowing, um, what we did to that business owner. I, I agree because, I mean, I sat on this commission for almost 10 years now and we have approved numerous, um, other drive through businesses and, you know, this plan has been in the works for years and they've obviously been operating under a very valid assumption that drive through businesses are acceptable and allowed. And they consider this to be a significant part of the project. And I don't think we're doing full service by saying, well, this commission at this time, and this makeup is made an entirely different position on drive throughs, especially given the fact that this drive through is so well designed in terms of there being no backup traffic into a major through fair. Um, so I, I have a significant reservation about that. In fact, I will be voting no on the resolution on that basis alone, as I think we're unfairly penalizing, uh, the developers that I think have rightly been operating under a different set of assumptions that were allowed. And if I was a developer, I would feel a little bit blindsided by being told that no matter how good my drive through is no go with this commission. So I'm, I'm going to vote. No, I think too, if I not to dig in, but this is a local business owner. These are local developers. Um, these are people who have been long standing members of our community. They're using local architects. They're using a local landscape designer. They're using local traffic engineers, um, to do this project. This is exactly what we ask for, um, for Jeremy to, um, come forward with a project like this. Um, when he can't even operate his business right now, as it is two of them, um, you can't go with it in motion right now. And I can't go and have sushi. Um, I can't go and have sushi inside. Um, I, it just feels just so icky that we're doing this at this time. I'm glad that y'all voiced your opinions on that. I, what can I, I go back to the restriction of hours, you know, to try to decrease the traffic. And I know Tony, I understand what she said, but I wonder if that would be a, an in between thing. I mean, from an ecological standpoint, I don't like drive-throughs. And I, they're all over town and drives me crazy. But, um, but I understand about trying to make a, a business viable and profitable and all that. So I'm just, I'm still thinking if we could limit the traffic somehow, it would help the neighbors. And it would cut down on the, the, the, the impact of the carbon monoxide. So I'm trying to throw out a in between solution, maybe. Yeah. I feel like we've pondered those potential compromises and solutions, and I don't know that there's a really good one. I mean, I get, so what we would have to do, I think is vote on this motion. Um, Dennis, you voted in the negative on the prior motion. I think we, I need a parliamentarian and our attorney, but I think because he voted in the negative, we could reconsider the vote, but would that happen? Would that have to be at a separate meeting or could that be at this meeting? If the, I mean, you can continue to deliberate and then if the vote is negative, um, or a tie again, potentially, then you could continue and make another motion. Okay. So you can continue it after another vote. You can have it, continue to have your discussion you're having now to see if that, that additional vote is necessary. Okay. So I think I would prefer to vote in the negative on this motion. So that it is not passed. So we could perhaps entertain a separate motion. I'm not sure that that would be productive. I mean, what are we, if we go back to the previous discussion, what, what could we add to that? That would, so Dennis has offered one, one possibility and there may be others. I certainly don't want to shut off the conversation because I, I am sympathetic to the impacts of, of what we, so, so I don't know. Bryce is the answer is, I don't know. Maybe there'd be something. I don't know. It's been moved and seconded. So we need to, we need to take, we need to take a vote since it's been moved and seconded. So we can discuss as long as we want after moving. Yeah, we can just continue to discuss it. But I think we, the motion right now is to approve it without the, the drive through. And so if we want to entirely, um, to separate it, we can do that. So that's what we're going to do. So that's what we're going to do. Right. So that's what the current motion is. Yeah. And so if you're all ready to vote on approving it without the drive through, I'm ready to. Okay. Um, so all in favor, please say aye. Aye. All opposed. No. Okay. And so that was four, I think. Yeah. Okay. So the motion fails. Um, okay. So what do we want to do next? What are our brilliant ideas? So are we going to consider a different motion or are we going to go back to the whole project itself? I mean, to the, just the project. I, I would, um, I don't, I'm not interested in going back to the, to the whole project. I mean, there's there, and this is a, this is not a, uh, you know, a sort that I'm willing to die on tonight. Um, I think I've heard lots of wise counsel from fellow commissioners and we've taken two votes now and it seems to be fairly clear what the will of the commission is. And, and as I said before, this is a fantastic project. And so I don't want, um, you know, the, my particular hesitation on the particulars of the use permit, um, to, to, to stall what I do believe is a great project. So, uh, so the answer to your question, Bruce, I certainly am not interested in opening up the entire project to, to more review. I, other commissioners may feel otherwise about that. But if there are other ways to, um, mitigate on, uh, the operation of the drive-through, um, then, you know, that may be something that, and Dennis has, has proposed one possibility. I don't know whether there's commission interest in supporting that or not, but, uh, there may be other things that we could do. I don't have anything to suggest really on that. Um, but again, I'm not interested in killing this project based on, you know, based on the discussion we've had tonight. I'm absolutely not wanting to see that. I think, uh, I think record trying to recognize, um, the, the, if, if there are such thing as standard hours for a coffee shop or a drive-through coffee shop, particularly in this type of a residential neighborhood, um, I think, I think the greatest need would be in the morning hours. Um, and so I would, I would like to go back to our original, um, motion that we made, including all of the bike parking that we had delineated. And, um, just add a condition that limits the, um, hours of operation for the drive-through from, uh, 6 a.m. until 4 p.m. And that gives us an hour, I think, before people in those neighborhoods come home. And it would cut down on traffic and potential safety with, you know, egress and ingress of the, of the drive-through. Um, it would take out six hours of potential lighting, idling of cars. So it would have an impact. Um, and I'm just frankly not sure how much of a, um, of a use the drive-through would get between 4 o'clock and 10 o'clock at night. Um, the coffee shop could still be open. But, you know, I'd hate to see us, um, like you said, Rich, I think it's a great project. Um, and I wouldn't want to see it sacrificed just because, um, I think, when I think we can come to a compromise over it. So my, my, I would just like to go back to our original motion, um, except add additional condition to, uh, limit the hours of operation for the drive-through from 6 a.m. until 4 p.m. And, and if I can add a comment from what I heard the applicant say earlier, we've been describing this as a, as a coffee shop, but I don't think that we're, you know, dictating necessarily what the actual business function is. Um, and I did hear the applicant earlier talk about serving meals, I believe. Um, I thought he said dinner. And I, I, I think it was, yeah, I think it included dinner. So, I mean, it sounds like I'm, I'm, you know, now arguing the other side of what I was arguing before. But if we're going to go forward with the drive-through, which I clearly have had some, uh, some opposition to, then I'm not sure that it does the business owner, if that's our interest. And if we are going to approve it, then we're doing the business owner not really any favors by restricting those hours. So, um, could we do like seven? In that case, I'll withdraw my motion before it's seconded. Okay. Would seven be, address your concerns? 7 PM, Dennis? Yeah, I mean, I'm just, you know, the, the reason for doing it before five for me was like John stated, just, you know, before a lot of people are coming home and doing things like that. So, I'm sorry to interrupt, but you know, the business can still be open. Oh yeah. Just the drive-through won't be open. They can still serve dinners. Absolutely. And, you know, but it just would the drive-through, I think limiting the hours of the drive-through would. So I don't know. I can throw my emotion back in if you want me to. Matter of fact, I will, I'll just, I'll put it back in there. That's and wait for a second. To clarify that motion includes the, the two conditions related to the bike lane and sorry, bike racks and the bike racks and limit the hours from six to seven. So it's six a.m. Till four p.m. And also the speaker board issue. Yes. Yep. I'll second that. I have a question. Okay. So the, there's a business owner who wants to serve dinners, et cetera, but isn't it in one of the conditions of approval that this is not a restaurant? Can you repeat that, Bryce? I couldn't hear you. It's in the conditions of approval that this is like a drink shop, the drive-through. It can't be. Yeah. It's not a restaurant. Yeah. Somebody is saying that they're going to serve dinners and such. I'm confused by the discrepancy there. I think it's tied down. The drive-through use is tied down. Yeah. That that's correct. It would be limited to a coffee shop or similar sort of tea or smoothie shop. Yeah. Coffee shops do provide some grab and go materials. Starbucks has, you know, pre-made sandwiches and the like so that could be, I'm not sure what the applicant was referring to. That sort of use might be permitted. That would be a decision for staff interpreting this condition. And you could also choose to clarify that with staff. I think in those later hours from 4 p.m. to 10 p.m., that just the way life works, there would be a natural lower customer flow wanting to access. Obviously, I think a coffee shop, we can all agree, the morning hours are when they're going to face their heaviest use. So I think a lighter use allowed to later in the evening, especially given shift changes at 7 or 8 o'clock, I just don't see that as that big a deal. If not 10 p.m., at least maybe like 7 or 8. That way they've got, you know, at least a 12-hour run with unimpeded instructions on their business. And then patrons have the option for a 12-hour run, 6 to 6, say, to either use the drive-thru or the walk-in. But I just think naturally there's going to be less use for a drive-thru in a coffee shop in the evening hours. And I'm not sure there's really a need to just say, well, then whatever that small, whatever amount is, we'll just eliminate it altogether. It's true. Yeah, I'm not sure I see the need there or that it would really make any impact in being like a compromise to the neighbors. It's not really going to remove the traffic that they're worried about. That's just my thoughts. So we have a motion on the floor, don't we? Okay. And to clarify, is basically the original motion with an hour difference? With limiting the hours of... Okay. To what times again? Well, my suggestion was from 6 a.m. until 4 p.m. Would you take a friendly amendment 6 to 6? Please. Hey, Tom. He's pleading with you. 5.30. No. I'm okay with 6 p.m. Can you clarify? You mean the drive-thru is open until 6 p.m. and then the business is normal? If it's okay, I will change it from 6 to 6. But we'd have to get a second on that. I'll second. Okay. All right. Are we ready for a vote? Okay. All in favor, please say aye. Aye. All opposed? Aye. Any abstentions? Aye. Okay. So the motion... Okay. The motion passes. Any bets? You made it. Hey, I think that was good work. All right. So we did that. Regular agenda. Doesn't look like there's anything on that. Reports and communications. Do we have reports and communications? Madam Chair, I don't have any. Your next meeting, though, we'll need to cancel, though. Okay. On the first, no meeting? Right. That works for me. Great. Okay. Okay. So then mid-October, we'll see... We'll see you all again. Pardon me? Sir? Next meeting, do we know when? It'll be... We're shooting tentatively for mid-October. We don't have anything for sure, though. All right. Well, meeting adjourned.
