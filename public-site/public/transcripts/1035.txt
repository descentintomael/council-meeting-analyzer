 All right, good afternoon. Happy Tuesday. Happy New Year for anyone who hasn't done these calls yet. My name is Manny Sanchez. I'm one of the product trainers here at Granicus. I'll be your tour guide, so to speak. I'm going through today's group session. This is session 104, peak overview and admin. In this session today, we're going to go through all the steps needed once you've actually got access to your site to log in and configure certain things, whether it be on the Granicus platform. I'll show you that side for a few moments. Then we'll spend the rest of our time in peak, giving you a very high-level overview to each of the different sections that kind of make up our site here. We do have a two-hour schedule for this session. This session usually will take the full two hours just because there is a lot of content to go through. So there's some of you guys smiling back at me. Thank you. You can put your hand down. That's okay. We're all friends. So this is kind of what we're going to go through today. We're going to log into our site. We're going to navigate through the Granicus platform. We're going to go through a couple of different tabs there that kind of interact with peak to kind of get everything set up there. We will then switch over to our peak side. We will also take an overview of the tabs that we see in peak. We'll show how to schedule meeting dates. We will search for items in our items tab. We'll also finish up in the admin tab. The admin tab will take probably the last 45 minutes or so of the session just because there's so much room in there to kind of customize and create certain ways for your site to look and act or feel. We do have our chat feature that will be open up the whole time here. So if you have any questions or anything that you want to get more information on, just pop it into here. I will stop along the way and just make sure that everyone's got what they need to hear. Any specific questions that you have about your site, you should send that information, that email to your project manager and trainer. We use a test site here because we have different people on from different parts of the country. And I don't want to just pick one person's site to use it because some of the information might be sensitive. What's nice is the stuff that you're going to see in our site here today is very similar to what you'll see in your site. We're just changing the names and faces to kind of protect the innocent, but it'll all have the same carry across there as far as the meeting bodies and meeting types, departments and stuff like that. It'll all make sense, I promise. We are recording. We are live here. So you're all going to get a copy of this video later today. I'll show you where that video will be uploaded into your site later today so you can access it at any time. Those videos do not expire. They're there for you to use. As you can see fit. Told you before about the chat features. If you have any questions, just pop it in there. I will definitely come along and answer your questions. And last but not least, that's me just smiling back at you, saying thanks for hanging out with me this lovely Tuesday afternoon. So let's get started. Let me switch my screen so I can show you. Oh, man. Were you guys seeing any of that PowerPoint? Or did you just see the Peaksite the whole time? I did have a PowerPoint. I opened it. I don't think I showed it to you. I feel kind of silly here. Let's go back over that a second here. Hold on. Sorry about that. All right. Were you guys seeing that? Can someone just confirm in the chat feature now that you can see it? Okay. I'm sorry about that. So I'm sitting there making fun of myself, but I'm having the picture changed. So this is kind of what we were going through, and I had it on the wrong screen. I apologize. We left you guys smiling back at me. This is kind of what we're going to go over today. I'll have it better for tomorrow. I promise. We are live. Any questions that you have, and there's my mug smiling back at you. All right. So let me just put this over here. I apologize. And all right. So you can hear me, which is great. You're seeing the pictures here. So we're going to go to our Peaksite, and let's get at it. All right. So our test site is Granite University. It's granite.com. Each of your sites will have the same suffix. That granite.com. You can put your camera on if you want. I'll put mine on. It's going to have that. Each of you will have a different prefix at the beginning of it. Usually something to do with your jurisdiction. Pretty straightforward, right? It's going to be something you can access from the web. We recommend Chrome, but it will work on other browsers if you choose to use those. It's going to look for your username and password. If you haven't gotten access to your site yet, you'll get it today. All right. All right. So there's a couple others. So there's others. So there's others. So there's others. So there's others. So there's others. So there's others. So there's others. So there's others. So there's others. So there's others. So there's others. So there's others. So there's others. So there's others. called Media Manager, Open Platform, whatever you want to call it. When you log in, it will not bring you there. And I'll show you where it's going to bring you in a little bit. But when you're in here under apps, you'll see Granicus platform. That's why I usually refer to it as such. This is kind of more of the backend. This is the foundation. Everything that's built through Granicus comes through here. So if you want to use this to stream your meetings, you have to have this site. If you want to use this for peak to build your agendas, you have to have this page here. If you want to track your boards and commissions, excuse me, through our program, you'd have to have this. This is the hub. If you don't have this, you're not going to have anything else. Most of what we're going to see on the homepage doesn't really matter to us right now because we're using peak for our agendas. This will tie into that later on and I'll show you. There's a couple of different tabs here that we go through. The first one that I go through is archives. So the archives are important because these are folders, as you can see right there. And typically they're tied to a meeting body or a meeting type, or even like a training. We talked before about our videos. The videos that we're recording now will live in your archive folder under training. Typically we'll go in and create a new one called peak training folders, which is Granicus training, whatever it may be. The videos will live here. Let me see if I have peak. There you go. It'll have each of the sessions. So you can just double click on one of these. It'll open up a video and you can watch it again. Okay. So why these folders are important. Obviously they'll have your videos. Now, if you're not using them, you're not going to be able to watch them. If you're not using us to stream, then the videos aren't important, of course, but we still want to tie these folders together because eventually they're going to go up on our view page. And I'll show you what that is in a second here. The view page is basically your agenda center, wherever your documents are going to live. They're going to go onto this page, right? So when you're building the folders, the folders come down here. It says prior meeting content. A lot of times it'll say available archives, past meetings, prior events, whatever you want to call it. That's fine. Everything down here. Is in the past, right? So you'll see where it says ARB meetings, board of reviews. It's all coming from here. Some of these folders will not be on that site and that's totally fine. You're also noticing we have about 20 or so folders. A lot of you, when you first start with peak, we'll just have that one city council board of supervisors, planning commission, whatever the main board is that we want to get implemented with peak. That's the one that we want to put all the eggs in that basket. We've been doing this for a while. So we've been adding things here as we go. But basically when you're building the meetings, you're going to have to have a lot of meetings in peak. You're going to want to tie that meeting or that content to a specific folder with the intention of later on having those documents live in a specific spot. This way we're only seeing EDC stuff here. We're not seeing city council stuff here. This is just the food commission and stuff like that. So instead of having just that one large list of items or meetings here with no real discernible order, this allows you to give it that order. Okay. What's nice about the folders is you can rename them. If you wanted to come in and say, let's rename this to say architectural review board. Architecture. I can spell it right. Maybe you don't want it to say ARB on the web. You want it to say architectural review board. Give it the proper respect. I get it. Once I do that here, it changes it there. Okay. So this is important. The archive folders are very important. Typically when you first log into the archive, you can have a lot of folders. It'll have four, it'll have city council, because just because a lot of places have city council as their primary meeting board, you might call it town council, mayor and council. We can rename it. That's fine. You can also create new ones. Also fine. It'll have public works because we usually add in a specific department. Most places don't use that. It'll have training and then it'll have the recycle bin. The recycle bin really just pertains to the videos. So if you're using peak, the recycle bin will be of no use to you, but don't delete it. Just leave it there. Trust me. You can have as many of these folders as you want. Easy, just give it a name and save it. Don't get into having any kind of wonky characters or any kind of ampersands. And you can do everything, but just don't get into underscores and stuff like that. Sometimes it doesn't look well out here or just gives a little bit of confliction when we're building the site here. So archive folders will see this many more times. Some today, some in future meetings. But this is definitely big. OK. The next tab we'll see is admin. And obviously the people who should access this, I'm talking to them now. You're an admin in the system. You have access to everything. There's nothing that you shouldn't see here that the rest of the users should. OK. There's a bunch of sub folders here, some tabs. The only ones that we really care about for today are the view pages and users and groups. OK, so the view pages I showed you that quickly here before. This is the view page. Most of you will just have that one primary meeting view page that will include all of the meeting pages. So you can have all the meeting bodies that you want and all of your documents. Right. We build a few of them here because sometimes you might want to have a view page that just has the documents for a specific board. So you have that main one for city council and board of appeals and planning and all that stuff. But maybe the planning commission on your home site has their own page. And when they click on that, they want the citizens to be able to click on the agendas there and only see the agendas for planning commission. We can do that. All right. So if we wanted to build a new view page, we can just come in here. Click on new. We're going to just give it a name. We'll just call it Test View. All right. Built. We can delete this when we're done. I'm just giving you just showing you how easy it is to do. We want to make it active. That means the documents will show on the Web. We have the default view template. So we're going to use that there and create it. Now, once we do that, it's looking to see what kind of contents do you want to put out here. So we have all these events. And archives. Right. So think of that when you're looking at the view page and we're going to go through this more time. So if it's not making sense, trust me, we'll connect the dots at a later time. The events are things that haven't happened yet that are upcoming. Right. So you want to show that stuff on the Web. Archives are what you're going to see down below. OK, so if you only wanted to show, say, city council stuff here, you just highlight those folders there and the scheduled dates out for the rest. Oh, boy. Maybe we just want to have the things for 2022. We don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves because who knows. Right. And you also want to pick the archive here that has the. Geez. Twenty thirty six. Hopefully we won't be working so then. Right. We might have the city council recurring meetings here. Let's put that in as well. Let's put that. OK. So when I do that, if I go back to the basics tab or just go to the views tab here and I see that new test view. It's only going to show me stuff here that pertains to council. I'm not going to see EDC. I'm not going to see the architecture of your board or anything like that. Right. It's only going to show me that I'll see the tabs here up top with the dates. So I could pick dates in the twenty, twenty one, twenty, twenty or this year. We've only had the one meeting so far. Right. So you can have as many of those view pages as you like. You can always come back in, just highlight it by clicking on it. That makes the whole row yellow. Click edit. So now by default, the design of the view pages are set to show the video archives on the bottom. So you're going to see here, depending on how you have it, different folders or different tabs and stuff like that. For us, we're not using the videos here. We're going to change that. To be past events, so past events are the same thing, but they're not including any videos. It's just going to be the agenda and the minutes and possibly the agenda packet if you produce that. Right. So the template we use the template before. We're going to use just the same one. I'm not going to change it really. But if I wanted to edit that template. I could come into here and if you go to the editor, if you ever see any HTML coding, just walk away. Don't do that. Go to the design team. They'll fix it for you. But here is your designer. So this is how we have the design templates up for basic out of the box. We have the tabs here with collapsing panels on the bottom of the years. But the things in between, if you wanted to have the panels first, you can do that. The default I mentioned to you before that large list of items here. You know, this could be now if I go back in here and look at this, watch it, how crazy that gets. Right. This is going all the way back. It's really it's not fun to look at like that. Right. We don't want to change that way. Let's put it back to the way here. That's the templates. And this will have already been done for you. When you first log into your site, you'll already have a view page as you're playing with your documents, as you're posting things to the Web. That's where they'll go. But if you wanted to come in and change some of the content, you can change the content here. Put some stuff. You have some Zoom stuff here. They go put that in there. If you're going to be using send agenda, you'll have this email update box there. That's basically a way for you to once you publish your agenda to send an email out through peak, letting people know that who are on that recipient list, that that most recent agenda has been published there. So you can take a look at that. Votes really pertain to that. You can send more to Legistar. Leave it on for now. Upcoming events. So there's a couple of different fields. If you want to have the way the dates are laid out, be different. Maybe you like that better. Maybe you want military time. You don't want to show the time of the meeting. Totally up to you. Right. The agenda link is there. If you're using videos, you want to put that there as well. E-comments. If some of you are using e-comments, it'll allow people to leave comments or publish, publish, leave comments or request to speak on items. Once the agenda has been published, if you want to put that agenda packet out there, you can do that as well. Same thing down below. Some people don't like it to say something else. They want it to just say, oops, hold on. They want it to say available archives. Totally up to you. But you can change that terminology to be something else. And on the bottom, I'm not a big fan of the way that looks. I like this one better here. Let's do that. Save it. You can change whatever you want to put here. We can't add tabs to it or rearrange the way that they look. That's not going to be something we can do. But we can have the terminology be a little bit different based on your selections here. And usually what they'll do is when they get your questionnaire, they'll go to your website, the design team and kind of pick the colors. They can go there with the little tool, pick the colors. So this way, when you're putting your view page like I'm showing you here into, let me just find, I have one that I can show you here. Hold on. I have a couple, but let me just pull one up just to show you kind of how it works. How that view page will correspond or how it'll look in your home site. Let me pull one up here. This is a place in Georgia. Nice group of people here. This is a place in Ohio. So this is their home page. This is where they're going. But in the agenda center, you'll have that page. So it's not taking up a whole 27 inch screen here in this place. Same thing. And it kind of fits the colors that you see here. You're seeing on different parts of the website. If you get to go through a redesign, let us know. We can change the colors or you can go in and change them yourself. Nice and easy. All right. But that's what you can do here. All of the things that I'm showing you here now, you'll have the ability to do. If you don't feel comfortable, I don't blame you. The first time or two doing it, it's a little bit daunting. Ask for help. Don't be shy. Project manager, trainer will be able to help you. No problem at all. OK. The last thing I want to show you here under the admin tab, on the Granite platform is users and groups. Before I do that, because this is the last piece. Anyone have any questions on archive folders or under admin, the view pages? Anything that didn't make sense or you'd like a little bit more information on? If so, don't be shy. I'm happy to give more information. I'm not seeing any questions. That's fine. So users and groups here, this is going to give me a listing of every single user in my site, whether it's peak, whether it's a Granite platform, they're all going to be here listed with the user name, first name, last name and an email address. Right. If you want to put their phone number and you can't, it's not really forward facing. It's more internal. If it's something you want to track, have at it. Right. If I clicked on anybody's profile, just click on their name, it'll open up their profile. I can come in and change your username. I can change your password. And as an admin, so can you. If their email address changes, you definitely want to change it here. It's also given me the ability to give the default app. Right. So if I'm creating users, I want to make sure that they're seeing peak first. Doesn't mean that they can't see the platform. It just means they won't see it first. So this one here says peak agenda. So for Gina, she's coming in to see peak agenda. It also shows me a listing on the right of all the groups that we have in our site. And which one she's in. The groups come into play more often. So later on for one of two things. One, if you're going to use our legislative, which is an app that you can use to download and view agenda that are published. Take notes and annotations and things like that. Plus, if you have anything confidential on that agenda, you'd see it in that specific spot. Plus, if you wanted to restrict access to certain people, maybe you have an agenda clerk that should only be able to see historical preservation. She shouldn't be able to do anything under bicycle or the ARB. So if you're going to use that agenda, you can put them in a specific group and give them access via permissions. What they can or can't do is through here. A lot of this stuff you don't need to do at the beginning. It's more once you've built out your database of users. And it really comes into play much more so later on once we get to Iowa Dispute. So I don't want to spend too much time on here because I don't want to lose you. We still have a lot more to go through. I want to make my way over to peak. Before we do that, any objections? Any questions? Any questions about the admin side here of Granicus Platform or how we got here? All right, so how do we get to peak? Great question. When you're logging in here, and if you come to this particular piece, it will show you my agency name. It will have the Granicus logo there. It will have my name, just like it will have your name once you log into your site. And it will also have this apps drop down, okay? It's going to show me a listing of all the apps that we have here. have. Now, some of you will not have boards and commissions or speaker, but you'll definitely have peak agenda. Okay. I promise you that. And this is what peak agenda looks like when you log in. Hold on. There you go. This is what it looks like for everybody out of the box. Same thing. We can't change or customize the dashboard. This is what it looks like, right? It's going to show you here a tab with all the items that you've created, not me, but you. And obviously this is me because it's my site. It's going to show me all the items that I've created. Now, I haven't created that many items. I have created a lot, but I am sharing a super user account with a bunch of other fine folks here at Granicus. That's why that number is allowed to go up that fast, right? If I click this button though, it brings me into the items tab and it shows me my items. So this particular site has over 300 items, but 145 of them are mine. Okay. So I've been pretty busy, right? On the right side, it'll show the items that need my approval. So depending on who you are in the system, you might not, uh, you might, opt to not use workflow. Very common and nothing wrong with that at all. Um, so if that's the case, this is going to be zero quite a bit. If you are somebody who plays a role as an approver, this number will go up and down based on your activity. So as you approve things, the number will go down. As items get sent to you, they're going to go up. This is kind of your one-stop shop to see what you have to do. Okay. If there's nothing there, good for you. If you're listed as an FYI, you're getting the same email as an approver, but you're not going to ask to approve. Okay. And if you want to see things that you've approved in the past, they all live here. Okay. This is going to be specific to your login. So once you log in Rodney or Danny or whoever like that, your name's going to be here, not mine. And it'll have whatever you've done in the system. Okay. Underneath that, you'll see here up to four meeting dates, and you can obviously have more than four, but you're going to see the next four in succession. Okay. It'll hold the date. It'll have the meeting body. It'll have the items that are on the agenda and scheduled as well as how many have been approved. And it'll have the status of the agenda. Okay. Now, if you have more than four meetings scheduled, you'll have an arrow that goes to the right. And if you click on that, it'll take you out a couple of months and shows you all the information there. Same thing. If you want it to go backwards, not a lot of us want to see 2021 right away, but we can go back and see those documents here. Okay. You'll see that some of these agendas have been finalized. Some have three items and they've all been approved. That's super. Okay. So, you can see what that means here and there. Okay. So, and sometimes on these calls, I'll throw out like some quiz questions for you just to kind of see if you're paying attention. And one of them, I just kind of went over again with what you're seeing here on the dashboard. And now here's the thing. When you're clicking on any of these fields, I'm like, I'm an admin. And you'll see here under my name, it's got admin. That means I have access to everything. Okay. Just like you'll see later today. If you don't already have access to your site, you'll have it today. And you'll be able to go in and do what I'm doing. Okay. If I click on an agenda that's not final, it'll bring me into it, show me what's there, and that's great. Right? If I click on an agenda that is final, it does the same thing. So, what's the difference? Right? If I go into an agenda and it's not final, and I'm not an admin or not a clerk slash coordinator, and if I'm just a drafter, and I don't mean any disrespect to the drafters. Drafters are very important. But if a drafter is in the system and the agenda is not final, when they go to click on it, instead of clicking on it, they're not final. And if I click on it, they're not seeing the agenda outline. They'll get a message that says, you do not have permission to perform this action. Please see an admin if you think you do. Okay. So, why are we doing that? We're just locking them out of the agenda. We want the agenda clerks to be able to go in and do their thing without having anybody else go in kind of over their shoulder making changes. Okay. So, that's what that's about there. Any questions on the dashboard, what we see here? And we'll be back here a few more times. Just want to make sure we're good. All right. Not seeing any questions, and that's okay. A lot of times this session, this is the first one. You don't know what you don't know. So, you don't have to come in with 75 questions. But if you have something, don't be shy. You can ask. If you don't want the question to be seen by everybody, you can just make it go to me, and I promise not to call you out. Totally fine. All right. So, the next tab we see is the meetings tab. And this is going to show me the calendar view for the month that we're in. You're going to see possibly a couple different questions. We can see a few colors, which is kind of cool, right, instead of just seeing the same old color all the time. This is going to show you all the meetings that we have scheduled for the month that we're in. Typically, you'll see the last week or so of the previous month, and depending on how the calendar lays out, it'll show us the week of the next month, okay? It'll show us the meeting body, and if we click on any of these boards or these meeting dates, it'll bring me to that agenda, okay, whichever one it is. Possibly, it'll be a different outline or different sections, and that's great, right? On the left-hand side, you'll see where the meetings are, and on the right-hand it says add new meeting. It's a green button right there. You'll also see that here. Same thing if you do it either way. I'm going to show you that in a little bit. On the left side here, we have the dates for the December meeting and all the January ones and possibly one in February. Okay. So now if you remember from the dashboard, here's quiz question number one. If you remember from the dashboard about a minute or two ago, on the bottom of the dashboard, there was some meeting cards and it had information pertaining to the meeting that were coming up and it had five pieces of specific information that it gives us. Can anyone give me any of those five for 20 fake points? All right. Holly's got a big one. Yep. Date. That's a big one. It shows us that. So there's four more pieces of information that the dashboard shows us pertaining to the meetings. Can anyone else give me, or Holly, if you want to double your points? What other topics or pieces of the meeting do we see? The location doesn't have that, but I like the way you're thinking. Nope. I like that too, but no. Good stuff. These are things that you will see eventually, but you won't see on the dashboard. I'll give you a partial credit, Danny. All right. So the meeting data is huge, but what else would you expect to see about a meeting? The subject of the meeting, I can take that as partial credit. So to me, the meeting body is that, and I just gave you a little tip, so we'll come back in there. So the subject of the meeting, so that's good. Ronnie's got 20 points. So there's three more things there that we're looking for. Two of them are tied together. The other one is kind of on its own. Anyone want to guess? And I'm going to give you the answers. I'm not trying to trick you. I'm just trying to throw it out there to see. Status, yes. That's one that almost nobody gets. So I'm going to give you 30 points right there. Good job. The status, yes. That's important because depending on how your settings are, people that are in the system, excuse me, users in the system will be able to access that agenda or they won't. Okay. So there's one more piece that has like two parts to it. So what do you put on the agenda? What are we usually discussing? Hopefully that didn't give it away too easy. All right. So this one's tough sometimes too. It's items. So how many items are actually on the agenda and how many of them have been approved? So this is important mostly for the clerk. You're coming in and you're the clerk for the council and you see an agenda that's coming out next week and there's only two items on there. Maybe it's a work session. Maybe it's a short meeting because we just had one the week before. Maybe it's not. But this gives you that little snapshot. So when you click on it, it brings you in. So you can see that you have a lot of items. And it shows you the items that are there. Okay. So you can kind of go through that. Great job. Thanks for playing. When you're in the meetings tab, you'll see some of the same information. This has the date. So we can give Holly some points for that. It has the meeting body. Okay. And it also has the meeting type. So the meeting type is different. This is the outline. This is what the agenda will look like as far as this section. Not every meeting has to be the same. It has to be the same. It has to be the same. It has to be the same. It has to have the same layout. It could be different. And obviously, most places will have call to order, roll call. Some places have a pledge of allegiance. Some have invocations. Some have public comment. Some don't have city manager comments, whatever. This just allows you to have a distinct outline for each of the different meeting types. Doesn't mean that you can only have one per body. You can have several. And a lot of places, especially for their main board, city council, you might have six or seven different types of meetings. Okay. This way, you're not tied to one layout, which is something I love about PEAK. It's also going to show you the agenda here. So clicking on this is the same thing as clicking on that. It does the same exact thing. If you don't believe me, take a look. Same thing, right? The other thing that you'll see for some of the meetings are the minutes. And the meeting minutes will not show up until the agenda has been published. Not so much finalized or anything like that. It's got to be published in order for the minutes to come out. The other thing that you'll see here is a details tab. We're going to see that together in a few minutes. So if you're going to create a few meetings with me just to show you just how smooth it can be. The details of the meeting. Let's go to something in this year here. Let's pick 19. When I click on the details, it'll show me here some basic information. Meeting body, the location. Good job, Danny. The meeting type, the date, the time, the end time. We'll talk about that a little bit. And some other information down below, which is kind of cool, right? The other thing that you'll have here, some of the meetings will have this little spinning circle here letting you know it's a recurring meeting. So it's nice when you're building meetings in peak. I see your question. I'll come to that in a second. So when you're building meetings in peak, you have the ability to build them in a one-off fashion. So if you just found out today there's a meeting tomorrow, let's build it, right? Not a big deal. If you found out today or usually the beginning of the year, you'll know the dates for the year ahead of time. You can come in in January and build all of your dates for your primary board in one spot, okay? I had a question that came in. So where do you change the meeting type on this page? So on this page here, you actually wouldn't change it. Where you would go to change it is if you're in the details tab. That's going to show you here a dropdown, okay? So we have each of the meeting types are tied to it. I'm sorry. Each of the meeting bodies has one default meeting type. That's the one that you'll see nine times out of 10 when you're building it. You can always change it to be something else. But for city council, typically it's going to be like a regular session or regular meeting, right? If you wanted to change it for an upcoming meeting to just be the work session, perfect. Glad I got it. But this is where you can build it right here. So yeah, you can definitely change that. Great question, too. Thank you. Okay. So the other thing you'll be able to do here is sort or filter. If you only want to see Board of Appeals meetings, you just cleaned out so much stuff here, right? I can't make this be my default view. I wish I could, but I can't. And you can only pick one board out of the two or 10 or 20 that you have in here. And for January, we don't have any more. So you can just go ahead and change it. And then you can go ahead and change it. You can also filter by the others. You can filter by others. You can filter others. You can filter others. You can filter others. You can filter others. You can filter others. You can filter others. You can filter others. You can filter others. You can filter others. You can filter others. You can filter others. You can filter others. You can filter others. You can filter others. You can filter others. You can filter others. a login and password, you also have to have certain permissions. So it's not something that you can get to just show up on your homepage or anything like that. I wish you could. Before I answer the question that comes in, other piece that you'll have, not every page will give you this, but some will, is a guide me feature. It basically gives you, it breaks down certain parts of the sections here and shows you what you're looking at. Here's the calendar view. Here's how you add a new meeting. I'm going to show you that in a minute. Here's how you filter the meetings. And here's all the different information about the meeting here. I have another question that came in. It says, do you have to input the recurring meetings every year or will they automatically populate going forward? It's a great question. So that's really up to you. You can build them. And if you remember before, when I was looking in the view page here, for one of the meeting bodies, I think it was council, they had meeting dates up until 30, 37, 38, 39, 40, 50. That's a lot. But when you're building the meetings, you're going to have the ability to start the meeting recurrence when you want and to end it when you want. So that's really up to you. What's nice is when you build those meetings out and you save them. So we have the meeting scheduled here for council. And then we have one for the committee of the arts. If I build the meeting set and it's got twice a week, twice a month, and one of the meetings falls up against a holiday. So I got to change that one, but not the other 26 meetings, just that one. I can do that. And I'll show you how to do that in a second. Does that answer your question before I show you guys how to create new meetings? So you're going to have that green button there. One thing to note too, only people, only users that have an admin gear or that agenda coordinator role, which is, think of that as the clerk, board secretary, executive system, whatever you have them, they're going to be the ones that are building agendas. They will see this green button. They will see that blue option here. They will not see that if they're a drafter or a board member, which board members should never be in peak or an approver or drafters. This is only for people that have access to do it. When I click on meeting, it's going to open up a new tab here, new page. And I have a blank template here. So let's see what we can do. We have the ability to build that one-time meeting or recurrent. We're going to build both, right? You'll see that some of these fields are required. Nothing I can do about that. We need that to show, okay? So the first thing you're going to fill out is the meeting body. So when you filled it out, the location could fill in and the meeting type. And it also has a two o'clock start time, right? Let's change that. So we're going to go ahead and click on that. And we're going to go ahead and click on that to be planning commission. Notice a different location fills in, different meeting type and a different time. All of that information is coming from admin. We didn't get there. We want to finish with that because I want to show you what it looks like and then show you how to build it later on. It's just easier to do it that way. But if I'm building it here, it doesn't mean that I have to have the location here. I can be somewhere else. Town council. Let's do this. City hall. There you go. So like that, typically this location field will show up on your agenda in some way, shape or form. Some places don't put that on their agenda document. All good. It's not required. Okay. The meeting type is, this is going to be what type of outline we have. If I wanted to change this to be a bicycle commission meeting type, it's still going to be a planning commission meeting, but I'm just using a different type. And typically this is going to go to a different folder. Let me go back to this. It's planning. I see another question coming in, which is great. Give me two seconds to this. A question that came in is, can you add multiple locations, multiple locations, multiple locations, multiple locations, multiple locations, multiple locations, for meetings? So when you're building the meeting types out, excuse me, the meeting locations out, that's all going to be done under the admin piece, right? Under the meeting bodies, you'll have a section there that says location. So you're going to put one in here and you can have as many, you can put as many as you want. And then when it comes time to do it, you're going to just delete the other ones, but you can't have like a dropdown if that's what you're looking for, which I understand that might be what you're thinking, but it's going to basically be the default or the main location. Now you might have six different boards and each of them meet in different places. So you can have different locations on each of their boards, but it's only going to be one typically that are there. Does that answer your question? And while I'm waiting for that person to answer, I see, so only admins can set up meetings is city clerk. No, only admins can set up meetings, i.e. city clerk, the park secretary can't set up meetings. That's actually not correct. And that's okay. We haven't gone through roles and permissions yet, which is great. But we haven't gone through roles and permissions yet, which is great. But we have a couple of roles coming up in a little bit. Basically, anyone who's an admin or an agenda coordinator, either of those two roles have the ability to create meetings in peak. Anything less than that, anyone who's a drafter or an approver or somebody who's listed as a view only, they would not be able to do it. Anybody who's one of those two roles, the clerk and admins, they have the most rights. If you wanted to have somebody be able to create meetings for only one board, you can do that. Or only these three boards, you can do that. But they would still need to have that access. They couldn't have anything less than that. Does that answer your question? Great. I have another question. This is great. A lot of times in this session, we have no questions. So this is awesome. If a director is meeting remotely and we have to post where they will be, okay, and the rest of the meeting, yep, okay. So for that, that's a little bit more advanced, but I can go through all of that with you in a little bit. So let's put a pin in that. But we can definitely do that. All right. So let's go ahead and get started. So this is what you're going to get out of the box, basically, on what you're building an admin. All right. The location, the type, the date, it's always going to default to today's date, which I'm thinking we're not going to have a date meeting today. Let's make it next Saturday. So 5pm is the start time. And that's really what's going to show out here once we do this. And that's what's going to show the end time. So if you're using peak, the end time means nothing. Okay. This is only important for places that are using us to stream their meetings. So if you are using peak, you can't leave this blank. It will have to have something there. But I can tell you that it will not show on the website, it will not show on your documents, it will not change anything about your meeting structure at six o'clock if the meeting is still going. Keep going. That's fine. It's just there. I can't turn this off. And you can't hide it. So okay. All right. Where do you save the changes if you need to make a change in date, location of meeting, please? All right, you're getting ahead of yourself, but you're in the right spot. So stay right there. And hold on. Okay. So we're building this meeting. We haven't even started yet. The submission deadlines. I want to ask you guys a question because you're coming in with questions for me. I got a good one for you. Does anyone ever have it? Anyone on the call ever have it where they always have their items in on time, where they're not getting items after the original submission date or after it's been posted? Anyone ever have that? Sometimes. Sometimes better than no. Usually this is a heck no or they'll get like a it's like that's funny type thing. So what's nice with peak is you're able to establish a deadline. Okay. So if you're saying this meeting is on the 29th, I want all items to be in by the 22nd at 4pm. Okay. So this is basically saying to everyone who's less than a coordinator who's less than an admin, if you come in on the 23rd, this date will not be in the drop down, you cannot get the item on there. The only way you could is to go to one of those admins to go to one of those clerks or coordinators to have them put it on, they will not be able to do it because we're basically saying, this is the deadline, get your items in a time or face the consequences. So description, let me just save this for us. Let's create this. Hold on. I must have hit something too fast. Let's try that. Let me get planning commission. Leave the date to the 29th. And the deadline 22nd. Let's save it one o'clock. Let me create that. All right. So the question came up before, where do I save the changes if you need to make a change in the date, location of meeting. So if I want to come in, and this is planning commission, let me just clear the board here. Here's the meeting for the 29th, right? If I want to change something about this, I come into here, hit the details tab. So I can't change the meeting body. If it's going to be a different board, I have to delete the meeting and start from scratch. If I want to change the location to be that city hall we've mentioned before, you change it here. And if you want the time to be different, maybe it's supposed to be five, we're going to push it up to four o'clock. Okay. You make the change here and save it. That will make the change out here. It'll also make the change on your document. All right, let's go back in here. There's still more to do. Another question came up. If there's somebody remote. Okay. So if you want to have it in here with the location, you can say city hall. One member is attending remotely via Zoom. The rest are in attendance. So you can do it here. If that's what you want to put, you can put it right there. The other field that you're going to have is this description field. The description field is left blank by design. Okay. So if you want to have it in here, you can put it right there. The description field is left blank by design. I don't know if you want to have it in here, but you can put it right there. I don't usually recommend putting this kind of information down here, but you can. What I usually do for this particular section here is if you have an agenda that's been published, and then you come back in after the original published date, and you have to make a revision or an amendment, some things change about what's out there now. If you're able to just go in and swap it out for the new document without saying anything, more power to you. A lot of places aren't that lucky. They have to come in and say that it's been revised, show some way that it's been revised. This is the best way to do it, and I'll show you that much more on the third session. I'm not trying to tease you. Just put a little appetizer out there. And I see another question here, so let's answer that, and let's go through that here. What if they have a task force subcommittee of planning and zoning? How do you change for that? How do you change for what? If you want to have a different committee, you would just create a different committee. So planning commission is the main, think of it like a tree. That's the main branch. Everything underneath it can be subcommittees or anything like that. So if you want to create a planning commission subcommittee or planning commission task force, something like that, that's a meeting body. If you want to just leave it as planning commission and have a task force subcommittee type, you can do that too. You got it, definitely. Again, the questions are great. Keep them coming. This is really good stuff, so I appreciate it. Let's go back into here, because on the bottom of that details tab, there's some advanced settings. So you can talk about that for a little bit too. These three here, excuse me, these three here automatically record and record and broadcast. For peak, don't mean anything. They don't have anything to do with it. This is really for streaming. This one here is important, because if you want to show this meeting on the upcoming events, you have to have that checked off. If you have these turned on and you're using peak, nothing happens here. Doesn't make a difference. This one's important. If you want to have that there for the public to see, then you have to have it here. And player for this particular group exercise, we don't care about. We're not streaming. We just want to look at the archives here. So if you remember from the beginning of our conversation, the folders were important, right? That's here. These are the archive folders. We have this meeting type associated with that folder. So what's going to happen is after this meeting is over on the 29th, it's going to drop down and put it into here. Okay, that's where that's going to... Okay. So we're going to connect in the dots here before the meeting even happens. The status of pending is on. The status really goes with the video. So we don't have to worry about that. But the part that's important is connecting it to the view page. So you see that we have like seven view pages here. I'm going to just put it there. Once I do this and hit save, if I come back out to the web and refresh it, here's the plan and commission meeting. It was originally at five o'clock. We changed it to four. Okay. If I need to go back to the web, I can go back to the web. If I need to make a change here, I come back in here. I want to make it 3.30. Trying to get home in time to beat the traffic. I get it. Change it here. And that changes it there. All right. So there was another question here. Where do you add the notification regarding people with hearing difficulties? So that, depending on... If that's going to be something that's static to your agenda, that's typically what we're going to think. We're going to put that on the back end of your template. Or I'm going to show you in a little bit under the meetings. How to add that stuff into the template on that side. So good stuff. All right. So that's the meeting section here. That's pretty big. We did a lot of stuff in there. Oh, actually, hold on. We didn't do recurring. Okay. I forget that. If I want to build meetings for the whole year, all right. Board of appeals. The location here. Let's give it the meeting type. When does it meet? Is it once a month? Twice a month? Is it every week? I'll just say the first Wednesday. Wednesday of the month. It's every month. Okay. And we're going to start that on in February. First Wednesday. And then when do you want to end that recurring? Do you want to just do that for a month? You want to do it for the whole year? Sweet. Start and end time is the same. Advanced settings is keeping it in the same folder. So what we're doing here now, once February comes, and you have the hour here to make it to the last day, to give me a couple of others to give me to others to give me to others to give me to others to give me to others to give me to others to give me to others to give me to others to give me to others to give me to others to give me to others to give me to others to give me to others to give me to others to give me to others to give me to others to give me to others to give me to others to give me to others to give me to others to give me to others to give me to others to give me to others to give me to others to give me to others to give me to others to give me to others to give me to others to give me to others to give me to others to give me to others to give me to others to give me to You can do it here and it'll show you all the other meetings in that recurrence. So if I wanted to change this one to be on February 3rd instead, it's changing that one. It's not changing anything else. OK, one thing to note when you're building your meetings out. On the view page, you're going to have that upcoming events window there, right? It's not going to show you all the meetings for the whole year. It's going to show you the meetings for the next recurrence. If you're building your meetings individually, one by one, they're going to list everything here, one at a time, right after each other. If you have a recurring set of meetings like the planning commission meeting that might have already had or board of appeals, it's only going to show me here. The one January 12th already passed, so it'll show me the next one. It's not going to show me all 30 of them. OK. Any questions on meetings? We had a bunch that came in, which is great. But any other questions about meetings tab here? While you're thinking about that, take a sip of my drink. All right. Next tab is items tab. This is going to basically be where all of your items live in peak. If anything that you've created that you haven't deleted, it lives here. OK, you're able to come in when you show these items, it'll show you the status of the item. It'll show you the internal number. The item title. The meeting body and date. If it's been assigned the current version. At that pencil marker here, this allows you to go into the item and edit it. OK. Also shows you if you have any attachments there and which ones you want to click on. If you click on something, it'll just open it up. Nice and easy. And it also tells you that a cover page is included. So think of the cover page as your transmittal form, staff report, council memo. Same thing when you're building items in peak, it's going to be asking for some specific information. The cover page is just basically a summary of those tabs or those fields. OK. You don't have to include the cover page. Some places don't use it, but we just have to build one for you. Otherwise it won't work. You'll see different statuses. You have approved, you have in draft. The other one you'll see is in review. When the item's in review, it'll show you the current approvers for that stage. OK. This has 307 items in it. If I want to change how many I'm looking at, I can pick the transportation committee and find that there's no items in here for that. None for the tree commission. How about town council? Give that a sec. I haven't found some of them in there. Planning commission. There you go. So you can take that large list of items and knock it down based on your search here. You can also pick dates. Pick a date of the meeting. Nothing there. OK. OK. OK. Nothing there. How about that? Striking that twice. If I want to also take the department that the item's coming from. County clerk. City clerk. Someone's been busy, right? I can also take the item type. So think of an item type as the category. How are you defining the item? Is it a resolution? Is it a bond? A contract? A bid? Things like that. And these are things that you can describe. You can build out. On that questionnaire that you've all hopefully handed in, we ask you for the types of items you use on your agendas. This is helpful for that searching and sorting here. Some people will actually build their workflows based on the item type. All contracts need to go through this particular level of view plus the accounting team or something like that. You know? Very helpful here. You're also able to do a search up top. Let's go through here. You want to just search for something under public works. So it'll show the items that have public works in it. It knocks it down. Okay. You can do an advanced search to pick other fields that are in the item template. And you can look for those. You can want to look for a specific range of dates between this date and that date. You can do that too. This might not give us any results. But maybe it does. Cool. You can go through that. If you wanted to knock this down to be just building division items. Let's see how many we got. You can also take this list of items and export it. Nice little CSV file here. And it shows you in that file each of the item numbers, the IDs, the version. Here's the item title. The status. The type of item it is. The department. The meeting body. The draft. The meeting date. And all those other fields. Very cool. Sometimes you like to have that paper copy. Go into a staff meeting and you want to just pull up all the items for this particular range of dates that came from building. Only 26. We can take a look at them right there. Okay. On the left-hand side here. We saw this before. It needs my approval. FYI and previously approved. We also have items that are not scheduled. So this one here. Does it really have a date? We can give others others others to use. We can give others others others to use. We can give others others others to use. We can give others others others to use. We can give others others others others to use. We can give others others others others to use. So once you do that, it's kind of a free agent and you can do what you want to it or with it. Put this back. OK, so we try to make it hard for things to get just deleted. OK, we don't want to be able to just come in and hit one button and knock out 30 items at once. That could have some adverse effects there. OK. You're able to each of these pages is a seven pages. Each of these pages holds 50 items. So if you scroll to the bottom, I want to go too fast and hurt anybody's eyes. You'll be able to see previous or next. And it changes the numbers here. From newest to oldest, we're using twenty, twenty one first. Now we have twenty, twenty two and things like that. You can also change how they're sorted based on your specifications here. OK. Anything that you create and peak items will live here. Straightforward. OK, if you never need to come find it, this is the place to do it. OK. The next step we have is creating a page. Now, we've already gone through meeting. I'm not going to do this one here because we're going to spend all of tomorrow session on that section. So I want to go through admin next admin next is the last piece of the puzzle. But there's a lot of that, a lot of pieces in there. So before we jump into here, anyone have any questions? All right. So under admin, when you click on that, that little gear, or that sprocket, it shows you more options on the left. OK. Most people will not see those because it's the only for admins. OK. If you're not an admin, you will not see that whole thing. It'll just say offline for the chat feature there. You won't even notice it's there. OK. On the left, you have these other areas where we can come in and create our site or configure it. Right. So the first thing you'll see is meetings. And the first thing underneath that is meeting bodies. OK. So meeting bodies is basically the board. So we talked before about having that meeting. OK. So meeting bodies is basically the board. And then you have planning and zoning commission, but they have a subcommittee. Right. This is where you build that. OK. So tomorrow's session is drafting and approving items. If you want to go into this, the grant university, you can register for that. I think it's at, hold on, I want to say the wrong time. Tomorrow's Wednesday, that session is tomorrow, two to four Eastern. It typically will not go over the two hours. It usually takes a little bit less than that, but we schedule all the sessions for two hours. Meeting bodies. So this is all the boards from A to Z or yeah, wow, A to Z. All the boards are here. And if I click on one of them, I click on the pencil marker. It shows me two things. It shows me the details of the meeting body and in the members. OK, so notice when you're in here, the only field that's required is the name. OK, if you want to come in and create a new meeting body, all you have to do is come in, click on, create green button. Say new board. If I just come in and just do that. OK, I haven't really done much here, but it's there. If I go back to the meeting bodies, the meeting tab, excuse me, it's there. There's nothing there to see, but it's something that I can use to search and sort by, which is kind of cool. So you can come back in and play with it, whatever you want to do here. And if you want, if you've already just created it, but you don't want to keep it, then maybe you created it by mistake. Right. Nobody's perfect. You can come in. And delete it. It's going to ask you this. Are you sure now we're using boards of commission, so this is important, but we're only using it for testing purposes. It's not a big deal. It's going to ask you, you sure you want to delete? So, yes. OK, if you are using boards and commissions, you want to be very careful about what you delete in here, because if you delete that, it could take it. Well, it will take it away from the boards and commission piece of it. And that could ruin some appointments or different past terms. We don't want to do that. OK. But for peak work. We're just going to worry about this. So when you're in the meeting body, you'll see different fields. You have the abbreviation, not that common. The meeting type. Very important. We want to make sure that when we're creating a new meeting that the meeting type comes in that we want. OK, so we have that set up. We have the location. So if you wanted to come in here before, that was a question. Can we have multiple meeting locations? If you want to come in and type in six of them and have them to be static, that's great. When you create the meeting, just go and pick the one you want and delete the rest. So if you want to do that, you can. Oops, sorry. Go back into one of the other ones here. The locations there. We have that the default time. So that's just the time that it usually starts. I mean, that all the meetings have to by law started 11 o'clock. That's the time that most finance committee meetings take place. So some committee it meets in the morning. OK. If you want to select the contact person, you can not required. It's more internal. The description field here. This is different than the one you saw under the meetings tab. This is if you wanted to have some places like to have their attendees show up on the agenda and they want to control that. That that information because it changes on a regular basis or semi regular basis. So instead of putting it on the back end on your tablet, which you don't have access to, you put it here and we just have the code kind of fill in that way. So you can do that. If that's something you want to look into, let us know. Let your project manager train and we can kind of go through that steps with you there. How many people sit on this board? We have five. You want to make it six? Make it seven. That's fine. The colors that you'll see here. These are the 12 that you have. The only place they really come into play is here. Doesn't show up on the Web. Doesn't show up on your agenda. It's just for you to kind of see different colors that are there. OK. Let's put this here. Let's get green. The other tab you'll see is members. OK, so the members tab here and some of the boards will have it. Some of them won't. It's important. That if you're if you're planning on doing minutes and peak, you have to have the names of board members here. Otherwise, when you go to start the minutes, you're not going to be able to take your roll call because we don't have any members in here. This is directly pulling from here into the minute minutes tab here. I got a question here for the member size. Should this include the ex officio members? It's totally up to you. You can do that if you want. For the boards that have those types of positions. Let's just pick one that didn't have one. Let's do. Where was it? Christmas board. OK, so if I wanted to add a new member, OK, green button, green button usually means add or create. So I can pick the name of a person in the system. I can pick anybody I want here. Let's pick Brandon. OK, so if that ex officio is not a voting member, uncheck that. This way, their name will not show up in the votes. It'll just show up in the roll call. So when you're doing the minutes and peak, anyone that's listed in this this row here will show up in the roll call. If that's something that you don't want the people to see, you just want them to be listed as a name only. And don't put them in here. I'll show you where to put them on the fourth call. But if they're a voting member, you got a great question. Voting member shows up on the roll call. Officer role not required. We give you a few of these to start and you can come in and build your own. You want to say ex officio. You can do that. What's nice is if you add something in here, it'll be here next time. And you can use it on the board, which is great. One of the only places you can actually create things on the fly without having to contact design or me. Status active if they're if they're on the board still keep them active. Start and end date. Totally up to you. You want to put that at you. That doesn't go anywhere because there's no reports to create from that. It's just for your own personal record keeping. If I wanted to add another person here. OK, and then we'll put them as active. Just do that. Doesn't have the officer role. It's not required. It's if you want to show it right. If I wanted to have Steven be first, I can use the arrow there. There's no drag and drop, but I can put them there. OK. You can always have more people if you want to. So, you know what? Let me take Steven off of the board. I'm not deleting this person from the system. I'm simply taking them off of the board. It happens, right? Let's go back. Details. So what we usually will do, and it's something we're going to talk about a little bit later on, because a lot of you, some of you. Well, let me ask this question. Is anyone on the call? Have you all been in their system yet? Have they been granted access to their site yet? OK, this one. So what we usually try to have set up for you when you first log in, and this will be the same thing for hopefully each of you, is we want to make sure that the archive folder that we have, the main one matches your main meeting body. That's straightforward. We're going to have that view page built out so you can go see what it looks like. And we'll have the users that you've asked us to build, like your core users. The primary team. The main team. So you're going to have all of those things built out, right? In peak, what we want to do is have that one main meeting body. We're not going to go to your site and scour all 12 of them. We want to put the one there, the big one. This is the one that's paying for peak. We want to have city council or board of supervisors, board of education, whatever it may be. Have that information looked the way it should, based on what your site looks like now. And what we want to do on this call here and their future trainings is have you know how to come in? And once I have the main meeting body built, I want to come in and build the other ones. Even if it's just to get them started but not be used, I want to have that foundation laid out. So when the time comes, it's really just a matter of, I don't want to say flipping the switch, but it's just a matter of picking up where you left off and then kind of running with that. So the more information you can put in there, the easier it will be for you later on. And you can always change it. Whatever you're putting here now is not something that you have to live with forever. You can always change anything about it. If you don't want to use the abbreviation, don't use abbreviation. If you want to pick a different meeting, take it. If you want to use a different type, pick a different meeting type. It's really just starting you out on the right foot. Okay. This is what you're going to see here on the web up here. Okay. Whatever the name of the body is is what you're going to see. This is usually going to be the body, but it doesn't have to be the body. If you remember from before, this is the archive folder. Whatever I have this labeled as is what you're going to see here. Okay. Meeting types. Very similar. Very different. Okay. Meeting type is like I said before, it's an outline. It's the agenda. It's the template, if you want to call it that. Right? Or the skeleton of the agenda. And you'll see that some of these boards have more than one type. Right? City council regular. Pretty straightforward. Right? All the outline from sections called order down to adjourn. Committee meetings, you might have that. Economic development. You can have different layouts. If you want to have a bold, underlying, capitalized, whatever it may be, this is where you do it. Okay? So when you're building a new meeting type, and again with the green folder here, click on green, we're going to say new meeting type. Okay. This is a little bit different than the meeting body. We have to first associate it with a folder. Okay? Don't know if we had one that said new. We don't. Put it in Mike's board. So any meetings that we use this board, this type for, it's going to show under the website here under Mike's board. So don't know if we have anything here. We do. Great. Which agenda template do you want to use? Usually you just have the one. Same thing with the minutes. The rest of it's just adding in the sections. Right? So this is what we're doing also for you for that first board. So if you're using city council, typically the regular session will have something like this. Call to order. Maybe even have roll call as the same section. Okay? Good for you. Do you want to have it numbered or not? It's up to you. Same price either way. Let's do pledge allegiance. And invocation. You're going to notice that you have a title field here. You also have standard text. I'll show you what that one's about in a jiffy here. A lot of times you'll have something like this, public comment or comments from the public. Right? And what you'll have is please. Limit comments. To three minutes. Less. And do not. Council board. By name. So sometimes you'll have that static language that you want to show on the agenda. We mentioned that before. With having like the public hearings and different things like that. This is where you put it. And make it a little bit smaller font. Stuff like that. And the reason why you're doing it in the different spot here is. This, this field here, the title field is getting a certain level of formatting by the agenda template. Whether it's always capitalized, always bold and underline, whatever it's going to be, whatever you put in here. Is going to get that level of formatting. So if I take this here and put it underneath there, it looks good here. But when I generate the agenda, it's all going to be the same size and it all might be bold and in things. Like that. This has its own level of formatting. It's where you separate. And sometimes, and if you do that. You can't really tell that it's in different spots, right? It's just the way it is. This allows you to kind of come in. Sometimes it's public comments. Sometimes for a consent agenda. Oops. For consent agenda. It's similar to that. Where they have like all items listed under here. Or getting the same vote for all the items. Blah, blah, blah. Just letting people know what they're kind of walking into. I see the question. I'll give me a second. I'll come back in here for that. Okay. So we have the sections here, but they're not numbered. We have to pick the numbering scheme. So the numbering scheme gives you two levels of numbers here. Level one is the sections. Level two are the items. Okay. There is no level three. There's no subsections. No sub items. No indenting at four levels deep. This is non-exception. This is peak. You have a couple of different choices to choose from. These are the numbers that will come out for you. Automatically. Okay. If you want to change it manually, you can. That's something I'll show you how to do on our third call, which I think is next Tuesday, but we can check it later. I have a question that came in. What if you have to add a special item, occasionally. Appointment of mayor pro tem. That happens a lot. So these here. Are the standards. Okay. These are the ones that you're going to use on a regular basis. When you're building a new meeting. All right. Actually, we just built one. We built the 29th. Let's do that one. Here's the agenda for the 29th and maybe for this particular meeting, we don't have any contracts and big. We want to get rid of that. Okay. Do that. But you do have appointments. Appointments. And retirements. Months. This is something that's not going to happen in January. So. We're going to add a section. Which is happening in February, right? Let's number it. So what I'm doing here is adding this section in. To this meeting. For January 29th. It will not have anything to do with February. Or March or April. If I go back, this is the planning commission regular meeting. If I go to admin. Meetings and meeting types. And I go here. Public contracts and bid you're still there. And the new section is not there. Does that answer your question? Where do I add it as an action item by the commission? So the items themselves. Would be where you're adding the information and the vote would be on the minutes. Does that make sense? The sections here are just based on letting people know what's within them. So I can send the agenda can have 10 items. New business might have three resolutions. Ordinances might have two or three items. The items that you're going to build. Which are going to be. The items that you're going to be adding. Which we'll learn about tomorrow. We'll go within a section. And then once you have the items on there. And you publish agenda. Once you go to the minutes, which is basically the meeting itself. At that point, you'll be able to take action on those items. Or not. You don't have to go to anything. But if you want to, you can, and I'll definitely show you how. Sound good. Sweet. All right. So. Excellent. Love it. Love it. Love it. So. These are the sections, right? These are the outlines. And everything like that. And just because you have it set a certain way now. Maybe we don't want this one to be always that way. Change it. Save it. So once you've had a meeting type already used or anything like that. Right. And you make a change to it here. We'll call this the backend or on the admin spot, right? When you make a change, it's going to show you this message. Okay. Changes will only be applied to the same type of current and future meetings. Right. That have no items. So if I go in and let's do this. Let's go to that planet commission. Because the one we just built before together. If I come in and add a section. Call it sample. Section. Number it. Here. And there. So that January 29th agenda. Does not have any items on it. So here it is right now. Let's do this. Okay. Let's do this and that and save it. So if I go back to the admin meetings and meeting types. And I changed this. To delete it. And save it. Okay. That January 29th agenda. It's still going to have it. Okay. This meeting has been started as an item on this. That's why it's not going to go away. Okay. Any other meetings that are in the future for planet commission. Using that type. We'll now have the same look up. Look up and feel that I have just heard there. Okay. So when you're building meetings, you know, you're going to have the items. You have all the sections are here. And you're building it the way you want. Great. If you need to make a change, you can. If you, if you find yourself having to change the outline a lot. I usually recommend don't do it here. This is just on the floor. This is a meeting by meeting thing. If you need to make a change to the outline going forward. Come under admins and meetings. And then you can go to meetings. And then you can go to meetings. And then you can go to meetings and meeting types and come into that type. And just make the change here. Once you make the change here and save it. It'll go forward for all the future meetings. Don't have any items on it. Okay. Similar to meeting bodies. You can have as many meeting types as you need. I don't want to say less is more, but when you're first starting out, you don't want to build 35 meeting types. You might eventually need to have 35 meeting types. If that's the case, good for you. But in the meantime, let's just start with the ones that you know that you're going to need. And build from there. This way, you're easy to do it. Okay. You're easy to mix and mix. You're easy to mix and mix. You're easy to mix and mix. You're easy to mix and mix. You're easy to mix and mix. You're easy to mix and mix. You're easy to mix and mix. You're easy to mix and mix. You're easy to mix and mix. You're easy to mix and mix. You're easy to mix and mix. You're easy to mix and mix. You're easy to mix and mix. You're easy to mix and mix. You're easy to mix and mix. You're easy to mix and mix. You're easy to mix and mix. You're easy to mix and mix. You're easy to mix and mix. You're easy to mix and mix. You're easy to mix and mix. a dashboard, if the agenda is not final, only certain people will be able to access it. Those being agenda coordinators and clerks, excuse me, and admin. If it's final, everyone can see it and access it, but their access might be limited. Some of these fields here might be grayed out. Okay. We're not going to let drafters publish an agenda. It doesn't work that way. That comes to the clerks and to the admins. But this is important. If you want to add something where it says revised or amended, that's great. It's only ever going to say, excuse me, this says final, right? I'm going to change it to say revised. Okay. It says revised here. If I go back to January 6th here, it'll say revised here as well. If I go back to the dashboard though, it says final. The system doesn't care if it's been finalized six different times. If you put different statuses, if it's been finalized others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others If you have any questions, don't be shy. There's a lot of stuff to take in here. A lot of information, so don't feel bad. The next thing we have is people and groups. So people and groups in the system are basically those two things. People, which are basically people in the system that have a first and last name and an email address. Some of them might be users. Some of them might not. Okay? And then you have users. Okay? We'll get into the groups in a little bit, but people will stay here for a little bit. So this list here of people is not the same thing as the users. Okay? People in the system don't necessarily need to have access to the system. So why would you not have access? Usually it's going to be the board members. Okay? Board members are not going to have access to people because there's really nothing for them to do in here. We're going to show them the agenda and let them see it, and that's good to go. Shouldn't need anything else than that. If you're going to be using iLegislate at a later time and you want your board members to use it, then they will need to have access. But don't give it to them. Don't give it to them yet. Wait until like the last minute to show them that. Okay? These people can show up in drop downs. They can be appointed to boards. That's great, but you have to have at least a name in here. So if I come in and add a new person, right? If I just show you that again, add person. First name. I'm going to put my friend Holly here. I will not use your real email address. Don't worry. All right? All I need is a first and last name and an email address. Okay? Once I do this, you can find her here. Or just go over here if I'm lazy. She's there. Here's her first and last name. Here's her email address. She's not a user. Okay? When the time comes to give somebody a user account, you click on this person here. Click on that give a login to Ron, right? And at that point, you can assign them a role. So we'll stay here for a little bit because this is important. It's got five different levels of access to the system. We'll start from the top because that's got the least and this is the one with the most. So approvals only really just means you can do just that. You can approve the item when it's your turn. And once it's not your turn, you can't do anything to it. Okay? No editing access abilities. Just look and no touch. Okay? View only, typically that's going to be for the board members if you're giving them access to iLegislate. Okay? If you're not going to use our legislative, view only will really not be necessary because those are the only things that are going to be available. Those people can just view things. They can't approve. They can't draft or edit or anything like that. Drafter is when we can start building things in the system. Have those items here they can build. They can start the items. They can add attachments. They can select the workflow. They can influence how the item gets routed and stuff like that. Okay? And put it on the agenda. This person here, agenda according to think of them as the clerk, board secretary, executive assistant, whatever term we use for the people that build our agendas, that's what you want to consider them here. They have access to the system. They have access to that. They can build agendas. They can build minutes. They can publish agendas in minutes. They can build dates. What they can't do is be an admin. I mean, they could if you make them an admin. But once you get admin access, then you get this right here and everything that comes along with it. Okay? So depending on what you want to give this person for access, click on that and click a button here, generate a login. So I'm not going to do this. This is a fake email. But I should have, let me pull one up here. Find one from one I've sent recently. Peak email. Templates. Yes. When you do that, when you send that button, that email to whoever it's going to be, they get the email, it looks just like this. Okay? Welcome to Peak Agenda Management, blah, blah, blah. Here's your domain. Here's your username. Here's a link to set your password. Here's how you log in. And here's some more information. You're a drafter in Peak. Exactly. That's awesome. What does that mean? It gives you the description of what your title does. Okay? So for the admins, they'll obviously have more. Again, the corners will be different. But still more than the drafter. Here's some documentation. Here's our help center. Okay? What's the help center? It's right there. Help center is something that's got, basically this is your support website. If you want to find anything out of background for support, come here. Click on Peak Agenda. Everything on this page, all these articles and links and stuff like that are about Peak. Nothing else. Okay? So if you're not sure what you're looking for, go to the support site. Click on Peak. I'll even, you know what? Let it recommend if you want. Type it in. There's a login in. Don't worry about that. That's for us if you want to change any content or update anything, articles and stuff like that. This is a free site. Okay? If you're not using Peak, then there's really no reason for you to be here. But if you are using Peak, a lot of good stuff here. A lot of good stuff. And it's all in bite-size articles. Some of the articles have videos. Some don't. The video is not. The video is usually two or three minutes long max. But it kind of shows you everything that you need here to do what you got to do. Okay? Very helpful. So that email that comes out, the link that you're going to get here is usually good to the end of the day. So if you send it out Friday at 5 o'clock, when you come back in on Monday, you're going to have 10 people that need to get their passwords reset because the link that comes out expires within the next day. So you want to be careful with that. That's what I'm saying. Wait. Wait until you need them in the system to send it out. Once they're in the system, if I click on Stacy here, you'll see that she's got a user profile. Okay? We put her in a certain department. You don't have to put them in the department if you want. I'll show you about that later on. The user tab here will look a little different. It's going to have their first and last name, their username, and their role. Whether it's different colors based on certain roles here, each of them do different things. Now, one thing to note, when you create a user in Peak, it is always going to generate the logs. So if you want to create a user in Peak, you can do that by just using the log in of a first name dot last. Okay? So if Rodney, if you wanted your username to be your first initial last name, I can't do it here. I can do it here. If I wanted to come in and change Betty's email or Betty's username to be B Smith, I can do that. Okay? And when I do that, ooh, that one's already taken. All right. B Smith. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. Once I do that, if I go back into Peak, and if I go back to people and users, let's check it. All right. Users. There she is. Okay? So she's in the system. I can change it there. I just can't change it in Peak. Okay? But everyone that's going to be on this call when I generate your logins today, if you haven't already gotten one, it'll have your first name, that last name. If you want to change it, you can definitely change it. If you're not sure how to change it, ask me on the next call or send an email to your project manager. They can walk you through it. Super simple. Okay? These people have user profiles here. Now, you'll notice that some of the people, when I typed in Betty, there's two of them here and there's four of them there. Like, what's up with that? Right? Typically, we're going to build people in Peak first, and then we generate the logins from here. Now, if I don't want to keep Betty here. Oh, she's on the Planet Commission. Let's see. Okay. Betty's busy. Betty's on three out of the four things here. If they're associated with a certain meeting body, you can't delete them. The people profile. I cannot delete users here. There's no way for me to do that. If I want to delete a user, I have to do it on the platform side. No way around that. Okay? People and users can get wonky. So, if you're not 100% sure, you're like, what is this guy talking about? Don't feel bad. That's a very common occurrence. More often than not, you're going to have all of your people listed in here. First and last name. Email address. When the time comes to get their profile, we're going to send that login out. And when you do that, it connects the people profile to the user profile. So, they're tied together. Okay? Group roles and group access. Group roles, if you wanted to put a specific level of access to a specific group, you could do that. It's always going to give you whatever your access is in the system, whether you're a coordinator or a drafter or an admin, whatever your highest level is, is what you're always going to be. So, if you're a drafter. And they put you into a coordinator role, you're still going to be a drafter. But you might be able to create agendas from there. But you're not going to be an admin. It's always going to give you the highest level of access to that particular group. It's not going to change your overall profile. It'll just change it for that particular group. Group access is something we usually talk about more so on our peak review call, just because this is so specific to different agencies, how they want to handle things. If you have five people on this call, maybe three of them have more than two boards, right? And they don't really have a lot of access. They don't really care because it's just they're doing both the agendas. So there's no real reason to limit access. But the other two might have 10 boards. And they might have clerks or liaisons for those boards that only should have access to those boards. That's how we do it here with the group access. So if you're ready to do that when you want to, let us know. We'll walk you through it. There is something on the Help Center with group access, very helpful documents. Let's find that for you. Because if you don't set up group access right, it will cause a lot of trouble. It will cause issues. Not like it's going to break anything or anything like that. Nothing like that. It just runs the risk of having people not see things they're supposed to or, more importantly, having them see things they're not supposed to. We don't want that. Okay? So I'm not going to get too deep into this now because if I do, I will definitely take you down the rabbit hole. I don't want to. Departments, pretty straightforward. Where is the item coming from? Oops, not here. There you go. It's A through Z, whatever you want to put here. Again, with A through Z, you put it in the right place. It's pretty nice. These are things that will show up in the dropdown. If a specific department has not been used, I can delete it. If it has been used, it will tell me how many items that are currently using it on. I have to go change that if I want to delete it. Or I can just go ahead and change it by renaming it. Creating a new one is as simple as coming in and creating a, let's see, bakeware department. I'm not sure why I went there, but okay. Boom. And now we have a new department. As soon as I put the department here, I can come in here. There she is. If I go to create a new item, that department is also there for me to use. Okay. Very cool. What else? Departments. So you can have as many of these as you want. Typically, we'll build five. We usually ask you for five on that questionnaire. Some places have a small user database. They don't even have five. It's just the three of us from the one department. Okay. If you're not looking, if it's not helpful for you to have these here for searching and sorting, don't overcomplicate it. Departments is not a required field. So if you want to use it, great. If not, also great. All right. The next thing is agenda items. Anybody have a question on people and groups? Okay. Agenda items. So item types. We talked about that before. Think of it as a category. Okay. What is this item doing for us? Is it an agreement? A bid? A bond? A budget? A purchase? Resolution? Ordinance? Whatever you want to do. Now, item type is required. Every item that you build in PEEQ will have an item type. It's helpful to have it be specific. I usually add minutes to your types, to your sites, just because everyone does minutes. And if you want to do a report at the end of the year, all the minutes from 2022, it's easy to have that for the item type. Okay? Adding a new record here is something as simple as this. Contracts. Housing. Department. Just because contracts doesn't have to be a catch-all, we already have contracts, but now we have another one. So it's not like a subcommittee like we talked about before, but it is available to be used in a different way. Okay? As many of these as you want, you can have the same thing with the people and groups or the departments, stuff like that. Very cool. Item items. IDs. This ID is internal. It goes nowhere. It's not going to show up out here on your documents. It's just internal. So now the prefix and the suffix are changeable and able to be edited or not used. If you don't want to use it, you can delete it. Right? Or if you want to have the suffix, not the suffix, if you want to have the year as a prefix, you can do that. Typically the number will start at one. And then if you want, usually what we'll do is at the end of the year when you're starting the items for next year, we'll come back in and change the year to be 2023. And you'll change the number back to one. Okay? The thing about this as far as limitations go, I'm going to just get out of here because I want to. Okay. You get one batch of numbers for the whole system. So if you are using resolution numbers or ordinance numbers and things like that, this is not going to be the way to do it. You'll have to basically add the number to the item title. Or we can talk about custom fields. But I do see there's a question there. So I want to jump into there. Only the administrator can add item types. Is that correct? That is correct. So only people that can see this can add it. And the only people that can see it have that. Great question. Item fields. Absolutely. You are welcome. Thank you. So when you're building an item in peak, typically you're going to have these fields. It's going to show you the item title, the suggested action, item type. We just talked about that. The submitting department, the meeting body, the meeting date, the sections, the drafter, and the ID. Those are all a part of every item. I can't take those out. I can't rearrange them. I can't rename them. They're there for whatever you need. You know? Underneath that, you can have as many of these custom fields as you want. So if you need to add more information than what the standard item comes with, this is where you add it. And when you're adding it here, you can edit a couple different ways. We can add a text field. Yep. I can come back to that in a second. The text field basically is just going to give you a line of text. You can type in it. There's no formatting available. But that is pretty straightforward. Date picker allows you to put a date range there. You can pick the calendar. Pick a date. Meeting body dropdown. Sometimes items will start. And we mentioned before the subcommittees. Right? So if you want to show like a meeting history, you can pull that here. Department dropdown, similar. If you want to have where the item came from and now where it's going, you can kind of have a to and a from part there. People dropdown. So the people dropdown will show you a listing of all the people, not the users. Big difference. So I'm going to show you this list here. Not the users. What else? Another one. Custom radio button. If you have a yes or no question, is this budget impacted or fiscally, you know, whatever it is, but boom, yes or no question, you can do that. Was it approved by the certain parties? Yes or no. Custom dropdown. This is probably my favorite. Because it's going to give you the option to create a text here. Give it a little placeholder language. Please select one of the following. And then put your options in. So you can put fiscal goals. I think we have that as one here. So you have each of these different goals. And if you want to come back in and do more, and this is not me, I'm not into gardening at all. But if you want to do that, you can add these fields in and add them on the fly. You have access to all of these here. Okay. I think there's two more there. Let me check it. Okay. So this is going to give you the most options for your customization, the most bang for your buck, if you will. It allows you to change the font, which we don't want you to do. But it allows you to make it bold, italicized, underlined, bullet points and stuff like that. Once you have these fields here, this is kind of your master list of fields. Okay. When you're building items, typically you're going to have just one. It's going to say agenda item or default. Pretty much straightforward. If you wanted to have different types of items, there's a lot of options. You can have different templates that maybe for resolutions and ordinances, we need the formal number field, but we don't need the estimated time field. This is what you can have. And this is what you might have. So depending on what you want to have here, and you're not going to need to have this many, this is just a test site we're just practicing. But this is kind of that. So if I click on, let's do this. Agenda item. We got a couple of fields there. But if I click on resolutions and ordinances. Okay. I'm going to have a few more fields. Right. So instead of it making it where there's one item template, that's got all 35 fields and you have to go through each of them. Now you can pick the one or the two or the five. That you think you'll need. And then it'll, it'll go through that. So I had a question that came in while I was jumping in. This is, can I explain the benefits of having an item ID? So I don't know that there's actually a benefit. It's required. You have to have the number there. The main thing that this does is allows you later on. To search. So this is 2022. We've built a bunch of items since the year started. Once we get back to like one, it should bring us to 2021 here. 2021 different ones are here. So it's internal. It's a tracking number. That's really it. When you're building your items, you'll have to have that number there. I'll show you how to pick one. Once you create the item and save it, it gives it a number. That number lives with the item. And then you can add a new item. And then you can add a new item. Doesn't go anywhere. Got it. Great question. So keep them coming. Keep it coming. It's very lively group. I appreciate it. So item approvals is something we'll talk about tomorrow. There's no real reason to go into it today. Cause we're not going to build items today. Item templates are basically what you're going to have the ability to create. So it's template level four. We had a question of Ken. Only the admins create item types. That's correct. Only admins can create item templates as well. So when your users are coming in. To build items for their agenda. You can use others to build others to build others to build others to to build others to build others to build others to build others to build others to build others to build others to build others to build others to build others to build others to build others to build others to build others to build others to build others to build others to build others to build others to build others to that's fine. They're all using the same template as far as the cover page on the back end, but you just have the ability to have a different look and feel. Okay. I'm sorry. So if you want to create a new one, just give it, let's just say a test item on 1.18. Okay. So we'll make it active, which means it'll appear on the dropdown. We're not going to make a default. There should only be one default. That's the one that you'll see right there on the cover page. We should just have the one. Okay. So the stuff down below, the item title is always required. I can't do anything about it. Suggested action is not required. If you want to make it required, click that button. Okay. Item types required. Department's not required. Of all the fields that are not required, that's the one that I usually recommend. Not to not tell you, but recommend making required. Because it's easy for searching later on. It helps later on, right? Draft if you want. I don't recommend making meeting date and section required because it's going to have you have a hard time having items that are not scheduled. Because if you're building an item today for a meeting in March, but that date hasn't been established yet, there's no way to do that. You'll have to have it on some meeting date, you know? So once I click save at this point now, if I wanted to go to 2021, that's really not really helpful anymore. Maybe I just want to have this particular field and that's it. Okay. I don't need the other 26 of them. I just need that one here. So when I come in here and pick this, it just shows me that, okay? All the other ones are there. If I decide, you know, I just built that one here now, do we really need that? We probably don't. Let me go back. I'm going to delete it. Hasn't been used. There's nothing, there's nothing really holding us to that. But the other ones, you want to be careful. You don't want to just delete things. You can make them inactive. If I don't want to have this one here active anymore, I just make it inactive. All that does is it hides it from here. Now we have six item templates instead of seven. So you can do that. Minutes, we'll talk about that more on the fourth session. Just because the minute session of all four will take by far the least amount of time, I'd like to have something to go with you there. Templates, we'll talk about that. Take about two seconds here. This is something you'll never have access to. Okay, the templates, when you log into your site, you will not see templates. You'll see minutes and configuration. This is just for people that have Granicus logins here. This is your agenda template, your cover page template. There's coding in here that if you make a mistake or change something, it's going to mess up your whole document. We don't want you to do that, so we don't give it to you. We mentioned before one of the questions came up, like if you wanted to have some specific language nestled in your template, like a footer or something like that, we can do that. We can put language in there, hardcoded and stuff like that. If you want to have something up top with the open meetings notice, something like that, or if it's a Zoom thing, that you just want to have a little information there, you can do that. That'll be helpful. We can have it here for you. You couldn't change it, and that's why we try to keep as much of that control to us on the back end. But if there's something that you want to have access to, we try to build it into here, so in the description field, so you can see it and you can change it and stuff like that. Okay. So the last piece of the puzzle is configuration. This is just basically the information. Nothing too fancy. Settings is important. So let me close this out. So these settings, and we'll see this many more times, so don't feel like you have to take notes or memorize by tomorrow. I don't expect that. These settings here are global. So whether it's for council or planning, it's for both. There's no way to make the specific settings. There's no way to make the settings specific. It's not specific to one board. It doesn't work that way. Okay. It's one size fits all. It's important that you like them because if you don't, then we got to change. So the first batch of questions here pertain to the agenda packet and the agenda packet only. So do you want to include cover pages on the agenda packets by default? What does that mean? When I come into the agenda and I go to download the agenda packet, it's already having that part checked off for me, and the packet will include the cover pages, which are basically the same, the transmittal forms or the summary requests. Do you want to have page numbers on the agenda packet? Page numbers will only ever be on the bottom right. If you want them in the middle or in the top left-hand corner, turn them off because there's nothing we can do, but something with the limitations of the system, it'll only ever be bottom right corner. How do you want your agenda packet items, excuse me, the attachments to look in the bookmarks? So right now I have it set to show the item number and the attachment name. So if I go to the agenda out here, let's check to see if we have anything here that I can show you. This one's not good. Let's check that. So it shows item three, a copy of award certificate. It's good. So it just shows you whatever you're naming it. That's what's going to show. Okay. Whatever the blue market, that's the attachments. That's what's going to show on your agenda. The other options you have are the ID number, which I never recommend showing because the citizens don't know what that is. Then if it's not in order, they're going to wonder why you're numbering things out of order. So I don't recommend that. And if you don't want to have the item number, if you want to just have the attachment name, what would happen not so much here, it would just say item seven, a cover page, and it would just say draft minutes. So the attachments would not have the number there. It would just have the attachment name. I usually recommend the second one because it kind of keeps everything in the same order, but that's up to you. The second set of questions are, are the same, but it's really for the item packet. So what's the item packet? Item packet is basically if you're in the actual item itself and you want to download it. So it'll show you the cover page. Plus it'll have all the attachments listed individually right after that. Same batch of questions. Publish item cover pages to iLegislate. So this is something we'll talk about more on the third call, which is next week, the agenda session. iLegislate is an app. You can download it. It's free. It's included in your purchase price. If you use it, great. If you don't use it, you don't get any money back. It's included, right? So you can download it on a Windows computer, a Mac, or an iPad. You need to have a login. You need to have a password, and you need to be in one of the user groups to have access to iLegislate. But once you do, do you want to give them the cover pages? If you're putting the cover pages out there for the web, for the public, you typically want to give it to the board members as well because they're not expecting to see less. They're expecting to see more. And enhance user group security. So this really comes into play with the group access. If you want to lock it down to the point where somebody from this group only has access to these meeting bodies and that meeting type, you can do that. It will literally hide the agenda items, agendas and items of meeting bodies and meeting types for the users that are not assigned. So what would happen, we were using Betty before, right? If we made Betty a coordinator, but we said, listen, Betty's in this group, and she's only able to access this group. We can't access the planning commission documents, planning commission and all the meeting types that come with it. Okay, great. If I logged in as Betty and I'm a coordinator, when I go to create a new meeting, it's only going to give me the option in the dropdown to see planning commission. It will not give me anything else. Similar respect, if I come in as Betty and I go to create a new item, it will only give me the option in the meeting body dropdown to see planning commission and the dates that go along with it. So you can get that granular. If you're trying to have somebody be a drafter for one group and a coordinator for the other group, that's not going to work. Coordinators have the higher level of access. It's always going to supersede. So you can't put them in that kind of box. So you want to be careful with that. If you wanted to maintain two IDs, you can do that. I just don't recommend it. It's two levels, two usernames, two passwords, just more problems. If you want your drafters to be able to see the draft agendas, you can turn this on. I'm not a big fan of that, but it's not my opinion. It's up to you. The rich text editor fields, we have this set by design. Whatever font you chose out of the ones we have are the ones you can pick. We don't want you to get into the habit of... changing this every meeting type or every meeting body here, I mean meeting date, excuse me, because now your documents are going to be messy because the template's using a certain font also. And you don't want to have three different fonts on the agenda, unless you do, which case then you're in the right spot. This one here we'll talk about tomorrow because it's really more important for the items that are being reviewed. Override agenda item deadline. So who can override... Who can override the agenda item deadline? So what that is, is under the... deadline here. Who can bypass the deadline? Obviously admins can always do that and so can coordinators, but you can have the ability, if you choose, to have even people with less permission to do that. So if you make a drafter owner and above, there's really no reason to bother creating a deadline because they're going to be able to bypass anyway. So what's the point? The whole point is, if you're trying to get your items in a timely fashion or, you know, correct a pain point that you have, to do that. I never recommend using drafter owner and above, but that is your choice. Sorry, just taking a sip. Add new workflow. We'll talk about that tomorrow. Enable minutes. If you're using peak for the minutes, we have to turn it on. Sounds silly, but it's true. Enable template builder. All of you have template builder turned on and it doesn't matter if you're not going to see it. So don't worry about it. If you want to publish documents in HTML, you can do that as well. It's only going to show your agenda in HTML. It's only going to show your agenda in HTML. It will not have the ability to put the packet in HTML. The packet will always be PDF. Okay. Reporting as well. Enable rich text fields here. So that really comes into play on the bottom, right? Oh, maybe not that bottom. So if we don't have the rich text turned on, these fields here will not have this stuff here. No format or table or tools. It's basically a text field with more content. penalties that you can control stuff, you know, not common. Most places do not use that. The main benefit of that is to, to have people just put things in, in the right way. If you have people that are copying and pasting all the time, and it's always making your document look more spacey or something like that, the rich text editor is probably the reason why, because you're not pasting it, right? So you want to just show them, do it that way you can. I don't recommend turning this off. It just makes everything easier, but you know, sometimes it's a little gross. growing pains. The last thing is email agenda coordinators when a new agenda item is added. So this is not going to impact admins at all. It'll only impact these guys, coordinators. So the only thing negative about that is if you have 10 bodies and 12 coordinators and one meeting body is pumping out items for the day, all the coordinators get the emails, not just the ones for that board. It's a one size fits all thing, as are all settings. I don't recommend you have this turned on if that's the case, unless you don't mind getting emails all the time that new items are coming out. Drafters will not get emails. Admins won't get emails or anything like that. It's just the coordinators. So if you want to say, how do I find out how many items are there? Go to the dashboard. How many items are here? Go to the items tab, pick the meeting body that you want to look for, and find the date. This is all from last year. It's not really helping. But if I wanted to pick planning commission, I wanted to pick all the dates from 2022. Nothing there yet. I didn't put anything there. But this way you can see that. It's just easier that way. Like I said, these settings are all set a certain way to start out of the box as a default. But these are things you can change. You're seeing it with me now on my site. And it might look different for you later today or tomorrow when you go to log into your site. There's no right or wrong way to do it. You can do it on your own. You can do it on your own. You can do it on your own. It's just a way to do it is whatever works best for you. And that's one of the nice things about peak is it doesn't make you choose yes or no. It's a maybe we'll do this way. Maybe we'll do it that way. And you can try it this way now. And then when you're done, or after making some changes, you can always go back in and do some tweaks. So I'm going to go ahead and pause. I'm going to stop recording now.
