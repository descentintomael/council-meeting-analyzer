Councilmember O'Brien. Here. Councilmember Tandon. Here. Vice Mayor Reynolds. Here. Mayor Coolidge. Virtually present. All right. So we will start with public participation note. So due to the recent universal masking indoor mandate issued by the California Department of Public Health and to protect the health of its citizens tonight's council meeting is being held obviously virtually via Zoom. The public is invited to participate just like they would in a regular council meeting either by logging in on their computer using the link on the city's website or to call in with the toll-free number which was listed. The public was also encouraged to submit comments via Engage Chico until 4 30 which council members have a copy of and then channel 11 viewers we also made sure there was a note put up with the Zoom information so they could in fact either call in or log in online and watch the meeting that way. So if you're wishing to address any items on the agenda please note that you'll need to raise your hand when that item is being discussed. So you obviously don't need to fill out anything in advance but if you want to speak on a particular topic just go ahead and raise your hand prior to that topic being discussed and then as soon as we call for public comment we will take each speaker in the order received. So when it's your turn to speak you'll be granted permission to unmute yourself once your time is up. You'll be muted so that the next speaker can address the council. If you're using the phone to call in you actually press star 9 to raise your hand and lower your hand and then star 6 to unmute yourself. So once again if you're released to the public if you're released to the public if you're that's star nine to raise your hand and lower it and star six to unmute yourself and mute yourself and i think that works for mute and unmuting um and then if i can ask the clerk in terms of the timer for the three minutes or two minutes or whatever end of the speakers have how will we note their time we believe we'll be able to share a screen that will show the amount of time that they have bearing if that does not work then we will be timing them here and we'll let them know when we get close to the 32nd yellow light and we'll let them know when their time is up all right thank you very much so um we'll start with the consent agenda all the matters listed under the consent agenda would be considered routine and can be enacted in one motion do we have any speakers on the consent agenda if so please raise your hands now and while we're doing that do we have any council disqualifications or no votes on any items of the agenda all right madam clerk do we have any speakers i am checking right now i do not see any on consent okay so we'd entertain a motion on the consent agenda hope to approve i'll second that all right we have a motion a second uh madam clerk to take the role council member bennett yes council member brown aye council member morgan yes council member o'brien yes council member tandon yes vice mayor reynolds aye mayor coolidge aye the consent agenda as read carried 7-0 all right and then business from the floor item three members of the public may address the council at this time on any matter not already listed on the agenda with comments being limited uh to three minutes released or invited mayor based on the number of speakers the council cannot take any action at this meeting on requests made under this section of the agenda and if you want to speak on business from the floor please raise your hand now on zoom in a no public comments we ask that they're limited to if they're in regards to personal members of either staff or the council that they'd be limited to their actions and not personal in nature and how many speakers do we have on business from before right now we have four um trying to see if there are any others so at this point um with the four would you give them three minutes yes ma'am okay so jessica giannola is our first speaker and if you can just a second we'll hopefully unmute you or give you the opportunity to unmute yourself there it is okay i got it can you hear me yes we can hear you thank you go ahead okay um umğiniğini Okay, so moving online, it brings a bit of anxiety, as you can see here. But previously when we had to do shutdowns, I feel like our trust was violated from the public. We've seen a mayor, the previous mayor, steal another mayor's position. And someone from another city was placed in our council seat. And we've seen Brown Act violations and bad decisions that's led to litigation. So all those things happen during these kind of scenarios where we were shut out of the chambers. So I'm hoping that this shutdown is brief and that we're back in chambers. And then along those same lines, I want to keep repeating this request that we move forward with a permanent policy where people can join in on Zoom for the people who are at home and not able to come typically. And then when they do come, when they are in. At present, that they're given an opportunity to speak, even if they're a minute late tending in a card. That that citizen's voice should be honored. And that's a decision that's been made by by you as a whole and can be changed by you as a whole. So I'm hoping that we can make changes so we can have the whole city, whoever wants to participate. I'd also to our housing crisis. It's raining again. We'll see continued flooding. It's not going to stop. I think we're in for a wet winter this year, which is good for water, but bad for people who are living in the elements. And it's really, really cold this year for people who are out of command. She'd be nice if we can get something raised up since they seem to be stuck there for some time. Some pallets or something to get them out of the water. I want to also continue to encourage you as council and our city staff involved. To consider whatever options we have available. For affordable housing. I know later there's something with housing, but I'm specifically speaking of affordable where people with no income. Can still find somewhere to live. And I haven't seen anything discussed or proposed to be on an agenda at any future day. And I think, well, I know, I know that we absolutely need to do that as a city. We need to figure out how are we going to turn our crisis around? Because if we don't. Do not act on figuring out. Some sort of housing situation, permanent housing, not just shelters for people with no income. We're going to always have this crisis going on. And it impacts everybody. And the numbers are increasing because our. Our poverty levels are increasing because our economics are just tanking with everything that's happening. So I'm hoping that. I see. We see more effort from. The city. As a whole. And I want to thank you. Okay. There was no warning. Oh, there's a timer on screen. Actually. So if you can't see the timer on the screen. Unless you're calling in, of course. And then if you're calling in just let us know. If, and in fact, you can scroll through the participants, they should be able to see it. Correct. Yes. Yeah. And then our next speaker is Nicole Nava. Okay. So we're going to wrap up the workshop. And we're going to wrap up the workshop. So we're going to wrap up the workshop. So we're going to wrap up the workshop. So we're going to wrap up the workshop. So we're going to wrap up the workshop. So we're going to wrap up the workshop. So we're going to wrap up the workshop. So we're going to wrap up the workshop. So we're going to wrap up the workshop. So we're going to wrap up the workshop. So we're going to wrap up the workshop. We can. Okay. So good evening first. So I wanted to note that I sent an email about the distressful situation I saw around Chico. I was, as I noted at a prior meeting, personally harassed when I went downtown in front of council chambers by the transients that are squatting there. I had food and other debris, trash thrown at me, which I did not appreciate. And literally had it hit me, I would have acted legally to do something about it. So it is imperative that we get our city safe and clean again. And I want to pivot and suggest that the city attorney start to think more broadly about things. We keep hearing that we're going to have solutions. And the problem is, those of us taxpayers pretty much know what that means. For those of us that are pro accountability and think there should be some kind of social contract and others that we're going to be on the hook for it yet again. And the solution being likely the BMX track, but the sun, the moon, the stars and other things that will go along with that, maybe not even just that site. And I don't think that that will end up solving anything because it does not involve the person having to accept treatment, which is, I think, And I think that that is the way through and forward. So the pivot to me is, what can we do to do some kind of counter suit by the city to say the citizens are experiencing a public health hazard and a danger to our lives on a daily basis. So after I sent that letter, what happened the very next day or a few days after I believe was that a transient grabbed the hand of a three year old child that was at the skating rink and attempted to run away. And the released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released feedback that they don't feel safe. In addition to that, there were multiple flashing of gun incidents where people did end up getting arrested. So it's not like there wasn't anything to it. I am appalled and I feel like the citizens all deserve protection, not just a certain sect of citizens. And I feel like protecting them means sometimes calling what's best for them, which is not continuing languishing in a drug lifestyle or in a situation of unstable mental health where appropriate treatment via counseling and prescribed medications is not occurring in a stable setting. Instead, what we're doing is we are catering to people who prefer to live in unhealthy lifestyles. And it is not right. It is not just. And there are numerous examples of why this won't work that have happened. Already over the past couple of weeks. So I implore you to think about things differently and not just move ahead and act to put the financial onus on everyone that isn't even tied to mandated types of treatment and real solutions for these individuals on the street. Yes, there is weather and there are solutions. There was an announcement, there's shelter beds and the warming shelters. Thank you. Thank you. Our next speaker is Katie Posey. And we'll allow them to unmute and then we'll start the timer once I begin speaking. So Katie Posey. Yes. Okay. Good evening, council members. I hope you're having a wonderful evening so far. I'd like to ask you to reconsider your decision to close the chambers for the next January meeting. As you may know, some were disappointed the council chose to go into a virtual format only for this meeting. After all, you could have kept the in person option open and added the call and comment option for those who do not wish to attend. Yes. Board of Supervisors has always had this option. I think it's very helpful. The fact is that the Governor's application of his mask mandate to every county in the state is frankly a logical and unscientific. If we were to look closely at our local data. You may be released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released aware that Butte County has been experiencing a downtrend in cases and hospitalizations. I don't know if you have time to look at the handy COVID dashboard, but I just want to share a few things. On September 23rd, for example, when the council was still meeting in person, there were 153 hospitalized. Today, there are only 25. The last time I checked, there were zero in the ICU. I understand many are afraid of this new variant, but making decisions based on new variants of COVID doesn't seem to be a good idea in many ways. We've observed officials at both the state and federal level implement policies that are detrimental to communities. You all have strong critical thinking skills and the ability to discern what is happening. Let's avoid the kind of government overreach that Newsom appears to enjoy. The government does not need to manage my health or protect me. That's my job. If people are truly afraid and they wish to be in person at the council meeting, they can always wear a hazmat suit. Surely, they're sold somewhere. If we're going to be in a Twilight Zone episode, to be honest, can we at least have in-person meetings in the chambers? Board of Supervisors continues to meet in person. You might have seen they're having a meeting tomorrow with masks and face shields, of course. The same thing for the Chico School Board. I understand every community is different, and I'm sure you're doing the best you can. I just want to point to the Roseville City Council, however, to illustrate that not every city council is shutting down and going to virtual only. So, they have a population of about 100. 35,000. Their county case count is higher than ours. They had their meeting on December 15th. The people in the audience were masked. Some of the council were not. You can see the video. It's probably not high on your priority list to watch the city council meeting videos from other cities, but that is there if you are interested. In conclusion, I just want to encourage you to consider the importance of keeping the chambers open for council meetings. Again, you could have virtual option. The people don't want to miss out on the excitement of there in person, addressing the council in person, and observing the process of doing the valuable work we elected you to do. Thank you. Thank you. And our last speaker is Davey. And as soon as Davey has received permission to unmute, we will begin the timer once we hear from him. So Davey is our last speaker. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. I'm Davey Andrick. I thank you all so much for the compromise and the caring in this time, the safety that we're finding in this virtual option and our communication through technology. You know, overall, you know, I want to applaud our community and I care about our community. I feel that all of our community members have valid concerns and I applaud the housing ideals coming about because I see that the streets, you know, I hope to see safety on the streets and I hope that people feel safety on the streets. I regard that, you know, there's valid points from every view. This is a very important issue. Thank you. That's how I feel. And that and that, you know, people are hurt in a lot of ways. People are scared. I don't want to see mom scared on the street. You know, however, I also care about the people that are underserved in our communities. I've been educated a bit within recovery elements in Los Angeles a little while back. And I recall that recovery groups, support groups help people empower each other. And it seems to me that with these housing options, I'm hoping, I'm hoping, I'm hoping and I'm and I'm pleading that that recovery support groups are implemented very, very quickly and applied. I'm not sure how that's going about. However, what I'd like to ask is that is that these are implemented. I try to share these myself. So I try to walk the walk. And, you know, within my technology resources, I share them around about and, you know, through through through different areas. And I believe that it can empower people. And hopefully help the streets and help some safety. I really am. I really am thankful. I also do. I want to applaud, too, with the safety aspect is that I feel that the streets are safer because there's less traffic on the roads. Therefore, less traffic demise and less traffic accidents. Therefore, the police can have their time, you know, to to to be safer, to offer more safety and other ways as well. You know, so I'm very thankful. I don't have to take all the time. I just want to applaud you all again for this compromise. I thank you also very much. I appreciate you all. I'll mute myself. Thank you. Thank you. That's our last speaker, correct? Yes, that is correct. OK. All right. We will move on. No public hearings on this particular agenda. And we'll move on with the regular agenda item 5.1. This item was actually removed from the agenda at the request of the applicant and will be brought back at a later date. So and. Madam Clerk. We can take down the clock or at least. Yes. Can we take the clock down? Yeah. Perfect. Thank you. Appreciate that. All right. And then so we'll move on to item 5.2, which is a resolution approving the boundary boundary line modification 21 0 5 and authorizing the city manager to enter real property exchange with Norfolk, etc. We have a report, I believe, from Madison Driscoll. Is that correct? Yes. Yes. All right. When you're ready. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. This is a requested boundary line modification to adjust the shared property line between three parcels, one owned by the city being part of the little Chico Creek Greenway and two privately owned. These parcels are located south of Humboldt Road between Notre Dame Boulevard and Bruce Road. The boundary line modification modification will fluctuate the property covenants provision of the approved Merriam Park North. subdivision and Merriam Park development agreement. With the new configuration, a total of one of just over an acre would be added to the city owned parcel. The land transfer would allow for an adjustment to the little Chico Creek Greenway boundary to include existing oak trees and a bike path access to allow for long term maintenance access to an existing sewer main. On November 18th, 2021, the map advisory committee recommended that the city. Council approved the boundary line modification. The map advisory committee and the community development record director recommend that the city council adopt the resolution. approving the boundary line modification authorizing the city manager to enter into a real property exchange with MP North Fork LLC and MP bungalow commons LLC and execute all related documents. And that's all for me if you have any questions I'm more than happy to answer. Right any questions from Council. Councilmember Cecilia Taylor. Very quick question, this is Alex. This wouldn't restrict the city's ability to develop the land and in the future in any way right. Yes, correct, so this is part of the open space, so there is no development votes for this for the city on parcel, thank you. All right, any other questions from Council. All right, do we have any speakers on this item. We do not have any hands raised at this time. All right, entertain a motion. Move to approve. Second. I have a motion by Council member Morgan a second by Council member Tandon. Madam Clerk, if you can take the role. Council member Bennett. Yes. Council member Brown. Aye. Council member Morgan. Yes. Council member O'Brien. Yes. Council member Tandon. Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds. Yes. Mayor Coolidge. Aye. Carries 7-0. All right, item 5.3 Chigo commercial cannabis policy manufacturing distribution lab testing retailer delivery only retailer storefronts and I believe we have a report from City Attorney Ewing on this matter. So, let's start there and go from there. Thank you, Mayor Coolidge. Honorable members of the Council. I'm Vincent Ewing, the City Attorney. At your meeting of December 7th, you directed me to analyze the City of Chico's existing commercial cannabis policy and make recommendations regarding potentially expanding retail storefront commercial cannabis operations to include manufacturing distribution lab testing and retail delivery only and bring back the item 4-D. That item is before you now for discussion. Based on the staff report that you have before you, I recommend that the Council use your legislative power to, per the municipal code, to direct staff to solicit applications for the operation of either one or more commercial cannabis activities, including manufacturing distribution lab testing retail delivery only. That concludes my report. All right. Any questions for Mr. Ewing? So I have one of Mr. Morgan, do you have a question? No, go ahead, Mayor. All right. So Mr. Ewing, so we could open this up for a time period just to allow people on various aspects because my understanding is as if in fact we opened it up and started going through a process, we'd actually have to revisit the entire ordinance, correct? You do not need to amend the ordinance. There's no time restriction set forth in the ordinance. So you have the legislative power to direct staff to bring back an item for adoption based on whatever your direction is today. Okay. So if we were to establish a couple of week period, would that be something that we'd need to bring back immediately or would it be something that we need to bring back the next council meeting? Can we do it at this council meeting? What's your thoughts there? My recommendation is that you direct staff to bring back an item at the next council meeting or a future council meeting to permit the activity that the council so desires based on the discussion that you're going to have today. And again, I stress that the municipal code contains no time limitations on the council's decision about what it wants to do with commercial cannabis activities. Okay. Perfect. Thank you. Any further questions for Mr. Ewing? Just a question for clarification. Mr. Ewing, is what you're saying that if the direction is different than what's currently written into the policy that we would request staff bring something back or is that going to be required either way? No. So if the direction differed from the policy, then I would recommend and bring back an amendment to the policy. Okay. So the policy as written gives the council the authority and the power to do whatever it wants to do pursuant to the policy as described. Again, that pertains to the specific areas of manufacturing, distribution, lab testing, retail delivery only. So that's what the statute or the ordinance covers. So just hypothetically speaking, if the direction tonight were to reopen the application process as dictated by policy for the policy. So if the released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released do. Hypothetically, the council directs staff to do XYZ. Staff comes back with a report saying honorable members of the council, we did XYZ as directed by you pursuant to the policy. Thank you. Okay. Any further questions by council? All right. Not seeing anybody. All right. How many speakers do we have on this item? We have three speakers. All right. Let's do three minutes. Okay. Our first speaker is Nicole Nava. And as soon as she's granted permission to speak and unmute. Can you hear me? Yes, we can hear you. Excellent. I don't see a counter yet. But I will begin. So I am a little bit confused. I understand the code that you're referencing. However, when this item first came before us, my understanding is that the code is not the same as the one that was used in the first item. So the first thing we released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released And then it says delivery only. So what are we doing? What are, why are we getting into drug business? This is not what I think is prudent and good for our community, especially given through everything we're going through. The ship really sailed on you deciding to do the commercial sale, but people already could take delivery. Now they're going to be able to sell, but now you're saying you actually want to bring even more of the type of activity that brings crime. You already have had incidents where folks have been involved in murder when it comes to pot in local areas. And now. We're going to do manufacturing distribution, all of that. And I'm really concerned about this community. I just do not think this is wise. I don't think you should do something just because your perception is that it will be a cash cow. There have been articles that have been provided to you about effects on pot on the brains of the youth and things that are very concerning. Statistically. So. People like to do the evidence-based thing. It is extremely concerning. And then the levels of certain chemicals in pot is a lot different story than it was back in the day. So I just, I'm really sad that it feels like we're, we're just totally defaulting to bottom denominator behavior because either we might make some money off of it or that we're catering to people who are drug addicted. And mentally challenged. That seems to be the way that we're going. So I think you need to take a big pause. And think about these decisions that are shaping the future of our city. And we put all of you there to take care of our city and make it a premier place to live, not necessarily the premier place to get high. So I'll close with that. Thank you. Our next speaker is crystal. And as soon as she's. Granted permission to unmute. Okay. We will start the timer. Crystal. Okay. Can you hear me? Yes. Go ahead. Good evening, council. This is crystal. KC. CEO of golden state or Chico resident. 15 years. And released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released market, manufacturers, traditional market, delivery services, traditional market, indoor cultivation facilities that all exist here in Chico. And I do believe that we're going to be bringing new activity to Chico. We're just going to be regulating the activity that already exists. And I think that is a responsible thing for a municipality of 100,000 plus people to do. And the city assumes the costs of this illegal activity. And so it would be a great opportunity for the city to actually have some revenue and not just... And so it would be a great opportunity for the city to actually have some revenue and And so it would be a great opportunity for the city to actually have some revenue and And so it would be a great opportunity for the city to actually have some revenue and not just... And so it would be a great opportunity for the city to actually have some revenue and And so it would be a great opportunity for the city to actually have some revenue and not just... And so it would be a great opportunity for the city to actually have some revenue and not just... And so it would be a great opportunity for the city to actually have some revenue and not just... And so it would be a great opportunity for the city to actually have some revenue and not just... And so it would be a great opportunity for the city to actually have some revenue and not just... He will be unmuted in just a second. Hey, Council, can you hear me? Yes, we can hear you. Hey, good evening. I really appreciate the time that you guys have allotted for us to address this item again. Unlike a lot of other speakers so far, I just want to show my appreciation for you and staff dealing with this mandates with the pandemic and stuff and still allowing us to be involved. I think it's commendable. So I appreciate it. Just as far as this topic, I think you guys are really like headed down the right road. I know it's a complex industry and uncomfortable for a lot of people to wrap their head around. The regulation and oversight that's within this industry, that will be inflicted on all the different licenses is substantial. You know, the idea that this is bringing crime into these cities is unrealistic at this point. This industry is flourishing not only here, but all over the nation. So it would be it would be a miss if we didn't take the opportunity to capitalize on the growing industry within Chico, because like one of your last speakers said, a lot of these activities are currently happening, at least giving individuals the opportunity to get legal, do the right thing and then help help also regulate the legal industry and the illegal industry within within Chico would be would be the smart thing to do. So I just appreciate it. I hope you guys have a happy holiday and thank you for your time. All right. Is that the last speaker? Yes. Okay. All right. All right. Do we have any? Actually, if Council would allow me, I'd like to ask a clarification question of either Mr. Ewing or I believe we have Mrs. Dilligan on as well. So and that's really the understanding of where we stand with delivery currently versus where we will once our dispensary is open. And do we have maybe Miss Dilligan answer that question best? I'm not sure Mr. Orme. And he is not in the meeting. I don't know why. She is not. I mean, Mr. Orme has shown up. And her last name is Dillig. Yeah. Did I answer Dillig? Yeah. Well, I'm sorry. Long day. Mr. Orme, maybe you can take that one. On on delivery? Yeah. Delivery now versus when we have dispensaries open. Okay. So I'm just wondering if you have any thoughts on that or how that will change or if there is any change there? Well, as far as I can recall, and I'd have to go back and take a look at it. Angie's been managing this and I know she would have an answer right now. But the bottom line is, as it currently exists, there are going to be three retail permits granted. And I know that in prior discussion there is a a consideration given those who had storefronts potentially could also distribute. But I don't know if that final determination had been made as of yet. But I believe that that was the intent of Council. And it looks like Council Member Morgan may have good recollection of that conversation. So, Andrew, I'm just waiting for you to nod because I don't want to speak. Yeah. Why don't you go ahead, Sean? So what we had done, approving what we approved last time, we approved up to three retail sites with delivery by. Those sites, no outside delivery, no anything. So I don't know where this conversation is headed, but listening to Mr. Ewing, we're talking about potential distribution, manufacturing, lab testing and retail delivery only, which would let more than the three up to three retail sites with delivery that we think we're going to approve at this point. And I was throw this out there for anybody that thinks. They might make a motion. I will not get behind any more retail. I only approved the last one. The camel's nose is under the tent. We limited to three with a lot of constraints, which was great. I think I've gone on record plainly being the most anti cannabis person on council. It is what it is. We've got retail. We have delivery. I don't think we need any more of those things. I think that I understand what the. Dispatch released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released comes to distribution manufacturing lab testing, there is money to be made there, unfortunately. There's been a few of the folks that applied for retail that have also shown interest in distribution and manufacturing, some of which are well-known established businesses in Chico already that are willing to spend quite a bit of money to manufacture things and send them out of Chico with no more retail. And my normal response to that would be like, well, go do that in Orland, to which the answer was, well, we would, which means they would be manufacturing in Orland and sending it to Chico, which I'd rather they didn't do. I don't really get behind the idea, I think Ms. Nava said this as well, getting more into the cannabis industry in order to fund the city. The city is actually in pretty good shape financially. Now, but we do potentially have a very large expense heading our way that has to do with other things going on in and about town. And I don't know how we're going to pay for it. And then lastly, I heard from Ms. Dill and Vice Mayor Reynolds separately, they had both gone and toured distribution and manufacturing facilities, which are some of the cleanest and not known to be cannabis producing industries. And I realized after hearing from both of them, we did this completely wrong. If we were going to let any of this into town, we should have done manufacturing distribution because there's no retail side, gained the dollars from that, moved it through the state and left retail and delivery out of it. But it was a different council that attacked this way. So as I said, the camel's nose is under the tent, but I can't get behind any more retail or delivery. It's just a bad idea. But I started that whole monologue just trying to shed light on what was allowed with delivery now. And it's out of the up to three retail sites that have already been approved. And we haven't approved who they are, but anybody that gets the retail license will be allowed to deliver. They don't have to, they just can't. End of monologue. All right. Do we have any other council member questions or comments? So Mr. Mayor? Go ahead, Mr. Mayor. Just to address the... Delivery, just so everyone is clear, we've had delivery in the city for many months. That's one thing that we do not control. So we have a number of businesses that are operating and delivering in the city and have done so for many months. I don't know if everyone was aware of that, but that's been a reality for, like I said, several months. But getting back to this overall issue, like I've said in the past, my concern is if we're going to do this, we need to do this right. Meaning let's do our dispensary since we have already headed down this road. Let's do dispensaries right before we start moving into other unknown areas of this particular industry. And I have some concerns with the manufacturing of marijuana and cannabis products because of the high THC content. And what we're starting to see, the emerging studies that are out there, and everyone can access that and look at those studies, that the developing brains are being impacted by high potency or, or long-term marijuana use. And I have a concern about approving anything right now that does more harm to our young adults and those that are up to 25, maybe even up to 30 in this community. That's something I cannot support. All right. Any other council members wishing to weigh in on this? Yes. Mr. Mayor. Just very short, very brief. I am vigorously supporting council member Morgan's comments. I think they are spot on, correct, as well as councilor O'Brien's comments. I think we should let this move forward as it is right now and not go in any other direction until we see how this plays out. End of comment. Thank you. All right. Council member Brown, you're unmuted. Did you have comments? Yeah. Can you hear me? No. Okay. Thank you. Great. Yeah. I mean, it is a logical order to open up retail first, because that is what the majority of Chico voters have requested of us through their votes on various measures in Butte County. But it also was the greatest point of contention amidst the Cannabis Citizens Advisory Committee. You know, the most debate, the most conversation that occurred in those meetings was about retail, which is a public-facing, storefront retail. Very, very little debate around deliveries. In fact, a lot of those folks kind of mentioned that they would prefer delivery to be the only or primary kind of retail option for people locally. The reality is, for more than the past several months, deliveries operating in various areas outside of Chico are coming to Chico and delivering products to no benefit to Chico, and they're not playing by Chico's rules. The point is, they're not playing by Chico's rules. The point of having businesses in Chico is not just economic development. I don't mean revenue specifically. I mean jobs. I mean the money spent on getting new businesses started. It's also the accountability to our community and to our citizens. One of the primary, almost unanimous issues that was brought up by the Cannabis Citizens Advisory Committee was the desire to have as many businesses as possible be locally owned, locally operated, and locally managed. And the only way to prioritize that is to allow kind of fair access to those licenses. In other words, by right. And so the policy that has been passed allows certain business types by right so that the market can kind of take care of the amount of businesses that operate here. The vast majority, all of those businesses are public-facing except for delivery, which is not brick and mortar. Right. Right. And that policy has been heavily vetted by the community. The hard part was storefront retail. We have already done that. We have already regulated it. It was going to be four. Now it's three. That's perfectly appropriate and fine. I think it's time for us to move forward on the rest of that policy so that we have local businesses that are legal, that are operating according to state standards, which are incredibly stringent, and our standards, which are also stringent, and that are accountable to Chico. Thanks. All right. Mr. Mayor, if there's somebody else that doesn't have something to say. Sure. Go ahead. Following up on Ms. Brown's comments, the only thing that concerns me, well, it all concerns me, but the business by right, what I really am not interested in Chico becoming the manufacturing, the distribution center of California's cannabis industry, but as I capitulated a little bit on the retail, like, okay, Camel knows his business. He's got a lot of businesses under the tent. Mr. Ewing, is there a way to allow some of that without allowing all of that? Either by right, by changing the ordinance, by not changing the ordinance, by limiting applications. I'm just trying to figure out how not to make this a big free-for-all and suddenly everything in the city becomes about cannabis. Well, yes. The short answer is yes. You have the discretion. Yes. And the legislative power, as the policy is currently written, to dictate to staff how you want the businesses to look in Chico. So you would say we want one or 500, whatever your number is, and we want licenses to be and applications to be vetted for this period of time. That's all covered under the policy. So it's really up to the council. It's up to the council to decide how you all would like this to look. So we could hypothetically say, like we did with retail and delivery prior to this, we could say we'll accept applications for a limited time for up to three distribution and manufacturing and lab testing thing. I mean, that's within our purview. It is. Thank you. You're welcome. Thank you. Thank you. I have a quick question, Mr. Ewing. On the delivery, if that was to be opened back up, although I'm not in favor of that right now, but one of my questions is, if we did open that back up and we had deliveries happening out of Chico other than out of retail, does that then stop out of area ones from being able to come in deliver or is that still a free-for-all anybody can deliver into the state? And if so, how would the city decide? And if so, how would the city decide? And if so, how would the city decide? And if so, how would the city decide? And if so, how would the city decide? And if so, how would the city decide? And if so, how would the city decide? And if so, how would the city decide? And if so, how would the city decide? And if so, how would the city decide? And if so, how would the city decide? And if so, how would the city decide? say you know outside entity you can no longer deliver in Chico because we've done this with the policy I'd have to get back to you on that part of the question but the policy that we're talking about that's before you you certainly as a council have the legislative power to decide how you want that policy to look and how you want the businesses to operate in Chico again as written second part of the question I'll get back to you on that yeah I'd be very curious and and have been curious about that the first part of the question and getting that answer back do we have any other council members wishing to comment on this I'm not seeing anybody else or any further comments I just have one I just have one question for Angie go ahead I'll let you go and then I'll speak actually council member O'Brien why don't you go ahead so the last comment I was going to make and I just want to make sure everyone understands this that regulation does not remove the black market in fact in my experience it thrives and I just we just need to be aware that just because we start to regulate something that we are not going to make this black market go away no matter what we do quite frankly but it certainly is not going to make it any better okay council member Tandon I'm just you know I understand we we have we have approved the three storefronts and we are just we are hoping to discuss about manufacturing and testing and distribution and I'm not sure maybe Mark or Angie can answer this so if we allow those other users it's not going to bring more marijuana on the streets correct uh yeah I am I don't know yeah I don't know if we're the right people to answer that question as to how much more cannabis but but what I what I can say is that um currently as the ordinance is written as I understand it to be that those categories are basically uh allowing unlimited numbers uh if you were to authorize applications to start to come in for manufacturing and such and so go ahead what I think what I'm asking is that the the it would be still sold through the retail right it's not like somebody's manufacturing it would still have to so it would be still sold with the channel so it's not going to bring more marijuana on the street right it will be still very much under the regulation that will come that that's correct and from every research that the city staff has conducted the cities that do have those types of facilities um it's very very uh restricted as to how they can and can't do and uh the state has really got them under their finger so it's very very restricted how they can operate and so yeah and and really I think the reason why a lot of those communities allowed for that type of use is jobs job generation and uh and to ensure that they're not losing out uh to other entities um in that type of industry whether it's manufacturing or something else do I can speak to that just a tiny bit um from what I visually saw when I actually visited some some of these places that literally you can't even have, the cars are inside the building loaded up and there's cameras on the outside of the building tracking what's coming in and out. The state is so highly regulated on this. They can't even, there's a lot that they can't do. So one of my fears that I do not have is that people are going to be like using this as a sub place to have another, like, we're going to go get a manufacturing license so we can do retail. That was a fear of mine from my unknowing and not being around it. But one of the things I learned in my research and doing is that that is absolutely far from what it actually realistically happens at these locations. All right. And Council Member Brown, I think you have a comment. Yeah, just a quick response to that. One of the, there's other business types that aren't allowed in the current policy as written. Those are cultivation and micro business. So Council Member Tandon, what you would be describing as micro business. I think micro business is a type of micro business where a manufacturer can also have a retail aspect, you know, potentially some sort of storefront to sell the goods that they're manufacturing. It's basically a license that allows a small scale of all of those things. It felt too confusing and like too much of an allowance to allow micro business in the current policy. And so that was kept out of the conversation so as not to confuse the retail that was being allowed with some of those kind of mixed licenses. Thanks for that clarification. The City Manager made an excellent point. And then, Dopeca, I think you also did as well. A manufacturer distributor is not getting access to a retail license because we only are giving up to three. That's what puts more stuff on, at least on our street. But Council Member O'Brien is also correct. At the end of the day, whether, you know, it's being manufactured in Chico or Orland, or San Luis Obispo, it's more stuff on the streets, hopefully not ours. But Casey, sorry, Vice Mayor Reynolds, I know you, I think you went and visited one. Can you speak to the fact, because Council Member Brown, she said that there are public facing, I knew what she meant, it's a building that everybody can see, but that doesn't mean it has retail. So you could drive by and have no idea what was going on. Was that your experience? The ones that I went to that you were pulling up to, you would have had no idea what was happening there. They look like a, you know, a fifth son, a retail store, a, you know, what, or not a retail store, but it just looked like a nondescript building. There was nothing happening outside. There was nobody hanging around. It was very clean. It was a very well taken care of. So there was nothing that I drove up and was like, whoa, I don't want to see this in our community. That's for sure. Um, and I obviously was one of the people that was a hard no on all of this. Um, the cats out of the bag, Camelot, the nose under the tent, whatever you want to call it. This is where we are now. What I did learn in all my research is the taxes are, we have a community benefit fee that we're doing, but the taxes on the distribute is, is captured at the distribution level. So all of these products that are going to. To be coming into Chico, if they are not receiving them from a local distributor, that 5% is staying in Sacramento, San Luis Obispo, LA, wherever they are buying those products from. So we are just by us having our three retail stores, all we are doing is supporting other stores in their communities. So that's why I'm willing to at least have this conversation because we're, we're either going to be given the money to somebody else, or we can potentially be capturing that here. And. Maybe servicing some of the other stores in the Northern California area. So that's why I'm interested in learning more and having the conversation of seeing about how we could maybe move forward with a few of these type of facilities in our area. All right. Do we have any other council member comments? I have so much. Um, so the reason why I asked for that opinion on, um, deliveries, because I think our community doesn't necessarily understand. I've heard from a lot of people. They. Assume when our three storefronts are open, that the delivery from outside the area would cease and only our storefronts would be able to provide delivery. Uh, within the community and understanding that'd be very difficult to police, but it sounds like Mr. Ewing, you need to provide a little more information for us on that particular issue. Uh, perhaps before we move forward with anything in regards to distribution, um, you know, I do think that the manufacturing lab testing aspect, um, at this point, we're going to be able to provide delivery within the community. Um, we're going to be able to provide delivery within the community. would be fine. I do like the limited window on it. Um, Mr. Ewing, a quick question here. If we were actually to move forward and have a two week window in which people could submit applications, realizing that a two week window would allow people to do it, but at the same time would maybe go too far into it. Um, you know, companies that have a proven track record companies that can be prepared, realizing that the city's closed at the end of the year, but then we reopen, you know, they could take that time to prepare and then submit. Um, we're looking at some of the things we're looking at. from today, but do we need to bring that back at a future meeting or is that something that we could do tonight in terms of opening the window for the two-week period? You can do that tonight. You can direct staff to do that tonight. Okay, so that would be my motion then that we open up manufacturing lab testing for a two-week period to take applications that we at a future meeting hear back more of the details on delivery. Did you, Mayor Coolidge, sorry, you said manufacturing and did you say distribution? No, I said manufacturing and lab testing. So just to clarify a word, and I know this because I was schooled by our city staff, distribution does not mean delivery. Distribution means, let's say you made a THC-based beverage, for example, in the city of Chico and you distributed it out either to the retail sites or to someone in San Diego. Distribution does not mean you can deliver. Yeah, no, and you're correct. I always kind of deem that with manufacturing in terms of how I think about normal commercial processes. So yes, not delivery, but distribution, manufacturing, lab testing with a bring back on the delivery. And then Council Member Bransford. Brown, did you have a question on the motion? I do. Can you hear me? Yeah. Not very well. Yeah, your volume is low, but we can make you. Okay, I'm going to try and see if I can fix it when we take a break. Are we good? We can hear me enough? Yeah. I have a little bit of concern about that brief of a window, particularly for your justification for it, Mayor Coolidge. If it sounds, and this very well may be the case, that the goal is to have a business that has an opportunity to have people or businesses, applicants with a proven track record, which means in which I am interpreting to mean businesses that exist in other areas. So what I'm hearing in that is that there is no real opportunity for local entrepreneurs, people who live here in the city of Chico who may want to run one of these businesses to have that opportunity, particularly in that brief of a timeframe. And I think for equitable. Equitability. for the ability for local people to put in their applications. Obviously, it's a lot of work. It's a lot of money. It's a lot of time. It's a lot of resources to do that. So they have to have those things in order to be legitimate. I would like to see those folks have that type of opportunity. And I feel that this limited window perhaps doesn't allow for that. Folks who have an application somewhere else that they can just dress up for the city of Chico might be able to do that. But I really would like to give a little bit more opportunity to our local folks who may be interested in entering that competitive process. So I do understand that. And I probably misspoke about the proven track record. I don't necessarily think that they need that. But I think, you know, I actually have heard from a couple of local businesses who don't have a proven track record, but want to expand in this kind of manufacturing who are interested in and on the local aspect. My concern with an extension. With an extended window is that we're going to get so many applications if we open this up for a very long period of time that we would flood the market. Now, I think we could open it up at this point. Do it for the two week period. See what we get. Possibly approve. You know, move through those. And then that doesn't mean that at a future date we couldn't reopen that window. So I think that that ability to look at it again is still there. And that's correct. Mr. Ewing. We'd be able to do this again in the future. Correct? Absolutely. Yes. Yeah. So I just think, you know, testing the waters and hearing from our community, which is, you know, certainly interested in this. We know they they voted overwhelmingly for, you know, legalized marijuana. We we but at the same time hearing a lot of hesitation. I, I think that window temporarily open now, but you have another comment. Yeah, I don't have a problem with a temporary window. I hear your can we hear me enough? Yeah, my microphone must be going in and out. I hear your your reasoning and I don't think it's invalid reasoning. Part of my concern is that we're headed into the holidays. And so we've got this week, which is the Christmas holiday, the following week, which is the New Year's holiday. And then that leaves somewhat limited time for people to get their stuff together to submit. And I know if it's a priority, they're going to make it happen. But just for the sake of access to the opportunity, could we extend that maybe to four weeks or three weeks or something a little bit longer of a window to give people that opportunity in the new year? You know, I really gave a lot of thought to the two week period. And I realized it's the holiday season. And, you know, I know we have a full week, you know, the rest of the work week this week with with Christmas Eve on on a Friday. And then, you know, the next week. And then it would, you know, obviously, even the city offices are closed. So we, you know, extend it out into that's what January 5, I believe. You know, I think that's some solid time for us to see some applications. I wouldn't mind looking again if, you know, we received none, you know, reopening the window at that point in time. You know, I just don't I'm concerned that we open the window. We give an extended period of time and then we get, you know, too many applications. So I do like the time restriction there. Council Member Morgan, you unmuted. Yeah, I'm going to agree with you. And this is why a, I think it should be hard. I think it should be difficult. Those those two things. And every weekday, whatever it is, it gets extended. If it's by right. And if I understand this correctly. Right. We open this up. There'll be some kind of scoring model for distribution, manufacturing and lab testing. Those are the things that you mentioned. And if a particular business hits those numbers, they're in by right. So every day that we go longer, we're just allowing more and more and more and more and more and more. So I understand where you're coming from. I understand also where Miss Brown's coming from. There's got to be a happy medium or or or nothing. And unfortunately, I'm just trying to keep up with what you just said about the politics is the fine art of making trade offs. And I, I think that would be one. I, you know, I'm not going to die on this hill. But the, the thought of, you know, maybe starting the two week period at at our next meeting in January and giving those two weeks. Might be a compromise that would give some time for folks to to find out that the application process is opening and then to start submitting those applications in the new year. So I'm just throwing that out there as an option. Yeah. And actually, I thought about that too. And, um, You know, in thinking about that, you know, that two week period, I think, would just be used as, you know, prep. So that goes from a two week period to a four week period just straight because of that. But, but I would say this is a process that we can reopen. It is something that we could explore again. And obviously, you know, I'm here, putting this forward for the two week. You know, I kind of want to see what we get. Yeah. And then, you know, possibly look at it once again, if you know we get one person and it doesn't make sense, then, you know, we can go back at it. But, you know, obviously we can move forward with a little at a time, but we can't once once those floodgates open, you know, if we were to say four weeks or six weeks or eight weeks and we get, you know, 52, there's no going backwards. So that's really where my concern is is trying to balance this because we have a lot of folks in our community. I think most folks are in the middle on this issue. Like, yes, I understand why we have it. Yes, we want to make some revenue from it. Yes, we don't want it to dominate our community. You know, and then we have people on both sides of the issue after that. So, you know, I think this is just a, you know, that's why that's why I made the motion that way. Yeah, go ahead. Can I ask a point of clarification on the two weeks? Does that mean 10 business days? Yeah, I would. I would think, yeah, 14 days from today. Business days. Obviously not counting, I believe, the technically city holiday on the 24th and probably on the I definitely look at a calendar to see exactly. But I would say, yeah, 10 businesses. Well, then you can't count next week because the city's closed. Yeah, well, so. So if you want to do weeks, it's got to be a hard two weeks. A hard two weeks. But the city doesn't have to be open for people to work on their applications. Right. And. And. And we all know. That there are. Numerous. Meaning more than two. People interested in the manufacturing distribution part. There has been forever. Since we started this discussion, they're probably going to get in first. They don't need the extra time. Extending it out. It's just going to make it harder. I did get clarification that if there is a challenge, someone puts in. An application. On let's say the last day. I think. And they released an application. And they released an application. And they released an application. And they released an application. And they released an application. And they released an application. And they released an application. And they released an application. And they released an application. And they released an application. And they released an application. And they released an application. And they released an application. And they released an application. And they released an application. And they released an application. yeah all right so my motion's out there if there's no second or if there is a second i'll take a look all right we have a second from council member tan further comment mr mr yeah that was a little whoa that was echoey yeah i'm not entirely sure okay can you hear me yeah okay fantastic just just for clarity's sake um so are we looking at the fifth or the seventh as the two weeks because the fifth would be two weeks from tomorrow the seventh would be 10 days um if you exclude christmas eve and new year's eve which the two weeks would be two weeks from tomorrow the seventh would be 10 days city's closed on those days yeah and i would say let's let's do the seventh if council member tandon will join me on that yeah thank you all right so and then council member brown do you have something further i saw your mic go off there i was just requesting my microphone is being very annoying can you hear me we can actually hear you okay it's just very quiet yeah okay uh my screen's not lighting up when i'm talking oh yeah i see that that's not yeah yeah uh i just wanted clarity on the motion just one more time sorry about that all right she asked for clarity on the motion there oh okay so the the motion would be that we open application process until january 7th for manufacturing manufacturing distribution not to be mistaken with delivery and lab testing and that the city attorney bring us back details in terms of delivery at a later date so we can reassess that in terms of how it works with our storefronts all right so we have a motion and a second um madam clerk if you could take the role okay council member bennett no council member brown hi council member morgan yeah i'll allow that i'm sorry we've got something echo in your your microphone there debbie you can't can you hear me yeah we can i think maybe one of the other clerks might have their mic on so you guys were echoing a little bit i'm going to try the actual microphone can you hear me now yeah yeah we can't okay so council member morgan i apologize i didn't hear you i said yes i will get behind that i keep i can't hear him he was he said yes he said yes okay thank you council member o'brien no okay council member tandem yes nice mayor reynolds reluctant but yes mayor coolidge hi k kerry's five two all right and uh let's see what time we're at here so why don't we uh take a short break uh about five ten minutes if we're released and we're released and we're released and we're If council members can come back at that time, we'll show you back and then we'll see you back here. And then Madam Clerk, if you can maybe put up something that says we're taking a short break, if you have the ability to do that. We will do that. All right. So we will do that and we'll be back in five, 10 minutes. In fact, let's just say hard, hard 10 minutes. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks. Thanks. Thanks. Thanks. Thanks. Thanks. Thanks. Thanks. Thanks. Thanks. Thanks. Thanks. Thanks. Thanks. Thanks. Thanks. Thanks. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. for revenue. You know, and one of the things that's interesting here is that we're, you know, you all authorized polling, I think, some time ago to look at this. And there was certainly a level of support based on the kinds of projects that city manager laid out. Things have changed since then. What I can tell you is we do this work across California. There does seem to be the March 2020 election was very rough for these kinds of measures. The November 2020 general election, the presidential, actually measures like these, where communities like Chico asked their voters if they wanted to participate in, you know, rebuilding infrastructure and rebuilding police and fire and public safety. And they were successful across the state in deep in the middle of a pandemic. So it's a tough time. But, you know, measures are having success across the state. I think from the communications perspective, one of the things that we really believe in at Clifford Moss is, you know, people support what they help create. So part of this communication strategy is to help people support what they help create. And I think that's a really important piece of what we're doing. And I think that's a really important piece of what we're doing. It's not just putting a flyer together and pushing it out or leaving it at desks across the city, but it's asking people to come along on a process with us. You don't make a final decision, right, about whether or not this ballot is definitely going to happen until, I mean, the law allows you until August for the November election. So I think the process will be important to your point, Council Member Brown, and having people's voices heard. And then us reporting back to what we're hearing. And that's part of the way we envision this rolling out. Alex, thank you. We can't hear you now. Go ahead and try again. I said, thank you. I appreciate it. And it's nice to meet you. Yeah, pleasure. All right. Do we have any other Council Member questions? Mr. Morgan, I see your hand. Tom, don't take this the wrong way, but what are you going to do for $91,000? I'm insulted. I mean, Mark, if you want to take it, I'm happy to kind of tick through it however you'd like. Oh, no, no, no. Oh, no, you can answer the question. So that's a combination of everything. So it's a not to include fee, right? So that includes mailers that are two-way mailers into your community that are saying, hey, listen, this is what we're proposing. What do you think? Send us feedback. Rip out this reply card or reply on the survey monkey or reply on this Google survey. Tell us what you think. Share. That's data and evidence that we bring back to you as you're thinking about putting a measure on the ballot. That includes digital, right? To be able to put digital spots out into the community. We've had a lot of success with digital actually across in communities across the state so that people are more, which we don't want to be in a position where you put a measure on the ballot and folks feel like there was never a conversation about what it is and the fact that it's coming. And so a lot of that budget is the budget required to pay for the digital, pay for the mail and other outreach components. And then another piece of it, actually a smaller piece of it is our professional services fee. So it's those two things combined. Council member Morgan, if that answers the question. It does. And that was helpful. Thank you. Yeah, you bet. All right. Any other council member questions? All right. So, so Tom born and raised here in Chico? Yeah. Yeah. Well, I was born in San Francisco, but I was, yeah, I was raised in Chico. Hooker Oak to Chico Jr. to Chico High. Fantastic. I don't trust him. You shouldn't. Hey, you shouldn't. Eastside quiet down over there. That's why I know better. Yeah. All right. Vice Mayor Reynolds, you had a question? I was just curious, Tom, what other communities of our size and type maybe that you've worked with and what has your success rate been and how long have you been doing this? Great, great questions. We've, I've been, this is going to make Council Member Morgan trust me even less. I'm actually a reformed lawyer and got into doing, but I had, but I did fight. Right. There you go. I did it a degree in public, public policy and law at the same time, a grad degree in that. And after seven years of practicing law, 12 years ago, I started doing this and we formed our company 10 years ago. And we've worked with communities across California. And, you know, what's really interesting is just how much Chico has grown in particular since, I mean, you all know this and feel this, but in particular since I was growing up and for community of your size, you know, over 100K folks. 58,000 voters. Most communities are when they're putting something as significant as potentially a one cent revenue measure on the ballot, they are definitely investing in, you know, public communication process so that, again, it's not like people walk into the ballot box and they're like, oh, I never even knew that this was happening. Now there will be plenty of people who don't know that there's a measure on the ballot. Right. Until the day they go in and vote. But our goal is to bring people through a process and at least have people have the opportunity to participate and engage and ask questions. So smart that you're doing this. All right. I'm sorry. I didn't. I was I was evasive. We've won 95.7% of our measures. Vice Mayor Reynolds, you're on mute. I do have a question. There we go. Council Member Tandon, if you can go ahead. Yes. No, no, go ahead. I was just curious. I mean, we have this report that we got, you know. And on one of it says proposed fee and it says total not to exceed amount 77,500. But then I'm hearing 91,000 too. So I'm just trying to clarify on those two numbers. Yeah, it's a it's a not to exceed 91,000. Basically, we can enhance our outreach capacity if we feel like we need to. And so we're asking for the higher end. It actually was more than that. And fortunately, Tom. And the Clifford Moss team was able to bring the costs down. And I will tell you that we're hoping that it's closer to the 70 some thousand. But if we feel like we need to get more education out there, we have the flexibility with the 91,000 to make that happen. So we're asking for the higher end of that. But we anticipate it will fall somewhere between those two numbers. Okay. I was just making sure. So, yep. Thank you. Correctly. Yep. All right. Vice Mayor Reynolds, did you have a question? Yeah, I remembered what my question was. We currently, Mr. Tom. We currently. We currently do not have a PIO. Do you have, are you comfortable with your staff and ability to fill in as that type of a person? Or do you have somebody on staff that can really, because I think that's one of the things that our community has expressed very, very well. That they, a lot of times, feel left in the dark. They don't understand what's happening. They don't know what's going on. So clear, direct, distinct messaging on this is going to be very, very important to myself anyways. Yeah. Yeah. Our role. And I'm not going to be attempting it as it is to say we would sort of, we really will never be able to replace what a PIO can do for a city. That's just being totally honest because they're looking at the range of communication issues that you have. Our loyalty and sort of fealty will be to the, to the revenue measure and really making sure we're doing a bang up job on educational materials, on outreach, on two way conversational materials, both digital and static media on the revenue measure. And within the context of the revenue measure, council member Reynolds will be able to. To help, you know, do some of the things that a PIO might otherwise do. But, you know, in terms of the need that you have across everything you're doing as a city, you know, I would hesitate to say we can step in and help there. Cause that's a, and that's a, we're seeing that I will say across the state with our clients, right? We come in and work with them in general in advance of revenue measure asks. But the need to communicate is so great now that it is something. It's something important to have. If you're in a place you can do that is to have a PIO. And I meant that specific to the revenue measure. So I apologize. I didn't have no words. Thank you. All right. Any further questions for Mr. Orm or Mr. Clifford? All right. Uh, do we have any speakers on this item? Yes, we have three. All right. Let's do three minutes of peace. Okay. The first speaker is Nicole Nava followed by Julie Threat. And once we unmute Nicole, we'll turn the timer on. All right. So we're going to wrap up the workshop. So we're going to wrap up the workshop. So we're going to wrap up the workshop. So we're going to wrap up the workshop. So we're going to wrap up the workshop. So we're going to wrap up the workshop. So we're going to wrap up the workshop. So we're going to wrap up the workshop. So we're going to wrap up the workshop. So we're going to wrap up the workshop. So we're going to wrap up the workshop. So we're going to wrap up the workshop. who normally would want to support a sales tax measure, given the timing post, you know, still in the pandemic and all of that. So I think that's going to be a challenge that's going to need some expertise and finessing and making sure that the messaging is on point about the considerations of this and what it will and won't do for this community. One thing that I would ask that we consider is it seems to me we do put a lot of money out to consultants rather than leaning on city staff for things. And so maybe what we could have an eye toward is leveraging when we do things like this, such as what this company has proposed. And when you get the materials to see if we can keep those materials as a template going forward for when things like this are needed in the future that we aren't constantly having to throw out. We're not constantly throwing dollars at consultants. It's just a hard pill to swallow repeatedly, I think. So, you know, I myself am on the fence about the measure. And here's why. Normally, I would say go for it. I'm not a fan of taxes, but I'm also a realist about what the sales tax looks like across the state and the challenges and costs going up and of doing business. And so I think for a community to thrive and survive, this might be necessary. It's necessary to take the hit. But again, it's going to be a hard sell. And a lot of that also goes to trust, like what will happen to the money? If it's going in the general fund, there is no guarantee it would go toward what all of us perceive it needing to go towards, such as things like our infrastructure and other needed services in our community to keep it vital. So I know that there won't be promises necessarily on what the funds would go to, but I would implore you. To do the some kind of informal survey, even if you do on your own site and get things out there to what the people believe are the biggest priorities for our community. As you look at expenditure of those funds, keep it in mind, you've already spent a ton on the homelessness solution and you look towards spending a ton more. It seems prudent that it go toward our physical infrastructure that is lagging woefully behind. And again, the Cliffords are very. Trustworthy great family and I think that Tom Clifford would do a great job for you. Thank you. Thank you. Our next speaker is Julie three, followed by Jessica Giannola. So we will unmute Julie three. Okay. You hear me guys? Yes. Go ahead. Hello everyone. I do not support hiring this consultant. I'm basically because I don't support a sales tax increase. For the sheer reason that I can't afford a sales tax increase. I definitely understand the logic and I know our rate is low compared to cities are size. I haven't looked at the revenue. I assume that you guys all know if we need revenue. And I think the sales tax is always the way to go with that because it's going to hit the people that buy more by the big ticket items and it avoids a, like a fixed tax increase. But really we just can't afford it right now and things are up in the air. So if you do vote this through, I'm going to give a few reasons for Mr. Clifford. And then you can avoid sending me one of those two way cards and just, we will know what's on the ballot just so you know that. So number one, you know, we've got a socialist president. He's putting out policies. And so my costs are going up for gas hamburger, et cetera. And he's got three more years. So we're in the, the unknown delivery costs are going up, et cetera. So the federal government's taking more of our money. I also have a socialist state governor who continues to extend his own emergency powers. He's got us locked up, locked down. This is costing everyone those on low minimum wage. So the governor is taking my money. And then I've got to keep it. I'm going to have to pay for the school board. And then I've got a socialist majority who's suing the conservative majority. And we're having a meeting tomorrow to approve unplanned funding for a big expensive law firm. And they don't pay that. It's going to hit every one of us eventually with some kind of fee increase. So the county's taken a hit from my pocket. And then I've got a socialist majority school board who's getting ready to put in health mandates that force parents to pay for more schooling. That's less money to the school, probably more property taxes for me and less money out of our parents' pockets. And then I've got my conservative majority city council where a socialist group is parading around pretending to be voting. And then I've got a conservative majority school where a conservative party is trying to get the voters to take aim at two of them and put a recall where I spent time and money to help get everybody elected last year. We won the majority back fair and square. And then one of their own had to resign and was replaced by a former police chief. And that was it. Here comes a recall. Has zero merit. The things they claim are reasons to recall are reasons you use a ballot box for. I mean, this is not your annual performance review process. Our democracy doesn't work that way. We have a council that all votes on every issue. This is a farce. And so it's going to be a farce. It's going to cost me money to obviously support the people that I supported in the in November. I feel like my boat's being stolen. And then we're going to support and money and give money to for the for the next general election, District three, District four, District six. So the Chico Voter Group recalls another unplanned expense and reason why I can't support hiring a consultant who's being hired to win an increase to my sales taxes. The Chico Voter Group who claims to be for fiscal responsibility, who is accusing two city council members of fiscal irresponsibility, is promoting an irresponsible, unpaid, unpaid Democratic recall that is costing all Chico voters money out of their pocket. Thank you for your time. Merry Christmas. So Jessica Giannola followed by, and we did have an additional speaker, Davey. Thank you, counsel. Can you hear me? Yes, go ahead. Thank you. One of the arguments that I'm hearing for supporting this sales tax here that I just heard was that we needed to help pay for the things that we benefited from as a community. However, I'm seeing that rather than us paying more, that we should look at where we're spending and cut what we're spending in areas like, oh, I don't know, we could word things on the ballot so that people can vote on it too. Unnecessary, I agree actually with the unnecessary money that we're spending towards consultant fees quite a bit. And, and, often I go, well, we just, we just had other people who gave input or other resources, whatever it might be. So why are we spending this money for this person kind of scenario? Those should be weighed and considered more and not doing that. Also, I don't know. I'm thinking of all the times that we're ending up in with petty litigation or a lot of back and forth paperwork that costs a lot of money. And then just to, from my understanding, come down to council recommendation. So maybe investing in, in more sound council can help the city save money in the long term instead of wasting those funds. I would suggest doing with CalPERS. It seems to be, I've heard, I think it was a city manager, not positive, stating how expensive that is. Maybe considering changing those, if it has to be on the ballot, then that's something we can do as a city together. Lastly, I'd say relocate funds to prevention-based efforts instead of so much towards punitive efforts. Trying to arrest people for XYZ rather than investing in the people and preventing those scenarios is where we're going to get the best bang for our buck. Long-term, we're saving a lot of money by doing that rather than trying to increase our taxes to keep paying for, you know, whatever might be increasing, a raise for, or hiring another officer because we have increasing theoretical, increasing crime somewhere. So preventing these scenarios, we'll save money by doing that instead of making us keep paying and paying and paying. We have enough on our plates. Everybody does. And asking us to pay another tax, I don't know who's going to agree with this. It's really hard. It's just, we need to spend better as a city. We need to spend better as a city. We need to spend better as a city. We need to spend better as a city. We need to spend better as a city. We need to spend better as a city. With what we have already, and we can, there's lots of opportunity. Thank you. Our final speaker is Davey. Hi, thank you all so much. And as I said, I applaud you. I'm very thankful for this resource. Along the lines, my thoughts on fiscal regard and fiscal respect, I think along the lines of sustainability when it comes to, when it comes to our resources, I am very much in favor of a cannabis service. I am. However, I really do not want the smoke in my face. Not at all. No. However, I really feel that the papers, utilizing it for paper, to save the resources of trees, because cannabis, from what I understand, it grows much quicker. Therefore, the trees can be conserved and counterweighs in our air can be cleaner. And I feel that oftentimes our bartering resources build unhealthy, for other businesses oftentimes, rather than grow and flourish in our communities, if we utilize sustainable resources oftentimes. I respect that people want to thrive within themselves because there are others that want to thrive in their own way. So overall though, I hope we can be amicable and have a balance between these. And this is why I do value the elements of cannabis as well. I mean, I don't smoke it. Honestly, I can't touch it. No, it's just not for me. However, and I don't want it in my face. No. However, I do feel that it has value. I feel it has very much value. From what I understand, the first American flag was made from hemp by Betsy Ross. And so, and I do feel it has very much value for the way that it grows quickly and it can be utilized much quicker for many, many resources. And so, that aside, however, there's other aspects where I feel like bartering, especially bartering aspects of like oil and elements like that. It's just like, to me, that's a limited supply. Therefore, it can be bartered much easily, much more easily. It seems to me that if we utilize our technology resources within our communication and lessening our travel, like we're doing just now, and like, I mean, it's not that I don't want to go across town and visit someone that I truly care about. I don't mean it that way. I don't mean to say that I don't truly care about people within meetings. What I mean is that like, you know, more familial, like more family or along those lines. You know, people that are, you know, just more family along those lines. And like, I personally, I like this. I feel a little nervous. However, I really like this peaceful setting that we're sharing. And I feel that within the communication tech that we're sharing and I see the security that you're putting into this. I feel like it's really, really we have an opportunity for democracy in a peaceful way. Often times I've seen. Well, I mean, you know, I'm thankful for the peaceful way that we're learning to communicate through these things. And so, like, we're learning to grow and grow and grow and grow and grow and grow and grow and technologies. And, you know, I'm learning as well. I appreciate what we're sharing and the opportunities for sustainability in a handful of ways. Thank you. And I applaud you all. Is our last speaker? All right. I'll wait for you to take down the clock there. All right. Good. Council Member Brown, you had a comment? Yes. And new headphones. Mr. Clifford, I have a quick question for you. Just based on something one of the speakers said, any assets that you develop for the City of Chico, we would have ownership over, right? Messaging documents, any branding, logos, print material, that would all belong to the City of Chico by the time the contract is done, correct? Yeah. Yeah. And from a branding perspective, that'll carry the branding that the City already has, Council Member Brown. But the documents, you know, our messaging, et cetera, will be yours. And you're free to use it as you need. Thank you. All right. Council Member Morgan, did you have a question or statement? Not a question. Before we move on. Sure. You know, obviously, the amount is kind of shocking. I think Mr. Clifford did a good idea or a good job explaining that. I think it's important for the people that are paying attention, particularly the press, is going to report this out. This isn't the City Council pushing the contract. At least not this City Council member. Pushing a tax initiative. There are some things that the community wants, including infrastructure and roads and some other things that it's really hard for us to afford. It's easier for younger cities that don't have roads like ours and haven't been around as long as we have that also have higher tax measures. And ultimately, we're going to leave it up to the voters. I do want to make sure that there's some direction for Mr. Clifford. And one of the speakers alluded to it, I think. Yeah. Trust is going to be a big thing with this community. And if they think we're going to take all this money and it's going to end up going to pensions and other things, the tax measure is dead on arrival. And there are a lot of people that think that's what's going to happen. I don't know who's going to champion this. That's going to be an important thing that we learn as a result of it. I am concerned about the dollar amount. But at the end of the day, having watched him work now for nine years, I know that the skipper looked at a lot of different options. And this was the one that was going to fit the city the best and make sure that most citizens knew exactly what was going on and had some say. So I will leave it at that. All right. And then do we have any other council member comment? I do have some as well. All right. No. Actually, when I looked at the city of Chico before I ran for council, I was like, oh, my God, this is a lot of people. And I was like, oh, my God, this is a lot of people. Chico faces a unique circumstance that not a lot of towns around California or even throughout the United States face is that we are a hub for the communities around us. They are growing rapidly and they are taking advantage of our resources to a level that we can't not necessarily sustain. So you take Bidwell Park, you take our roads, things along those lines. And we have a lot of people that are going to be able to take advantage of that. And I think that's a lot of people who come into our community to drive around, to work, to do different things here, to shop, whatever it might be, to take advantage on the weekends of our parks and things of that nature and aren't necessarily paying their way in any way, shape or form. And a tax measure, actually, a sales tax measure helps recoup some of that. Most of the towns our size in California, and I'm sure, Dom, you can provide some background on this, do have a tax measure. Most of the towns, in our county, actually have, or most of the cities in our county actually have tax measures as well, a sales tax measure. So, you know, as much as I am an anti tax person, you know, I think our community, from what I've heard from my constituency, needs a chance to weigh in on this. And I think Councilmember Morgan, you make an excellent point. This is not the City Council putting a tax measure for, you know, saying this tax measure is approved. This is putting it before the voters of Chico asking them if they want to approve it. So I think that's very important that we see this. You know, certainly I think in this position, I'm willing to function either way. I agree that my fellow council members probably feel the same way. We can make this work for the best we can without it. We can make it work better with it. But the people of Chico really need to decide which avenue we want to walk down. And they'll have that approval at the ballot box. So with that, I'd make a motion to approve the contract. Second. All right. Second by Council Member Tannen. Further comment? All right. With that, Madam Clerk, can you take the roll? Yes. Council Member Bennett? Yes. Council Member Brown? Aye. Council Member Morgan? Yes. Council Member O'Brien? Yes. Council Member Tannen? Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds? Aye. Mayor Coolidge? Aye. Gary 7-0. All right. Moving on. Thank you, everyone. Moving on to Item 5.5, Amendment of the CalPERS Retirement Contract, affecting Sworn Park Rangers. And I believe this one is Ms. Tannen. Good evening, Mayor. Council Members, the item you have in front of you is our first step to amend our contract with CalPERS. This amendment allows our Sworn Park Rangers to actually become local safety members versus miscellaneous. We've done these before with our cost-sharing measures. This simply amends their classification within the CalPERS system. So our recommendation to Council is to approve the resolution and introduce the ordinance by reading of title only. And I'm happy to answer any questions. All right. Do we have any questions for Ms. Tannen? All right. Seeing none, do we have any speakers on this item? We do not. All right. Will the Council? Will the Council? Move to approve. All right. We have a motion from Vice Chair. Vice Mayor Reynolds. Do we have a second? I'll second that. All right. We have a second from Council Member O'Brien. And that's a resolution of intent of the City Council to approve an amendment to contract between the Board of Administration and the California Public Employees Retirement System, the City Council of the City of Chico, ordinance of the City Council of the City of Chico authorizing an amendment to contract between the City Council of the City of Chico and the Board of Administration of the California Public Utility, the City Council of the City of Chico, public employees retirement system. Madam Clark, if you could take the role. Council Member Bennett. Yes. Council Member Brown. Aye. Council Member Morgan. Yes. Council Member O'Brien. Yes. Council Member Tanden. Yes. Council Member Tanden. I don't think we heard your vote. I heard Council Member Tanden. I didn't hear Vice Mayor Tanden. Oh, yes. Thank you. Mayor Colage. Aye. Carry 7-0. All right. Thank you very much. All right. Moving on to 5.6. Council Member Tanden requests housing project presentation. And this is a presentation by Mr. V from the community. Sorry. Community. Community Development Director. Mr. V, are you there? I'm here. Can you hear me? And can you see my PowerPoint? We can indeed hear you and see your PowerPoint. So take it away. Perfect. Thank you. Good evening, Mayor, Vice Mayor, and Council. Again, I was asked to provide a summary regarding the status of Chico's housing. So I'm going to highlight some areas that I believe are important. And then, of course, I'll be happy to answer any questions at the end. Get this to move. Perfect. All right. Ready when you are. Thank you. I'm having a little problem with my toggle to move to the next slide. So first, I think it's important to note that the city government generally does not produce housing. There's a different role played in the housing development process for both the city and the private sector. The city's role in accommodating growth is generally to identify an adequate supply of appropriately zoned land, to provide infrastructure and municipal services, and to create an environment where development can proceed expeditiously. It is then left to the private sector, where physical development of housing is driven by market conditions, as well as willing landowners. But to that end, while there are always opportunities for improvement, I believe the city's existing development review and entitlement process is in fact streamlined. Proposed projects that are consistent with the city's general plan and zoning code are processed expeditiously, and staff seeks to utilize existing CEQA exemptions, CEQA being the California Environmental Quality Act, or tear off previously prepared environmental documents whenever applicable. Staff has led a series of multi-phase municipal code amendment processes over the past 10 years as well, and all of those amendments have resulted in streamlined processes, greater flexibility in code implementation, reduction in unnecessary oversight, and the allowance of uses where they were previously restricted or prohibited. So the city's supply of land for residential development can be broken up into four categories. One, existing proposed, approved, and under construction development, or what I like to call a pipeline unit. Two, vacant developable land. Three, the five special planning areas or new growth areas that are identified on the city's general plan land use diagram, which you can see on the screen. And four, the numerous opportunity sites identified in the general plan that have good redevelopment potential. On the screen are updated pipeline tables highlighting the number of proposed, approved, and under construction single-family and multi-family units available in the near and mid-term. This information demonstrates that there are approximately 2040 single-family, 2229 multi-family units in the pipeline. Many of these units were approved quite some time ago. Some units are part of large master-planned areas like the Northwest Chico-Pacific plan area, Merriam Park, or Oak Valley. And some of them in those areas may require subsequent approvals. And others are on hold until they receive state and federal permits, like the Stonegate project. Honestly, I don't think today we're going to be able to say who we're going to be. Tonight's the time to get into the weeds on each of these, but I just wanna highlight that I believe there's a healthy near-term pipeline for residential development. Again, it is then left to the private sector to proceed with development, but please recognize that that is not a simple notion and that the timing of private development is often driven by a number of complex factors, including demand, financing, infrastructure obligations, as I previously mentioned, state and federal permitting, the availability of workforce, the cost of materials, and then more recently, global supply chain issues. So for the past five years, the average annual number of single family units produced has been around 278, and the average annual number of multifamily units is 210. So far in 2021, that's to date this year, not the end of the year, there have been 144 single family residential units built, and there are another 155 units that are currently under construction. For multifamily units or apartments, there have been 355 units built, and to date, oh, and there are also an additional 823 additional units under construction. I just wanna stop there and highlight that that is considered a significant number in Chico's history. Add to that, there are over 616 multifamily units and 105 single family units in plan review at the building division, which means they'll likely be under construction in the next year. So I guess that's the plan. In other words, the key takeaway here is that residential development, especially multifamily, is being built at an extremely high rate. From what I hear, apparently as fast as they can be built, they're being occupied. I believe this reflects an ongoing post-campfire demand for housing, and I would expect similar production in the coming years. So one clear way that the city council can show its support for continued housing production is honoring the city's 2030 general plan, specifically acknowledging that the land use diagram on the screen in front of you, represents where the community has agreed it will focus growth. Given the significant risk associated with development, as well as the community's desire for additional housing, there must be a predictable and transparent process. Proposed projects that are consistent with the city's general plan and development regulations should be supported by the planning commission and the city council. Another reason we should develop consistent with our general plan, and something that I believe is often lost on people, is that if we don't efficiently utilize the land that we've thoughtfully planned to accommodate, we'll lose. And so, if we don't do that, we'll lose the opportunity to accommodate future jobs and housing needs, then we'll unfortunately be increasing pressure to develop in areas we desire to protect. You simply cannot have it both ways. I've highlighted on the screen, the different opportunity sites and special planning areas on the city's general plan. I wanna highlight that there are a number of projects that are proceeding in the opportunity sites. A couple of examples include the Esplanade Greenfield Apartments, the Jesus Center Renewal Center on Ferris Street, and the 1297 Park Avenue Affordable Housing Project. With regard to the special planning areas, there's also a lot happening. The first special planning area to proceed is the Valley's Edge Pacific Plan. The public review period for the draft environmental impact report for this project was recently concluded. At over 1400 acres, this project has the potential to provide approximately 2800 new residential units, 450 square feet of commercial and office space, 680 acres of open space and parks, a new school site, and a comprehensive trail network. This project will be making its way to the Planning Commission, as well as the City Council in 2022. In addition, the second special planning area application was recently received for the 135 acre Barber Yard Project. It proposes approximately 1250 residential units, a combination again of both single family and multifamily, as well as 180 square feet of commercial and office uses. This is a location of the old Diamond Match facility and represents a unique redevelopment infill project released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released!!!!!!!!! growth area as well. So I want to pause here for a moment regarding the value of the new growth areas. It's critical to understand that these areas have very long build-out periods. The Northwest Chico-specific plan, Merriam Park, and Oak Valley all received planning entitlements in the early 2000s and are still providing both residential and non-residential development potential today. They simply don't develop overnight. They represent critical long-term supply. Another interesting point I'd like to make is that a majority of the affordable housing projects proceeding today are being located in these older master-planned areas. When affordable housing money is made available, it's based on extremely quick turnaround times, and affordable housing developers are looking for locations that already have planning entitlements and where environmental review has taken place. I believe that Valley's Edge and Barber Yard will provide similar opportunities in the future. So my key takeaway on this slide is that I believe the general plan is performing well. The current plan is being implemented in the area of the! The!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! If all of these projects get built over the next couple of years, a total of 937 new affordable units will be made available. Honestly, this shows me that affordable housing can get built in Chico if funding is simply made available from the state and federal government. Also due to the Camp Fire, over $32 million in CDBG disaster relief funds have been made available to Chico for, again, multifamily projects. Chico is the first jurisdiction in California to complete all due diligence required by the state for this program and has already identified three projects for funding representing an additional 181 affordable units. Additionally, a portion of the $61 million in funds allocated to Butte County under this program will be utilized in city limits due to the availability of existing infrastructure. Again, I think this is all great news on the affordable housing front. So the city is currently navigating a very complex update to its general plan housing element. Per state law, the housing element must be updated on an eight-year cycle and it must provide an analysis of Chico's housing needs for all income levels, as well as provide strategies to respond to provide for those needs. This is a major planning housing effort and the new element needs to be adopted by the city council in June of 2022. Key parts of the update include a housing needs assessment that identifies the community's greatest housing needs an adequate sites inventory that determines whether there's an adequate supply of land that is appropriately designated to meet our future housing needs during that 8-year cycle. A constraints analysis that looks at governmental constraints like regulations and fees as well as non-governmental constraints like the price of land cost of building supplies and availability of works. With the released released workforce. As well, a key component of the update is public input. The city led a very robust and successful public outreach process in 2021 with record attendance of the virtual meetings as well as the survey responses. The city was recognized in the Leave California Western City Magazine for its outstanding outreach efforts. Work is now focused on drafting the draft housing element for the Community Planning Commission and ultimately City Council's review and approval. For those that have not been tracking on the process and want more information, I suggest they go to ChicoHousingElement.com. My point in bringing up this important planning effort is to highlight that there will be a natural venue for Council to continue the discussion of housing during the housing element adoption process. So in Chico's development climate, the provision of infrastructure serves as a critical constraint to the delivery of residential units. Following the Camp Fire, state and local governments have been working closely with the City Council to develop a plan for the development of residential units. The City Council has been working closely with the City Council to develop a plan for the City staff consistently shared with both state and federal agencies that perhaps the most effective mechanism to facilitate additional housing in Chico was funding for capital projects, including roads, bridges, and sewer extensions. On your screen is a list of key road rig projects that Public Works has underway that promote and support housing production. The goal, of course, is to time infrastructure to match the demand of development. Litigation of the Bruce Road Whitening Environmental Review Process may have a direct impact on the delivery of affordable and workforce housing. The widening is an upgrade to a key piece of existing infrastructure that was initially identified in the City's 1994 General Plan and again identified in the City's current General Plan to accommodate thoughtful growth. Attempts to slow down this project only hurts the City's ability to accommodate existing and future growth outlined in our General Plan, to meet former CEQA obligations for previously approved projects, to utilize state money to improve deficient infrastructure, and ultimately to develop affordable and market-rate housing. So I wanted to use this opportunity to promote Accessory Dwelling Units, or ADUs, which has been a priority of both the state and the City Council going back several years. So using state funds, the City retained a local architect to prepare plans in a variety of sizes, with both one- and two-bedroom units designed to be compatible with Chico's single-family neighborhoods. The permit- ready ADU plans are free of charge to the community. They come pre-approved by the building division, which means that they are available to the community. The City has been working on a lot of plans for ADUs, including the City's owner. How to access the plans is available on the City's, or I should say the planning division's, webpage. So due to loosened requirements, as well as the availability of these free ADU plans, we are seeing a record pace of ADU construction. In conclusion, I'd like to leave you with the following takeaways. I believe the City has a healthy pipeline of projects to meet near- and mid-term demand. The new growth areas will provide entitled land to meet future mid- to long-term demand. Honoring the City's General Plan Land Use Diagram is the best way to support and promote orderly and thoughtful growth. The City can best support development by having a predictable and transparent process, as well as by investing in infrastructure identified in the General Plan through the City's Capital Improvement Program. It is critical that we utilize any and all resources to support affordable housing projects during this significant influx of funding. And finally, I'd like to thank the City's Council for its support and leadership in this effort to keep the City's Council and its Council in the best position to deliver the best of its potential. And finally, the Housing Element Update process provides a natural venue for the community and Council to continue the discussion of housing. That completes my presentation. Of course, I'm happy to answer any questions. All right. Do we have any questions for Mr. Veague? I have a question. Council Member Martin. Mr. Veague, that was excellent. Could you go back to your first slide? You said something here when you started that was fantastic that I think is lost on a lot of people. I don't want to put words in your mouth, but it was something along the lines of the City doesn't actually create housing. That is correct. We can play a small role like we are in some of these affordable projects by bringing some of our funding and or some land to the deal. But for the most part, it's to provide appropriately zoned supply of land to be there with infrastructure, municipal services to create a predictable process. It's up to the market after that. And then as we're getting it to the market and people are trying to develop that land, what are the things that play into housing not being affordable? There's a lot of turmoil about affordable housing in Chico, in California. There's absolutely nothing the City can do. There's a lot of turmoil about affordable housing in Chico, in California. There's absolutely nothing the City can do. There's a lot of turmoil about affordable housing in Chico, in California. There's absolutely nothing the City can do. And some of its labor costs, you mentioned that. Some of its lumber costs, you mentioned that. CEQA, that's out of our hands. And then it seems like every time a development gets proposed, somebody sues us and it slows everything down. All these things out of our hands. But to summarize your presentation, you believe staff and the City has done the best job it can to streamline the process for the things that are under our control. Is that correct? I do believe that. And I've acknowledged that there are always opportunities for improvement. And we look for those. And some things may be identified through the housing element update. And then as we've shared with Council, and we'll be bringing some things to you in the coming year, there's state mandates that may further streamline some activities. But it takes away some of our local discretion as well. Thank you, Brendan. That was excellent. Thank you. All right. And if you don't mind taking off the screen, we're going to end the session. sharing so we can get back to kind of the view of everyone we appreciate that do we have any other council member uh questions comments council member brown i saw your hand first why don't you go ahead yeah i've got a handful of questions and some of these questions may be best directed to miss demmer so i welcome her to also weigh in um particularly around some of the affordable housing projects that are in or around the merriam park area three out of seven are on highway 32 uh leaving town um i guess one of my questions is why are none of these projects going into central chico where per our general plan we really want to stimulate and encourage denser development i can start with you chico i think one of the things that i've seen is that the city of chico released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released!! released released released released being being being a as quickly as possible where there's land available. There probably are some greater challenges doing a redevelopment like is taking place at 1297 Park, the old site of the Jesus Center. That project started earlier, but they thought that there was some availability of that land. The Jesus Center wanted to work with folks. So it was these projects that came in a little bit late in the game and wanted to get ahold of those tax credits that wanted to go where there was a quick turnaround time. We do see with the second round of funding that maybe Marie can speak to, there are some projects along the Esplanade, some up further on the Esplanade on the Northwest Chico specific plan area. But yeah, I mean, we're always concerned about having too much focus of too many affordable housing units in one place. But at this point, we also want to support projects while the getting is good. I'll have a follow up to that. Marie, do you want to expand? I would say that Brendan pretty much covered it. But if you need more clarification, I'd be happy to answer. I guess one of the questions I have is what authorities does the city have, if any, to influence those factors, in particular, particularly to increase affordable housing development in and housing development in general in some of those more compact close to resource areas. So there have some there have been some things we've done already along the corridor opportunity sites, where we allow increased density. Those are kind of big state ideas, I think that have more support in larger urban areas. But we put those on the book. So you can get increased density, you can get reduced parking requirements along these corridors, with the intent that they would serve as incentives. They probably would score well also, because they'll be closer to amenities, schools, you know, existing infrastructure. But I, you know, I would say that, you know, if you're just anğiniğiniğiniğiniğiniğiniğiniğiniğiniğiniğiniğiniğiniğiniğiniğiniğiniğiniğiniğiniğini And and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and is more apt to try to find those more unique locations along the corridors and also to do them kind of like as you mentioned um more redevelopment than greenfield development um so you noted several several uh pieces of reasoning behind where those affordable projects are located um isn't another major reason why uh affordable housing has been a part of the merion park development because of an inclusionary zoning or similar policy requiring that affordable housing be developed in that that uh master planned area so for merion specifically i mean there's a lot of going on there um the creek side is a project the city kind of was involved in the stuff in oak valley is its own separate but you're right in the development agreement with merion park there's a requirement for the delivery of a certain amount of affordable units and um how much of that is accounted for in some of the numbers that were shared interesting marie's 160 is that correct yes that's correct um one other thing uh inclusionary zoning as a as an idea was approved as part of the 2009 uh adopting of the housing element and the stated goal in the housing element was for the staff to draft an ordinance to bring forward to council addressing inclusionary zoning um i'm just curious why that hasn't been brought forward to date i can point to the page um in the housing element where it stated that that would happen i think it said by 2015. um as part of the adoption of the housing element so i think our last housing element wasn't 2009 wasn't it 20 40 000 what's up 20 14 the current one 20 14. yeah that idea was carried over i believe in the into the 20 14. right that's fine i just wanted to cite the most recent housing element and it said you know bring forward i if you have the exact language with something along the line to bring forward a 204.4 million square feetğiniğini inclusionary zoning ordinance for council's consideration. By the end of 2015. Yes. I didn't know it had a date specific, but, um, and so we had a council at one point where we did an RFP. We received some, um, proposals and, uh, determined that we had a council that didn't have an appetite or support for that. Um, then there was a change in the council and we had some engagement with them and some direction specifically post camp fire, where it was, Hey, let's look at a number of strategies. Uh, there was again, a highlight that we had this policy in the housing element. And so there was some general direction given towards the end of that majority of that council to move forward with an inclusionary program. Um, but it was kind of towards the last end of that council. And I more recently, I believe there's, sense that we have a council that doesn't have support for the inclusionary zoning. So that's kind of, you know, we don't want to put a lot of energy and effort. You bring on a consultant at over a hundred thousand staff resources are significant for such an undertaking. If it's not going to, um, get support and move forward. Sure. Um, I just have two more questions. Thanks for being with me. Um, according to the regional housing needs assessment numbers for Chico, we were at about 2% of the needed, very low income housing numbers available. Uh, our HNA numbers came out. Where are we now? Um, in that, with that percentage, if you include the development that you noted in your report. So I believe that Rena number probably is going to be carried through until we have the new adoption in June of 2022, we probably, we'll probably be at that very unsatisfactory 2% because we won't have these, how these units available. No Marie. Nope. We'll, we'll actually be able to count those units that have actually pulled building permits. So, um, I don't know the exact percentage that'll go up, but, but we will be much in much better shape than we are right now. Thank you. Sorry. Thank you. Last couple of questions. Um, Barbara yard valleys edge special planning developments that you noted are coming forward as well as the last part redevelopment. And she just had a conversation about, um, in collaboration with Chico state, what would be the effect of simply requiring 10%, 15% affordability in these new developments as we did with Miriam park? Um, I guess it would be something that would have to be directed by council. We don't have anything specifically as far as policy that would require that at this point, there is some policy that talks about investigating those options with the applicants. And we have done that and we'll continue to. And if we don't do that, um, what land could we expect affordable housing to be built on in the future? And presumably the resources we would expect to be utilizing would be state, uh, state and other resources. Okay. So what would be the impact of this on the city of Miriam? I would just say that the correlation I was trying to create in my presentation was that when the money is made available from the state and federal government, then those projects tend to go in areas that are entitled and have done their environmental review. So I can't tell you specifically where the affordable units will go. The city is responsible generally is in order to, you know, meet your arena numbers is to show that you have an adequate supply of land appropriately zoned that would accommodate those affordable units. Um, the dictating it is again, something where there's a correlation then I believe with money being made available and that's when it gets built. Uh, anything you would want to add to that? I don't think so. The only other thing is obviously the land would have to be, um, in good proximity to services and, uh, amenities so that they could garner the points needed to be awarded. Okay. Yeah. So we're released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released Okay, that's all the questions for now. Thank you. All right. Let's see if we have anyone else. Mr. Morgan, before you comment. I had a question. Vice Mayor Reynolds, go ahead. Mr. Veague, on your slide number seven is what it says online, the residential units for 2021, the five-year average being 278 and 2021 year-to-date is 144. That's, you know, 134 less than usual when we're at an all-time high for need. You say 155 under construction, but did you have 155 under construction when you have 278? It just seems like we're way under. And I'm trying to see if you can hear me. If you can just give a little bit more information on those particular numbers. These are interesting conversations. I would ask, you know, the council to maybe engage the development community and ask them to kind of share how they plot out their development. Again, I kind of mentioned we leave it over to them. The paper lots exist in many cases. We have a major developer in Epic Homes that, again, has been waiting to do some permitting with Stonegate and probably isn't proceeding. We have a major developer in Epic Homes that, again, has been waiting to do some permitting with Stonegate and probably isn't proceeding with their usual single-family residential development. We don't have a lot of non-local single-family home developers. There are some limitations based on their workforce as well as supplies and costs. So they don't, just because you can build it, they don't have the ability necessarily to produce significantly more based on the demand. But again, that would be a good conversation to engage our development community on. Thank you. So you say you... You had encouraged the conversation engaging the development community. What would be the best way to do that? What's your recommendation? Are you wanting an ad hoc committee? Are you wanting a... No, I... I'm not asking for an ad hoc committee. There was an ad hoc committee at one point right after the campfire. And these conversations did take place. So, again, maybe you engage them and ask them to come speak. To the council. I don't know that there has to be an ad hoc committee. But that would be your prerogative. So I do have a couple of questions here. Go ahead, Council Member Kim. Right. I mean, I see that in your conclusions, Mr. Weed. You have said we have a healthy pipeline of residential projects, right? But when... And I'm... So when we see on the residential pipeline, we see we have 2,040 houses under construction and approved at 1,200. And that... I'm assuming it's till date that those are approved, correct? I don't have that... The PowerPoint in front of me. Do you have the PowerPoint? So there's a... There's proposed, approved, and under construction. So are you looking at single family? Yes. And so then what's the question? So under the single family, you have approved 1,220 units. Is that till date, correct? That's as of right now. I kind of highlighted that Stonegate recognizing that they're going through some permitting, but yes. Right. So those are practically... They are not going to do anything till we have that lawsuit settled for the Bruce Road widening, correct? I don't know how much Bruce Road widening litigation is dictating the timing of their moving forward or whether it's them getting their state and federal permits. Okay. Okay. Thank you for that. Thank you for that clarification. So we basically, if we do not count that, that is one third of the total inventory if we say is approved. So I'm just curious to know that, do you think having 1,200 units in a year is a good enough pipeline for us? Because we have less than 100 single family houses on the market right now. Those are houses. And then we have more than 100 single family houses on the market. I understand. And then what we're referring to here are new housing units. So I guess what I'm sharing with you is I believe there's adequate paper lots approved, but then dictating the timing of their development is left to the private sector. We don't... Right. Okay. Okay. So when you say a healthy pipeline, what do you mean by that? Could you like... What is like a... Criteria. How do you say it's healthy? So if we're averaging 278 single family units, and we've got, again, under construction 581, another 1,200 units, although if you wanted to subtract out the Stonegate, but again, I said mid or near and midterm. Oak Valley phase two is coming online as being, you know, going through the process. So my suggestion is... My suggestion is that, yes, those projects represent a good mid and near-term pipeline, and that it's important that as these other projects like Valley's Edge and Barber Yard move forward, they should receive city approvals if they meet all of our general plan guidance and our development standards. Okay. Because like you have the Hicks Lane subdivision, which is 219 houses, right? They're not going to be ready. They will probably become available in the next four to five years, which I understand that that is not something that you decide. But I'm just curious to know that, you know, what... So what is this? So city can plan the special planning areas. What is the goal for that? Is that something we will decide with the housing element? No. What zoning will go there? Or how will that work? The special planning areas. The special planning areas are the larger greenfield, mostly areas that require master planning, like a specific plan, usually require an environmental impact report because they're big and have a lot of moving parts. They build out over, you know, 10 to 15 years generally. And so my point in suggesting is they are moving forward now. And we're starting to see the general plan mature. People have bitten off on the vacant land. Other areas were like Merriam Park Northwest. West Chico specific plan, Oak Valley, all the stuff we see along the Eaton Road over on the eastern edge of the community. We've been building those areas. And so now people are saying, all right, the land that's available are these new growth areas. And so that's what is starting to come online. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. All right. Mr. Morgan, you had a question? I think about what it is. Yeah. Thank you. Brendan, how much, how big a problem is available land? Well, these are loaded questions because it's who has the land, right? So for the person that doesn't have the land, available land is a problem. For those that do, it's not a problem. And so, you know, I hear clamoring for, hey, we need more land available. And so I always say, what does that look like? You know, we have a green line. It took a lot of energy to kind of support in our general plan, a growth area that moved up into the foothills slightly. We, of course, have Barbary Yard, which is a unique special planning area. We took the South Entler and the North Chico. Those were natural areas that don't have as many constraints. And so we'll help folks say, well, I don't have that land and I'd like to start moving forward with my project. And I always share. Well, it's very difficult to get to other land. It's either on the ag side of the green land or green line, or you're moving north and south along Highway 99. You have to open up our general plan. For those that were involved in this process, for the general plan that was adopted in 2011, and I was the project manager, it was about a three-year process. About two and a half to three million dollars. A lot of community rancor. And we had a lot of disagreement, but ultimately we settled on the general plan and the land use diagram that we did. And even after that was done, we had to go do sphere amendments with the Butte-Lafco. And so there's a lot that goes into it and there's litigation that follows. So it's not as simple as saying, well, let's just go grab some more land. It comes with time and money and with a lot of liability. So what I try to highlight is, yeah, some of our infill opportunities are running dry. Some of the areas that we were developing over the last 10 years have been utilized or are coming to an end. That's why these new growth areas are critical. All right. Thank you. I'm going to wait some comments until after we have speakers. Madam Clerk, do we have any speakers on the side? I have one quick question. Okay, go ahead. Mayor, how often do you recommend to update a general plan? I understand it's expensive and time consuming, but so what do we do then? How often do you suggest to revise it? So the rule of thumb that I've come to understand is that the policy framework is either stale or we believe we're running out of land. Those are usually the two pushes. There's not a classic number. When we adopted the general plan in 2011, the 2030 general plan, which was adopted in 2011, we didn't plan for just 20 years of supply to meet our needs. It's not like SimCity because there are so many variable factors, willing sellers, willing owners, peaks and valleys, recessions. You come up with new things you didn't know existed, you know, Vernal Pool, UConn Metafoam, airport overflights. So I don't have a rule of thumb. I do believe that we are kind of maturing. Right. The plan is still, I think, performing well. It still has adequate supply of land. Council Member Tandon, we did have a land absorption study prepared that was completed just before the campfire. And the conclusion was that we have adequate supply of land to meet probably our residential needs through 2030 and beyond. I think it even concluded 2035. Again, a lot of assumptions and caveats went into those conclusions. But I guess. Usually as a community, you know, it's time. So I just don't know that that's now, but I would say in about four or five years, that conversation will start taking place naturally. Right. That's my opinion. But there may be. No, which is true. And you know, the reason I asked that question, because you mentioned that, you know, housing element happens every eight years, correct? Eight years. So I, that's why I wanted to clarify if there is a general rule of thumb that helps. But I know where. It seems like when you said that we have constraints. So it seems like with the journal plan, we have constraints on that. You know, we have green line on one side. So it seems like that. Maybe we are ready to go there. And. So I just needed to take your opinion on that. Thank you. All right. Madam Clerk, how many speakers do we have on this side? I believe we have two Jessica Gianola and Chris. Okay. So why don't we proceed with them three minutes space. Okay. And so we'll allow Jessica Gianola to unmute herself. And then we'll share the screen and start the timer. Okay. So. Oh, there we go. Okay. All right. Those are some great questions that we had by Council on VIG's report. I really appreciate the conversations that I was seeing taking place here. There's just something really important to note when we're thinking about the people of our city. The majority of these builds that were discussed, they're not for low or no income and I did hear this being brought up as a concern. Okay. And Chico's population on census is 25% of the citizens are living at or below poverty rate. The poverty rate is determined by taking half of our median income. So I know some of you know how to do this. In Chico, the median income is listed as $53,000 and change. 25% of our neighbors are trying to survive on half of that. That's about $26,000 a year or less. And that's at the top. So there's zero up to that. Out of one out of four people that live in Chico will make less than $26,000. And the average rent for a one-bedroom will be around $1,000 currently because we had a major disaster that wiped out housing locally. $1,000 a month is more than half of their income. For low income, you need to have 30%, no more than 30% of your income. For some, they don't even make that much. And then places, property management require three times the income to be able to rent a property. So they're not able to even rent a property. With a population of about 110,000 now, 25% of that number, that is poverty level below, is 27,500 people. That 27,500 people need low income housing. And we only have what looks like about 1,500 low income units. And there's a seven-year wait for a one-bedroom low income unit. We still need an easy 10,000 to 11,000 units. And we need to have a lot of units to properly house the amount of people we have with a low, low or no income. The deficit in affordable housing for our citizens have left thousands sharing housing, couches, cars, and in our parks. The city has to reassess their role in this. I've heard so many times at council about how the city is not in the business of housing. Well, look where we are today. This took decades. This took decades to happen. And then now we're in this crisis. And the city has to reassess what role they play. And this is what we're doing. If it's incentives, if it's grants, if it's whatever it is, it has to be done. And we can't just keep leaving our hands off and saying a developer has to solve this problem. Some of the places like Valley's Edge and Stonegate, those are high end units. They may be changing a little bit as they face this crisis that we're in. But most of those, they're not going to be able to, those houses aren't available for the people who, a large mass of people who need it. And we have to continue to think about it. And we have to continue to consider the environment when we are doing these builds. So we can't just disregard CEQA. All right. Thank you. I'm out of time. Okay. Thank you. And our next speaker is Chris. And so we'll unmute him. Can you hear me? Yes. So my name is Chris Gempali with Epic Homes. We've been home builders here in Chico for the last 40 or 45 years. And one of the, our main product that you've heard our name a little bit in Brennan's speech is these, is the smaller lots with smaller houses and first time home buyers. And we've been building those types of houses in Chico for, like I say, 30, 40 years. Unfortunately, we've ran out of the land in Chico. The little infills, the projects that were. Available to be grabbed by all various types of developers. Throughout town are no longer there. We basically. Built through that. And those little houses, those, those, that product that we've basically built. Throughout town. There isn't those. It's not available anymore. And until we take a real good talk with the development community. And builders and the realtors. And the other folks that are in the business. To get. And show what's left out there. And unfortunately when you compete. With. With the lack of land that's there. It's just an essence that your supply and demand and the price of houses are going to keep going up. So until we take a big look at where these special planning areas are, which Brennan says there's five of them out there, which I don't disagree with. With the lack of land that's there. It's just an essence that your supply and demand and the price of houses are going to keep going up. So until we take a big look at where these special planning areas are, So until we take a big look at where these special planning areas are, So until we take a big look at where these special planning areas are, hard look at those. We may not ever see them in some cases. So taking a realistic look of what we have now is really important. And there are other ways to go about maybe capturing some of this land that has been, is we need to be annexing the land that we have that's in place. There were sewer agreements that we were able to use back in the old days where you could tie in from county with city and there was agreements that were placed that those agreements are no longer. There's a lot of different things that we could be doing to be looking out in the future. Unfortunately, we are drastically short on day one. Yes, it may sound like we have 500, 600, 800 lots now, but if that the supply is only two, three years down the road, we're going to be out of them. And we should be, as long as it takes to get projects approved nowadays, we need to be looking at long-term today for the next 20, 30, 40 years. And if we don't, we're going to be drastically short. I guess I would just maybe even, I heard a talk from Casey that maybe we should be reaching out to more of those, the folks that are in the business to maybe put our heads together to try to find some more property or find some more ways or how to make it come through. Thanks. That is it for speakers. All right. Thank you. All right. Let's see. Does anyone else have any comments for the non-action item just to report? So, all right. I'm going to take mine from here. So first I'd like to thank Council Member Tandon for bringing this forward. I think it was very informative. Mr. Big, as always, you did an excellent job. I'd love you to do it three or four times so everybody out in the community could actually hear it over and over and over and wrap up the conversation. And then we'd like to wrap up the conversation and wrap up the discussion and wrap up the discussion. And then we'd like to wrap up the conversation and wrap up the discussion and wrap up the discussion. And then we'd like to wrap up the discussion. And then we'd like to wrap up the discussion and wrap up the discussion. And then we'd like to wrap up the discussion and wrap up the discussion. And then we'd like to wrap up the discussion. And then we'd like to wrap up the discussion. And then we'd like to wrap up the discussion. And then we'd like to wrap up the discussion. And then we'd like to wrap up the discussion. And then we'd like to wrap up the discussion. And then we'd like to wrap up the discussion. And then we'd like to wrap up the discussion. And then we'd like to wrap up the discussion. capital, you know, projects which have been excellently timed to increase housing and housing opportunities. And, you know, we're also leading on the push towards the ADUs, and I think doing more than most cities are. And we have a record base of ADU construction. So, you know, also that we have, we'll be better in better shape next year as we continue to move through this. But, you know, I think one thing that we need to keep in mind, and a lot of people just say, you know what, Chico needs more affordable housing, and not necessarily affordable housing, but, you know, affordable housing for, you know, low income housing, things along those lines. And I think you made an important point that mainly the state and federal governments drive that. You know, beyond that, I think we've done a pretty good job. I do think if we're going to be able to do that, I think we're going to be able to do that. I think we're going to be able to do that. I think we're going to be able to do that. I think we're going to be able be a value to here in the near future. You know, how many housing units we have coming online, multifamily or single family compared to cities the same size and realizing that we are obviously, you know, a couple years out from the campfire now, and this is still an issue facing our local community, but maybe a comparison of cities our size. So we can see exactly how we're tracking in comparison to those. I think I would find real value in a presentation like that. So if If council, I think we can do that, not necessarily with a vote, but I think we can do that with a consensus. If council is agreeable to that, I'd love to see some, you know, give us some information on the, you know, 10 cities in Northern California that are like us and where they are in terms of building units. Mr. Ewing, is that something that we could ask for to come back to council without a motion and a vote or do we need that? You can ask for that without a motion, Mayor Kulick. Okay, so just based on consensus. So, you know, if everybody's willing, I'd love to hear just the comparison of how we fare to other cities, because I think there's a lot of You know, so pick the 10 most similar cities in Northern California that you can population wise and see where we stack up against them, because I think that's information that our community can really Really, you know, find value in. So But and anything else, Mr. Viggy, feel free to weigh in here. Do you feel like we need to see anything else or I think that would be good data. We know, I think I wouldn't make it just Northern California, I'd probably make it similar cities. Okay. In the northern part of California. There we go. Okay. Sounds good. including some of the private sectors ideas. like the speaker Chris was on there saying they they had some ideas and different thoughts and then Brenda actually released that to to me and we needed an ad hoc committee. But he did say there are some good ideas coming out of that. I don't know. There are some resources in the community. Certainly we could ask for Mr. Orem to reach out or Mr. Beek to reach out to some of those organizations to maybe present when he presents, if everybody's agreeable with that. All right. I'm seeing a couple of nods of heads. I'm not seeing everybody's heads, so. Chief O'Brien and, or sorry, Council Member O'Brien and Council Member Bennett. What are you saying? Yes, I would agree with that. All right. Okay. So yeah, maybe we can move to that at a future meeting in the next month or so. All right. No further comments. We'll move on from here. Go ahead. Yeah, we can take a break. I think that's a great idea too, but I just wanted to note that one of the things that Mr. Beek brought up is the land absorption study was taken right before campfire. So I think anything that was done there is probably null and void. The other thing is, as you say, go out and find like cities like us. I don't think there's any city that has been under turmoil for four years straight and had 30,000 people move into it overnight and increased its population by 20% overnight. But I do think it's super important to engage the building, because it's a great place to be. And I think that's a great way to get that information to the community and get that information. So I will follow up personally on getting whatever that information is and ensuring that we get that back. I mean, to hear we had something approved in the 1994 plan to do something, and we're still fighting about it right now and can't get it done, and it's going to stop affordable housing from happening, that's a serious problem in our community. So I think those are the kind of things that we need to be looking at. How did something get approved in 1994 and we're still arguing about it? And it's so important. It's stopping low income housing. So anyways, that's all I had to say. All right. Okay, so yeah, with that, it probably is time we take a break. So why don't we go ahead and just take a quick, why don't we go for eight minute break? Because I think that'll be time because most of us are sitting at home that we can stretch our legs. So we'll be back in eight minutes. And Madam Clerk, if you could put up the note on that as well and we'll do that. I appreciate that. Thank you. We'll do that. All right. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. All right. Everybody come back relatively soon. All right, looks like, so Council Members, if you could just say something when you return, so I know everybody's in. Mike, Dale, Alex. Let me know when you're here, Casey. I'm here. All right. I'm here. All right. So Alex, when you're back or, obviously if she's not, so. So if we're released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released is mental health reform support letter. Mr. Arm. Yes, Honorable Mayor, members of the council, on October 19th, as you will recall, council directed staff to prepare a draft letter to state officials requesting mental health and drug treatment support for our city and our region. Then on November 2nd, the council astutely requested additional information on how best to further coordinate and collaborate with Butte County Behavioral Health on such a letter. And an overview of possible areas where steps can be made to positively impact such a need, not only within the city, but countywide. And the attached letter that you have your staff report reflects the overarching need and specifies initial legislative reforms that can be taken by the state of California to help support the dire need for such public health services. Should the council authorize the mayor to sign the letter on behalf of the city council, staff will then work on getting the letter to agencies throughout the North State to encourage them to also advocate for such reforms. With that, I ask for your approval. All right. Any questions for Mr. Arm? All right. Seeing none, any speakers on this item? Yes, we have one, Nicole Nava. All right. Go ahead when you're ready. All right. can you hear me we can and um council member bennett you might want to mute your microphone there okay so can you reset her clock and then we'll go go ahead thanks andrew um okay so i so much appreciate seeing the follow-through on this by um the first the mayor for bringing it up and from the council for voting to approve um that the city take the direction to draft this letter up and so i read through it um and i am a fan i do have one question i'll ask at the end um i don't know that you can address it but i just want to highlight something for you um but i'm pleased that we will be doing a letter to ask the state to support us in the area of mental health and drug treatment i note that down below in the actual draft it talks about making some amendment to the definition of the state's policy on drug treatment and i'm going to go ahead and read through it and then we'll wrap up and wrap up and wrap up and wrap up and wrap up and wrap up and wrap up and wrap up and wrap up and wrap up and wrap up and wrap up and wrap up and wrap up and wrap up and wrap up um and wrap up and wrap up and wrap up and wrap up and wrap up and wrap up and wrap up and wrap up um and wrap up and wrap up and wrap up and wrap up and wrap up and wrap up and wrap up and wrap up um and wrap up and wrap up and wrap up and wrap up and wrap up and wrap up and wrap up and wrap up um and wrap up and wrap up and wrap up and wrap up and wrap up and wrap up and wrap up and wrap up and wrap up and wrap up and wrap up and wrap up and wrap up and wrap up and wrap up and wrap up and wrap up and wrap start real therapy and kind of have breakthrough, it will be so, so important. So I truly hope that the state listens. All we can do is act and take these steps. And so again, thank you so much for doing that. One thing I will note on it is part of what is noted in the very first part of the report in brief in the last sentence under that report in brief paragraph, it talks about further requesting staff to conduct outreach by letter or other means to cities and counties, other cities and counties within the North State asking them to take similar action. I didn't see that attachment. I'm wondering if that is still the plan to do that. And if so, is there just going to be a little paragraph inserted on this letter, you know, kind of bolded saying, you know, please join us or something like that, and that they could use that letter as a template or maybe even enclose a template for them. Anyway. Just my extra two cents. And then what I will tack on to this is, look, all anybody has to do is look around the community to see this is a huge issue. You heard Director Kennelly, Kennelly, excuse me, speak at a prior meeting and give a presentation about recommending these elements that were included in this draft letter. So this has data behind it about the need for the assistance and what in. Specific would be needed to push things forward and affect some real change here and dollars to do all of this cannot hurt. So anyway, thank you again, Council. I'm so pleased at this forward momentum. Thank you. That's it. All right. Thank you. And all right. Thank you for taking off the clock. Mr. Orr, maybe you can address that in terms of outreach to the other cities. And I don't know if that was maybe looking even at the league. But if there's anğini released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released going to share that with them. So we'll get it out to a couple of different venues to ensure that all the cities are reached out to and see a copy of this. And then they have an option to take it forward to their councils to see if they'd be willing to do the same. You know, I think it wouldn't, you certainly have the, you know, the capability through BCAG to outreach to some of the other cities locally. And I know you have conversations with them too, but even if you looked at SACOG, which is Sacramento area governments, that that would be valuable as well to try to have that conversation with them too. So, all right. Any further council comment? If not, we'll entertain a motion. Yes, I have a couple of comments I'd like to make. Go ahead, Council Member Brown. There's a slight grammatical error that if we're going to be disseminating this, I'd love to see change. It says mental and behavioral health issues plague our region and is most visibly displayed. I think we want to say all of them. I don't know if that's a good idea. I don't know if that's a good idea. I don't know if that's a good idea. I don't know if that's a good idea. I don't think we are most visibly displayed there. That was a quick one. For the reasons that we just noted about how far and wide this piece of literature is going to be shared, I think it's even more important that we refine our language slightly. I think using terms like these issues plague our region actually reinforces the stigma against mental health and substance use. And I don't think that we want our name on something that kind of uh uh uh! With the With the With the With the With the With the With the With the With the With the With the With the With the With the With the With the With the With the With the With the With the With the With the All right, then I'll make a motion to approve the letter with the change that Councilmember Brown noted to some alternative language that, you know, satisfies that concern you put forward. Second. All right, we have a motion and a second. Madam Clerk, can you take the roll? Councilmember Bennett? Yes. Councilmember Brown? I don't believe this satisfies the full scope of issues leading to some of the problems we're facing, but it does address some of them. I think state and local advocacy is important, so I'll put my name on it. Councilmember Morgan? Yes. Councilmember O'Brien? Yes. Councilmember Tandon? Councilmember Tandon? I'm sorry, couldn't hear. Council? Council? member Tandon yes thank you her screen is frozen so she's probably having a little bit of connectivity issues vice mayor thank you mary coolidge hi carry seven zero all right moving on on the item 5.8 which is actually my request for the spring queen event um so on our meeting on 11 16 we voted to agendize a request which was to make the annual spring queen event which i think was a phenomenal success uh in april of last year and you really did a lot to unify our community around cleaning up i know we had hundreds and hundreds of volunteers we included such organizations in that as card and back um it was pretty across the the board we had um you know chico unified school districts involvement as well we had uh some of their board members out there too so i think it was pretty successful i'd just like to see it continue as a regular event for the city of chico so that was what i was putting forward so any questions or all right how many speakers do we have on this item none all right so entertain a motion move to approve all right we have a motion and a second by council member morgan madam clerk if you take the role council member bennett yes council member brown hi council member morgan yes council member o'brien yes council member tandon yes vice mayor reynolds yes mayor coolidge hi carry seven zero all right we have no items that posted after the agenda i'm going to be on item six uh reports and communications following reports and communications items were provided for the council's information no action can be taken on the items under the section unless the council agrees to include it on a subsequent agenda and we have a verbal report item 6.1 from the city manager yes just just a quick one thank you mayor i just want to wish everybody just a wonderful season with family and friends this is a very special time of year for many of us and so i just want to thank you all for your dedication and work as a city council and all the city staff that have dedicated their their hearts and their souls and a lot of they what they have to this community throughout this past year and i look forward to a bright and and wonderful uh 2022 but in the meantime enjoy your family during this special time of year and with that that's all i have thank you all right thank you very much uh item 6.2 council members requests pursuant to apmp 1010 council members may verbally request an item to be agendized at a future meeting after stating what the item would be a majority uh vote of the council is needed in order for staff to agendize council members may also move to submit requests and writing any items for okay councilman brown go ahead yeah i've got a couple uh items i'd like to have some conversation about um uh i'd like to revitalize the conversation on inclusionary zoning that we'd sent to internal affairs committee which never really found its way back to us um and that conversation's promised in our housing element as mentioned earlier so for the sake of transparency i'd like to request that the council have a discussion on inclusionary zone zoning and i'd like to request that the council have a discussion on inclusionary zoning and i'd like to place an open thought on the ideas released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released released The city clerk. I just wanted to let you know that the Internal Affairs Committee met just recently on that and has a recommendation that we were going to bring forward at the next meeting. So we'll have that report on there where the inclusionary zoning item is being addressed. So we'll have an opportunity to have a conversation about it. Absolutely. All the recommendations that come from IAC have to go to the council for approval. Okay. I look forward to it. The other one is housing related as well. I'd like the council to have a broader discussion about policy approaches to incentivizing infill and redevelopment, particularly in our central neighborhoods, which, as I mentioned, are close to services. I would like the discussion to include possibilities like vacancy tax, upzoning when and where it makes sense to allow higher density projects, the conversions of existing houses into plexes, which is cheaper for developers. And if other council members want to contribute ideas, I'll certainly prepare documentation to help guide that conversation. And with that, I'd make a motion to discuss. All right. Do we have a second? I'm open to shifting these requests to make a broader conversation happen and possible. So if any council members would be amenable to changing any of these requests so that we have some discussion on the table about improving housing for the people we serve, I would appreciate it. So if any council members would be amenable to changing any of these requests so that we have some discussion on the table about improving housing for the people we serve, I would appreciate it. You know, I'm not against necessarily having the conversation. I am thinking that it would be helpful to have Brendan bring back the statistics that we asked him to first, maybe. So I might be more willing to without trying to find information without having all the facts present in terms of the actual numbers and comparison and other cities and see how much more we need to be doing. So I might be more willing to without trying to find information without having all the facts present in terms of the actual numbers and comparison and other cities and see how much more we need to be doing. all the discussions can fold in together they could they could would council be amenable to including those topics in the discussion a broader discussion about housing to be presented by staff i i would following the report back from mr vee yes go ahead i'm sorry i was there on all of those item and items things that will be coming back on the housing element update that's coming back in four or five months five months i don't want to put the exact date on that is right i don't know mr i would just say that ideas and suggestions for increasing housing production the natural venue would be during the consideration of the housing element update all right make that part of that greater conversation not have separate little ad hoc conversations are you guys getting an echo from me can you hear me okay a little bit of an echo but it's fine okay um just that would be an opportunity for not just a council but the planning commission members of the community bring forward thoughts and ideas that would enhance and increase production of housing we don't need to have sidebar conversations when we're going to have a more holistic one i believe mr big i'm not requesting a sidebar conversation numbers i'm requesting a public conversation with the council but thank you for your input uh when can we expect that uh conversation to take place well it'll start with the planning committee commission i believe i don't have the exact schedule but late february and then be going to council sometime in march so councilmember brown would you be content with i know you don't want to wait that long but would you be you know willing to wait that long and then if there's anything that you didn't feel was brought up to make a motion at that time is the conversation about data related to other cities and their housing approaches and how they compare to ours going to wait until the housing element update and it should maybe mr big do you think that could be folded into that same conversation it's going to take you a little while to get the figures it's not like you're doing you know 50 million things i know sure the data is probably easy to accumulate the housing element has a very focused things we're supposed to be covering as dictated by the state we could fold it into the staff report if that was something that was important or interesting at that time but i could get you something as far as the data i could just provide it to you it doesn't have to be a report unless that's how you want it presented i'd rather have the community hear it so okay um so why don't we try to bring that back and then maybe that'll be a good preface into the conversation when the housing element returns so all right okay okay councilman brown did you want to leave it there or do you want to further the conversation at all i don't want to cut you off just because the motion was made there was no second i know but okay all right um okay uh any further councilman requests i do right okay councilmember tandem um i mean we so i have looked at this one of the reports from 2017 regarding the public works operation and maintenance planning staff and we know that we have heard a lot from the community in the past months regarding the infrastructure maintenance parks roads and in this report in 2017 it seems like on every division we have inadequate staff or inadequate inadequate resources and we have heard a lot from the community in the past months regarding the infrastructure maintenance and since the fire in with the population growth and with the annexation of the certain areas into the town i would like to see an update to see what could be the plan or where we are if we have adequate resources right now to take care of our infrastructure if that's something i would like to see okay so if you wouldn't mind um maybe elaborating a little bit for me are you looking for a specific report by so this report that i have seen that is from the public works and a public works operation and maintenance staffing plan and in this report the every division that we have uh suggests that you know street cleaning division we have inadequate resources and every particular division i know we have made some changes and so i'm just curious to know if we have adequate resources moving forward because a lot has changed since 2017 and now it's almost five years in a week so i would like to see an update on that right so just an analysis of the resource for public works that maybe we can say that in the future so i would like to see an update on that and then we can do that in the short guess okay yeah i'm more than happy to make that motion so i can i second it or how does it you can okay i'll second that all right and and how detailed just so we have a true definition here council member tanner how detailed are you looking for something really similar to what we have right because like i said we're going to wrap up the workshop and wrap up the workshop and wrap up the workshop and wrap up the workshop and wrap up the workshop and wrap up the workshop and wrap up the workshop and wrap up the workshop and wrap up the workshop and wrap up the workshop and wrap up the workshop and wrap up the workshop and wrap up the workshop and wrap up the workshop and wrap up the workshop and wrap up the workshop and wrap up the workshop and wrap up the workshop and wrap up the workshop and wrap up the workshop and wrap up the workshop and wrap up the workshop and wrap up the workshop and wrap up the workshop we need to do to get there. Gotcha. All right. So we have a motion and a second. Claire, you take the role. Okay. Councilmember Bennett? Yes. Councilmember Brown? Yes. Councilmember Morgan? Yes. Councilmember O'Brien? Yes. Councilmember Tandon? Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds? Sure. Mayor Coolidge? Aye. Carries 7-0. All right. If no one else has a request, I have a quick one. Should be fairly routine. The local restaurateur approached me. They're attempting to get through Congress passed an additional round of funding for restaurants so that they can continue to provide food and They're going to have to continue to move forward because many of the requests that were initially made through some of the federal funding were not necessarily approved. So they just are looking for councils and elected officials around the state to help them push forward the legislation that would actually utilize some of the monies available or coming available to help our local restaurants. So I'd like to see us entertain signing a letter. They have a pre-drafted letter I could get to council and we can look at at our next meeting. So with that, I make a motion to agendize. I'm willing to look at it. Second. All right. Madam Clerk, you take the role. Councilmember Bennett? Any help to our local restaurants? Absolutely, yes. Councilmember Brown? Yes. Councilmember O'Brien? Councilmember O'Brien? Yes. Councilmember Tandon? Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds? Yes. Mayor Coolidge? Aye. Carries 7-0. All right. Further requests from council? All right. Moving on to closed session. Do we have any public comments? Let me check. I do not have any hands up. All right. Okay. Any council disqualifications on any of the items? Okay. Okay. Just a note here too. Council will recess the closed session. To discuss items as noted on the agenda, closed session will be held as a separate Zoom meeting that council and appropriate staff members will need to join once you exit from this meeting. So once you exit from this meeting, join the, it's through a secondary email, council members and staff that you will be logging on to to join that and we'll see you there shortly. Thank you. Thank you, everybody. Thank you. Thank you.
