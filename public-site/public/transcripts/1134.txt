And without it, you know, all our various committees, parks, airport commission, anything along those lines, it's very important that we have these folks. And the service they do is not easy. So they make tough decisions sometimes. They have to go to meetings and they have to study up and know what they're talking about. So first, we would like to give you this for your service to the city. From 2019 to 2023, on behalf of the city of Chico and city staff and members of our community, we extend our deep appreciation for your four years of dedicated service to the city of Chico. Thank you very much. Thank you. All right, and Georgie Bell, come on down. Well, you've done this for a little while yourself. Yeah. And we appreciate you. And we appreciate you as well. So on behalf of the city of Chico and the city staff and members of our community, we extend our deep appreciation for your six years of dedicated service to the city of Chico. Thank you so much. Thank you very much. Thank you. And if I could say something. So I just want to say that I was looking at some of my certificates today, kind of looking at kind of some of the past and stuff. I think my very first certificate was April 1973. And I have served on airport commissions and planning commissions and city councils and county task force and all those things. And I say to people in talking Austin being and serving, you know, and I say to people all the time, don't be the critic on the outside. Be the person in the arena. You know, that's from Roosevelt's speech. It's just like, you know, dare greatly get in there, participate. If you don't like it, speak up, volunteer, serve. Put in the time. And I am so pleased that I have gotten to do this my lifetime in this town. And I came here with a bicycle and a trunk and $900. And when I think of this marvelous life I've had by being part of this community and hopefully help making it be what it is today, I'm really proud of that. Really proud. So again, thank you to the council. And who knows, maybe I'll be back. Who knows? Thank you. There is an election coming up as always. Thank you both for your service to the community. We appreciate it. All right. We'll move on to the consent agenda. All matters listed on the consent agenda can be considered routine in nature and can be enacted in one motion. Do we have any speakers? We do not. There's one. All right. Wait, wait. I apologize. Okay. We do have one. I didn't see it. James Hutchinson. All right. Three minutes. I'm not opposed to this, what's here proposed to. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, Mr. Chairman, and all of you, and all of you, and all of you, and all of you, and all of you, and all of you, and all of you, and all of you, and all of you, and all of you, and all of you, and all of you, and all of you, and all of you, and all of you, and all of you, and all of you, and all of you, and all of you, and all of you, and all of you, and all of you, and all of you, and all of you, and all of you, and all of you, and all of you, and all of you, and all of you, and all of you, and all of you, and all of you, and all of you, and all of you, and all of you, and all of you, as has happened recently. But overall, it works well in the international arena. It does not work very well in the local arena in terms of giving everyone the same opportunities. Here's an example that's used all the time now. It says, during the trade talks with a representative of China in Washington in April 2019, U.S. President Donald Trump was asked by a reporter how long he expected U.S.-China memorandums of understanding to last. He said, I don't like MOUs. It's quoted saying this, although the background is considerably different in different stories depending upon who's telling it. He said, because they don't mean anything, the former president replied after some discussion. It was decided that any document that emerged from the talks would be called a trade agreement that is finished. Finally, I'm talking about procedure. I'm not opposed to what this particular group of people, they deserve it, the bonuses are earned. But I am concerned about using this particular technique too much. Thank you, that is it. All right. Do we have any counsel disqualifications or no votes? Entertain a motion. Move to approve. Second. Motion by Vice Mayor Reynolds. Second by Council Member Tandon. Madam Clerk, when you're ready. Okay. Council Member Bennett. Yes. Council Member Morgan. Yes. Council Member Tandon. Yes. Council Member Van Overbeck. Yes. Council Member Winslow. Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds. Aye. Mayor Coolidge. Aye. Carries 7-0. All right. The item formerly known as business from the floor, public comment. Members of the public may address the council at this time on any matter not already listed on the agenda. The council cannot, take any action at this meeting on request made under this section of the agenda. How many speakers? We have seven. All right. Three minutes. Okay. And I'll call the first two names. And if you could go ahead and line up in the middle aisle. James Hutchinson followed by Terry DeBose. A year ago I got in front of this council because a group of kids trying to get to school were attacked by a police officer. They were attacked by two dogs that were coming from a homeless camp along Humboldt near Deadhorse Slough. The reason I was particularly upset was because these same dogs had attacked two police officers, a police officer and his dog when he drove up several days before. Immediately he called for backup for his situation. Two cars showed up. They helped him immediately. This was within minutes. With these two dogs, they were attacked by two dogs that were coming from a homeless camp along Humboldt near Deadhorse Slough. These kids, I'm sitting there, they're coming to me and saying, what can I do? I got to get to school. And I'm sitting there, these dogs are vicious. I've seen them already. And so I try to work around to see what I can find a pathway through there. There is no safe path because of the camp being there. So what happens is we end up asking one of the kids to use his cell phone to call 911. He calls. Nobody shows up. A woman that I knew in the area came by, and I waved her down, and she offered to take this one kid to school. Two other kids found a back way around the far side. But still, no officer showed up. I waited there. It's happened again. Here's what happens. Just before school starts, I'm down under Deadhorse. I'm down under Little Cheekwood Creek, under Forest Avenue. Two guys come. I'm down the hill with pit bulls off leash. We have a little code here, I think, that says it's called 7.08110. And there's also a secondary code about releasing these things. It's 7.08120 that dogs off leash are prohibited. Here's two pit bulls coming now. I pull a cart out of there. I leave the area because I'm hoping they'll just pass through. And I'm going to the back of the hill. I'm cleaning up along the creek. I come back, and I hear a young woman screaming. She's yelling. Two boys yelling. They're very upset. These dogs are barking their heads off. I came up to them. One of the little boys looks at me, and he goes, Hey, I fought this with a bike, Pat. Can I ride my bike on it? That's what's happening out here. You want to talk about making Chico better, you got to enforce the laws we have. And it's not happening. It's just these kids are being left out cold. Same two dogs, by the way, that attacked the police officer and these kids came back four days later. The people with the dogs that I'm talking about with these two kids, one of them came at me in the morning. He had his two dogs with him. He saw me out there cleaning, and he came at me. He backed off. That's all. Thank you. Terri DeBose followed by James Sweeney. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Good evening, Council. Thank you for the opportunity to speak. Tonight I'm here on behalf of my parents, who are 83 and 80 years old. And I guarantee you are probably in bed, if not about ready to get in bed. So they've had many sleepless nights over this, so I thought I would come and speak on their behalf. They own the property at 313 Walnut, which is where a lot of the dogs live. Their house, which is where Gonzalez, Gonzalez, Gonzalez, Gonzalez, Gonzalez, Gonzalez, Gonzalez, Gonzalez, Gonzalez, Gonzalez, Gonzalez, Gonzalez, Gonzalez, Gonzalez, Gonzalez, Gonzalez, Gonzalez, Gonzalez, Gonzalez, Gonzalez, Gonzalez, Gonzalez, Gonzalez, Gonzalez, Gonzalez, Gonzalez, Gonzalez, Gonzalez, Gonzalez, Gonzalez, Gonzalez, Gonzalez, Gonzalez, Gonzalez, Gonzalez, Gonzalez, Gonzalez, Gonzalez, Gonzalez, Gonzalez, Gonzalez, Gonzalez, Gonzalez, Gonzalez, Gonzalez, Gonzalez, Gonzalez, Gonzalez, Gonzalez, Gonzalez, Gonzalez, Gonzalez, Gonzalez, Gonzalez, Gonzalez, Gonzalez, Gonzalez, Gonzalez, Gonzalez, Gonzalez, Gonzalez, Gonzalez, Gonzalez, Gonzalez, Gonzalez, Gonzalez, Gonzalez, Gonzalez, Gonzalez, Gonzalez, Gonzalez, Gonzalez, Gonzalez, Gonzalez, Gonzalez, Gonzalez, Gonzalez, Gonzalez, Gonzalez, Gonzalez, Gonzalez, Gonzalez, Gonzalez, Gonzalez, Gonzalez, Gonzalez, Gonzalez, Gonzalez, Gonzalez, Gonzalez, Gonzalez, Gonzalez, Gonzalez, Gonzalez, Gonzalez, Gonzalez, Gonzalez, Gonzalez, Gonzalez, Gonzalez, Gonzalez, Gonzalez, Gonzalez, Gonzalez, Gonzalez, Gonzalez, Gonzalez, Gonzalez their monthly water bill went from $150 to $900. They have paid for plumbers, electricians, handymen, private security. All of this has resulted in well over $10,000 out of pocket to pay for these crimes that are being committed by criminals. The outcome is a lot of sleepless nights for my parents, numerous calls from the property management company, and tenants who have been there for years that are unhappy, don't feel safe, and may move. We don't want them to move. They've had that property for a long time. I'm not speaking on behalf of Farshad, but there's 300 to 400 children that participate in classes there, as well as the rock climbing place on the other side on 5th Street. I think that there's a lot of safety issues. And citizens that you should be thinking about. Thank you. Thank you. So James Sweeney, followed by Michelle Cooper. I'm a 55-year park user. I went to the Park Commission last week and told this story I'm going to tell you, and they said I should come and talk to you. I spend a lot of time in the park. I've been riding up to Brownsville. I've been riding up to Brownsville a lot lately. It's a good bike ride. It's hard. The swimming hole is unbelievable. It's an oasis. Two weeks ago from tomorrow, I ride my bike up to Brownsville, and there's two electric motorcycles blocking the bench there. I hike down to the creek, and there's two hammocks across the trail right at the creek. And I walk around the hammocks, and there's litter on the ground. And there's 75 rock carns. I've seen the rock carns two days previously. And then I look past that. There's a dam. And the dam would be from here to, you guys, three feet wide. Five feet wide, excuse me. Three feet tall. Huge amount of work. Tremendous amount of work. I said, what's going on here? They said, you can go to another beach. Well, like I said, I'm a 55-year park user. Things were not pretty, you guys. I felt threatened by these two young men. They were 25 to 30-ish. I took my dip. I threw some rocks out of the thing, and I realized how much work there was to remove the dam. I mean, this was 20 hours to go remove it by hand. I came back to town. Came back to my car. Called the park, which got sent to the dispatch. I wasn't sure the dispatch knew what the park was. Then I got over to Linda, and she said, well, everybody's down at Depot Park working, you know. And then I thought about it. Well, I haven't seen a ranger in the park. You know, I'm there almost every day. I haven't seen a ranger in the park in six months, eight months. I know those guys. I know them well. Anyway, no one was going to go there. So the next, I'm not here to complain about the dam. I'm here to talk about rangers in the park. And then I called back the next. I called back the next morning and talked to Linda. She's whatever she is, a super, something like the paperwork person behind the park. And she told me that they couldn't go up there until Sunday. But then I found out the ranger did go up there, and he saw the guys there, took pictures of his motorcycles. They're illegal in the park. Took pictures of the dam. Took pictures of him. He called me on Sunday. I was in the park when he called me. And I asked him if he was in the park. He goes, no, I won't be there until Wednesday. Okay, so ever since then, I've been consumed by this a little bit. We do not have rangers in the park, you guys, ever. They're not in the park, you guys. I've spent the last two weeks up there. Okay, you have, there's an agreement. It's an MOW between the city, the police, and the public works. And it says that the park, the rangers are for the park. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Michelle Cooper, followed by Rich Hartman. Good evening. I've read a few articles the past couple weeks, and it's my understanding that some council members might be considering discussing the topic of managed campgrounds in our community. And I have deep concerns regarding this as a solution to homelessness. Firstly, the availability of shelter beds in Chico is not the issue. We have the infrastructure in place to provide immediate relief to those in need. However, the effectiveness of these shelters is questionable. The pallet shelter experiment has not produced the desired results, and we must question whether individuals are transitioning to long-term housing or if we are perpetuating the cycle of homelessness and addiction. The so-called resting site was intended to be a temporary solution, but has evolved into a nightmare for our community. I live within walking distance of the site, and crime and vacancy in our area has skyrocketed. The lack of city oversight has allowed it to become a breeding ground of crime, and public safety concerns. I'm sure you're all aware of the dog attack on a passerby and somebody who tried to help him. We should not have to tolerate crime being dumped into our neighborhoods. The current state of the resting site is unacceptable. We need clear guidelines and enforcement allowing one nighttime tent per person with cleanliness requirements and daytime vacancy. This ensures that public spaces remain accessible, and that the housing system is accessible to everyone without becoming hubs for crime and instability. Furthermore, it's time to reevaluate our approach to law enforcement. Regardless of housing status, all individuals should be held accountable for breaking laws and ordinances. As homeowners and taxpayers, we deserve better. Our hard-earned money should not be thrown at a problem without clear end in sight. We need solutions that address the core issues of homelessness, and provide a path to self-sufficiency. Let's reject the notion that we are the only people in this country who are not alone. Let's reject the notion of service-resistant individuals and opt for a firm stance that encourages personal responsibility and growth. We must invest in sustainable solutions that uplift our community as a whole, rather than resorting to makeshift fixes like campgrounds. In conclusion, I just urge you to reconsider the idea of managed campgrounds and instead redirect our efforts to holding NPOs accountable, enforcing our laws consistently, and providing comprehensive solutions to the problems of homelessness. We need solutions that empower individuals to regain their independence. Our city deserves more than temporary solutions. Campgrounds can perpetuate homelessness. It deserves a brighter, safer, and more promising future. Thank you. Thank you. Rich Hartman, followed by Wayne Shims. Good evening. The main reason I'm coming here, I'm a local business owner, and I'm asking you guys for help. We are located about a half a block away from Depot Park. We've been there for the last three years, and for the last two years, we've tried to take it on the chin and handle everything there ourselves. I spent 20 years here as a police officer, retired from Rockland as a police officer. I'm a fourth-generation Chicoan. I understand the city inside and out, and I understand crime. Following up on Terri's situation earlier, we've had multiple bikes, tools, equipment stolen from our business. We've had people vandalize our building. We've had our staff threatened. I've been threatened. I've had rocks thrown at me twice by transients while we had dogs in our care with the attempt of hitting the dogs with the rocks. Frequently, if we go by Depot Park with a client, dogs will charge us from the park. The most recent cleanup was amazing, but it led now to a blocked street and sidewalk from Fifth Street to Third Street where nobody can park or use the roads. The roadway effectively. The tents and the debris are now out into the street. Cars can't park where parking should be allowed. People can't safely walk on the sidewalk. The dogs are still loose. The crime is still happening. Watched people shooting up this morning. They frequently have to Narcan themselves back to life. It is a penal code issue, and I'm asking the police department for help. This is not a camping situation. This is a crime situation. Thieves are happening. Overdoses are happening. Open drug use is happening. Assaults are happening. Domestic violence is happening. And it's happening every day. Depot Park rests directly between Rosedale Elementary School and Notre Dame Elementary School. Those are both young children that have to cross that path. The climbing gym directly across the street from it hosts young children all day long. Azad's has over 300 juveniles that work out at that gym, and they're less than a half a block away. There is a problem at Depot Park. There is a problem now in the city street of Cedar that's not being addressed. There's penal code problems that are not being addressed. And I don't blame the cops because they don't have any ability or leadership on what to do on that area. We go by there every day. Every day they're working, trying to manage that and push back the wave. Somebody up here needs to give them direction on what to do. It's not their fault, but the entire community in that area is being victimized. And it's pretty sad. Thank you. Thank you. Next question is for you, Wayne Shims, followed by Barbara Steinberg. Good afternoon. I'm Wayne Shims. I live at 18 Titleist Way in Chico. I've been living here for two years now, so I'm a relative new resident. I wanted to speak with regard to the proposed idea of a managed campground. A managed homeless campground is a temporary solution. The true reason for that is that it's not a temporary solution. The remedy is low-income housing. Houselessness is a chronic symptom of a very dysfunctional American society of inequality. Paul Krugman, the American economist, has stated that the homeless problems will continue to grow because the inequality in the United States will become a wider gap and therefore more will become houseless. The Butte County Continuum of Care released its 2023 point-in-time count during its meeting Monday night. Well, forget that. The 2023 count shows 1,237 homeless people in the county. That's an increase from last year of 1,156. The National Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty has reported illegal homelessness, homeless encampments have only been growing since the pandemic, and cities across the country have struggled to respond. Encampments are everywhere. Unique homeless encampments were reported in every state and the District of Columbia. California had the highest number of reported encampments by far, but states as diverse as Iowa, Indiana, Louisiana, Michigan, Oregon, and Virginia each tallied significant numbers of reported encampments. Research shows that housing is the most effective approach to end homelessness with a larger return on investment. Beyond this misuse of resources, sweeping encampments too often harms individuals by destroying their belongings, including their shelter, ID, and other important documents, medications, and mementos. More often than not, this leaves the homeless person in a worse position than before with a more difficult path to exit homelessness. Moreover, sweeps frequently destroy homes. This can destroy the relationships that outreach workers have built with residents and that residents have built with each other, again, putting further barriers between the residents and permanent housing. Consider the cost of a more permanent solution, low-income housing, versus the operational costs of a managed campground. Add in the total cost of performing the sweeps of the illegal tent cities, and what does it cost? This houseless problem will continue to expand, and these are fellow human beings like you and me who have the right not to be treated as garbage, treated with cruelty and dismissing indifference. I urge the Council to seriously consider this idea. Thank you. Barbara Steinberg is our last speaker. Good evening, Council Members. My name is Barbara Steinberg. I moved to Chico in 2020, and I've been living here ever since. I lived in Sacramento for many years and was frequently involved in my community. This is my first time here speaking to you at City Council. Before I get to my reason for coming, I'd like to say to Mayor Coolidge and also to Council Member Winslow, I've reached out to you a couple of times. It's been quite a long time trying to talk to you about some other issues I have, and so I'd really like to know the best way to communicate, with you about some other things I'd like to discuss. But the reason I'm here tonight is I'm trying to understand why there are so many areas of the City of Chico where there are no sidewalks. The reason this has been very clear to me for a long time, and the reason it really came up to me now, is because a friend of mine who lived at East 9th Avenue in Oleander had gone out for a walk a couple of months ago, she's quite elderly, and had to walk in the street, and sadly, she fell. Now, she may have fallen anyway, even if there had been sidewalks, but I really firmly believe the fact that there are no sidewalks in many of these neighborhoods, were the cause of her accident. She broke her femur, she's been in the hospital and rehab ever since. So I'm trying to understand, people have told me that part of these neighborhoods used to be a county, and that's why there are no sidewalks, but it's clearly a safety hazard. There are so many of these neighborhoods where there is nowhere to walk, people have to walk in the street, and it's dangerous. And so I would like to have a conversation about how that gets remedied. Obviously, I realize that's a huge expense, whether homeowners or, you know, however that works. But that, for me, was a real wake-up call for me about this friend of mine. Because when I go to visit her, I know there are no sidewalks. And for her to have to walk in the street to go for a walk, should not be happening. So that's what I wanted to discuss. And if I can have a way of reaching out to you, I've left two messages for you, Mayor, on some other issues. And Addison also, there were some things I was trying... She lives in your district, by the way. So thank you. Thank you. That's the end of our speakers. All right, thank you. We'll move on to public hearings. Item 4.1, TEFRA hearing for the conduit financing for Cusick apartment project. And we have the Clerk. Thank you. Thank you, Mayor and Council. This is the first of two items that are being considered where the Council is being asked to conduct a public hearing pursuant to the Federal Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act, otherwise known as TEFRA. This act requires that a public hearing be held by the governing body of the jurisdiction in which a project is to be financed with tax-exempt financing is located and that the governing body approve the proposed financing. The Danco Group proposes to obtain tax-exempt financing in an amount not to exceed $30 million to finance the acquisition, construction, improvement, and equipping of a multifamily rental housing project located at the northwest corner of West East Avenue and Cusick Avenue in Chico. The California Municipal Finance Authority is a joint powers authority formed to assist local governments, nonprofit organizations, and businesses with the issuance of both taxable and tax-exempt debt. The debt to be issued by the CMFA will be the sole responsibility of the borrower and the City will have no financial or legal obligations or responsibilities with regard to the repayment of the debt. All financing documents will carry disclaimers that the loan is not an obligation of the City and the City will also bear no liability or no cost in the issuance of the proposed debt. This is a private loan with the borrower and their bank. It is recommended that following the public hearing, the City Council adopt a resolution approving the issuance of bonds by the CMFA for the borrower. Such adoption is solely for the purpose of satisfying the requires of TEFRA, the code, and the California Government Code Section 6500. All right. We will open the public hearing. How many speakers? On this one, we have three. All right. Three of them. Okay. The first speaker is... Just a second. Sean Reese followed by Bruce McLean. Good evening, Mayor and Council members. My name is Sean Reese. I'm a field representative from the NorCal Carpenters Union, Local 1599. I represent nearly 40,000 carpenters here in the North State and track all construction projects in our area. I'll cut straight to the point. I do not believe the City of Chico should allow this bond. Projects like these are fantastic and help ease the current housing burden our town faces, but we shouldn't overlook how the workers who are building those projects are seen. All too often, contractors like these tend to bounce around the rules, cutting corners and pinching pennies on the backs of the hardworking men and women that are building it. Our housing crisis in Chico is a very real issue. The only way to mitigate that is to build it. We can't mitigate the problems by building more housing, but we shouldn't take advantage of the workforce helping us solve this crisis. And those same workers should be able to afford to live in the communities that they are building. Giving contractors like this access to the funding openly lowers the ceiling on our local labour pool, and that is not the answer. I understand prevailing wage projects and the wages will reflect as such, but there are many laws in today's world that largely go ignored, and projects from contractors like these are no different. If all contractors played by the rules, I wouldn't have a job. I spend every day, day in and day out, protecting these workers. And prevailing wage projects from contractors like these are common havens for wage theft, human trafficking, and a litany of safety violations. I've seen it first hand nearly on a weekly basis. Again, approving an avenue for these kind of contractors to do this to our community is not the answer. We ask that you deny this bond. I look forward to talking about this with you in the future. Thank you for your time. Thank you, Bruce McLean, followed by George Schmidbauer. Hi. I asked to speak because I live 500 feet from a project that was built a little while ago, and it was a project that was going to really change the nature of my living because it was going to change the nature of my life. It was going to block off my view of the mountains and the sky for the most part. But when I found out that the project was a senior low-income housing project, and I know that we desperately need that kind of housing, I went to the Planning Commission first, and then I came to the City Council to recommend that the housing be built because we need it. I didn't know the Carpenters' Union was going to be speaking. That surprised me. I don't know a lot about this project. I just wanted to share that if this is a low-income housing project for families, we know we need that kind of housing. And I'm sorry to speak in opposition or after the Carpenter spoke. Thanks. Thank you. George Schmidbauer, if you'd like. Yeah, I'm a project manager with the Danco Group, and I'm here representing them. I guess to just quickly address the contractor comment, we're just a general contractor, and there are requirements with the contract. The financing that we have for this, it is an affordable housing project subsidized by the state for families. It's one to four-bedroom projects, but the financing does require that we solicit to local subcontractors, which are the people doing the work. Thank you. Do you have any questions about the project? Okay. Thank you. Okay. No, we're good. Awesome. Thank you. Thank you. All right. I have a question for staff. Master Chief, what are the implications of a no vote? I'm not sure. I would have to... The city takes on the responsibility for the bond. It just means they don't get the financing? I would have to ask Vince to weigh in on that. That's a good question. I'd have to take a look at it before responding to you. I can't vote. Okay. You know what? I'll move that we table this item until we have those answers. Sorry. I'm not seeing this. Sorry. So he is representing the CMFA. If you have questions, this is a courtesy. It has no obligation on the city. Okay. And so they do have representatives that's indicated that they would be here to talk. I didn't put his name in, but if you'd like your question answered... Come forward, sir, to the microphone, please. There's a microphone on the podium. Yeah. I apologize. My name is Travis Cooper. I'm with the CMFA. I'm a financial advisor for the CMFA. And we're the issuer of the bonds. So the implications, if there was a no vote, the financing couldn't go forward. So that would be the implication. We're issuing bonds, and without the tap for approval, the financing can't happen. I'm happy to answer any other questions. All right. Any other questions? Are you familiar with those sort of accusations that this financing doesn't have sufficient enough requirements on labor to be sure that there aren't abuses or there isn't circumventing of prevailing wage requirements or such? As far as wage requirements goes, I'm not familiar with as far as the wage requirements go for using union labor. I think Danko can answer those questions more better than I can. We're kind of responsible for the financing portion of issuing the bonds. We do perform compliance on the project every year to make sure that it meets the affordability requirements at 50% of AMI. We do that. As the CMFA, the state does that. So the project itself is monitored quite closely year after year. All right. Thank you. I'll entertain a motion. Mayor Coolidge? Can I just share that the project has been approved by the city architects review board, and it wasn't appealed to the city council. Just so you know, there's an approved project. I know this is financing. I just wanted to make sure that the council had that knowledge. Got it. Yeah, I move to approve. All right. I'll second. And that's a resolution of the city council and city of Chico approving the issuance of the California Municipal Finance Authority exempt facility bonds for a qualified residential rental project in an aggregate principal amount not exceeding $30,000 for the purpose of financing, refinancing, acquisition, construction, improvement, and equipping of key departments and certain other matters relating there to the amount. Clerk? Council Member Bennett? Yes. Council Member Morgan? No. Council Member Tandon? Yes. Council Member Van Overbeck? Yes. Council Member Winslow? Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds? No. Mayor Coolidge? Aye. It carries 5-2. All right. Item 4.2, TEFRA hearing for the condiment financing of the Oleander Community Housing Project. Thank you, Mayor and Council. This is the second of the two public hearings for the TEFRA process. Pacific West Communities, Inc. proposes to obtain tax-exempt financing for the community housing project, which is a $1.5 million project, and an amount not to exceed $15 million, to finance the acquisition, construction, improvement, and equipping of a multifamily rental housing project located at 2324 Esplanade. Again, to make it clear, the debt is to be issued by the CMFA, will be the sole responsibility of the borrower, and the City will have no financial or legal obligations or responsibilities with regard to the repayment of the debt. Following this public hearing, it is recommended that the City Council adopt a resolution approving the issuance of bonds by the CMFA. The remaining bonds will be taken in separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate separate to advocate for responsible allocation of this bond and the protection of our valued construction workers. As we consider allocations for this bond and the upcoming project, it's crucial that we exercise our due diligence in selecting contractors. We must not entrust our resources to an irresponsible contractor who may jeopardize the success and integrity of this job. It is essential that we prioritize quality, accountability, and transparency throughout this entire process. Construction workers are the backbone of the city's development. They work tirelessly to build the infrastructure that supports our communities and enhance our quality of life. Their safety and welfare should never be compromised. It is our duty to prioritize their protection and ensure that the contractors we engage share this commitment. When awarding these bonds, we must thoroughly vet the contractor's track record, examine their past project, safety protocols, and compliance with regulations. We should prioritize awarding contracts to those who have been involved in the project and those who have demonstrated a commitment to worker safety, fair wages, and adherence to ethical practices. I ask that we deny this bond. Thank you. Thank you. Our last speaker is Ed Mayer. Good evening. My name is Ed Mayer. I'm the Executive Director of the Housing Authority of the County of Butte. I'm here to represent the partnership that will construct, own, and operate this property, the Oleander Community Housing Apartments. I am here to answer any questions you may have about the financing. Tonight's business is a business that is based on the project. We already have the city's partnership by way of a CDBG agreement as well as commitments for state tax credits. We have with us the California Mental Housing Finance Agency, who is basically our bank in the transaction. I want to make one note here to the audience, and that is really to our construction workers who are here represented, their construction representatives. I want to share that this project is subject to the state prevailing wage rates as well as Davis-Bacon wage rates. The wage rates are carefully monitored. Every hour of every laborer's work is tracked by labor classification on these projects. It's exhaustive, and it's very, very important that we do this. I suggest that these labor representatives here, if they want to talk about labor and contracting in Butte County, they're welcome to come to my office. We'll have a great conversation. With that, any questions? Thank you. Thank you. All right. We'll close the public hearing. Entertain a motion. Move to approve. I have a motion from Vice Mayor Reynolds, a second from Councilmember Tandon. Do you need me to read the resolution? Resolution titles don't need, do not need to be read. Councilmember Bennett? Yes. Councilmember Morgan? Yes. Councilmember Tandon? Yes. Councilmember Van Overbeek? Yes. Councilmember Winslow? Yes. Councilmember Reynolds? Aye. Mayor Coolidge? Aye. Carries 7-0. All right. Item 4.3, public hearing to consider a resolution to continue the temporary closure of a portion of the old Humboldt Road to unauthorized vehicles. We have a report from Eric Goffson, Public Works Director. Thank you, Mayor Coolidge. I'll be brief. This is a routine closure in public hearing required in accordance with California law. The vehicle code section 21101.4 and Chico Municipal Code Chapter 10.53. We have temporarily closed this eastern portion of Humboldt Road to vehicular traffic due to safety concerns previously mentioned when this originally took place back in June of 2020. Per the vehicle code section, we're allowed eight consecutive 18-month closures. This is the second extension out of those eight 18-month consecutive closures. So, we just seek council approval to continue the vehicular closure. Both the police chief and I have confirmed that conditions still exist. So, we want to keep it closed another 18 months. Thank you. Questions? What is the ultimate goal? If we only have eight extensions that are on our second, will we ever permanently close it? I don't think we'll permanently close it. The area in question is subject to future development on both sides, both the south side specifically. There's private landowners that I believe have intentions to develop someday. And there is the current, on the north side, the current Oak Valley development is taking place right now. So, you know, it will need to be open to vehicular traffic once I think development takes place. And we have ice and gears up there. But for right now, the conditions still exist. There's no houses or occupied properties up there. And so, we want to keep it closed to reduce the continued impact we saw of vandalism and constant dumping and trash and debris and things like that. Thank you. All right. Further questions? Speakers? We have none. Entertain a motion? I move to approve. Second. Motion by Vice Mayor Rounds and second by Council Member Irwin. When you're ready. Okay. Just a second. Council Member Bennett? Yes. Council Member Morgan? Yes. Council Member Tandon? Yes. Council Member Van Overbeek? Yes. Council Member Kite? Yes. Council Member Winslow? Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds? Aye. Mayor Coolidge? Aye. Carry 7-0. Item 4.4. Hearing to consider a Comprehensive Treatment Municipal Code Title 18 Subdivision Arrangements Update. And we have a report from Bruce Amler. Thank you, Mayor and council members. This is Eric Norris. He's our subdivision consultant. He's going to give you the first part of our brief presentation. I'm going to follow it up. So I'd like to introduce Eric Norris. North to get through great work for us on the solution ordinance. Thank you, Bruce. Yeah, Mayor and Councilor, I'm Eric Norris at InterWest. Pleasure to be here tonight. And I'll just start off by echoing what Bruce said, but in the other direction. Your staff has been fantastic to work with. They've been engaged throughout the process. They've looked carefully at what we gave to them. What is in front of you is our work, but it's also their work. And I think it came out that we have a real great code for you. So we'll keep this brief, but just for the audience again, we're looking at updating your subdivision code. That is the code that governs how land is subdivided. So any lot, parcel, roads, et cetera, those are all created through the subdivision process. And it's a very important part of basically everything that gets done in the city, whether you're talking about new housing development, new commercial development. It all takes place on lots and parcels, which are created through the processes that are in this code. So Title 18 of your municipal code is the subdivision code that we're talking about tonight. What we're proposing is to basically take what you have now, which is in this binder, and replace it with an entirely new code. What we did then, I'll get into a little bit of what we tried to do, but we're giving you an entirely new code. This is all based, by the way, on the Subdivision Map Act, which is one of the more complex, and kind of difficult to use parts of state law planners. I'm sure Brendan will tell you that. We struggle with this all the time. It's terribly written. It's like a James Joyce novel almost. So what we tried to do in this code is to take that complexity, and the complexity that's in your current subdivision, Title 18, and make it simpler and easier to use. So in terms of the things that we tried to do, first of all, we wanted to bring the code up to date. There have been changes in state law that needed to get reflected in the subdivision. There's a new subdivision code, so what's in front of you now has all that in it. Bruce will go into this in a little bit more detail, but in general we tried to empower staff to make more decisions than they currently can make as part of a general effort to push that decision-making process down to the staff level as much as we could, makes things just easier to process. The process gets easier for both the city and the developers to make that whole development process go smoother. We definitely have a lot of work to do. We definitely tried to make the code easier to use, as I mentioned, grouping things together in logical ways, saying things more simply. I think if you look at the two codes side by side, you will find that the new one is much more logical, much easier to follow. If you're looking for a specific topic, it's easier to find it in there, and you don't have to jump around between different parts of it to kind of put together the whole picture of what you're looking at. We did some unused regulations. We looked at it as InterWest with kind of a fresh set of eyes, and there were a number of things that we asked about. We said, well, what is this? And frankly, nobody on the staff knew what they were, because they had never used them in some 20 years of experience here. So there are a number of things that we just did away with. They just simply weren't needed anymore. A couple other things we did, we updated the findings for map approval as part of a general effort to make the decision-making process clear, so if we're approving a map, you have better findings to approve that map. If you're in a tentative map situation, if you're in a final map, we now have something which most subvision codes don't have, which is clear sets of findings to say when you can approve a final map. There's usually a general standard that, well, if the final map is more or less consistent with the tentative map, you can approve it. Well, we've taken that vagueness out and given some very clear-cut standards on what is substantial conformance. That's something that most codes don't have. We added a new kind of map called finance maps. Actually, it's not new. It's used all over the state. Your code doesn't have them. Commonly used in land development when a developer comes in and, say, does a large sub-division. They'll do what's called a finance map or an A map or a B map to be able to approve that in stages and record that initial map in different phases. Again, it's something that's done all over the state. Your code just didn't have it in there. And finally, there's a new set of notifications on sub-division maps that this council will be getting, which we added at the request of the city attorney. So that's something that you'll start seeing in your packages moving forward. In terms of outreach, we did do the best we could to get input from the city. We got input from stakeholders. So in addition to your staff, we met with more than 20 development industry professionals here in Chico, including engineers, surveyors, developers. Got some very important input from them, which is reflected in the draft that's in front of you. As I mentioned, we had city staff from a number of departments consulted throughout the process. They gave us a lot of comments. And again, that's really made for a better document, the one that's in front of you tonight. We also had a website, a dedicated website for the sub-division ordinance update, which was regularly updated with drafts of documents, opportunities to comment. So we did do our best to take what is admittedly a kind of a dry subject and make it as interesting as we could and get as much input from the public as we could. And with that, I'll turn it over to Bruce. So the Planning Commission unanimously recommended approval of this project, the six to zero, one absence. There were two recommendations in their recommendation to the Council that the Chico Builders Association requested that fee dedications be addressed in fee, which is kind of a technicality. And another thing they asked for was that public improvements be delayed until the individual is approved. So that's the first recommendation. individual parcels on a parcel map for development. We had a long conversation about that in the Planning Commission, and the Public Works Director has been engaged on this and working with the property owners. And what the Planning Commission recommended was that these changes be addressed in the forthcoming update to Title 18, which is underway right now. Title 18, or Title 18R. Title 18 is this document. This addresses processes and procedures. Title 18R addresses design specifications and development standards. That's the place where these kinds of things can be addressed in Title 18R. And it's my understanding from Brendan Oh that they're working on that and they have a workable solution. So that's coming forward to you as a separate piece under Title 18R. And then I'll just go ahead and summarize the key changes. So the first thing is parcel maps would be approved by the MAP Advisory Committee instead of the Planning Commission. So we're smoothing it down and moving it to the MAP Advisory Committee. We're pushing the approvals of lot line adjustments, which were formerly bound to the MAP Advisory Committee. We're calling them boundary line modifications. Now we're calling them lot line adjustments like everybody else in the state does. Lot line adjustments, parcel maps, excuse me, lot line adjustments, parcel mergers, and minor land divisions would be approved by the Director instead of the MAP Advisory Committee. So those approvals, so to speak, are being pushed down. And the next thing we will look at is the changes in the process. So their processes are getting easier, and that will mean the fees will go down too. So we're going to come back to you with revised fees and processes to implement these new regulations. And there will be a notification procedure the council includes, as Eric mentioned, that includes all newly submitted maps and maps that are pending approvals, which will be key to your council agendas and will set our timing up to approve them based on when they occur on your agendas. All these things will be in the MAP Advisory Committee. All these things are still being worked out. But those are the major changes. These, the whole ordinance is wholly consistent with the general plan. The environmental review is categorically exempt. And we're recommending that you hold the public hearing, adopt the environmental document, and then adopt the ordinance. And if you have any questions, either I or Eric are happy to answer them. All right, questions from council? Council Member Bennett. I just want to compliment you. It's encouraging to hear that some of the fees will be adjusted. You're streamlining the process, making a lot of changes. This document's been in place for about 20 years, and now it's being upgraded. So I just want to say thank you on behalf of the construction industry that some adjustment in fees will take place. Thank you. All right, Council Member Wenzel. Just a quick question. Just a couple of really quick questions to clarify for people who might not be following along with some of what these changes imply. So a parcel map was seen by the Planning Commission, but now is no longer seen. And a subdivision map still is seen by the Planning Commission. What's the difference between the two? I'm glad you mentioned that. A parcel map is four or less lots, and a tentative track map is five or more lots. So parcel maps are minor subdivisions with four or less lots. Right. And so these are small projects. These projects can still be appealed to the City Council, correct? Right. Anybody can appeal them. Yes. And what's the cost to appeal a project to the City Council? I think it was $239. Thank you. Further questions? All right. Close the public hearing. Oh, sorry. We've got to open the public hearing. Any... We have no speakers. You can close it. Close the public hearing. Entertain a motion. All right. I just want to say, in general, I think that public input on things that are important to people's lives is significant. I think we have a policy set that we're trying to increase the amount of housing we have in Chico, and these small projects are exactly the sort of thing we should be supporting. So although this is fewer public hearings, there still is the opportunity for any controversial issues to come before the public at our meeting. But this does allow staff to streamline the process. It does make things more efficient, so more of these projects can go forward. So I will make a motion to approve staff's recommendation. Second. I have a motion from Councilmember Winslow, a second from Councilmember Van Overbeck. Councilmember Bennet? Yes. Councilmember Morgan? Yes. Councilmember Tandon? Yes. Councilmember Van Overbeck? Yes. Councilmember Winslow? Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds? Yes. And I just have one small comment. I'm going to hold your feet to the fire that this actually does make it streamlined. Okay. Thank you. Mayor Coolidge? Aye. Carries 7-0. All right. Moving on to the regular agenda, item 5.1, introduction of an ordinance of the chapter 1.14 of the City of Chico Municipal Code to provide for streamlined nuisance abatement procedures. And we have a report from Vincent Ewing, City Attorney. Thank you, Mayor Coolidge, members of the Council, Vincent Ewing, City Attorney. Chapter 1.14 of the Chico Municipal Code entitled Nuisance Abatement Details Procedures Required for the City to Abate Nuisance Conditions that Exist on Properties Throughout the City. Presently, those procedures require the City Council to conduct hearings that may be required if a property owner disagrees with the city's determination that a nuisance exists on their property. Scheduling hearings before the multi-member City Council is a little more challenging. And so it's been recommended that the ordinance be amended to permit a single administrative hearing officer to conduct hearings. Moreover, current procedures lack the ability to impose administrative fines for failure to abate the nuisance. They do not provide for the collection of attorney's fees expended in the course of abating a nuisance and do not clearly define a variety of common nuisance conditions encountered by code enforcement officers. The amended chapter recommended in this report and the report before you on the ordinance provides for streamlined enforcement procedures that allow an administrative hearing officer, appointed by the City Manager, to conduct nuisance abatement hearings so that the City Council is not required to set forth administrative fines for failure to abate a nuisance, enable the collection of attorney's fees expended in the course of abating a nuisance, and further define what conditions the City deems constitute a nuisance. These revisions are recommended for the purpose of increasing the efficiency of completing nuisance abatement actions, motivating property owners to voluntarily abate a nuisance to avoid the imposition of cause. The amended chapter also recommends that the City Council exercise a separate exercise exercise exercise exercise exercise exercise exercise exercise exercise exercise exercise exercise exercise exercise exercise exercise exercise exercise exercise exercise exercise exercise exercise exercise exercise exercise exercise exercise exercise exercise exercise exercise exercise exercise exercise exercise exercise exercise exercise exercise exercise exercise exercise exercise exercise exercise exercise exercise exercise exercise exercise exercise exercise exercise exercise exercise exercise exercise exercise exercise exercise exercise exercise exercise exercise exercise exercise exercise exercise exercise exercise exercise exercise exercise exercise exercise exercise exercise exercise exercise exercise exercise exercise exercise exercise exercise exercise exercise exercise exercise exercise exercise exercise exercise exercise exercise exercise exercise exercise exercise exercise exercise exercise exercise exercise exercise exercise exercise exercise exercise exercise exercise 1.14 of the City of Chico Municipal Code to revise the nuisance abatement chapter. That concludes my report, and of course, I'm happy to answer any questions. Questions? Council Member Winslow. I like a lot of the things in here, but one of the things that caught my eye was this provision that's on page 8 of the red line version. It says a nuisance can be defined as any other condition or use of property which gives rise to a determination by code enforcement officer that if the condition or use permits is continuous, it will cause substantial diminution of the enjoyment, use, and property values of such properties. And since there are so many things that are outlined in here as being specific nuisances, I'm curious what would be captured by something that would result in the diminution of property values and why that can't be specified because it's very open-ended. Are you looking at the red line? The red line version says page 8 of 19. And what page? C and 5. Seems like it's kind of an open-ended line. So while we have specific things, especially when it relates to safety or says that it's like obstruction of a walkway or something, I think that all makes a lot of sense. But once we expand it to this, I'm wondering what sort of things some crotchety neighbors in Chico could come up with that they could report their neighbors for that code enforcement officers would then... Be obligated to investigate. I hear you. I found where you are. And your question is again...
